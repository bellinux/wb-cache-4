50|$|The {{landscapes of}} the Urals vary with both {{latitude}} and longitude and are dominated by forests and steppes. The southern area of the Mughalzhar Hills is a semidesert. Steppes lie mostly in the southern and especially south-eastern Urals. Meadow steppes have developed on the lower parts of mountain slopes and are covered with <b>zigzag</b> and mountain <b>clovers,</b> Serratula gmelinii, dropwort, meadow-grass and Bromus inermis, reaching the height of 60-80 cm. Much {{of the land is}} cultivated. To the south, the meadow steppes become more sparse, dry and low. The steep gravelly slopes of the mountains and hills of the eastern slopes of the Southern Urals are mostly covered with rocky steppes. River valleys contain willow, poplar and caragana shrubs.|$|R
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal.

The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, <b>zigzag</b> <b>clover</b> and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained.

50|$|Trifolium repens, {{white or}} Dutch clover, is a {{perennial}} abundant in meadows and good pastures. The flowers are white or pinkish, becoming brown and deflexed as the corolla fades. Trifolium hybridum, alsike or Swedish clover, is a perennial which was introduced {{early in the}} 19th century and has now become naturalized in Britain. The flowers are white or rosy, and resemble those of the last species. Trifolium medium, meadow or <b>zigzag</b> <b>clover,</b> a perennial with straggling flexuous stems and rose-purple flowers, has potential for interbreeding with T. pratense to produce perennial crop plants.|$|E

Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the wood small-reed, before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management. The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores. Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering.|$|E
40|$|Seven {{previously}} unreported triterpene glycosides (1 - 7) {{were isolated}} from methanol extract of the aerial parts of Trifolium medium var. sarosiense (<b>zigzag</b> <b>clover).</b> Their structures were {{established by the}} extensive use of 1 D and 2 D NMR experiments along with ESI-MS and HRMS analyses. Compounds 1 - 7 are oleanane derivatives characterized {{by the presence of}} a keto group at C- 22 of an aglycone and a primary alcoholic function at C- 24 and differing functions at C- 30. Among these, compounds 1 - 3 and 6 showed a secondary alcoholic function at C- 11, which is methoxylated in compounds 4 and 7. Compound 5 was shown to possess a known aglycone, wistariasapogenol A; however, it is described {{here for the first time}} as a saponin constituent of the Trifolium genus. Some aspects of taxonomic classification of <b>zigzag</b> <b>clover</b> are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 48 th New Zealand Grassland Association Conference, 3 - 6 November 1986, Alexandra. Production of two rhizomatous clovers, Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum) and <b>zigzag</b> <b>clover</b> (T. medium), was assessed under a number of fertility regimes. Caucasian clover annual dry matter production was of 12 t/ha for cv. Treeline on a fertile lowland soil, 8. 5 t/ha for cv. Prairie on a moderately fertile hill country soll and 2. 5 t/ha for cv. Prairie on a low fertility high country soil. For a 30 year old stand of <b>zigzag</b> <b>clover</b> on a moderately fertile high country soil estimated DM yields ranged from 2 t/ha under low fertiliser applications to 10 t/ha under high fertiliser rates. The stand gave a 3. 2 t DM/ha response to the addition of 50 kg/ha sulphur alone. Both clovers are very persistent and appear to remain productive for several years {{in the absence of}} fertiliser applications...|$|E
40|$|Physiological {{mechanisms}} of adaptation to copper-induced stress in two widespread legume plants, white sweet clover (Melilotus albus Merik.) and <b>zigzag</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium medium L.), growing in habitats differing in the man-made pollution. An antioxidant plant defense system was activated {{in response to}} 10 mM CuSO 4, which is a stress factor. Specific biochemical features related to adaptation to soil contamination with copper were observed in tested plant species. Superoxide dismutase was activated in response to stress in both species from various habitats. M. albus from the impact zone manifested the better capacity of proline accumulation as compared with plants from less polluted habitats. T. medium plants from the impact zone contained more active peroxidase. It was suggested that plants growing {{for a long time}} under stressful conditions manifest the greater tolerance to copper ions than plants, which did not experience stress or were subjected to the milder stress. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Caucasian clover (Trifolium ambiguum; cv. Monaro and Alpine), <b>zigzag</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium medium; seed lines, Kentucky and Porters Pass) {{and white}} clover (Trifolium repens), were {{evaluated}} in a sheep grazing trial on a lowland medium fertility soil (Templeton silt loam) at Lincoln University, Canterbury. Each rhizomatous clover cultivar / seed line was sown (March, 1989) in plots with four rows 0. 75 m apart, 80 m long. There were three replicates of these plots (1. 5 m apart), each replicate arranged as randomised blocks. The site was oversown with Marsden high endophyte ryegrass (Lalium perenne) {{in the spring}} of 1992. Volunteer white clover Huia was present throughout the trial site. The 80 * 3 m plots were split into eight grazing plots 10 * 56 m rows in August 1993 by fencing, at right angles across the original plots. This resulted in 12 clover subplots in each main grazing plot. The eight main plots were divided into two replicates of four grazing treatments: two levels of grazing intensity (Lax (L) and Hard (H)) and two levels of grazing frequency (Set stocked (S) and Rotational grazing (R)). The four grazing treatments were first applied in September 1993, and then continued in early-February 1995 after having not been grazed since late December 1994. Set stocked lax pastures were grazed for 2. 5 days after an interval between grazing of 4. 5 days to maintain a pasture mass of about 1700 kg DM/ha. Hard set stocked pastures were maintained at between 600 to 800 kg DM/ha by grazing every 4. 5 days with a 2. 5 day interval between grazing. Hard rotational grazed treatments aimed to have a pre-graze herbage mass of between 1500 to 2000 kg DM/ha 25 days after grazing and a post herbage mass of 600 to 800 kg DM/ha after 5 days grazing. Lax rotational grazed paddocks were spelled for 25 days to achieve a pre-grazed herbage mass of 2000 to 3000 kg DM/ha then grazed for 3 to 4 days to a post-herbage mass of 1500 to 2000 kg DM/ha. Botanical analysis, clover morphology and grass characteristics were measured in all grazing treatments prior to grazing of the rotational grazed pastures in April, May, June and in early October after plots were grazed approximately every six weeks to a herbage mass of about 800 kg DM/ha. The intensity of the hard set stocking treatment was indicated by reduced ryegrass tiller populations, tiller weight and length by 50 % compared to the lax set stocked treatment. Infrequent grazing favoured ryegrass growth and tillering. The hexaploid Monaro Caucasian was the superior clover in the lax rotational grazed treatment covering 14. 3 to 29. 3 % of the subplots. Swards dominated by Monaro reduced other sward components. Hard set stocking of pasture reduced the percentage cover of all rhizomatous clover species; only white clover (8. 4 to 18 % cover) and weeds (16 to 24 % cover) increased under the extreme grazing pressure. Hexaploid Monaro Caucasian cover was superior to the diploid Caucasian cv. Alpine in cover and all growth characteristics. Hard rotational grazing treatments increased the number of clover growing points more than the other treatments for Caucasian and white clover species. Clovers in lax grazing treatments had longer petioles, but petiole growth potential may have been reduced by declining soil and air temperatures. Zigzgag clover generally had a very low cover and growing point populations, but lax infrequent grazing favoured zigzag most. An assessment of underground biomass in early August 1995, showed that the root weight of Monaro Caucasian (202 g DM/m³) far exceeded that of white clover (9 g DM/ m³). Rotationally grazed treatments had significantly (P< 0. 007) more Monaro underground biomass (330 g DM) than set stocked treatments (78 gDM/m³). This may reflect the preferential grazing of clover in reference to the high endophyte ryegrass. A supplementary study conducted on old seed plots beside the main trial site, was grazed to a herbage mass of 450 kg DM/ha on the 5 th of May and used to evaluate the regrowth of clover over 50 days. Monaro Caucasian clover and white clover produced far more growing points than any other of the clovers measured (5280 and 4790 growing points/m² respectively). Petiole length of all clovers increased during the 50 day period, particularly Monaro Caucasian and stoloniferous white clover (up to 73 mm). Growth of all but white clover slowed from 24 to 50 days indicating that the other rhizomatous species were becoming dormant due to low temperatures (Mean air temperature in May 9. 7 °C and June 6. 2 °C). Results from the experiment confirm the choice of hexaploid Caucasian clover for commercial pastoral development. Zigzag clovers were very low producing and uncompetitive with ryegrass under the range of treatments used. Alpine Caucasian (2 n) was less productive than Monaro (6 n). The reduced underground biomass of set stocked Monaro suggests that the rhizomatous habit may not be the ultimate response to continuous hard grazing and that some autumn spelling and or rotational grazing may be necessary to maintain root and rhizome reserves...|$|E
