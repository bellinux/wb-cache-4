40|$|A rapidly {{evolving}} {{field in}} chemistry is {{the application of}} organometallic and coordination complexes as building blocks or active components {{for the construction of}} new materials exhibiting specific catalytic, redox, optical or sensor activities. A central theme in the construction of these inorganic building blocks is the targeted functionalization of ligands, either prior to or, less conventionally, after the metallation step. Ligand functionalization enables the immobilization of the transition-metal complexes on macromolecular or inorganic supports, the regulation of their solubility, the introduction of additional functional moieties, as well as the electronic tuning of the metal. Furthermore, the functionalized complexes can be applied in inorganic crystal engineering or for targeted (supramolecular) assembly in solution. The NCN-pincer ligand (NCN = 2, 6 -bis[(dimethylamino) methyl]-phenyl anion) is a versatile building block for these purposes. NCN-pincer palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes (Chart 1) are air- and water-stable, and find widespread applications in the field of catalysis and as sensor materials. Para-functionalization of these complexes offers an anchoring point, while leaving the structural integrity of the metal center intact. X M=Pd(II), Pt(II) !

Z= functionalization site <b>Z</b> <b>Chart</b> 1 The results described in this thesis show that NCN-pincer palladium and platinum complexes are versatile building blocks for the construction of new organometallic materials with applications in diverse fields such as catalysis, crystal engineering, and (macro) molecular visualization. The pathways presented for the synthesis of the new para-functionalized NCN-pincer complexes are of crucial importance for generating a suitable anchoring point for further functionalizations without affecting the M C bond. Important aspects concerning their synthesis include: i) the exceptional stability of the NCN-complexes, allowing ligand modifications after the metallation step, and ii) the availability of various metallation procedures for selective introduction of the palladium or platinum center in the NCN-ligand. Both features offer a high degree of flexibility in the synthesis of the para-functionalized complexes, making functionalization with virtually any (organic) group feasible. Noteworthy are the linear Hammett correlations found for the para-substituted NCN-platinum complexes. Extension of these correlations to NCN-pincer complexes of other metals, and eventually to PCP- or SCS-pincer complexes, allows subtle tuning of the electron density on their metal centers, and consequently theoretical predictions of their catalytic and/or optical properties. The application of NCN-pincer building blocks in the examples shown in this thesis illustrate the above-mentioned features, i. e. selective metallation of the ligand at various stages of the syntheses and modifications on the ligand after the metallation step. The methodology employed in the preparation of the pincer complexes {{can be used as a}} starting point for the construction of new organometallic materials based on the pincer ligand. These materials can be designed to exhibit bio- or solvent-compatibility and/or specific aggregation behavior. Finally, (non) -covalent assembly of catalytically active NCN-pincer complexes with other functional moieties, e. g. (co) catalysts or receptor sites, offers the opportunity to construct bifunctional or supramolecular catalysts...|$|E

As [...] {{is the same as}} the system impedance, this is represented by a point at the centre of the Smith chart. The first transformation is OP1 along the line of constant normalized resistance in this case the addition of a normalized reactance of -j0.80, corresponding to a series capacitor of 40 pF. Points with suffix P are in the Z plane and points with suffix Q are in the Y plane. Therefore transformations P1 to Q1 and P3 to Q3 are from the <b>Z</b> Smith <b>chart</b> to the Y Smith chart and transformation Q2 to P2 is from the Y Smith <b>chart</b> to the <b>Z</b> Smith <b>chart.</b> The following table shows the steps taken to work through the remaining components and transformations, returning eventually back to the centre of the Smith chart and a perfect 50 ohm match.|$|R

5000|$|The {{choice of}} whether to use the <b>Z</b> Smith <b>chart</b> or the Y Smith chart for any {{particular}} calculation depends on which is more convenient. Impedances in series and admittances in parallel add while impedances in parallel and admittances in series are related by a reciprocal equation. If [...] is the equivalent impedance of series impedances and [...] is the equivalent impedance of parallel impedances, thenFor admittances the reverse is true, that isDealing with the reciprocals, especially in complex numbers, is more time consuming and error-prone than using linear addition. In general therefore, most RF engineers work in the plane where the circuit topography supports linear addition. The following table gives the complex expressions for impedance (real and normalised) and admittance (real and normalised) {{for each of the}} three basic passive circuit elements: resistance, inductance and capacitance. Using just the characteristic impedance (or characteristic admittance) and test frequency an equivalent circuit can be found and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|Background: Almost all {{presently}} available pediatric echocardiography Z-score nomograms {{are based}} on Western data. They {{may not be a}} suitable reference standard for assessing the sizes of cardiac structures of children from developing countries. Objective: This study's objective was to collect normative data of 21 commonly measured cardiovascular structures using M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography in Indian children aged between 4 and 15 years and to derive Z-score nomograms for each. Subjects and Methods: The study was conducted at two centers in India. Ajmer, Rajasthan, and Mohali, Punjab. We studied a community-based sample involving healthy school going children. After excluding children with cardiovascular abnormalities on the screening echocardiogram, 746 children were included in the final analysis. Echocardiographic assessment was performed using a Philips iE 33 system. Results and Analysis: For each parameter measured, seven models were evaluated to assess the relationship of that parameter with the body surface area and the one with the best fit was used to plot the Z-score chart for that parameter. <b>Z</b> score <b>charts</b> were thus derived. Conclusions: The Z-score nomograms derived by this study may be better alternatives to the Western nomograms for use in India and other developing countries for preprocedural decision making in the pediatric population. However, they will require validation in large-scale studies before they can become clinically applicable...|$|R
