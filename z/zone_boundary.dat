5|$|In July 2016, the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan {{announced}} the South Circular would {{become part of}} the London Ultra-Low Emission <b>Zone</b> <b>boundary</b> in 2020, meaning a daily charge of £12.50 for cars/vans/motorcycles and £100 for coaches/HGVs/buses, would need to be paid by vehicles not meeting key exhaust emission standards. The boundary had originally been proposed by Johnson the previous year, but covering a narrower area.|$|E

5|$|The east–west interzonal border became {{steadily}} more tense as {{the relationship}} between the Western Allies and the Soviets deteriorated. From September 1947, an increasingly strict regime was imposed on the eastern Soviet <b>zone</b> <b>boundary.</b> The number of Soviet soldiers on the boundary was increased and supplemented with border guards from the newly established East German Volkspolizei ("People's Police"). Many unofficial crossing points were blocked with ditches and barricades. The West Germans also stepped up security with the establishment in 1952 of the Federal Border Protection force of 20,000 men– the Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS; however, Allied troops (the British in the north, the Americans in the south) retained responsibility for the military security of the border.|$|E
25|$|Since 2002, the {{nitrogen}} dioxide (NO2) produced by diesel exhaust {{has become a}} serious problem, with the London Air Quality Network of King's College London reporting that the annual mean NO2 objective (of 40 μgm-3 or 21 ppb) was exceeded at all kerbside and roadside monitoring sites across central and greater London during 12 months between 2005 and 2006. Although no areas within the Congestion Charge Zone reported NO2 levels above an upper limit of 200 μgm-3 (105 ppb), some monitoring areas near the <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> experienced very long periods at such levels, notably the A23 near Brixton (3741 hours) and the Marylebone Road (849 hours).|$|E
25|$|After the war, the Reichsautobahns were {{declared}} national {{property of}} the various post-war states (for example Bundesvermögen, federal property, under Article 90 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949) and became {{the foundation of the}} modern autobahn networks in Germany and Austria. Several stretches were no longer within the redrawn German borders, notably the unfinished highway between Berlin and Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), now known unofficially as the Berlinka. Others were no longer useful because of the altered borders, including the occupation <b>zone</b> <b>boundary</b> that became the inner German border between the Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic. A stretch of highway near Kaiserslautern became the access road to the U.S. Ramstein Air Base. Most of the destroyed bridges were either reconstructed or rebuilt in a different style, although the Saale River Bridge at Rudolphstein, on the inner German border, was not replaced until the 1960s. The debris of the destroyed bridges still lies below the rebuilt series of viaducts at the Drackensteiner Hang in the Swabian Alps. Elsewhere, unfinished autobahn construction was left abandoned; the Wommen Viaduct, also on the inner German border, was completed in 1993, after German reunification.|$|E
50|$|Time <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> {{have changed}} greatly since their {{original}} introduction and changes still occasionally occur. DOT issues press releases when {{these changes are}} made.

Because <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> do not follow census tracts or zip codes, we created digitized maps of original <b>zone</b> <b>boundaries</b> and later expansions. We combine these maps with geocoded observations on most businesses located in California. The evidence indicates that enterprise zones do not increase employment.
