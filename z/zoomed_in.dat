5|$|Soma Bringer is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game where players {{take control of}} members of a military unit dubbed Pharzuph Division 7. The three-dimensional environments are explored from a top-down perspective, and the overhead camera can be <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> and out on the playable character. Seven characters {{are available at the}} start of the game, with an eighth being unlocked later on. The game uses two modes of play. In single-player, the player controls the party leader while the two assigned companions are controlled using the game's artificial intelligence. In addition to the single-player mode, the game features cooperative (co-op) multiplayer. Activated through wireless connection, up to three players can freely explore environments and team up for dungeons.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, {{the detainees}} {{were taken to}} the {{headquarters}} of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in Matamoros for an informal press conference. More than 250 international journalists arrived at the scene to take pictures and ask them questions. The four suspects were paraded from the building's balcony and were allowed to answer questions from reporters. Elio stated that he was an ordained executioner under Constanzo and that Kilroy was murdered by Constanzo. As the cameras <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> on the suspects, Elio showed his membership scars on his shoulders, back, arms, and chest. These were arrow-like cuts made with a hot blade. The marks were given to selected cult members with the authority to perform human sacrifice.|$|E

The next cluster of cubes <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> on a vision of a high-tech, future home in a sylvan setting (and a commuter gyrocopter); a series of projections contrasted this [...] "best of the future" [...] to [...] "the worst of the present" [...] (over-uniform suburbs, a dreary urban housing project).|$|E

500|$|Reviewers highly {{praised the}} game's sound and {{environment}} backdrops, but noted blurriness {{in the character}} animations. IGN appreciated its stereo sound, special effects, and camera work. Scary Larry (GamePro) liked Gold sound except for the explosion and [...] "death screech" [...] sound effects. GameSpot considered the graphics [...] "near perfect" [...] apart from the character animations. (CVG wrote that characters appeared blurry because of [...] "fuzzy anti-aliasing" [...] when the camera <b>zoomed</b> <b>in.)</b> Game Informer was similarly impressed by the graphics, but one reviewer commented that Gold had few other positive features. As an exception, GamePro praised the [...] "lively" [...] character animations over the [...] "flawed" [...] backgrounds.|$|E
500|$|Mark Reed of Maximum {{thought that}} the game was {{graphically}} a [...] "mixed bag", praising the well-defined sprites and animations whilst criticising the backdrops, stating that they looked [...] "often too blocky" [...] and repetitive, although he admitted that it improved in later levels. Neil West from the Next Generation Magazine thought the graphics were [...] "solid", despite recognising that the game was mostly a direct transition from a 2D format into 3D. Chris Broesder of AllGame {{thought that the}} graphics added to the overall experience of the game, stating that the characters were colourful and of [...] "cartoon quality", although he noted that some textures were [...] "a bit blocky" [...] when <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> on. Amalio Gomez of Hobby Consolas praised the sprite renderings and 3D environments as [...] "beautiful", stating that the game {{took advantage of the}} Saturn's power and possibilities.|$|E
500|$|The critics {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} about three prominent {{features of the}} game: voice acting, artwork, and faithfulness to Howard's writings. [...] Perlman earned acclaim for his vocal performance and gravely voice that matched the game's dialogue, but he also received criticism for not sounding like a barbarian. [...] A few applauded Nihilistic for capturing the oil painting feel of Frazetta's art, but several others said that the graphics consisted of drab-looking environments that were jagged-edged and pixelated when <b>zoomed</b> <b>in.</b> [...] Although the animations were rated to be smooth and vivid, the lack of variety among enemy character models was criticized. [...] Several critics also praised Nihilistic for recreating the atmosphere of Howard's stories. [...] The decision to have Conan use magic was, however, called a [...] "blasphemy" [...] by IGN. G4techTV Canada disagreed and forgave the game {{on the grounds that}} it was mostly faithful to the books. [...] Ray Huling of The Escapist said that the game's developers misunderstood Conan's appeal to the masses. [...] In the journalist's opinion, Howard's depiction of Conan's brutal physical nature called attention to the dull nature of their lives and offered them a temporary escape. [...] Furthermore, Huling said that Nihilistic used the characteristics of Conan for superficial purposes, and that, in copying the mechanics of another game without any groundbreaking innovations of its own, Nihilistic missed the essence of Howard's stories and created a shell of what its game could have been.|$|E

500|$|Character {{designs were}} created by Mutsumi Inomata. A key element of the designs was the {{variation}} of time periods many characters came from. To make the character sprites {{as close as possible}} to the original artwork, the team took Inomata's artwork and turned them into 2D [...] "dot-by-dot" [...] sprite pictures. This gave the sprites roughly four times the detail of most environments. They then built the world around the sprites. The sprite details sometimes caused problems, as they would appear larger than the environments when the camera <b>zoomed</b> <b>in.</b> The animated cutscenes {{were created by}} anime company Production I.G. The game's opening was the longest ever created for a Tales game up to that point. While many contemporary PS2 role-playing games were being developed around three-dimensional characters, Destiny 2 used two-dimensional sprites for its characters. Part of the reason behind this was that the development team wanted to create the [...] "ultimate 2D RPG". As opposed to previous Tales games, where gameplay development was focused on the battle system, the development leads requested that the gameplay should be [...] "waste-free and strategic". The Grade system and new skill customizing elements, later staples of the series, were also developed. The game's artificial intelligence was markedly improved, the combat system was made both more elaborate and more user-friendly, and health and magic systems were adjusted. The PlayStation 2 hardware enabled the expansion of mini-games, the improvement of the game's graphics, and the incorporation of advanced interactive elements on the world map.|$|E
500|$|Viewtiful Joe {{features}} unique gameplay {{elements in}} the form of Joe's [...] "Viewtiful Effects (VFX) Power", which is designed to emulate camera tricks seen in films. VFX Power is used in both battling enemies and solving various puzzles. These three powers are limited by the [...] "VFX Gauge" [...] located {{at the top of the}} screen. Normally, the meter is full, giving the player access to Joe's super powers via his Viewtiful Joe transformation. The meter slowly empties when an ability is in use. Once it depletes, Viewtiful Joe changes to normal Joe, lowering his attack and defense and leaving him temporarily devoid of VFX Power. The VFX Gauge automatically refills over time and can also be manually filled by picking up bottles of [...] "VFX Juice". The first VFX Power is [...] "Slow", which slows time, causing the player's attacks to be more powerful, increasing Joe's reflexes, and allowing him to dodge attacks more easily. The second VFX Power, [...] "Mach Speed", allows Joe to move at a faster speed, creating multiple after-images of him when he unleashes a flurry of attacks on all enemies on the screen. It can additionally cause his attacks to envelop Joe in a temporary heat shield, rendering him immune to flame attacks and setting enemies on fire when struck. The last VFX Power, [...] "Zoom In", causes a camera close-up of Joe, powering up his normal attacks, granting him a set of new attacks, and paralyzing all lesser foes in proximity to him. However, any damage dealt to Joe whilst <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> is increased too. Any two VFX Powers can be combined. The VFX Gauge can be extended by collecting a certain number of V-Films present in each stage. The bar reverts to its normal length when a new stage begins.|$|E

Some of the rescuers who helped bring the miners to the surface also attended. Reporters and cameras mobbed the miners prompting the police to intervene to protect them.

2500|$|Manchester City {{supporters}} are also {{well known for}} their gallows humor fuelled by the many years of failure and unpredictability which is commonly associated with City and which fans enjoy wearing as a badge of their commitment. Gláuber Berti– After {{sitting on the bench}} 20 times in the 2008–09 season, the City fans were starting to joke that Gláuber Berti wasn't real and nicknamed him the invisible man. Finally though in the last game of the season against Bolton Wanderers he made an appearance in the 85th minute. This was the most popular substitution of the season and City fans greeted his every touch with applause and sang songs for him {{for the rest of the}} game. In a game against Red Bull Salzburg, the City fans found another new Brazilian they took to call Alan. When he came on as a second-half substitute, the announcer on the public address simply called him [...] "Alan" [...] and City fans were amused to see a Brazilian footballer with such an English name as Alan. City fans then started singing songs for him such as [...] "Alan is Superman!". After the match, Alan thanked the City supporters for their support. Grandma– In a game against West Bromwich Albion in February 2011, the big screen at the City of Manchester Stadium <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> on an elderly looking woman. City fans cheered, so the camera <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> on her a few more times throughout the match. As the game went on City fans nicknamed her 'Grandma' and started singing songs such as '75 years and she's still here' and 'Grandma do the Poznan' (which she did). She was later revealed to be Mavis Goddard from nearby Hulme. Unfortunately she suffered a stroke and was unable to attend the 2011 FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United, a match City won 1–0 to book their place in the 2011 FA Cup Final, and she died in December 2011. In 2012, Porto considered complaining to UEFA over an [...] "unsporting" [...] chant which was aimed at their player Hulk. With Manchester City leading the UEFA Europa League tie 4-0 at home, unimpressed City supporters proceeded to sing [...] "You're not incredible, you're not incredible!" [...] (to the tune of [...] "La donna è mobile") to the £80million-rated Porto striker, who had a mediocre performance. The threat of Porto's complaint was met with a humorous response in the English media.|$|E
2500|$|Stylistically, Rosenthal {{attempted}} {{to recreate the}} elements and themes of the original film. The opening title features a jack-o'-lantern that splits in half to reveal a human skull. In the original, the camera <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> on the jack-o'-lantern's left eye. [...] The first scene {{of the film is}} presented through a first-person camera format in which a voyeuristic Michael Myers enters an elderly couple's home and steals a knife from the kitchen. Rosenthal attempts to reproduce the [...] "jump" [...] scenes present in Halloween, but does not film Myers on the periphery, which is where he appeared in many of the scenes of the original. Under Rosenthal's direction, Myers is the central feature of a majority of the scenes. In an interview with Luke Ford, Rosenthal explains,The first movie I ever did [...] was a sequel, but {{it was supposed to be}} a direct continuation. It started one minute after the first movie ended. You have to try hard to maintain the style of the first movie. I wanted it to feel like a two-parter. You have the responsibility and the restraints of the style that's been set. It was the same crew. My philosophy was to do more of a thriller than a slasher movie.|$|E
2500|$|Wen's {{public image}} {{has been criticized}} by Chinese {{dissident}} Yu Jie, who charged that Wen's rhetoric is insincere and empty. Dissidents such as Yu allege that Wen's parade of appearances on Chinese media is a carefully managed public relations campaign designed to distract people from real issues. They say that through use of Wen's charisma, the government hopes to showcase cosmetic solutions to much larger, systemic issues in order to placate public opinion. They {{also point out that}} Wen's words are rarely translated into deeds. On the other hand, Li Datong, a pro-democracy advocate, {{in an interview with the}} Associated Press, stated that [...] "among the top Chinese leaders, who else speaks about democracy? Who else speaks about universal values and freedom?... Wen is the only one." [...] Li believes that Wen is genuinely calling for democratic reform but he is powerless to make major decisions on the matter due to internal opposition. Wen's family members have also been subject to gossip and scrutiny outside of mainland China. Taiwanese media <b>zoomed</b> <b>in</b> on his wife's alleged personal fortunes from her jewelry business, while the Financial Times reported on a private equity firm called New Horizon Capital co-founded by Wen's son Wen Yunsong.|$|E
