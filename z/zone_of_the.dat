40|$|Tumor-associated immunocytes can {{influence}} <b>the</b> survival <b>of</b> tumor cells, <b>the</b> processes <b>of</b> proliferation and apoptosis, these immunocytes also {{participate in the}} metastatic cascade. Aim. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} estimate <b>the</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squamous cell lung cancer (SCLC) microenvironment using the immunohistochemical technique. Materials and methods. Pathomorphological and immunohistochemical studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surgical material from 20 patients, which were treated in ZRCOD because of SCLC, were conducted: 10 patients with SCLC without metastases in the regional lymph nodes (RLN) formed the I group and 10 patients with SCLC with metastases in the RLN formed the II group. Results. It was revealed, that <b>the</b> maximums <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution density (DD) of CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes are typical for <b>the</b> peritumorous sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SCLC stroma. Moreover, the statistically significant differences between the CD 4 + lymphocytes DD in <b>the</b> stroma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I and the II groups cases were found: 401. 2 (344. 6, 511. 3) vs. 622. 4 (587. 2, 793. 9) cells/mm 2 in <b>the</b> peritumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma; 298. 0 (246. 1, 350. 1) vs. 484. 8 (479. 3, 690. 6) cells/mm 2 in <b>the</b> intertumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma. <b>The</b> maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CD 20 + lymphocytes DD in the I group cases was revealed in <b>the</b> peritumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma, in the II group cases – in <b>the</b> intertumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma, while <b>the</b> maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plasmocytes DD was observed in <b>the</b> intertumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma. <b>The</b> maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> macrophages DD is typical for <b>the</b> peritumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma. Moreover, there are statistically significant differences between the macrophages DD in <b>the</b> intertumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma in the I and the II groups cases: 259. 5 (193. 0, 325. 2) vs. 507. 1 (390. 2; 617. 8) cells/mm 2. Conclusion. SCLC without metastasis in the RLN is characterized by <b>the</b> predominant distribution <b>of</b> CD 4 +, CD 8 + lymphocytes and CD 68 + macrophages in <b>the</b> peritumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma, as well as CD 20 + lymphocytes and plasmocytes in <b>the</b> intertumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumor stroma. SCLC with metastases in the RLN differs by <b>the</b> predominance <b>of</b> CD 20 + lymphocytes in <b>the</b> peritumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma, as well as the significantly higher values of CD 4 + lymphocytes in the peri- and intertumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stroma, CD 68 + macrophages in <b>the</b> intertumorous <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumor stroma. ...|$|R

5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Falls. However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to {{systematic}} predator control hunting {{which began in}} 1850.

The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve {{the balance of the}} ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project – the largest wolf research project in North America.
