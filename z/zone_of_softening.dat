40|$|Neuropathological {{findings}} in the brains of two alcoholic patients with Korsakoff's psychosis are reported. Their memory defects had been studied in detail quantitatively {{over a period of}} nine years in one case and three years in the other, relevant details of which are presented. Both patients had had a relatively pure long-term memory impairment in the absence of other cognitive deficits {{and in the absence of}} a short-term memory impairment. Their retrograde amnesia for public events and famous faces had been measured and found to have extended backwards over at least twenty-five years. There was severe impairment in anterograde recognition memory for both verbal and non-verbal material. On a newly prepared memory quotient battery both patients had scored well below the bottom of the normal scale (less than 60, where 100 is the mean with a standard deviation of +/- 15). Both patients had also shown the characteristic differential improvement in retention when tested by cued recall and also the characteristic 'prior learning effect', i. e. normal retention of one list of words when tested by cued recall but impaired retention of a second list sharing the same cues as the first list. There had been a slight but significant deterioration in intelligence in one of the patients in the two years prior to his death, although his IQ still fell within the normal range. The other patient remained undeteriorated until his death, and his IQ also was close to an estimated measure of his premorbid IQ. In the brains of both patients there was marked gliosis, shrinkage and discolouration bilaterally in the medial nuclei of the mammillary bodies. In addition there was a thin band of gliosis bilaterally between the wall of the third ventricle and the medial dorsal nucleus, the rostral limit lying anterior to the medial dorsal nucleus. In the patient with no intellectual deterioration these were the only pathological changes that were seen. In neither patient was there evident local loss of nerve cells, gliosis or any other qualitative evidence of abnormality in the hippocampi, the white matter of the temporal lobes or the greater part of the medial dorsal nuclei, although it is difficult to be certain whether there was any overlap between the band of gliosis and the most medial region of the medial dorsal nueleus and other adjacent thalamic nuclei. In the other patient there was also a small <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> in the cerebellum and an increase in astrocytes in other regions of the cerebral hemispheres, including the basal ganglia, amygdala, and brain-stem, but without noticeable loss of cells. The question of the minimal lesion for the alcoholic Korsakoff amnesic state, and some aspects of the related anatomy, is discussed in the context of other reports in the literature which are, however, difficult to assess in the absence of details of the specificity, severity and character of the memory disorders...|$|E

From a review of some natural shear zones, initial faulting focused along a pre-existing shear zone, and/or the boundary of a volume of relatively strong crust or lithosphere, guides emplacement of hot mantle-derived melts into {{the base of the}} crust, lleading to extensive melting. When crystallized, the sub-solidus piu tons represent a focused <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> thermally <b>softened</b> material, capable <b>of</b> deforming readily and developing the full range of crystal-plastic microstructures and fabrics associated with mylonitcs, contrasting with the intrusion-free wall rocks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{predict the}} {{behavior}} of a concrete structure under seismic loading, the stress-strain curve of concrete in compression is important material characteristic. Current models are including the influence of compressive strength. By the way, the localization of failure of concrete in compression is also influential on the stress-strain curve; hence, the stress-strain curve is strongly changing with the aspect ratio of a concrete specimen. The objective {{of this study is to}} establish the hysteresis model of concrete in compression considering the localization and compressive strength of concrete. To overcome the localization of failure, it is assumed that the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> strain <b>softening</b> (failure <b>zone)</b> <b>of</b> a specimen is coupling in series to “transition zone ” and “unloading zone”, such that the stresses carried by these 3 zones are equal and their strains are superimposed with considering the extent <b>of</b> each <b>zone.</b> In this paper, the hysteresis loop model for a failure zone, which governs the overall behavior of concrete structures, was presented in comparison with the experimental loop...|$|R

Its composition reveals {{similarities to other}} calc-alkaline granitoids, which are mostly interpreted as products of magma mixing between the basic magmas derived from mantle wedge above a subduction zone with crustally-derived acid melts.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of laser welding on fatigue properties of DP 600 and DP 980 steels in relation to the microstructural change and softening in the heat-affected <b>zone.</b> The degree <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> was found to be stronger in the DP 980 welded joints than in the the DP 600 welded joints. While the severity <b>of</b> the soft <b>zone</b> in the welded DP 980 joints led to a significant decrease in the fatigue limit, the mild soft zone present in the DP 600 welded joints had little or only a minor effect on the fatigue resistance. Despite the strong effect <b>of</b> the soft <b>zone,</b> the DP 980 welded joints showed a similar or even longer fatigue life than that of both the DP 600 welded joints and DP 600 base metal at higher stress amplitudes.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the ground {{response}} to tunnel excavation in deep clay formations have been studied. Such strata may be only lightly overconsolidated and an unsupported tunnel could have a high stability ratio. Consequently, at large depths there may be construcz ion difficulties similar to those encountered in soft ground at shallow depths. Problems which may be encountered are squeezing ground, i. e. a continually increasing volume loss with time, and possible collapse after a 'stand-up' time. A range of parameters likely to influence the time dependent deformation behaviour at an unsupported tunnel face was investigated {{in a number of}} small scale model tunnel tests. The tests were performed in large cylindrical samples of kaolin clay under axisymmetric conditions, with measurement of tunnel face displacement and pore pressure changes in the clay. After removal of the tunnel face support, soil intruded into the tunnel at a rate which gradually increased with time until a constant rate was reached. The steadily increasing deformation was frequently associated with increasing pore pressures close to the tunnel face as water flow occurred towards the tunnel face due to the changed boundary conditions. Two parameters, the initial pore pressure in the soil and the initial load factor, were shown to have a major influence on the time dependent behaviour, and were incorporated into a new deformation time factor. Initial undrained pore pressure changes caused by the removal of tunnel face support have been compared with simplified closed form solutions for the thick cylinder and thick sphere analogue. As a result two zones were identified at the tunnel face, in which either approximately cylindrical or spherical behaviour was observed. The small scale tests were modelled numerically using the finite element program CRISP. Elasto-plastic soil behaviour and consolidation were included in the analyses. Although the predictions were affected by the complex geometry and boundary conditions of the model tests, the mechanics of the time dependent deformations were demonstrated. Deformations at the tunnel face were poorly predicted and pore pressure changes were confined to smaller zones than in the model tests. However, comparisons of the finite element predictions and the closed form solutions for the plastic zone were more favourable. Longe term pore pressure predictions showed only limited agreement with the experimental behaviour. For both the model tunnel and thick cylinder, CRISP predicted localized <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>softened</b> soil close to the unsupported boundary which developed over a very short time period. The rapid local drainage implies that time dependent movements will be observed which are governed by changes in pore pressure and water flow...|$|R
40|$|Strongly {{heterogeneous}} deformation {{and extreme}} metamorphic gradients characterize the dominantly carbonate Nieves Unit in the footwall to the Ronda mantle extrusion wedge {{in the western}} Betic Cordillera. A well-developed foliation and mineral lineation, together with isoclinal intrafolial folds, occur in silicate-bearing, calcite or dolomite marbles within a c. 1. 5 [*]km thick metamorphic aureole underlying the peridotites. For the inferred maximum pressure of 300 [*]MPa, petrological investigations allow us to define temperature ranges for the main <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the metamorphic aureole: > 510 [*]°C (probably c. 700 [*]°C) for the forsterite zone; 510 – 430 [*]°C for the diopside zone; 430 – 360 [*]°C for the tremolite zone; 360 – 330 [*]°C for the phlogopite zone. Field structural analysis integrated with petrological, microstructural and electron backscatter diffraction textural data document large finite strains consistent with general shear within the metamorphic aureole, associated with NW-directed thrusting of the peridotites. On the other hand, post-kinematic silicate growth suggests that heat diffusion from the high-temperature peridotites continued after the final emplacement of the Ronda mantle extrusion wedge, leading to final zoning of the metamorphic aureole and to local partial annealing of calcite marble textures, particularly in the highest-temperature <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the thermally <b>softened</b> footwall carbonates.

Therefore, the relationship of leaf and fruit transpiration rates with the incidence <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> tissue in mango cultivars.

The significant and negative relationship (r = - 0. 436 and - 0. 521) observed between the fruit transpiration rates and softening tissue suggests that the lower fruit transpiration rates in cultivar Dashehari are a varietal specific trait, which results in slower movement of water and mineral to the fruits from the soil/leaf leading to the development <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> tissue in mango...|$|R

40|$|Composition {{dependence}} of the in-plane Cu-O bond-stretching LO mode in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x was investigated {{in order to gain}} insight into the microscopic mechanism of the metal-insulator transition in cuprates. We report experimental results suggesting the presence of spatial electronic inhomogeneities in superconducting YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x. These results were obtained by time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering measurements on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x single crystals with different oxygen concentrations (x = 0. 15, 0. 35, 0. 6, 0. 7 and 0. 95). In addition to the well-known <b>zone</b> boundary <b>softening</b> <b>of</b> the in-plane Cu-O bond-stretching longitudinal optical phonon mode, our results showed an insulator-like unsoftened branch coexisting with the softened branch at intermediate doping. We also determined that the extent <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> was the same for all doping levels and was equal to 14 meV. It has been proposed that this phonon softening is the result of strong electron-phonon coupling. In addition, we found that the spectral weight <b>of</b> the <b>softened</b> mode at the zone boundary increased while the intensity of the unsoftened branch decreased with increasing doping. This suggests a nano-scale electronic phase separation in superconducting YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6 +x. Lattice dynamical calculations have been carried out to study the evolution of phonon modes upon doping. The lattice dynamical models assuming a homogeneous, one-component system were not able to reproduce the experimentally observed phonon behavior. To explain out experimental findings, we propose a two-phase scenario for underdoped cuprates. The effect of doping [...] -phonon softening [...] -is confined to a certain volume fraction of the material, and this volume fraction is increasing with doping. Furthermore, triple-axis and time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering measurements on the underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6. 6 performed at different temperatures revealed that a new mode appeared at 65 meV at higher temperatures (200 K and above). This mode is dispersionless and might indicate the presence of polarons in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6. 6 at higher temperatures, possibly shedding light on nature of transition from the insulating parent compound to metallic cuprates. ...|$|R

This is the case both for physical constraints, like saturation constraints, as well for performance or safety constraints on outputs or other variables of the process. Performance constraints can usually be softened by allowing violation if necessary. This is advisable, as hard constraints can lead to stability problems.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{comparison}} of several models, proposed in the literature, <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> plasticity with internal variables regularized by nonlocal averaging of integral type. The analyzed models <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> plasticity are divided in two groups. The former complies with models {{based on the principle}} of nonlocal maximum plastic dissipation; the latter is given by models formulated ad hoc without any recourse to thermodynamic requirements. In general, these models are not easy to compare. Actually, the formulations based on the principle of nonlocal maximum plastic dissipation appears to be quite different in terms of the free energy and of the yield function. On the other side, it is not trivial to check the thermodynamic admissibility of nonlocal models ad hoc formulated. To highlight the fundamental properties of these models in order to exploit the similarities and the differences between them, a general treatment <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> plasticity with internal variables is preliminarily proposed in the framework supplied by convex analysis and by the generalized standard material. It is shown that this framework provides the suitable tools to perform a theoretical analysis of such nonlocal problems. The proposed nonlocal formulation <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> plasticity combines in a quite general way the effect of local and nonlocal internal variables in the expressions of the free energy and of the elastic domain. As a consequence, several models <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> plasticity based either on thermodynamic considerations or on ad hoc formulations can be derived from the proposed model.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of welded boiler tubes used in power plants can be significantly altered {{as a result}} of the fabrication history, such as pre-straining and heat treatment. The primary aim of the study was to determine the effect of fabrication history on local tensile properties across the welds. This was achieved by testing cross-weld specimens machined from welded thin-walled tubes (with unstrained or pre-strained base metal) before and after heat treatment. Digital image correlation, which is a full-field strain measurement technique, was implemented in order to obtain the local stress–strain curves and to extract the corresponding local tensile properties such as offset proof stress. Evidence of strain hardening due to the constraint and thermo-mechanical cycles during the welding process was found in the heat-affected <b>zone</b> and evidence <b>of</b> <b>softening</b> was observed in the pre-strained base metal. It was found that the heat treatment process removed the effect of pre-straining and welding on the proof stress and the strength along the specimen was nearly homogenized. However, mapping the local stress–strain curves in the as-welded cross-weld specimens with pre-strained base metal has revealed abnormal strain relaxation with increase in load in the weld-affected region. For a better understanding of this behaviour, a tensile test of a cross-weld specimen with a large strength mismatch between the weld metal and the base metal was simulated using the finite element method. It was found that the strength mismatch in the specimen causes the development of biaxial stresses in the heat-affected zone once local yielding begins, and the use of global axial stress to construct the local stress–strain curve results in an apparent ‘reduced-strain’ anomaly. Nevertheless, for the strength mismatch ratios studied, this anomalous behaviour did not seem to significantly affect the determination of the local proof stress in the specimens...|$|R
