25|$|CANDU fuel bundles {{are about}} a half meter long and 10cm in diameter. They consist of {{sintered}} (UO2) pellets in <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes, welded to <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> end plates. Each bundle is roughly 20kg, and a typical core loading is {{on the order of}} 4500-6500 bundles, depending on the design. Modern types typically have 37 identical fuel pins radially arranged about the long axis of the bundle, but in the past several different configurations and numbers of pins have been used. The CANFLEX bundle has 43 fuel elements, with two element sizes. It is also about 10cm (4inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20in) long and weighs about 20kg (44lb) and replaces the 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. Current CANDU designs do not need enriched uranium to achieve criticality (due to their more efficient heavy water moderator), however, some newer concepts call for low enrichment to help reduce the size of the reactors.|$|E
25|$|Uranium dioxide (UO2) powder is {{compacted}} to cylindrical pellets and sintered at {{high temperatures}} to produce ceramic nuclear fuel pellets {{with a high}} density and well defined physical properties and chemical composition. A grinding process is used to achieve a uniform cylindrical geometry with narrow tolerances. Such fuel pellets are then stacked and filled into the metallic tubes. The metal used for the tubes depends {{on the design of}} the reactor. Stainless steel was used in the past, but most reactors now use a <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> which, in addition to being highly corrosion-resistant, has low neutron absorption. The tubes containing the fuel pellets are sealed: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped into fuel assemblies that are used to build up the core of a power reactor.|$|E
50|$|Pressurized water reactor fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes that are bundled together. The <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes are about 1 cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14x14 to 17x17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters in length. The <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet cladding interaction {{which can lead to}} fuel rod failure over long periods.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{are solid}} {{solutions}} of zirconium or other metals, a common subgroup having {{the trade mark}} Zircaloy. Zirconium has very low absorption cross-section of thermal neutrons, high hardness, ductility and corrosion resistance. One of the main uses of <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> is in nuclear technology, as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, especially water reactors. A typical composition of nuclear-grade <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> is more than 95 weight percent zirconium and less than 2% of tin, niobium, iron, chromium, nickel and other metals, which are added to improve mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.|$|R

50|$|<b>Zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> readily {{react with}} oxygen, forming a nanometer-thin {{passivation}} layer. The corrosion {{resistance of the}} alloys may degrade significantly when some impurities (e.g. more than 40 ppm of carbon or more than 300 ppm of nitrogen) are present. Corrosion resistance of <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> is enhanced by intentional development of thicker passivation layer of black lustrous zirconium oxide. Nitride coatings might also be used.|$|R
50|$|Also, 5-20% of {{hydrogen}} diffuses into the <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> cladding forming zirconium hydrides. The hydrogen production process also mechanically weakens the rods cladding because the hydrides have lower ductility and density than zirconium or its alloys, and thus blisters and cracks form upon hydrogen accumulation.

50|$|The Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) was {{established}} in 1971 as a major industrial unit of India's Department of Atomic Energy, for the supply of nuclear fuel bundles and reactor core components. It is a unique facility where natural and enriched uranium fuel, <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> cladding and reactor core components are manufactured under one roof.|$|E
50|$|The loss of coolant further caused {{hydrogen}} {{explosions in}} the facility. As the fuel temperature went up, <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> cladding reacted {{with the hot}} steam removing oxygen from water molecule, leaving hydrogen gas.

40|$|<b>Zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> are {{routinely}} used as {{materials in the}} nuclear industry due to the low absorption of thermal neutrons, favorable mechanical properties, and reasonably good corrosion resistance in normal water reactor operating conditions. However, under transient conditions, <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> may be exposed to oxidizing atmospheres and temperatures up to 1000 °C. The effect of transient conditions on <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> is not well understood. Transients can result in changes in volume, grain morphology, and composition, which may impact the mechanical integrity of the material. Therefore, {{the focus of this}} study is to investigate the behavior of the Zircaloy- 3 (Zr- 3) and Zircaloy- 4 (Zr- 4) alloys under these conditions. To simulate thermal transients, the alloys were annealed and quenched in inert atmospheres. Microstructure and chemical compositions were compared before and after thermal treatments using a scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and optical microscopy. Zirconium undergoes a structural phase transformation from HCP → BCC at 863 °C, which results in a volume contraction. The elements introduced during the <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloying</b> process changes the phase transformation temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure changes in the phase transformation temperature. The results of this investigation are reported here...|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied processes in the nuclear industry. The purpose of this report is to provide in a concise form a review of the oxidation process of <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> in the moderate temperature regime. In the initial ''pre-transition'' phase, the surface oxide is dense and protective. After the oxide layer has grown to a thickness of 2 to 3 {micro}m's, the oxidation process enters the ''post-transition'' phase where the density of the layer decreases and becomes less protective. A compilation of relevant data suggests a single expression can be used to describe the post-transition oxidation rate of most <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys</b> during exposure to oxygen, air, or water vapor. That expression is: Oxidation Rate = 13. 9 g/(cm{sup 2 }-s-atm{sup - 1 / 6 }) exp(- 1. 47 eV/kT) x P{sup 1 / 6 } (atm{sup 1 / 6 }) ...|$|R
50|$|Both {{the fuel}} and {{cladding}} can swell. Cladding covers the fuel {{to form a}} fuel pin and can be deformed. It is normal {{to fill the gap}} between the fuel and the cladding with helium gas to permit better thermal contact between the fuel and the cladding. During use the amount of gas inside the fuel pin can increase because of the formation of noble gases (krypton and xenon) by the fission process. If a Loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) (e.g. Three Mile Island) or a Reactivity Initiated Accident (RIA) (e.g. Chernobyl or SL-1) occurs then the temperature of this gas can increase. As the fuel pin is sealed the pressure of the gas will increase (PV = nRT) and it is possible to deform and burst the cladding. It has been noticed that both corrosion and irradiation can alter the properties of the <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> commonly used as cladding, making it brittle. As a result, the experiments using unirradated <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes can be misleading.|$|E

40|$|For the {{development}} of processing maps to <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys,</b> a simple instability condition based on the Ziegler's continuum principles as applied to large plastic flow is extended for delineating the regions of unstable metal flow/occurrence of fracture or defects, utilizing the flow stress data of Zr- 2. 5 Nb- 0. 5 CU. An attempt is made to fit the measured flow stress data in a constitutive equation, useful in the finite element process models.

Finite element analysis has been used previously to explain the lateral crack formation by the development of localised out-of-plane tensile stresses at the metal–oxide interface. This work uses the Abaqus finite element code to assess critically current approaches to representing the oxidation of <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys,</b> with relation to undulations at the metal–oxide interface and localised stress generation. This includes comparison of axisymmetric and 3 D quartered modelling approaches, and investigates the effect of interface geometry and plasticity in the metal substrate. Particular focus is placed on the application of the anisotropic strain tensor used to represent the oxidation mechanism, which is typically applied with a fixed coordinate system. Assessment {{of the impact of the}} tensor showed that 99 % of the localised tensile stresses originated from the out-of-plane component of the strain tensor, rather than the in-plane expansion as was previously thought. Discussion is given to the difficulties associated with this modelling approach and the requirements for future simulations of the oxidation of <b>zirconium</b> <b>alloys...</b>|$|R
