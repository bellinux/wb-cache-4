2500|$|Field {{electron}} emission (also known as field emission (FE) and electron field emission) is emission of electrons induced by an electrostatic field. The most common context is field emission from a solid surface into vacuum.

The field-induced promotion of electrons from the valence to conduction band of semiconductors (the <b>Zener</b> <b>effect)</b> can also {{be regarded as a}} form of field emission. The terminology is historical because related phenomena of surface photoeffect, thermionic emission (or Richardson–Dushman effect) and [...] "cold electronic emission", i.e. the emission of electrons in strong static (or quasi-static) electric fields, were discovered and studied independently from the 1880s to 1930s.

Avalanche breakdown involves minority carrier electrons in the transition region being accelerated, by the electric field, to energies sufficient for freeing electron-hole pairs via collisions with bound electrons. The Zener and the avalanche effect may occur simultaneously or independently of one another. In general, diode junction breakdowns occurring below 5 volts are caused by the <b>Zener</b> <b>effect,</b> whereas breakdowns occurring above 5 volts are caused by the avalanche effect.

The composition dependent elastic moduli changes were shown to consist of a temperature independent and a temperature dependent part. The temperature independent changes were analyzed on the basis of contributions due to volume changes and to changes in the electronic structure of the alloy. The temperature dependent contributions to the elastic moduli changes were each associated with an acoustic attenuation and exhibited a significant isotopic dependence.

The Zener relaxation caused by reorientation of pairs of Ga atoms in Fe {{was used to evaluate}} the activation parameters of Ga atom jumps in Fe. An increase in the relaxation strength occurred with an increase in the Ga content up to 19 at. % according to {{an increase in the number}} of Ga-Ga atom pairs (Δ∼CGa 2 (1 -CGa) 2), whereas a decrease in the relaxation strength from 19 to 28 at. % Ga was assigned to D 03 and L 12 ordering of Ga atoms in Fe-Ga alloys. Ordering and phase transitions in these alloys affected the Zener relaxation parameters and led to the appearance of transient anelastic effects. A study of several ternary Fe-Ga-Al alloys using both temperature dependent and isothermal mechanical spectroscopy (frequency variations from 10 − 4 – 102 Hz) was conducted to avoid transient effects which take place at heating or cooling, and to measure anelasticity of alloys in the equilibrium state for the chosen temperatures.

However, {{in the far}} field where both temperature and shear stress is low, calculated L_ EGS reaches several tens of centimeters, which is not realistic. This result may be ascribed to our assumptions of instantaneous grain growth following the equation for L_ EGS.

Sluggish grain growth is attributed to the <b>Zener</b> pinning <b>effect</b> from the fine dispersion of oxide, mutual retardation of grain boundaries in the presence of two phases, and sluggish diffusivity because of cooperative diffusion of multi-principle elements.

40|$|Lightweighting in the {{transportation}} industry is today {{recognized as one}} of the most important strategies to improve fuel efficiency and reduce anthropogenic climate-changing, environment-damaging, and human death-causing emissions. However, the structural applications of lightweight alloys are often limited by some inherent deficiencies such as low stiffness, high wear rate and inferior strength. These properties could be effectively enhanced by the addition of stronger and stiffer reinforcements, especially nano-sized particles, into metal matrix to form composites. In most cases three common strengthening mechanisms (load-bearing effect, mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion, and Orowan strengthening) have been considered to predict the yield strength of metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs). This study was aimed at developing a unified model by taking into account the matrix grain size and porosity (which is unavoidable in the materials processing such as casting and powder metallurgy) in the prediction of the yield strength of MMNCs. The <b>Zener</b> pinning <b>effect</b> of grain boundaries by the nano-sized particles has also been integrated. The model was validated using the experimental data of magnesium- and titanium-based nanocomposites containing different types of nano-sized particles (namely, Al 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3, and carbon nanotubes).

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{localized}} defects in magnetic semiconductors act as deep impurities {{and can be}} described by the Anderson model. Within this model, hybridization of d-orbitals and p-orbitals {{gives rise to a}} non-RKKY indirect exchange mechanism, when the localized d-electrons are exchanged through both conduction and valence bands. For semiconductors with indirect band gap the non-RKKY part of exchange integral is antiferromagnetic, which suppresses ferromagnetism. In case of direct band gap, this exchange mechanism can, under certain conditions, lead to enhancement of ferromagnetism. The indirect exchange intergral is much stronger than RKKY, and can be sufficiently long range. Thus, a potentially new class of high-temperature magnetic semiconductors emerges, where doped carriers are not necessary to mediate ferromagnetism. Curie temperatures in such magnetic semiconductors are determined mostly by the interaction between localized impurities, not <b>Zener</b> mechanism.

40|$|Modifying the {{chemical}} composition of {{magnesium alloys with}} special emphasis on rare earth (RE) elements has shown numerous indications of improved properties of this class of alloys, such as possibility of grain refinement, better formability at low temperatures, and enhanced strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures. In particular, has been their ability in facilitating formation of less-common and unconventional sheet and extrusion textures. However, such texture modification in RE elements containing Mg alloys has been associated primarily with changes in the recrystallization texture, as opposed {{to changes in the}} deformation texture. What has been and still remains subject to greater scrutiny and investigation are the primary underlying physical mechanisms that are associated with RE-influence over recrystallization and grain growth behavior, whereby such significant texture modification is realized. The present work investigated in detail the influence of dilute additions of RE-elements upon deformation, recrystallization and grain growth behavior under varying processing conditions involving large strain hot rolling, plane strain compression and uniaxial tension tests. Comparisons were drawn between solid solution Mg- 1 Gd alloy and precipitate based Mg- 1 Ce alloy. Recrystallization inside shear bands, deformation twins and near particles was analyzed with context to texture formation features in the presence of rare-earths. By means of in-depth characterization ranging from atomic to bulk scales, the overall role of RE elements on the microstructure and texture development was understood. Shear banding in magnesium was enhanced in the presence of RE element additions. With respect to deformation twinning, addition of solute Gd triggered activation of { 101 ̅ 1 } compression and { 101 ̅ 1 }–{ 101 ̅ 2 } double twins in conjunction with { 101 ̅ 2 } tension twinning. While dynamic recrystallization was severely retarded during the large strain rolling treatment, deformation under plane strain compression witnessed slip assisted dynamic recovery inside twins. Solute rare-earths indicated a significantly larger potency of texture modification during annealing, as opposed to precipitate based Mg-RE alloys. Texture modification during recrystallization and grain growth was attributed to selective growth behavior stemming from segregation of RE atoms at the grain boundaries, whereby off-basal orientations assumed a growth advantage over their basal counterparts. The results indicated that not all RE elements behave in a similar fashion and the choice of RE element is critical for the desired texture modification. Adding non-RE elements (Zn and Zr) amplified the texture modification effects in the solute Mg- 1 Gd alloy, while Mg- 1 Ce, in the additional presence of non-RE elements, started exhibiting modified off-basal textures. The enhancement in texture modification was attributed to a larger solute drag in the Gd containing alloy and an intricate interaction of particle nucleation and <b>Zener</b> pinning <b>effects</b> in the Ce containing alloy. The resultant impact on the room temperature ductility was significant with the quaternary alloys revealing total elongation values as high as 34 - 40 %. Atom probe tomography investigations performed on two solute based RE-alloys viz. Mg- 1 Gd and Mg- 1 Dy, further highlighted that the aforementioned influence of the choice of RE element also holds valid when considering two elements showing similar interaction with matrix i. e. both are in solid solution. It was shown that the segregation tendencies are not just contingent to solubility limits of RE elements but strongly depend upon other factors such as clustering/ordering and phase formation energies. It was suggested that the greater tendency of clustering/ordering shown by Gd facilitates much stronger segregation to the grain boundaries, whereby the impact on texture evolution mechanisms during annealing is substantial...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafine {{structured}} {{metal matrix}} nanocomposites (MMNCs) have received much attention {{due to their}} attractive engineering applications and scientific interest. On the engineering aspect, ultrafine structured MMNCs have a higher room temperature strength and better high temperature performance due to grain boundary strengthening, nanoparticle strengthening and <b>Zener</b> pinning <b>effects</b> compared to their metal matrices. On the scientific aspect, {{there is the question}} of whether the linear superposition of basic strengthening mechanisms, which is applicable to conventional precipitation-hardened alloys, is still valid in evaluating the strength of ultrafine structured MMNCs. In general, there might be a synergistic effect among different strengthening mechanisms when the grain sizes of matrices of MMNCs are reduced down to the submicrometer range. In this thesis, a model system of Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ was selected to study with the aim of deepening and reinforcing the understanding of the microstructure/property relationship and contributions of various strengthening mechanisms to the overall strength of ultrafine structured MMNCs. Nanostructured Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ nanocomposite powder particles were produced by high energy mechanical milling (HEMM) of a powder mixture of Cu powder and Al₂O₃ nanopowder. The nanocomposite powders were then annealed at 300 - 600 °C for up to 5 h. The powders had a high thermal stability at temperatures up to 600 °C. After annealing at 600 °C for 5 h, Cu nanograins in the microstructure of the nanocomposite powder particles only grew slightly and the microstructure of the Cu matrix of powder particles was still well within the nanostructure range. The activation energy for the grain growth of the Cu nanograins was determined to be 63. 4 kJ/mol, which is much lower than that of coarse grained monolithic Cu and similar to that of nanocrystalline monolithic Cu, and suggests the grain growth behavior is controlled by grain boundary diffusion. The impressive thermal stability of the microstructure of the powder particles is mainly associated with the effect of Al₂O₃ nanoparticles on the grain growth through inhibiting the grain boundary diffusion. Ultrafine structured Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ nanocomposite samples were synthesized by powder compact extrusion at 750 and 900 °C, and their microstructures and tensile properties were characterized. The microstructural characterization showed that there is no significant difference in the mean Cu grain sizes for both samples but the sample extruded at 900 °C has far less Al₂O₃ nanoparticles in comparison to the sample extruded at 750 °C. The tensile testing results exhibited that the 900 °C extruded sample has a larger strength and higher ductility at fracture as compared to those of the 750 °C extruded sample. This shows that the dissolution of Al₂O₃ nanoparticles in the Cu matrix takes place when the powder compact is heated and extruded at 900 °C, and the dissolution of the Al₂O₃ nanoparticles leads to superior tensile properties of the sample extruded at 900 °C. Further ultrafine structured Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ nanocomposite samples were prepared by extrusion of powder compacts of nanostructured Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ nanocomposite powder at temperatures ranging from 300 to 900 °C. The experimental results showed that Cu grains and the sizes and volume fractions of Al₂O₃ nanoparticles of bulk ultrafine structured Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ nanocomposite samples increased with the increase of the extrusion temperature. The average sizes of Cu grains and Al₂O₃ nanoparticles and the volume fraction of Al₂O₃ nanoparticles of the extruded samples increased from 132 nm, 43 nm and 0. 75 % to 263 nm, 100 nm and 4 %, respectively, as the extrusion temperature increased from 300 to 900 °C. The increases in the sizes and volume fraction of the Al₂O₃ nanoparticles with the increase of the extrusion temperature were caused by the precipitation of Al₂O₃ nanoparticles during extrusion. The samples extruded at 400 °C or lower fractured prematurely without yielding, while the samples extruded at T≥ 500 °C fractured after yielding. The yield strengths and ultimate tensile strengths of such materials changed only slightly with the increase of the extrusion temperature and had values in the range 466 - 517 and 546 - 564 MPa. However, the tensile ductility of the extruded samples was proportional to the extrusion temperature and increased from 0. 76 to 5. 82 % with increasing the extrusion temperature from 500 to 900 °C. The slight decrease of yield strength and significant increase of the ductility of the consolidated sample with increasing extrusion temperature suggests that the level of interparticle atomic bonding in the consolidated samples increases with increased extrusion temperature. It is speculated that the fracture of the samples extruded at T ≤ 800 °C is associated with the weak bonding of residual interparticle boundaries which have not been transformed into grain boundaries. When the extrusion temperature T ≥ 800 °C, the area of the residual interparticle boundaries may be too small to play any major role in causing the fracture of the consolidated sample. Analysis of the contributions of different strengthening mechanisms demonstrates that grain boundary strengthening makes the largest contribution to the strength of the extruded samples relative to the nanoparticle strengthening and strain hardening and experimentally measured yield strength of the extruded samples can be predicted appropriately by the sum of Peierls stress, grain boundary strengthening, nanoparticle strengthening and strain hardening. The effect of annealing on an ultrafine structured Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ nanocomposite sample made by powder compact extrusion at 900 °C was investigated by annealing for 1 h at different temperatures in the range of 500 - 900 °C. This revealed that Al₂O₃ nanoparticles provided excellent thermal stability to the ultrafine structured Cu- 5 vol. %Al₂O₃ nanocomposite sample. The microstructure and microhardness of the sample remained stable up to annealing at 800 °C for 1 h. High resistance of Al₂O₃ nanoparticles to coarsening was responsible for this high thermal stability. The microhardness increase observed for the sample annealed at 700 °C for 1 h came from the precipitation of small Al₂O₃ nanoparticles. On the other hand, the sudden drop in microhardness of the sample annealed at 900 °C for 1 h was related to the coarsening of small Al₂O₃ nanoparticles and grain growth of the Cu matrix. This thesis concludes with suggestions for future work that would extend on from the findings presented here...|$|R

The techniques used included a variety of mechanical tests at both room and high temperatures, dilatometry, phase analysis by XRD and chemical analysis by XRF, pore analysis by simple Archimedes tests and mercury porosimetry and both scanning electron and transmitted light microscopy. A large number of materials were created with different formulations and the various characterisation techniques employed were used to determine the function of the different constituent. 	It was determined that the function of zircon was to prevent grain boundary movement at elevated temperatures via the <b>Zener</b> <b>effect,</b> by acting as a non-reactive secondary phase. The zircon also had an additional consequence from the inherent contamination, with alumina, from the ball-mill procedure performed by the supplier. This had the effect of significantly affecting several high temperature properties.
