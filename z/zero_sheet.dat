40|$|Three new {{algorithms}} for deconvolving image blur are presented. All {{three are}} based on the computation of the zeros of an image's z-transform and the separation of the zeros into sets belonging to the image and to the point spread function (psf). The zeros lie on a sheet existing in a four-dimensional space. The first two algorithms are applicable when the psf is known a priori. In Algorithm I portions of the "zero sheet " are matched using a Eucidean measure, then zeros are selected from the remainder and an image is algebraically reconstructed. In Algorithm II the point zeros of 1 -dimensional cuts through Fourier space are matched before reconstructing an image estimate via inverse Fourier transformation. Finally, Algorithm III is applicable when an ensemble of differently blurred images are recorded from the same object (e. g. astronomical speckle images); even though the psi is unknown for each member of the ensemble (i. e. deconvolution is to be "blind"), parts of the <b>zero</b> <b>sheet</b> corresponding to the actual (unblurred) image can be matched over the ensemble and a reconstruction made by inverse Fourier transformation. Encouraging results have been obtained for Algorithms I and III for small positive images contaminated by small amounts of noise; Algorithm II has been successfully applied to larger images. Algorithms I and II have an inherent advantage over conventional Wiener filtering in that the psf {{does not need to be}} known precisely to achieve acceptable results. 1...|$|E

Thereafter, he took up full {{employment}} at All States Trust Bank where he worked for around two years before joining Zenith Bank in 1997. At Zenith Bank, he set a record of growing a new branch from <b>zero</b> balance <b>sheets</b> to over N9 billion and rose to the position of an Assistant General Manager (AGM) in Zenith Bank. He resigned in 2007 to pursue a career in entrepreneurship.|$|R
50|$|As the {{principal}} curvatures are the eigenvalues {{of the second}} fundamental form, there are two at each point, and these give rise to two points of the focal surface on each normal direction to the surface. Away from umbilical points, these two points of the focal surface are distinct; at umbilical points the two sheets come together. When the surface has a ridge the focal surface has a cuspidal edge, three such edges pass through an elliptical umbilic and only one through a hyperbolic umbilic. At points where the Gaussian curvature is <b>zero,</b> one <b>sheet</b> of the focal surface will have a point at infinity corresponding to the zero principal curvature.|$|R

This is in clear contrast to the 2 D single-crystal Nb film [28], where the <b>zero</b> bias <b>sheet</b> resistance was undetectably small at sufficiently low temperatures. In accordance with it, the presence of strong vortex pinning was concluded from the observation of vortex creep in [28]. This {{can be attributed to}} likely variations in local thickness of the epitaxial Nb film at the lateral scale of vortex size [30]. The absence of ‘local thickness’ variation in the present surface system may be the origin of the observed free vortex flow phenomenon.|$|R

The equation describing the plane wave propagation (PWP), the stability, or the rectangular duct mode characteristics {{in such a}} flow is shown to be reducible to Whittaker's equation. The exact solutions are applied to problems of PWP and stability in linearly sheared flows as limiting {{cases in which the}} speed of sound goes to infinity (incompressible limit) or the shear layer thickness, or wave number, goes to <b>zero</b> (vortex <b>sheet</b> limit). With respect to the PWP it is shown that the shear layer possesses no resonances and no Brewster angles, while with regard to the problem of the stability of a finite thickness shear layer with a linear velocity profile, it is shown that the thin layer is unstable to long wavelength disturbances for all Mach numbers...|$|R

The resulting solutions, which are real, viewed as functions of two variables, depend on a parameter and an argument, the values of which have precise physical meanings depending on the problem. The exact solutions in terms of Whittaker functions are used to obtain a number of known results of plane wave propagation and stability in linearly sheared flows as limiting {{cases in which the}} speed of sound goes to infinity (incompressible limit) or the shear layer thickness, or wave number, goes to <b>zero</b> (vortex <b>sheet</b> limit). The usefulness of the exact solutions is then discussed in connection with the problems of plane wave propagation and the stability of a finite thickness layer with a linear velocity profile...|$|R
50|$|This process, in {{comparison}} to other methods based on using solid substrates, allows to manufacture defect-free graphene structures. HSMG is formed on a perfectly flat surface - liquid metal. While growing graphene on solid substrates is difficult due to surface irregularities and defects. Growing graphene on a liquid metal matrix enables the rotation of graphene grains, resulting in forming a continuous graphene sheet. Because of that, the grain disorientation angle is close to <b>zero.</b> Large-area graphene <b>sheets</b> formed with this method have high mechanical durability, close to graphene's theoretical values. This production method has been developed and patented {{by a team of}} scientists from the Institute of Materials Science of Lodz University of Technology, under the direction of Prof. Piotr Kula. HSMG graphene's commercialisation and applications are being handled by a spin-off institution - Advanced Graphene Products sp. z o.o.|$|R
