50|$|The TT <b>Zero</b> <b>lap</b> speeds {{have been}} {{improving}} {{at an average}} rate of around 4 mph each year since the series began (119.279 mph as of 2015). With more mature technology, the combustion engine bikes' lap speeds in the mainstream TT have been improving at a lower rate of around 0.4 mph each year in recent years (132.298 mph as of 2014). If these trends continue, the TT Zero bikes may match the combustion engine bikes by 2018 or 2019, and exceed them thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|The 2016 winning time {{failed to}} improve on the 2015 time {{not because of any}} lack of {{technical}} improvements, but due to Anstey backing off to secure a safe win, having passed his main rival McGuinness who paused mid-race due to accidentally engaging the 'kill switch'. On finishing the race, Anstey said; [...] "the bike still has lots of battery left" [...] (riders would normally try to utilize all the battery capacity during the race). The Victory team's 2016 lap speed improved by 4 mph over their 2015 speed. In general the TT <b>Zero</b> <b>lap</b> speeds have been improving at an average rate of around 4 mph each year since the series began (119.279 mph as of 2015), and thus could achieve 130 mph by around 2020, and catch up with the gasoline bikes in subsequent years. The Superbike TT lap records typically improve by 0.5-1 mph each year, with 2016 record of 133.393 mph.|$|E
50|$|Austin Dillon won the pole, but led <b>zero</b> <b>laps</b> {{on his way}} to {{finishing}} 24th. Harvick led a race high of 142 laps {{on his way to}} a runner-up finish. There were 26 lead changes among {{eight different}} drivers, as well as six caution flag periods for 33 laps.|$|R
50|$|Denny Hamlin won {{the pole}} {{for the race}} and led <b>zero</b> <b>laps</b> {{on his way to}} a 10th-place finish. Keselowski led a race high of 86 laps {{on his way to a}} third-place finish. The race had 18 lead changes among eight {{different}} drivers, as well as seven caution flag periods for 30 laps.|$|R
50|$|The winner's {{purse for}} the 1971 Daytona 500 was {{considered}} to be $45,450 in American dollars ($ when inflation is taken into effect). Even the last place finisher received $1,000 ($ with inflation) in take-home pay. Richard Petty would go on to win four more Daytona 500 races after this one (1973, 1974, 1979, and 1981). There were seven cautions involving forty-four laps of yellow flag racing and <b>zero</b> <b>laps</b> of red flag racing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{record for}} the {{shortest}} NASCAR career would be broken in 1990 by Rich Vogler. He qualified for a 1990 race at Pocono, but he died {{the night before the}} race. He was given a 40th-place finish and a [...] "Did Not Start", which means he completed <b>zero</b> <b>laps.</b> The fewest amount of lead changes were committed here; this record would be officially tied with the 1961 Dixie 400 the following year.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 the car {{was entered}} for the French Grand Prix, and the race, run that year at Lyon, was {{postponed}} till 21 September to enable it to compete. Unfortunately the transmission broke on the start line, and the record shows that it was placed last after completing <b>zero</b> <b>laps.</b> Nevertheless, the next year the CTA-Arsenal team returned to the fray, now with two cars built. It was scheduled to feature in the French Grand Prix, run at Rheims in July 1948, but had to withdraw at the last minute. The race was won by an Alfa Romeo.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H steering system {{plays an important role}} in realizing accurate steering control for an automatically guided agricultural vehicle. E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control valve, steering actuating cylinders, steering linkage, and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the <b>zero</b> <b>lapped</b> valve, and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R
5000|$|... 2015 Coke <b>Zero</b> 400: On <b>lap</b> 161, {{the final}} lap of a green-white-checker finish, second place Denny Hamlin got tapped by Kevin Harvick, {{spinning}} {{him in front}} of the 27-car lead pack as they crossed the finish line. Hamlin drifted back up into traffic and was hit by Austin Dillon, causing Dillon's car to fly over two other rows of cars, flip, and hit the catch fence. The crash collected 25 cars, with the only uninvolved cars from the lead pack being race winner Dale Earnhardt, Jr., second place Jimmie Johnson, and fifth place Kurt Busch. Twenty-four cars from the lead pack, as well as the trailing car of Brad Keselowski, were swept up in the melee. The crash occurred after the cars crossed the finish line, as Hamlin finished third and Harvick fourth, while Dillon finished seventh.|$|R
