25|$|Canna (or canna lily, {{although}} not a true lily) is a genus of 10 species of flowering plants. The closest living relations to cannas are the other plant families of the order Zingiberales, that is the <b>Zingiberaceae</b> (gingers), Musaceae (bananas), Marantaceae, Heliconiaceae, Strelitziaceae, etc.|$|E
25|$|Several mite species (mainly in the genera Proctolaelaps, Tropicoseius and Rhinoseius, family Ascidae) {{have evolved}} a phoretic mode of life, {{climbing}} into the nostrils of hummingbirds that visit flowers and hitching a ride to other flowers where they can feed on the nectar. Hummingbird flower mites favour plants in the families of Heliconiaceae, Costaceae, <b>Zingiberaceae,</b> Amaryllidaceae, Rubiaceae, Apocynaceae, Bromeliaceae, Gesneriaceae, Lobeliaceae and Ericaceae, members of which are associated with hummingbirds.|$|E

6000|$|The flora of the Archipelago is {{at present}} so imperfectly known, and I have myself paid so little {{attention}} to it, that I cannot draw from it many facts of importance. The Malayan type of vegetation is however a very important one; and Dr. Hooker informs us, in his [...] "Flora Indica," [...] that it spreads over all the moister and more equable parts of India, and that many plants found in Ceylon, the Himalayas, the Nilghiri, and Khasia mountains are identical with those of Java and the Malay peninsula. Among the more characteristic forms of this flora are the rattans--climbing palms of the genus Calamus, and {{a great variety of}} tall, as well as stemless palms. Orchids, Araceae, <b>Zingiberaceae</b> and ferns, are especially abundant, and the genus Grammatophyllum--a gigantic epiphytal orchid, whose clusters of leaves and flower-stems are ten or twelve feet long--is peculiar to it. Here, too, is the domain of the wonderful pitcher plants (Nepenthaceae), which are only represented elsewhere by solitary species in Ceylon, Madagascar, the Seychelles, Celebes, and the Moluccas. Those celebrated fruits, the Mangosteen and the Durian, are natives of this region, and will hardly grow out of the Archipelago. The mountain plants of Java have already been alluded to as showing a former connexion with the continent of Asia; and a still more extraordinary and more ancient connection with Australia has been indicated by Mr. Low's collections from the summit of Kini-balou, the loftiest mountain in Borneo.|$|E
40|$|Turmeric {{which is}} a member of the ginger family (<b>Zingiberacea)</b> is {{extensively}} used as a spice, food preservative and colouring material. Curcumin is a main bioactive natural compound derived from the rhizome of this plant. Curcumin can exist in several tautomeric forms, such as keto and enol. The keto form is more stable than enol form. Silyl ethers have proven to be versatile substrates for a wide variety of organic reactions and they can be prepared by the reaction of alcohol and silicon halide using a base such as triethylamine in stoichiometric quantity. Curcuminsilyl ether derivatives were prepared under mild conditions. The stability of products decreases when the size of the silyl substitutions increases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{rhizomes}} of Curcuma caesia Roxb. (<b>zingiberacea)</b> {{are traditionally}} used in treatment of various ailments and metabolic disorders like leukoderma, asthma, tumours, piles, bronchitis, etc. in Indian system of medicine. Considering {{the importance of}} natural products in modern phytomedicine, the antioxidant and antimutagenic activities of C. caesia Roxb. rhizome extract and its fractions were evaluated. The ethanolic fraction showed highest antioxidant activity by DPPH assay (86. 91 %) comparable to ascorbic acid (94. 77 %) with IC 50 value of 418 μg/ml for EECC followed by MECC (441. 90 μg/ml) >EAECC(561 μg/ml) >AECC(591 μg/ml). Based on the antioxidant activity, three of the rhizome extracts were evaluated for their antimutagenic properties against indirect acting mutagen cyclophosphamide (CP) using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 and TA 100. The antimutagenic activity of the extracts against indirect acting mutagen cyclophosphamide {{in the presence of}} mammalian metabolic activation system was found to be significant (p< 0. 01, p< 0. 05). All the extracts showed similar antimutagenicity in dose dependent manner. The total phenolic content as well as reducing ability of the extracts was also determined...|$|R
60|$|Persons {{who have}} formed the usual {{ideas of the}} {{vegetation}} of the tropics who picture to themselves the abundance and brilliancy of the flowers, and the magnificent appearance of hundreds of forest trees covered with masses of coloured blossoms, will be surprised to hear, that though vegetation in Aru is highly luxuriant and varied, and would afford abundance of fine and curious plants to adorn our hothouses, yet bright and showy flowers are, as a general rule, altogether absent, or so very scarce as to produce no effect whatever on the general scenery. To give particulars: I have visited five distinct localities in the islands, I have wandered daily in the forests, and have passed along upwards of a hundred miles of coast and river {{during a period of}} six months, much of it very fine weather, and till just as I was about to leave, I never saw a single plant of striking brilliancy or beauty, hardly a shrub equal to a hawthorn, or a climber equal to a honeysuckle! It cannot be said that the flowering season had not arrived, for I saw many herbs, shrubs, and forest trees in flower, but all had blossoms of a green or greenish-white tint, not superior to our lime-trees. Here and there on the river banks and coasts are a few Convolvulaceae, not equal to our garden Ipomaeas, and in the deepest shades of the forest some fine scarlet and purple <b>Zingiberaceae,</b> but so few and scattered as to be nothing amid the mass of green and flowerless vegetation. Yet the noble Cycadaceae and screw-pines, thirty or forty feet high, the elegant tree ferns, the lofty palms, and the variety of beautiful and curious plants which everywhere meet the eye, attest the warmth and moisture of the tropics, and the fertility of the soil.|$|E
60|$|On {{ascending}} the mountain, {{we first}} meet with temperate forms of herbaceous plants, so low as 3,000 feet, where strawberries and violets begin to grow, but {{the former are}} tasteless, and the latter have very small and pale flowers. Weedy composites also begin to give a European aspect to the wayside herbage. It is between 2,000 and 5,000 feet that the forests and ravines exhibit the utmost development of tropical luxuriance and beauty. The abundance of noble Tree-ferns, sometimes fifty feet high, contributes greatly to the general effect, since of all the forms of tropical vegetation they are certainly the most striking and beautiful. Some of the deep ravines which have been cleared of large timber are full of them from top to bottom; and where the road crosses one of these valleys, the view of their feathery crowns, in varied positions {{above and below the}} eye, offers a spectacle of picturesque beauty never to be forgotten. The splendid foliage of the broad-leaved Musaceae and <b>Zingiberaceae,</b> with their curious and brilliant flowers; and the elegant and varied forms of plants allied to Begonia and Melastoma, continually attract the attention in this region. Filling in the spaces between the trees and larger plants, on every trunk and stump and branch, are hosts of Orchids, Ferns and Lycopods, which wave and hang and intertwine in ever-varying complexity. At about 5,000 feet I first saw horsetails (Equisetum), very like our own species. At 6,000 feet, raspberries abound, and thence to the summit of the mountain there are three species of eatable Rubus. At 7,000 feet Cypresses appear, and the forest trees become reduced in size, and more covered with mosses and lichens. From this point upward these rapidly increase, so that the blocks of rock and scoria that form the mountain slope are completely hidden in a mossy vegetation. At about 5,000 feet European forms of plants become abundant. Several species of Honeysuckle, St. John's-wort, and Guelder-rose abound, and at about 9,000 feet we first meet with the rare and beautiful Royal Cowslip (Primula imperialis), which is said to be found nowhere else in the world but on this solitary mountain summit. It has a tall, stout stem, sometimes more than three feet high, the root leaves are eighteen inches long, and it bears several whorls of cowslip-like flowers, instead of a terminal cluster only. The forest trees, gnarled and dwarfed to the dimensions of bushes, reach up to the very rim of the old crater, but do not extend over the hollow on its summit. Here we find a good deal of open ground, with thickets of shrubby Artemisias and Gnaphaliums, like our southernwood and cudweed, but six or eight feet high; while Buttercups, Violets, Whortleberries, Sow-thistles, Chickweed, white and yellow Cruciferae, Plantain, and annual grasses everywhere abound. Where there are bushes and shrubs, the St. John's-wort and Honeysuckle grow abundantly, while the Imperial Cowslip only exhibits its elegant blossoms under the damp shade of the thickets.|$|E

This group demonstrate complex patterns of fusion among their floral organs including the staminodes. In <b>Zingiberaceae</b> and Costaceae the staminodes fuse to form a staminodial labellum which provides much of the floral display.
