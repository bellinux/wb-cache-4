5|$|In September 2006, the Government of Croatia {{formed a}} {{construction}} workgroup. It {{was decided that}} the project, estimated at the time at HRK 173 million (US$ 30 million), would be partially financed by the Government of Croatia and the City of <b>Zagreb,</b> and that both Jewish organizations should be represented in the workgroup. However, the involvement of Bet Israel was deemed unacceptable by the Jewish Community of <b>Zagreb,</b> which is the sole owner of the Praška Street property, and which also sees itself as the sole legal representative of the <b>Zagreb</b> Jewish community. As a consequence, the community and its president, Ognjen Kraus, refused further participation in the project under the set conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Jewish Community of <b>Zagreb</b> {{sought to}} legally reacquire its property. The Croatian denationalization law was enacted in 1996, and the Praška Street parcel was finally {{returned}} to the community on December 31, 1999.

The architecture competition was planned for 2005. However, a 2005 rift in the Jewish Community of <b>Zagreb</b> resulted in formation of a splinter Jewish community, Bet Israel, led by Ivo and Slavko Goldstein.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{counties}} were re-established in 1992, Croatia {{is divided into}} 20 counties and {{the capital city of}} <b>Zagreb,</b> the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of {{the counties}} changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities. Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) division of Croatia is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. The Northwest Croatia includes the city of <b>Zagreb,</b> <b>Zagreb,</b> Krapina-Zagorje, Varaždin, Koprivnica-Križevci and Međimurje counties, and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Virovitica-Podravina, Požega-Slavonia, Brod-Posavina, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Syrmia, Karlovac and Sisak-Moslavina counties. Individual counties and the city of <b>Zagreb</b> also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS Local administrative unit divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of <b>Zagreb</b> in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia.|$|E
