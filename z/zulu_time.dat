Initially, the narrative examines the need for <b>Zulu</b> (military) <b>time</b> at the level of organizational structure. This is followed by a portrayal of how, within that structure, temporal embodiment and inter-embodiment are learnt and habituated, via practices such as parade ground and weapon training drills. Next, those same temporal processes are focused upon in the context of operational (combat) patrolling, and their manifestation within the practices of formations and tactics are examined. The narrative then moves on to examine collective temporal perceptions troops construct, which are focused upon issues of danger, safety, and identity. The account concludes with a call for organizational time both civilian and military to be given much more attention by sociological researchers particularly at the level of embodied practices...|$|R

50|$|The {{separation}} of language services cleanly severed ethnicities from each other, {{but it also}} created a forum that documented the complexly layered Zulu identity developing within an ever shifting reality. Recordings in 1970 of traditional sounds like that of Ladysmith Black Mamabazo’s, an isicathamiya collective, first LP (Amabutho) at the SABC studios in Durban being contrasted {{with the use of}} multiple existing isiZulu dialects in the politically ignorant uBhekifa were the early signs of a dynamic culture; frozen in some aspects but fluid in others. Following the {{separation of}} stations into ethnicities, the content being broadcast exhibited more signs of a culture in a constant cycle of redefinition; both protecting and breeding extensions of this identity. Thokozani Nene’s use of language became a poster child for this process of renegotiation; resurrecting unused words of old alongside his own newly coined ones. Cyril Bongani ‘Kansas City’ Mchunu, who joined Radio Zulu as a disc jockey in the 1970s, reflected the multiple influences the traditional Zulu identity was grappling with, traversing lines of separation by nicknaming himself and signalling his presence on air through an American tune {{while at the same time}} using street lingo, original slang and other local languages like seSotho and English to create his uniquely blended style of announcing. Furthermore, his popularisation of call-in shows provided an open line of communication for Zulu persons across physically divided spaces; highlighting commonalities and exposing nuanced differences. The content of the radio dramas, however, were the most telling symbols of a nation at odds with its core values and customs. In May 1979, the airing of Abangane Ababi by Abigail Zondi followed the journey of a young woman moving between the city and ruralscape. The series raised questions about gender roles, taboo issues of divorce and out-the-box women and the situations and possible dangers specific to a female city populant. This engagement with contemporary-social was silver lined with throwbacks to female izibongo stylings, further expanding the knowledge archive in terms of feminine contributions to traditional arts. Kwaphambana izinkomishi, written by Maqhawe Mkhize in the 1970s, stirred the underbelly of the custom of polygamy and its real inspirations of evil and jealousy between wives, and allowed for a further exploration of a still largely untapped source of women’s oral poetry. Radio Zulu thus became a reflection of a nation lumped together by lineage circumstance collectively contributing to the creation of a choppy narrative of what it meant when one self-identified or was identified as <b>Zulu</b> in those <b>times.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Zulu {{identity}} {{appears to}} have enjoyed precedence over other polity identities in KwaZulu-Natal for what is largely viewed as time immemorial. Yet, a cursory glance at emergent literature on the Zulu and {{what has come to}} be called ‘Zuluness’,, the reification of this identity, reveals that in every instance, where the term ‘Zulu’ is perpetuated, as if an overarching singular socio-political entity, ethical questions emerge. In economic terms these questions become inflamed, particularly within Tourism related industries, where products and services are being sold as authentically ‘Zulu’, thereby negating other potential for varied brand offerings. Much of the body of literature on beadwork appears to be similarly ‘framed’, by this seemingly unopposed view of the Zulu. When juxtaposed against the dire poverty within the province, compounded through HIV/AIDS, and retail sites saturated with ‘Zulu’ product, such as beadwork, the value of brand diversification emerges. Based on this premise, this study examines how polity identity within the Zulu might translate into the alleviation of poverty through micro-economic approaches, by capitalising on visual anthropologies in the form of beadwork identity. To this end, this thesis examines if those, within one such polity, the Nyuswa at KwaNyuswa, in the region known as the ‘Valley of a Thousand Hills’, in KwaZulu-Natal, continue to maintain the use of this identity and elect to define that identity through a beadwork convention. Further, if such forms of denotation can serve as a basis for a departure from the existing position on beadwork and its relationship to the Zulu brand. This study, therefore examines the historical, political, cultural and socio-economic factors which have and continue to impact on the survival of the Nyuswa identity, from numerous theoretical perspectives. Methodologically this study draws on the training and experience of the researcher, as a visual communication design practitioner and educator, employing a reflexive ethnographic research framework through which to interpretivistically deepen understanding on beadwork conventions of the Nyuswa, in relation to other beadwork conventions within the Zulu. Drawing on qualitative data, gained through unstructured interviews and participant observation, by attending numerous traditional events, and in design- based engagements with three craft collectives - Sigaba Ngezandla, Simunye and Zamimpilo, in KwaNyuswa, and with Durban Beachfront Craft retailers and Rickshaw Pullers it discusses various prototype handbags, and Rickshaw cart and outfit designs, developed to test the value of beadwork denotation in serving micro-enterprise and polity-based brands. The findings of this study point to the value of polity-based branding and product development, but also represent the value of visual ethnographic analysis towards understanding the material culture of those from the Nyuswa, the extended Qadi, and the larger Ngcobo polity, many of whom elect to denotatively represent themselves through isijolovane, the beadwork convention said to look like “colorful ‘peas’ floating in a black ‘soup’ “. Examples of which were found across KZN province. These findings not only point to a new way in which oral records might be validated, through beadwork, but also serve to challenge the commonly heralded view, particularly in the Tourism sector, that the Zulu are a singular identity represented by a single beadwork convention known as isimodeni or the view, held by many scholars, that Zulu beadwork is simply comprised of a limited number styles, or as merely denoting large regions, in the KZN province. Instead the outcomes of this study represent a step towards a reconstituted perspective of beadwork as being a denotative tool for communicating polity allegiance and for representing the dispora of identities, within the <b>Zulu,</b> displaced through <b>time</b> and circumstance across South East Africa. These findings are underpinned through the analysis of secondary data, accessed in museums; in beadwork archives, across KwaZulu-Natal; online; and in relevant texts...|$|R

50|$|Locating {{the roots}} of digital {{performance}} practices {{can be traced back}} for many decades or even centuries. There are three main periods that can be highlighted in the history of multi - media performance; Futurism during the 1910s, mixed media performance during the 1960s and experimentation with a performance and the computer during the 1990s. Both during the eras of Futurism and the experimentation with computer incorporated within performance, they are both greatly inspired by the development of new and existing technology. Researching back, digital performance practices have experimented with numerous of the different avant - garde movements which can date right back from the early twentieth century, some of these movements can include the likes of Bauhaus, Dada, Surrealism and many more. It could be said that digital performance can be linked to the aesthetics, philosophies and practices of the futurist movement. One of the main links that has been found which can connect futurism to digital performance was {{with the use of the}} ‘machine’ which was used in the set of Robert Lepage’s <b>Zulu</b> <b>Time</b> (1999).
