Because of this, the Witten index is independent of the temperature and gives the number of <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> bosonic vacuum states minus the number of <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> fermionic vacuum states. In particular, if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken then there are no <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> ground states and so the Witten index is equal to zero.|$|R

40|$|Random Dirac fermions in a {{two-dimensional}} space are studied numerically. We realize {{them on a}} square lattice using the π-flux model with random hopping. The system preserves two symmetries, the time-reversal symmetry and the symmetry denoted by H,γ= 0 with a 4 × 4 matrix γ in an effective field theory. Although {{it belongs to the}} orthogonal ensemble, the zero-energy states do not localize and become critical. The density of states vanishes at <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> as ∼ E^α and the exponent α changes with strength of the randomness, which implies the existence of the critical line. Rapid growth of the localization length near <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> is suggested and the eigenstates near <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> exhibit anomalous behaviour which can be interpreted as a critical slowing down in the available finite-size system. The level-spacing distributions close to <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> deviate from both the Wigner surmise and the Poissonian, and exhibit critical behaviour which reflects the existence of critical states at <b>zero</b> <b>energy.</b> Comment: latex 209, REVTEX, 6 figure...|$|R
