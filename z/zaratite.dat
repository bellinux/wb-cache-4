50|$|<b>Zaratite</b> is {{a bright}} emerald green and {{questionable}} nickel carbonate mineral with formula Ni3CO3(O H)4·4 H2O. <b>Zaratite</b> crystallizes in the isometric crystal system as massive to mammillary encrustations and vein fillings. It has a specific gravity of 2.6 and a Mohs hardness of 3 to 3.5. It has no cleavage and is brittle to conchoidal fracture. The luster is vitreous to greasy.|$|E

5000|$|Nickel {{carbonate}} NiCO3•6H2O, hellyerite, crystallising {{with six}} water molecules, precipitates when an alkali bicarbonate {{is added to}} a Ni aqueous solution. Basic nickel carbonate, <b>zaratite,</b> with the formula Ni4CO3(OH)6(H2O)4, is produced when alkali carbonates are added to a nickel solution. Nickel phosphate, Ni3(PO4)2•7H2O is also insoluble. A number of other phosphates have been made, including nanoporous substances resembling zeolites named with [...] "Versailles Santa Barbara" [...] or VSB. The nanoporous nickel phosphates can accommodate sufficiently small molecules and selectively catalyse reactions on them. A nickel arsenate, Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O occurs as the mineral annabergite.|$|E
40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{combined with}} infrared spectroscopy {{has been used}} to study the minerals, nullaginite and <b>zaratite.</b> Raman bands are observed at 3650, 3556 and 3309 cm- 1 for nullaginite and 3609, 3516 and 3336 cm- 1 for zaraitite. By using a Libowitzky type empirical function estimation of the hydrogen bond distances of the OH and water units has been made and values vary from 0. 268 nm to 0. 332 nm. Hydrogen bond distances of OH units are less than for water units. The observation of multiple asymmetric stretching and bending modes for nullaginite suggests the carbonate is strongly distorted in contrast to <b>zaratite</b> for which only single bands are found. Raman bands at around 935 and 980 cm- 1 are assigned to OH deformation modes...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Nickel {{carbonate}} {{occurs in}} {{nature as a}} hexahydrate (hellyerite) and as a hydroxyhydrate (<b>zaratite),</b> but the anhydrous pecies is only known as an artificial product. All of the compounds show anomalous properties {{that have led to}} confusion in the literature. Only the calcite structure was found for NiCOs; hydrothermal conditions appear to be essential for its synthesis, and a variation in cell size was found with changes in duration or temperature of synthesis, or both. Hellyerite probably is [Ni(H~O) 61 COs, which would explain its ease of decompo-sition and rarity in nature. <b>Zaratite</b> is not a single mineral, but a composite of amorphous and fibrous components. The conditions under which NiCOa might be expected to occur are discussed. Nickel bicarbonate formed in the reactions to produce NiCOs; its X-ray diffraction pattern, indicating cubic symmetry, analysis, and optical properties are given. The behaviour of nickel in these compounds i best explained in terms of crystal field theory...|$|E
40|$|RECENT {{investigation}} of samples labelled zara-tite from the Lord Brassey Mine, near Heazle-wood, Tasmania, in the mineral {{collection of the}} Museum of Victoria revealed {{the presence of the}} rare nickel carbonate, otwayite, and the rare nickel hydroxide, theophrastite. X-ray diffrac-tion, electron microprobe and infrared analysis were utilised in the study, which failed to confirm the presence of <b>zaratite.</b> The Lord Brassey Mine is situated near the summit of Mt. Grey, 1. 5 km northeast of the Waratah-Corinna Road bridge over the Heazle-wood River, in western Tasmania. The mine is the type locality for two nickel-bearing minerals, heazlewoodite (Petterd, 1910; Peacock, 1947) and hellyerite (Williams et al., 1959). The nickel ore occurs as narrow veins within a body of serpentinite 4 km long and 800 m wide, forming part of a large Cambrian ultrabasic complex consisting of pyroxenites and peridotites (Williams, 1958). The main ore consists of heazlewoodite with minor pentlandite and miller-ite generally intergrown with magnetite. In shear planes and fracture fillings a waxy, translucent, emerald-green amorphous mineral referred to as <b>zaratite</b> by Williams (1958) has been deposited along with thin coatings of pale blue hellyerite. Given that the secondary nickel carbonates and hydroxides from Lord Brassey Mine transect massive magnetite and serpentine minerals, and given their associations in other deposits, it is most likely that they precipitated from meteoric fluids which permeated the nickel sulphide ore-body via shear planes and fractures. Otwayite Otwayite is an orthorhombic nickel carbonate thus far recorded only from the Otway nickel prospect in the Nullagine region of Western Australia (Nickel et al., 1977). A sheared ultra-mafic body contains otwayite as fibrous, late-stage infillings of narrow veinlets 0. 5 -I mm in width, which transect massive serpentine, millerite, polydymite and apatite. Associated with the otwayite in veinlets are magnesite, gaspeite and pecoraite, with paraotwayite occurring in separ-ate veins from otwayite (Nickel and Graham...|$|E
40|$|Four nickel carbonate-bearing {{minerals}} from Australia {{have been}} investigated to study the effect of Ni for Mg substitution. The spectra of nullaginite, <b>zaratite,</b> widgiemoolthalite and takovite show three main features {{in the range of}} 26, 720 – 25, 855 cm− 1 (ν 1 -band), 15, 230 – 14, 740 cm− 1 (ν 2 -band) and 9, 200 – 9, 145 cm− 1 (ν 3 -band) which are characteristic of divalent nickel in six-fold coordination. The Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) of Ni 2 + in the four carbonates is calculated from the observed 3 A 2 g(3 F) → 3 T 2 g(3 F) transition. CFSE is dependent on mineralogy, crystallinity and chemical composition (Al/Mg-content). The splitting of the ν 1 - and ν 3 -bands and non-Gaussian shape of ν 3 -band in the minerals are the effects of Ni-site distortion from regular octahedral. The effect of structural cation substitutions (Mg 2 +, Ni 2 +, Fe 2 + and trivalent cations, Al 3 +, Fe 3 +) in the carbonate minerals is noticed on band shifts. Thus, electronic bands in the UV–Vis–NIR spectra and the overtones and combination bands of OH and carbonate ion in NIR show shifts to higher wavenumbers, particularly for widgiemoolthalite and takovite...|$|E
