40|$|In this paper, the {{modeling}} of boundary conditions for an imperfectly clamped circular plate is discussed. This model is derived {{under the assumption}} that there is some variation in both the boundary displacement and slope when the plate oscillates.

The well-posedness of the model is demonstrated and appropriate approximation techniques are outlined. Finally, under natural assumptions for this model and approximation scheme, results leading to parameter convergence are given. 1 Introduction An important consideration in {{the modeling}} of structural and structural acoustic systems involves the determination of appropriate boundary conditions for the vibrating structure.

The procedure is repeated until the traction continuity conditions are also satisfied on the virtual boundaries. The membrane problem in each subdomain is solved using the Analog Equation Method (AEM).

5000|$|As {{an example}} of the second type, a {{standing}} wave in a transmission line is a wave in which the distribution of current, voltage, or field strength is formed by the superposition of two waves of the same frequency propagating in opposite directions. The effect is a series of nodes (<b>zero</b> <b>displacement)</b> and anti-nodes (maximum displacement) at fixed points along the transmission line. Such a standing wave may be formed when a wave is transmitted into one end of a transmission line and is reflected from the other end by an impedance mismatch, i.e., discontinuity, such as an [...] or a short. [...] The failure of the line to transfer power at the standing wave frequency will usually result in attenuation distortion.|$|E

The decaying vehicle speed (kinetic energy), the rising tank pressure and the desired rate of deceleration determined by the driver all are variables which are easily managed by the Hydristor system. The stored braking energy can then be re-used for subsequent re-acceleration. With hydraulic storage capability, the acceleration at highway speeds can result in wheel spin.|$|E

By introducing the unit pulse functions and Dirac functions, the clamped edge can be made equivalent to the simply supported one by adding the unknown horizontal reactions. According to the governing equations of the plane stress problem, the general expressions of displacements, which satisfy the governing differential equations and the boundary conditions at two ends of the beam, can be deduced. The unknown coefficients in the general expressions are then determined by using Fourier sinusoidal series expansion along {{the upper and lower}} boundaries of the beams and using the condition of <b>zero</b> <b>displacements</b> at the clamped edge. The solution obtained has excellent convergence properties.

5000|$|When {{drawing the}} {{conjugate}} beam {{it is important}} that the shear and moment developed at the supports of the conjugate beam account for the corresponding slope and displacement of the real beam at its supports, a consequence of Theorems 1 and 2. For example, as shown below, a pin or roller support at the end of the real beam provides <b>zero</b> <b>displacement,</b> but a non zero slope. Consequently, from Theorems 1 and 2, the conjugate beam must be supported by a pin or a roller, since this support has zero moment but has a shear or end reaction. When the real beam is fixed supported, both the slope and displacement are zero. Here the conjugate beam has a free end, since at this end there is zero shear and zero moment. Corresponding real and conjugate supports are shown below. Note that, as a rule, neglecting axial forces, statically determinate real beams have statically determinate conjugate beams; and statically indeterminate real beams have unstable conjugate beams.

The basic one is based on pruning the least significant terms in the different system function coefficients. This may yield important errors in pole and zero locations.

40|$|Abstract. Piezoelectric {{transducers}} {{have been}} used extensively as the distributed actuators and sensors in active control of structural vibrations. Piezoelectric actuator/sensors are distributively bonded on or embedded in the host structure and have the inherent advantage of integrating over their surface area, which leads to potentially more robust implementations as compared to implementations that use shaker/accelerometers. For this reason piezoelectric actuator/sensors have attracted more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, a theoretical analysis is presented of the active control of a vibrating beam using collocated triangular and rectangular piezoelectric actuator/sensor pairs. The {{aim of this study}} is to generate points of <b>zero</b> <b>displacements</b> and <b>zero</b> slopes at any designated position. So the control systems impose a virtual clamped boundary condition at the control position on the beam, in which both displacement and slope are driven to zero. Two independent single-input single-output (SISO) control systems similar to direct velocity feedback (DVFB) are implemented, i. e. for the rectangular pair the voltage signal measured by a triangular piezoelectric sensor is electronically multiplied by a fixed gain and fed directly back to a collocated piezoelectric actuator.
