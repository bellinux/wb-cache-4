25|$|New York Jets scout Terry Bradway was {{impressed}} by Revis' workout but was concerned by the level of competition Pittsburgh played, as Louisville's Mario Urrutia was the toughest receiver Revis faced during the season. Despite this concern, the organization was so impressed by his man and <b>zone</b> <b>coverage</b> techniques {{and his ability to}} play the run that they decided to trade up for him in the draft. Originally, New York discussed trading draft selections with the Houston Texans who had the 10th overall pick however, when the deal fell through, they traded their first, second and fifth round picks to the Carolina Panthers, moving from 25th overall to 14th overall, to select Revis.|$|E
2500|$|After an off-week, Michigan Tech {{traveled}} to Alaska–Anchorage for games on November18 and 19. Junior defenseman Carl Nielsen stayed home {{to recover from}} a concussion sustained in the team's previous game, and with three freshmen defensemen in the lineup, Pearson stressed defensive <b>zone</b> <b>coverage</b> in practice sessions before the series. Kevin Genoe started at goaltender in the Friday game and gave up one goal in each period. Sophomore defenseman Bradley Stebner scored his first collegiate goal, and the Huskies' only goal of the game, on a 4-on-3 attack late in the second period. Five or six of the 19 shots generated by Michigan Tech were [...] "quality chances" [...] according to Alaska–Anchorage coach Dave Shyiak, and Seawolves defenseman Corbin Karl said it was [...] "the most complete game" [...] his team had played to that point in the season. In the Saturday game, Josh Robinson started at goaltender and earned his second shutout of the season while stopping 23shots. On the offensive side, the Huskies capitalized on numerous defensive mistakes by the Seawolves. Blake Pietila scored after Michigan Tech forced a turnover inside the Alaska–Anchorage zone. Jordan Baker was left undefended and scored on a rebound. Ryan Furne was similarly left alone {{in front of the}} goal before he scored. Milos Gordic and Jacob Johnstone also scored for the Huskies in their 5–0 win.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regular season}} opened on October7 with a two-game series against visiting American International. Pearson sought {{to improve the}} team's {{defensive}} <b>zone</b> <b>coverage</b> in practices before the series, but starting goaltender Kevin Genoe gave up three goals {{in the first period}} while his Yellow Jackets counterpart, Ben Meisner, stopped all eight Huskies shots. The Huskies' comeback began late in the second period when Blake Pietila's pass deflected off a defender's skate past Meisner. In the third period, goals from Pietila, Steven Seigo and Jordan Baker completed Michigan Tech's 5–3 comeback win. Genoe stopped all 14shots he faced in the final two periods. In the following night's rematch, Robinson started at goaltender and the Huskies scored first after Riley Sweeney's pass sent Brett Olson on a shorthanded breakaway and Meisner failed to stop Olson's high shot. The Yellow Jackets, however, tied the game 31seconds later while the Huskies were still shorthanded. Pearson had inserted Mikael Lickteig in the lineup for this game, hoping his speed would be beneficial, and it paid off when Lickteig created a scoring chance for himself that Meisner stopped, but Jacob Johnstone scored on the rebound. In the second period, Johnstone found a loose puck immediately in front of Meisner and made [...] "three quick stick-handling moves for a highlight-reel goal", and the Huskies won 3–1. Robinson stopped 32 of 33shots, and Pearson called him [...] "the difference in the game". The series sweep was the Huskies' first since December19–20, 2008, against Northern Michigan. Pietila was named Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) Rookie of the Week for his two-goal performance in the series' first game.|$|E
