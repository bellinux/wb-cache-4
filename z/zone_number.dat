25|$|TransLink {{offers a}} {{contactless}} fare payment card called go card. It requires passengers {{to touch the}} card on a card reader at the start and end of each journey, and when transferring between services. The fare is automatically calculated based on {{the difference between the}} highest <b>zone</b> <b>number</b> and the lowest <b>zone</b> <b>number</b> recorded for the journey. A journey can comprise any number of individual legs (each recorded by touching the card when entering or leaving a service) within a two-hour period. The fare is automatically deducted from a pre-paid balance associated with the go card used.|$|E

The Albany Port Customs District includes all of the following counties: Albany, Columbia, Delaware, Fulton, Greene, Montgomery, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Warren, and Washington; along with the parts of Dutchess, Sullivan, and Ulster counties north of 41°42'N.latitude.

2500|$|The {{development}} of postal codes reflects the increasing complexity of postal delivery as populations grew and {{the built environment}} became more complex. This happened first in large cities. Postal codes began with postal district <b>numbers</b> (or postal <b>zone</b> <b>numbers)</b> within large cities. London was first subdivided into 10 districts in 1857, and Liverpool in 1864. By World War I, such postal district or <b>zone</b> <b>numbers</b> existed in various large European cities. They existed in the United States at least {{as early as the}} 1920s, possibly implemented at the local post office level only (for example, instances of [...] "Boston 9, Mass" [...] in 1920 are attested,) although they were evidently not used throughout all major US cities (implemented USPOD-wide) until World War II.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925, the Post Office divided Toronto into ten postal zones (...) , in {{an effort}} to {{facilitated}} mail sorting in an era before postal codes. There was no obligation to use the <b>zone</b> <b>numbers,</b> and were originally not widely adopted. After the Second World War, the <b>zone</b> <b>numbers</b> did begin to be used extensively. The postal districts became one of the primary ways of dividing up the city. Residents frequently described themselves as living in Toronto 2 or Toronto 10. The system was retained until 1971, with gradual modification. New zones were added as the city expanded outwards and downtown zones were subdivided as the number of homes and businesses in the core increased. By 1966, the urban areas of the city were covered by 19 zones, while more distant areas had one-letter codes, such as R for Rexdale and W for Willowdale.|$|R

2500|$|The MBTA Commuter Rail uses a {{fare zone}} policy whereby origin and {{destination}} stations are not individually priced, but assigned a zone based on distance from Boston. There are a total of eleven zones (1A, then 1 through 10) with an increasing fare to or from Boston the higher the <b>zone</b> <b>number.</b> Zone 1A fares are the least expensive and cost the same as rapid transit ($2.25), while the highest priced Zone 10 fares are $12.50 per ride. Travel between suburban zones without going to Boston is charged an [...] "interzone" [...] fare {{based on the number}} of zones traveled. Seniors, those with a disability, and middle and high school students with proper identification receive a 50% discounted rate; children under eleven travel free with a paying adult.

40|$|Stress {{affects a}} number of animals and is a {{survival}} mechanism. During stress, changes in the animal’s physiological mechanisms and changes in behavioural reactions will happen. This study evaluates four different stressors that can occur in a chicken’s life. The four stressors are fixation, social isolation, predation and transport. 40 White Leghorn chicken from age sex to seven weeks {{were used in the}} study. An open-field test was used to evaluate the stressors. The open-field test registered time for ambulation, time for first change of <b>zones,</b> <b>number</b> of <b>zones</b> used and <b>number</b> of registrations in central zones. The chicken was expected to ambulate in the open-field arena since chickens are curious but the activity was expected to be different depending on which stressor the chicken was exposed to. Previous studies have shown that more stressed birds are less active in an open-field test than birds that are not stressed. A control group was included in the study and this group was not exposed to a stressor. The results did not show any significant dereferences between time for the first change of <b>zones,</b> <b>number</b> of <b>zones</b> used and <b>number</b> of registrations in central zones. However, there was a tendency for a significant difference in time to first ambulation. The results suggested that the control group and the group that was exposed to social isolation displayed most stress-related behaviour. Least stressed was the predation group and the transport group...|$|R
