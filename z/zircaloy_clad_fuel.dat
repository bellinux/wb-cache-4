As part of this process, two waste streams will be consolidated into waste forms; one will be a mineral and the other a metal alloy. The metal waste form is an alloy that contains cladding hulls, ``noble`` metal fission products, and Zr from alloy fuels. The nominal composition of the metal waste form alloys are stainless steel- 15 wt. % Zr (SS- 15 Zr) for stainless steel clad fuel and Zircaloy- 8 wt. % stainless steel (Zr- 8 SS) for <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel,</b> with both alloys also containing up to 4 wt. % noble metal fission products.

40|$|The {{long and}} short term {{behavior}} of light water reactor stainless steel clad fuel has been investigated {{in order to establish}} more adequate or applicable operation/design criteria. The performance record of stainless steel clad fuel used in both the Connecticut Yankee and San Onofre 1 power stations has remained essentially unmarred until the recent past. While the San Onofre 1 plant has maintained this record, the Connecticut Yankee station has experienced a number of fuel element failures since 1977. Consequently, emphasis has been placed on cladding behavior for anomalous operation experienced by the Connecticut Yankee reactor prior to its first observed coolant activity increase. In order to predict cladding behavior, a fuel performance code (STRESS) has been developed with the capabilities of analyzing long term cladding creepdown behavior, cladding conditioning, and behavior during up-power ramping and power maneuvers. The effects of varied fill gas pressure and cladding creep rate on the stress/deformation behavior of stainless steel cladding for these performance areas have been investigated. Similar calculations are also performed for <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> so that a comparison can be made between these materials. Code limitations are discussed and some methods which compensate for insufficient modeling are reviewed. Fuel element design and reactor operation recommendations are made for Connecticut Yankee (and San Onofre 1) stainless steel clad fuel. These include fill gas pressurization level, up-power ramp rate limitations, and possible cladding material preference. These recommendations are {{based on the results of}} the STRESS code and the trends which may be inferred from them...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to describe the condition of commercial <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> as it is received at the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) site. Most commercial nuclear fuel is encased in Zircaloy cladding. This analysis is developed to describe cladding degradation from the expected failure modes. This includes reactor operation impacts including incipient failures, potential degradation after reactor operation during spent fuel storage in pool and dry storage and impacts due to transportation. Degradation modes include cladding creep, and delayed hydride cracking during dry storage and transportation. Mechanical stresses from fuel handling and transportation vibrations are also included. This Analysis and Model Report (AMR) does not address any potential damage to assemblies that might occur at the YMP surface facilities. Ranges and uncertainties have been defined. This analysis will be the initial boundary condition {{for the analysis of}} cladding degradation inside the repository. In accordance with AP- 2. 13 Q, ''Technical Product Development Planning'', a work plan (CRWMS M&O 2000 c) was developed, issued, and utilized in the preparation of this document. There are constraints, caveats and limitations to this analysis. This cladding degradation analysis is based on commercial Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel with Zircaloy cladding but is applicable to Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) fuel. Reactor operating experience for both PWRs and BWRs is used to establish fuel reliability from reactor operation. It is limited to fuel exposed to normal operation and anticipated operational occurrences (i. e. events which are anticipated to occur within a reactor lifetime), and not to fuel that has been exposed to severe accidents. Fuel burnup projections have been limited to the current commercial reactor licensing environment with restrictions on fuel enrichment, oxide coating thickness and rod plenum pressures. The information provided in this analysis will be used in evaluating the post-closure performance of the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) in relation to waste form degradation...|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen is {{contained}} in the <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> of spent <b>fuel</b> rods from nuclear reactors. All the spent fuel rods placed in a nuclear waste repository will have a temperature history that decreases toward ambient; and as a result, most all of the hydrogen in the Zircaloy will eventually precipitate as zirconium hydride platelets. A model for the density of hydride platelets is a necessary sub-part for predicting <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> failure rate in a nuclear waste repository. A model is developed to describe statistically the hydride platelet density, and the density function includes the orientation as a physical attribute. The model applies concepts from statistical mechanics to derive probable deformation and thermodynamic functionals for cladding material response that depend explicitly on the hydride platelet density function. From this model, hydride precipitation kinetics depend on a thermodynamic potential for hydride density change and on the inner product of a stress tensor and a tensor measure for the incremental volume change due to hydride platelets.

40|$|International audienceIn {{a nuclear}} power plant, a {{potential}} risk in some low probability situations in severe accidents is air ingress into the vessel. Air is a highly oxidizing atmosphere {{that can lead to}} an enhanced core oxidation and degradation affecting the release of Fission Products (FP), especially increasing that of ruthenium. This FP is of particular importance because of its high radio-toxicity and its ability to form highly volatile oxides. Oxygen affinity is decreasing between <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>cladding,</b> <b>fuel</b> and ruthenium inclusions in the fuel. It is consequently of great need to understand the phenomena governing cladding oxidation by air as a prerequisite for the source term issues. A review of existing data in the field of Zircaloy- 4 oxidation in air-containing atmosphere shows that this phenomenon is quantitatively well understood. The cladding oxidation process can be divided into two kinetic regimes separated by a breakaway transition. Before transition, a protective dense zirconia scale grows following a solid state diffusion-limited regime for which experimental data are well fitted by a parabolic time dependence. For a given thickness, which depends mainly on temperature and the extent of pre-oxidation in steam, the dense scale can potentially breakdown. In case of breakaway combined with oxygen starvation, cladding oxidation can then be much faster because of the combined action of oxygen and nitrogen through a complex self sustaining nitriding-oxidation process. A review of the pre-existing correlations used to simulate zirconia scale growth under air atmospheres shows a high degree of variation from parabolic to accelerated time dependence. Variations also exist in the choice of the breakaway parameter based on zirconia phase change or oxide thickness. Several correlations and breakaway parameters found in the literature were implemented in the MAAP 4. 07 Severe Accident code. They were assessed by simulation of the QUENCH- 10 test, which is a semi-integral test designed to study fuel bundle exposure to steam first and then to air.

40|$|Corrosion is a {{major issue}} in {{applications}} involving materials in normal and severe environments, especially when it involves corrosive fluids, high temperatures, and radiation. Left unaddressed, corrosion can lead to catastrophic failures, resulting in economic and environmental liabilities. In nuclear applications, where metals and alloys, such as steel and zirconium, are extensively em- ployed inside and outside of the nuclear reactor, corrosion accelerated by high temperatures, neu- tron radiation, and corrosive atmospheres, corrosion becomes even more concerning. The objec- tives of this research are to study and develop surface modification techniques to protect zirconium cladding by the incorporation of a specific barrier coating, and to understand the issues related to the compatibility of the coatings examined in this work.

30|$|Here, {{we propose}} a {{mechanism}} on the morphology evolution of anodic oxide layer to porous or tubular structure and experimentally demonstrate that nanoporous or nanotubular oxide layer can be controllably and selectively fabricated by anodization of zirconium alloys, or zircaloy. The reason behind using zircaloy {{in the present}} experiments is to apply this anodization technique to improve {{the safety of a}} nuclear power plant under severe accidental conditions. In fact, zircaloy is the most widely used nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>cladding</b> material in nuclear reactors. When zircaloy comes in contact with high-temperature steam, the zircaloy metal atoms become oxidized from the presence of oxygen molecules in steam. As a result, hydrogen gas is formed from water molecules that have lost the oxygen atoms. If an excessive amount of hydrogen gas is produced, explosion, similar to the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident [32], could occur. However, we suggest that the hydrogen production rate can be dramatically reduced if nanoporous oxide layer is preformed on the <b>zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> through anodization. Since zircaloy surface is pre-oxidized through anodization, the oxide layer hinders further oxidation of the <b>zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> even though the cladding contacts with steam, thereby preventing hydrogen production due to water splitting. However, for this purpose, the oxide layer prepared on a <b>zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> should not have a nanotubular but a nanoporous morphology because nanotubular oxide layer having many gaps and cracks cannot protect the interaction of steam with zircaloy base metal. Therefore, for the application to nuclear reactors, nanoporous oxide structures without gaps and cracks are to be fabricated on the surface of <b>zircaloy</b> <b>cladding.</b>|$|R

The gas-cooled reactors developed in England use metallic uranium enclosed in a thin layer of Magnox.

The vast majority of the remaining power reactors in the world use uranium dioxide pellets in <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> as the <b>fuel</b> material. Reactors that are fueled with uranium dioxide generally use water as the moderator. If ordinary water is used, the reactors are called Light Water Reactors (LWR), while if water enriched in the deuterium isotope of hydrogen is used, the reactors are called Heavy Water reactors. The LWRs can be either pressurized reactors (PWR) or boiling water reactors (BWR). Both of these reactor types use uranium that has been enriched in the 235 isotope to about 3. 5 to 4 % total abundance. There may be minor differences in the details of the spent fuel characteristics for PWRs and BWRs, but for simplicity we will not consider these second-order effects. The Canadian designed reactor (CANDU) that is moderated by heavy water uses natural uranium without enrichment of the 235 isotope as the fuel.

5000|$|However, the {{containment}} building does not protect the fuel {{during the whole}} fuel cycle. Most importantly, the spent fuel resides {{long periods of time}} outside the primary containment. A typical spent fuel storage pool can hold roughly five times the fuel in the core. Since reloads typically discharge one third of a core, much of the spent fuel stored in the pool will have had considerable decay time. But if the pool were to be drained of water, the discharged fuel from the previous two refuelings would still be [...] "fresh" [...] enough to melt under decay heat. However, the <b>zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> of this <b>fuel</b> could be ignited during the heatup. The resulting fire would probably spread to most or all of the fuel in the pool.

Moreover, if the fire becomes oxygen-starved (quite probable for a fire located {{in the bottom of a}} pit such as this), the hot zirconium would rob oxygen from the uranium dioxide fuel, forming a liquid mixture of metallic uranium, zirconium, oxidized zirconium, and dissolved uranium dioxide. This would cause a release of fission products from the fuel matrix quite comparable to that of molten fuel. In addition, although confined, BWR spent fuel pools are almost always located outside of the primary containment. Generation of hydrogen during the process would probably result in an explosion, damaging the secondary containment building. Thus, release to the atmosphere is more likely than for comparable accidents involving the reactor core.|$|R

The subcodes described in this section are for melting temperature (ZOPRP), specific heat capacity (ZOCP), enthalpy (ZONTHL), thermal conductivity (ZOTCON), thermal expansion (ZOTEXP), density (ZODEN), emissivity (ZOEMIS), elastic moduli (ZOEMOD, ZOPOIR), and mechanical limits and embrittlement (ZORUP). 5. 1 Melting and Phase Transformation Temperatures (ZOPRP) The subcode ZOPRP calculates the transition temperatures between the monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic, and liquid phases of zircaloy oxide. The oxygen-to-metal ratio of the oxide is the only required input to the subroutine. The monoclinic-to-tetragonal and tetragonal-to-cubic transition temperatures are constants that have been reported for ZrO 2 (1, 478 and 2, 558 K, respectively). 5 " 1 - 1 These temperatures are assumed to apply to zircaloy oxide, {{in spite of the}} fact that the oxide is slightly substoichiometric and may be under stress. 5. 1. 1 Model Development Since atomic fraction oxygen in the zircaloy oxide compound is used as a basis to determine the solidus (appearance of the first liquid phase) and the liquidus (melting of the last solid phase) temperatures of the zircaloy oxide, the input oxygen-to-metal ratio is converted to atomic fraction using the following relationship...|$|R
40|$|Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) {{reprocessing}} is due {{to cease}} in the UK in 2018 and a new interim storage method may be required if {{it is found that}} pond storage is not viable beyond the 25 year period which is currently understood to be safe. Dry storage has been used elsewhere in the world for <b>Zircaloy</b> and aluminium <b>clad</b> <b>fuel</b> and has been proposed for use in the UK, however since the UK’s fuel is predominantly stainless steel (SS) clad, testing will need to be carried out to ensure that drying methods are suitable. This will require representative samples for macro scale drying tests. To date little long term stored fuel has been examined. As a result, work has been carried out to try and ascertain whether the corrosion associated with long term storage leads to significant bound water and whether through wall cracks can be formed in intact lengths of SS tube. It was found that unlike an aluminium simulant, corroded SS showed no sign of water loss as a result of oxide dehydration during controlled drying by thermogravimetric analysis, and consequently bound water could be disregarded. It was also found that through wall cracks could be produced in an intact length of SS tube which would be suitable for macro scale drying tests. Some initial macro scale drying tests have been carried out using an alternative test piece with preformed cracks, and three distinct drying regimes to complete drying have been detected...|$|R
25|$|The Chernobyl corium is {{composed}} of the reactor uranium dioxide <b>fuel,</b> its <b>zircaloy</b> <b>cladding,</b> molten concrete, and decomposed and molten serpentinite packed around the reactor as its thermal insulation. Analysis {{has shown that the}} corium was heated to at most 2255°C, and remained above 1660°C for at least 4 days.|$|R
50|$|Silicon carbide {{composite}} material {{has been investigated}} {{for use as a}} replacement for <b>Zircaloy</b> <b>cladding</b> in light water reactors. The composite consists of SiC fibers wrapped around a SiC inner layer and surrounded by an SiC outer layer. Problems have been reported with the ability to join the pieces of the SiC composite.|$|R
