The follow-up to <b>Zero</b> <b>Minus</b> Ten, the novelization to Tomorrow Never Dies has Bond switching to the Walther P99. This remains Bond's main weapon throughout Benson's novels.

5000|$|Back from a {{successful}} tour in South America, Petrolini {{was hired in}} 1910 by Giuseppe Jovinelli for his theater in Piazza Guglielmo Pepe that had opened in 1909 with a performance by Raffaele Viviani. It was a great success and, after two seasons at the Teatro Jovinelli, the [...] "Sala Umberto" [...] company signed an exclusive three-year contract with him. In 1915, he formed his stage company, the Compagnia dei grandi spettacoli di varietà Petrolini, with whom he staged the revue <b>Zero</b> <b>minus</b> zero, {{that led to the}} debut of one of Petrolinis most famous characters, Fortunello, which was based upon a cartoon character. The performance aroused the enthusiasm of Futurists such as Filippo Tommaso Marinetti who called Fortunello [...] "the most difficult to analyze of all Petrolinis masterpieces." [...] Petrolini was so flattered by the admiration of the Futurists that he participated in some of their public events performing texts of Marinetti, Bruno Corra and Emilio Settimelli. The collaboration culminated in Radioscopia di un duetto ("Radioscopy of a duet"), a one-act play co-written with the Futurist writer and painter Francesco Cangiullo in 1918. The following year, Mario Bonnard directed a film based on the play, Mentre il pubblico ride ("While the audience laughs"), starring Petrolini (in his film debut) and Niny Dinelli. Petrolini developed an anti-Dannunzian position, something which was appreciated by the Futurists, and thus he put on exhibit during his variety sketches.From the 1920s, Petrolinis repertoire was enriched with a series of plays by Italian authors such as Alfredo Testoni, Renato Simoni, Roberto Bracco, Luigi Antonelli, Ugo Ojetti, Salvatore Gotta, Fausto Maria Martini, adapted by Petrolini himself. In 1925, he took his stage adaptation of Luigi Pirandellos Lumie di Sicilia, called Agro de limone. In the 1920s, he also met Elma Criner, who became his companion and later his wife. In 1930, with the advent of sound films, Petrolini returned to the cinema as a protagonist of Nerone by Alessandro Blasetti, and also featuring Criner in the part of Poppea. The film featured some of Petrolinis most famous interpretations: Gastone, Nerone, Pulcinella. The same year he starred in Cortile by Carlo Campogalliani, based on the play of the same name by Fausto Maria Martini. The following year he starred in Il Medico per forza, again directed by Campogalliani. In Scenarios July 1934 issue, Petrolini has 94 close-ups, in a variety of poses, expressions, and emotional interpretations.|$|E

40|$|When two random {{variables}} are both additive or multiplicative, {{the effect of}} the way one "slices" the available period to subperiods (time intervals) is well documented in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the time interval effect when one of the variables is additive and one is multiplicative. We prove that the squared multiperiod correlation coefficient (ρ 2 n) decreases monotonically as n increases, and approaches zero when n goes to infinity. However, for relevant data corresponding to the U. S. stock market index, when shifting from weekly parameters to quarterly parameters the decrease in ρ 2 n is negligible. The effect on the regression coefficient is much more dramatic and even a shift from weekly data to quarterly data affects the regression coefficient substantially. The regression slope generally approaches <b>zero,</b> <b>minus</b> infinity or plus infinity, as the number of periods increases. Montonicity, however, exists only in certain cases.

40|$|Note {{that half}} 1 calls half 2 and vice versa. This {{is an example}} of {{so-called}} mutual recursion. This can be modeled by one function half 12 returning a pair such that half 12 (x) =〈half 1 (x),half 2 (x) 〉. half 12 0 = 〈 0, 0 〉 half 12 (s(x)) = 〈snd(half 12 (x)), s(fst(half 12 (x))) half x = fst(half x) In our notation this becomes half 12 = λx ∈ nat. rec x of h(0) ⇒〈 0, 0 〉 | h(s(x ′)) ⇒〈snd(h(x)), s(fst(h(x))) half = λx ∈ nat. fst(half 12 x) As a last example in the section, consider the subtraction function which cuts off at <b>zero.</b> <b>minus</b> 0 y = 0 minus (s(x ′)) 0 = s(x ′) minus (s(x ′)) (s(y ′)) = minus x ′ y ′ To be presented in the schema of primitive recursion, this requires two nested case distinctions: the outermost one on the first argument x, the innermost one on the second argument y. So the result of the first application of minus must be function, which is directly represented in the definition below. minus = λx ∈ nat. rec x of m(0) ⇒ λy ∈ nat. 0 | m(s(x ′)) ⇒ λy ∈ nat. rec y of p(0) ⇒ s(x ′) | p(s(y ′)) ⇒ (m(x ′)) y ′ Note that m is correctly applied only to x ′, while p is not used at all. So the inner recursion could have been written as a case-expression instead. Functions defined by primitive recursion terminate. This is because the behavior of the function on s(n) is defined in terms of the behavior on n. Wecan therefore count down to 0, in which case no recursive call is allowed. An alternative approach is to take case as primitive and allow arbitrary recursion. In such a language {{it is much easier to}} program, but not every function terminates. We will see that for our purpose about integrating constructive reasoning and functional programming it is simpler if all functions one can write down are total, that is, are defined on all arguments. This is because total functions can be used to provide witnesses for propositions of the form ∀x ∈ nat. ∃y ∈ nat. P(x, y) by showing how to compute y from x. Functions that may not return an appropriate y cannot be used in this capacity and are generally much more difficult to reason about...|$|E
