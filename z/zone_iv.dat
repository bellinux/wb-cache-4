Se trata de una mezcla de ácidos grasos alifáticos de alto peso {{molecular}} (C a C) purificados de la cera de caña de azúcar (Saccharum officinarum, L.), donde el ácido octacosanoico es el componente mayoritario. Se determinó la estabilidad del D- 003 en estado natural y en forma de tabletas recubiertas de 5 mg, siguiendo las guías de la ICH. Los estudios de validación de los métodos por CG demostraron una buena linealidad (r > 0, 9994; CVs de los factores de respuesta y de las pendientes 0. 9994, RSDs of {{the response}} factors and of the slopes < 5 and 2 %, respectively), high accuracy (recoveries from 98. 9 to 100. 6 %) and precision (RSD < 2 % for repeatability and reproducibility). Specifications such as content, color, tablet weight, hardness, disintegration time, and microbiological content were assessed. Stress testing included acid hydrolysis, thermolysis, oxidation and photolysis.

Comparatively to female, male had a larger annual home range (150 ha vs. 130 ha), composed of more widely scattered sites of preferred use in more seasonal vs variable habitat types. Habitat selection in different seasons was affected by several factors: i) in all seasons, abundance of Rubus ulmifolius and Rosa ssp., ii) strong winds, especially in winter, that caused the male to move to southern slope, iii) disturbance by hunting dogs in autumn that forced deers into one or two refuge <b>zones,</b> <b>iv)</b> aspect of deer biology, such as territory marking by the male and giving birth by the female, which modified not only behaviour but also use of space...|$|R
