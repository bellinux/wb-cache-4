5|$|After Tommy Docherty's brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond {{was hired}} in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but {{recovered}} to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating <b>Zaïre,</b> they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they had beaten <b>Zaïre</b> by the smallest margin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his primary}} reason for {{military}} action in <b>Zaire</b> was {{the dismantling of the}} refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power. Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within <b>Zaire.</b> Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent-Désiré Kabila, which began waging the First Congo War. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of <b>Zaire</b> except for the capital Kinshasa; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, with as many as 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.|$|E

5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighboring countries, particularly <b>Zaire,</b> fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in <b>Zaire,</b> and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the Interahamwe paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.|$|E
5|$|Kagame first {{provided}} {{troops and}} military training to aid a rebellion against <b>Zaire</b> by the Banyamulenge, a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian South Kivu province. With Rwandan army support, the Banyamulenge defeated local {{security forces and}} began attacking the Hutu refugee camps in the area. At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda {{despite the presence of}} the RPF; others ventured further west into <b>Zaire.</b>|$|E
5|$|U.S.-mediated {{negotiations}} between the MPLA and Zairean governments led to a peace accord in 1979 {{and an end to}} support for insurgencies in each other's respective countries. <b>Zaire</b> temporarily cut off support to the FLEC, the FNLA and UNITA, and Angola forbade further activity by the FNLC.|$|E

5|$|Mobutu {{accused the}} MPLA, Cuban and Soviet governments of {{complicity}} in the war. While Neto did support the FNLC, the MPLA government's support came in response to Mobutu's continued support for Angola's FNLA The Carter Administration, unconvinced of Cuban involvement, responded by offering a meager $15million-worth of non-military aid. American timidity during the war prompted a shift in <b>Zaire's</b> foreign policy towards greater engagement with France, which became <b>Zaire's</b> largest supplier of arms after the intervention. Neto and Mobutu signed a border agreement on 22 July 1977.|$|R
5|$|In 1965, Mobutu {{launched}} a second coup d'état against {{the central government}} and took personal emergency powers. Once established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to illustrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the Popular Movement of the Revolution (MPR), which until 1990 was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's revised constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed <b>Zaire</b> and {{efforts were made to}} remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country. By the time of its disestablishment, <b>Zaire</b> was characterised by widespread croneyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to major conflicts, USMC AV-8Bs {{have been deployed}} in support of contingency and humanitarian operations, providing fixed-wing air cover and armed reconnaissance. The aircraft served in Somalia throughout the 1990s, Liberia (1990, 1996, and 2003), Rwanda (1994), Central African Republic (1996), Albania (1997), <b>Zaire</b> (1997), and Sierra Leone (1997).|$|E
5|$|On 11 June 1975 several {{military}} officers {{were arrested in}} {{what became known as}} the coup monté et manqué. Amongst those arrested were Générals Daniel KATSUVA wa Katsuvira, Land Forces Chief of Staff, UTSHUDI Wembolenga, Commandant of the 2nd Military Region at Kalemie; FALLU Sumbu, Military Attaché of <b>Zaïre</b> in Washington, Colonel MUDIAYI wa Mudiayi, the military attaché of <b>Zaïre</b> in Paris, the military attache in Brussels, a paracommando battalion commander, and several others. The regime alleged these officers and others (including Mobutu's civil secrétaire particulier) had plotted the assassination of Mobutu, high treason, and disclosure of military secrets, among other offences. The alleged coup was investigated by a revolutionary commission headed by Boyenge Mosambay Singa, at that time head of the Gendarmerie. Writing in 1988, Michael Schatzberg said the full details of the coup had yet to emerge.|$|E

While Neto did support the FNLC, the Angolan government's support came in response to Mobutu's continued support for Angola's anti-Communists. The Carter Administration, unconvinced of Cuban involvement, responded by offering a meager $15 million-worth of non-military aid. American timidity during the war prompted a shift in <b>Zaire's</b> foreign policy from the U.S. to France, which became <b>Zaire's</b> largest supplier of arms after the intervention. Neto and Mobutu signed a border agreement on July 22, 1977.|$|R

5|$|The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, {{formed in}} 1967 by Chile, Peru, <b>Zaire</b> and Zambia, {{operated}} in the copper market as OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, {{was never a}} member; it was dissolved in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake {{is a long}} {{distance}} migrant, breeding across temperate Eurasia from the British Isles east to central Siberia and western China.

Small numbers of birds may winter in the milder areas of western Europe, or halt their migration and stay in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|After the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon {{and the end}} of the Angolan War of Independence, {{the parties}} of the {{conflict}} signed the Alvor Accords on 15 January 1975. In July 1975, the MPLA violently forced the FNLA out of Luanda, and UNITA voluntarily withdrew to its stronghold in the south. By August, the MPLA had control of 11 of the 15 provincial capitals, including Cabinda and Luanda. South Africa intervened on 23 October, sending between 1,500 and 2,000 troops from Namibia into southern Angola in order to support the FNLA and UNITA. <b>Zaire,</b> in a bid to install a pro-Kinshasa government and thwart the MPLA's drive for power, deployed armored cars, paratroopers, and three infantry battalions to Angola in support of the FNLA. Within three weeks, South African and UNITA forces had captured five provincial capitals, including Novo Redondo and Benguela. In response to the South African intervention, Cuba sent 18,000 soldiers as part of a large-scale military intervention nicknamed Operation Carlota in support of the MPLA. Cuba had initially provided the MPLA with 230 military advisers prior to the South African intervention. The Cuban intervention proved decisive in repelling the South African-UNITA advance. The FNLA were likewise routed at the Battle of Quifangondo and forced to retreat towards <b>Zaire.</b> The defeat of the FNLA allowed the MPLA to consolidate power over the capital Luanda.|$|E
5000|$|In 1972, {{during the}} height of <b>Zaire's</b> authenticité policy, Kisolokele changed his name to Kisolokele Lukelo (lukelo meaning [...] "it is {{revealed}} now"). He died on 17 March 1992 at a hospital in Brussels.|$|R
25|$|Shaba I was a {{conflict}} in <b>Zaire's</b> Shaba (Katanga) Province lasting from March 8, 1977, to May 26, 1977. The conflict {{began when the}} Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC), {{a group of about}} 2,000 Katangan Congolese soldiers (veterans of the Congo Crisis, the Angolan War of Independence, and the Angolan Civil War) crossed the border into Shaba from Angola. The FNLC made quick progress through the region, due to sympathizing locals and to the disorganization of the Zairian military (Forces Armées Zaïroises, or FAZ). Traveling east from <b>Zaire's</b> border with Angola, the rebels reached Mutshatsha, a small town near to the key mining town of Kolwezi.|$|R
25|$|In 1992 the popularization of Pygmy music {{spread with}} the release of Eric Mouquet and Michel Sanchez's Deep Forest. A {{percentage}} of the proceeds from each album were donated to the Pygmy Fund set up to aid <b>Zaire's</b> Pygmies.|$|R
5|$|Concorde {{sometimes}} made special flights for demonstrations, air shows (such as the Farnborough, Paris-LeBourget and MAKS air shows) {{as well as}} parades and celebrations (for example, of Zürich airport's {{anniversary in}} 1998). The aircraft were also used for private charters (including by the President of <b>Zaire</b> Mobutu Sese Seko on multiple occasions), for advertising companies (including for the firm OKI), for Olympic torch relays (1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville) and for observing solar eclipses, including the solar eclipse of June 30, 1973 and again for the total solar eclipse on August 11, 1999.|$|E
5|$|During his vice-presidency, Kagame {{controlled}} the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings; it is disputed whether Kagame organised these, or was powerless to stop them. It {{is important to}} note that Kagame says he did not support these killings and failed to stop them. These soldiers however, were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in <b>Zaire</b> and other countries, which were controlled by the genocidaires (participants in the genocide) and threatened Rwanda's security. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in <b>Zaire.</b> The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the first war (1996–97), installing Laurent-Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu and renaming the country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son Joseph, following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a continent-wide conflict which lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.|$|E
5|$|Following the RPF victory, {{approximately}} two million Hutu fled to {{refugee camps in}} neighbouring countries, particularly <b>Zaire,</b> fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were crowded and squalid, and thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including cholera and dysentery. The camps were {{set up by the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began rearming in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.|$|E
50|$|Entre la coupe et l'élection (Between the Cup and the Election) is a 2008 {{documentary}} film co-directed by Monique Mbeka Phoba and Guy Kabeya Muya.It tells of <b>Zaire's</b> football {{team at the}} 1974 FIFA World Cup {{and what happened to}} the players afterwards.|$|R
50|$|One of {{her most}} {{well-known}} works is Oyé Oyé, (2004) a two‐channel video installation, {{in which a woman}} (Magema) is shown marching in place on the left, while on the right historic footage of <b>Zaire’s</b> Mobutu Sese Seko overseeing parades of Congolese cultural pride.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. House Committee on International Relations {{questioned}} {{the importance of}} aid and moved to halve <b>Zaire's</b> arms credits from $30 million to $15 million. Americans were evacuated from the area. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance sought to justify the aid based {{on the importance of}} copper and cobalt mining.|$|R
5|$|Moore was a Preseason All-Atlantic 10 First Team {{selection}} as a senior. He changed his jersey number from 23 to 10 {{in honor of}} his cousin <b>Zaire,</b> who died in a car crash in the summer of 2011 at the age of 10. He was named to the All-Atlantic 10 First Team {{at the conclusion of the}} regular season. He was recognized as an All-Fourth District first-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All-America teams. According to the Sporting News, Moore was the Player of the Year in the Atlantic 10.|$|E
5|$|Non-governmental organisations {{began to}} move back into the country, but the {{international}} community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in <b>Zaire</b> following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions among Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{best known}} for his work in applied {{philosophy}} concerning refugees, immigration policy and genocide, Adelman published a major study entitled Early Warning and Conflict Management: Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda (1996) as part of the 5 volume study International Response to Conflict and Genocide: Lessons from the Rwanda Experience. In 1999, he co-edited The Path of a Genocide: The Rwanda Crisis from Uganda to <b>Zaire,</b> already regarded a classic on the subject. Adelman served as an associate editor for the Macmillan three-volume Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity (2005). These efforts earned international acclaim.|$|E
50|$|Mensah {{played in}} the 1967 Africa Clubs Cup final which {{resulted}} in a 3-3 draw and a replay was scheduled, however the Ghana Football Association never informed Asante Kotoko. As a result, Asante Kotoko did not participate in the replay and the trophy was awarded to <b>Zaire's</b> TP Engelbert in their absence.|$|R
