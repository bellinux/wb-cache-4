50|$|<b>Zacopride</b> is {{a potent}} {{antagonist}} at the 5-HT3 receptor and an agonist at the 5-HT4 receptor. It has anxiolytic and nootropic effects in animal models, with the (R)-(+)-enantiomer being the more active form. It also has antiemetic and pro-respiratory effects, both reducing sleep apnea and reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression in animal studies. Early animal trials have also revealed that administration of <b>zacopride</b> can reduce preference for and consumption of ethanol.|$|E
50|$|This {{suggests}} {{that either the}} anti-respiratory depression action is mediated via a specific subtype of the 5-HT4 receptor which is activated by BIMU-8 and <b>zacopride,</b> but not by mosapride or tegaserod, or alternatively there may be functional selectivity involved whereby BIMU-8 and <b>zacopride</b> produce a different physiological response following 5-HT4 binding compared to other 5-HT4 agonists. Another alternative to {{this is that the}} 5-HT4 agonist currently available for use in humans do not have great enough potency or bioavailability in the brain to elicit the same effects.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly {{some other}} {{selective}} 5-HT4 agonists such as mosapride and tegaserod (the only5-HT4 agonists currently licensed {{for use in}} humans) have been found not to reduce respiratory depression.

40|$|Arrhythmogenesis {{in acute}} {{myocardial}} infarction (MI) is associated with depolarization of resting membraine potential (RMP) and decrease of inward rectifier potassium current (IK 1) in cardiomyocytes. However, clinical anti-arrhythmic agents that primarily act on RMP by enhancing the IK 1 channel are not currently available. We hypothesized that <b>zacopride,</b> a selective and moderate agonist of the IK 1 /Kir 2. 1 channels, prevents and cures acute ischemic arrhythmias. To test this viewpoint, adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to MI by ligating the left main coronary artery. The antiarrhythmic effects of <b>zacopride</b> (i. v. infusion) were observed in the settings of pre-treatment (<b>zacopride</b> given 3 min prior to coronary occlusion), post-treatment (<b>zacopride</b> given 3 min after coronary occlusion) and therapeutic treatment (<b>zacopride</b> given 30 s after {{the onset of the}} first sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) /ventricular fibrillation (VF) post MI). In all the three treatment modes, <b>zacopride</b> (15 μg/kg) inhibited MI-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias, as shown by significant decreases in the premature ventricular contraction (PVC) and the duration and incidence of VT or VF. In Langendorff perfused rat hearts, the antiarrhythmic effect of 1 μmol/L <b>zacopride</b> were reversed by 1 μmol/L BaCl 2, a blocker of IK 1 channel. Patch clamp results in freshly isolated rat ventricular myocytes indicated that <b>zacopride</b> activated the IK 1 channel and thereby reversed hypoxia-induced RMP depolarization and action potential duration (APD) prolongation. In addition, <b>zacopride</b> (1 μmol/L) suppressed hypoxia- or isoproterenol- induced delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). In Kir 2. x transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, <b>zacopride</b> activated the Kir 2. 1 homomeric channel but not the Kir 2. 2 or Kir 2. 3 channels. These results support our hypothesis that moderately enhancing IK 1 /Kir 2. 1 currents as by <b>zacopride</b> rescues ischemia- and hypoxia- induced RMP depolarization, and thereby prevents and cures acute ischemic arrhythmias. This study brings a new viewpoint to antiarrhythmic theories and provides a promising target for the treatment of acute ischemic arrhythmias...|$|E

Here, {{we compared the}} agonist action of known <b>zacopride</b> and its 2 -fluoro benzamide analogues, LMA 10203, LMA 10227 and LMA 10228 against mammalian homomeric α 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We found that LMA 10203 was a partial agonist of α 7 receptor with a pEC 50 value of 4. 25 ± 0. 06 μM whereas LMA 10227 and LMA 10228 were poorly active on α 7 homomeric nicotinic receptor. LMA 10227 and LMA 10228 were identified as antagonists of acetylcholine-induced currents with IC 50 values of 28. 4 μM and 39. 3 μM whereas LMA 10203 and <b>zacopride</b> possessed IC 50 values of 8. 07 μM and 7. 04 μM, respectively. Moreover, despite their IC 50 values, LMA 10227 was the most potent inhibitor of nicotine-induced current amplitudes (65. 7 ± 2. 1 % inhibition). LMA 10203 and LMA 10228 had the same inhibitory effects (26. 5 ± 7. 5 % and 33. 2 ± 4. 1 %, respectively), whereas <b>zacopride</b> had no significant inhibitory effect (4. 37 ± 4 %) on nicotine-induced responses. Our results revealed different pharmacological properties between the four compounds on acetylcholine and nicotine currents.

40|$|Ethanol is {{reinforcing}} {{within the}} nucleus accumbens shell (NACsh), but {{the underlying mechanisms}} remain unclear. Ethanol can potentiate {{the function of the}} GABAA, GABAB, and serotonin- 3 (5 -HT 3) receptors. Therefore, the current study tested the hypothesis that activation of these receptors would be involved in the reinforcing effects of ethanol in the NACsh. An intracranial self-administration (ICSA) procedure was used to assess the reinforcing effects of ethanol in the NACsh of alcohol preferring (P) rats. The ICSA consisted of seven sessions: four sessions to establish 150 mg% ethanol self-infusion into the NACsh; sessions 5 and 6 with co-infusion of ethanol plus one concentration of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (10 or 100 µM), the GABAB antagonist SCH 50911 (50, 75 or 100 µM), or the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist <b>zacopride</b> (10 or 100 µM); and session 7 with 150 mg% ethanol alone. All groups self-infused ethanol into the NACsh and readily discriminated the active from inactive lever during the acquisition sessions. Co-infusion of 100 µM, but not 10 µM, bicuculline or <b>zacopride</b> significantly decreased active responses during sessions 5 and 6. Co-infusion of 75 µM, but not 50 or 100 µM, SCH 50911 significantly attenuated responses for ethanol. Overall, the results suggest that the reinforcing effects of ethanol in the NACsh may be modulated by activation of local GABAA, GABAB and 5 -HT 3 receptors...|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE: Alcohol and {{nicotine}} co-use can reciprocally promote self-administration and drug-craving/drug-seeking behaviors. To date, the neurocircuitry {{in which}} nicotine influences ethanol (EtOH) seeking {{has not been}} elucidated. Clinical and preclinical {{research has suggested that}} the activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system is involved in the promotion of drug seeking. Alcohol, nicotine, and serotonin- 3 (5 -HT 3) receptors interact within the posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA) to regulate drug reward. Recently, our laboratory has reported that systemic administration of nicotine can promote context-induced EtOH seeking. OBJECTIVES: The goals of the current study were to (1) determine if microinjections of pharmacologically relevant levels of nicotine into the pVTA would enhance EtOH seeking, (2) determine if coadministration of nicotinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (nACh) or 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists would block the ability of nicotine microinjected into the pVTA to promote EtOH seeking, and (3) determine if 5 -HT 3 receptors in the pVTA can modulate EtOH seeking. RESULTS: Nicotine (100 and 200 μM) microinjected into the pVTA enhanced EtOH seeking. Coinfusion with 200 μM mecamylamine (nACh antagonist) or 100 and 200 μM <b>zacopride</b> (5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist) blocked the observed nicotine enhancement of EtOH seeking. The data also indicated that microinjection of 1 μM CPBG (5 -HT 3 receptor agonist) promotes context-induced EtOH seeking; conversely, microinjection of 100 and 200 μM <b>zacopride</b> alone reduced context-induced EtOH seeking. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results show that nicotine-enhanced EtOH-seeking behavior is modulated by 5 -HT 3 and nACh receptors within the pVTA and that the 5 -HT 3 receptor system within pVTA may be a potential pharmacological target to inhibit EtOH-seeking behaviors...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the action of serotonin (5 HT) on function of the ileocolonic junction (ICJ) in vivo. In anaesthetised rats, models were developed to study the effects of intra-aortic (ia) serotonin on ileocolonic and colonic transit, and the effects on transit of a number of 5 HT receptor antagonists. In the first series of experiments, a bolus of saline labelled with 99 mTc DTPA was instilled 20 cm proximal to the ICJ and transit was assessed three hours later by the geometric centre of the spread of isotope. In the second series, similar techniques were used on the postcaecal colon and transit assessed two hours later. In the third series of experiments, the effects of ia 5 HT on ileal net fluid flux was evaluated by standard perfusion experiments with 14 C polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 as a non-absorbable marker in rat plasma-like electrolyte solution. Compared with ia saline, 5 HT accelerated ICJ transit significantly (p < 0. 05). This acceleration was comparable with the effect of ia bethanechol. The effects of 5 HT on ICJ transit were inhibited by the intraperitoneal (ip) infusion of atropine, the 5 HT receptor antagonists, methysergide, ketanserin, <b>zacopride,</b> and the 5 HT 4 agonist, SC 53116. Methysergide, <b>zacopride,</b> and SC 53116 given with ia 5 HT slowed ICJ transit to rates below those of ia saline alone. When these same agents were given together with ia saline, the ICJ transit was not significantly altered. Serotonin, at the dose that accelerated ICJ transit, did not significantly alter colonic transit or ileal fluid transport. In conclusion, 5 HT is a potent pharmacological stimulant of transit across the rat ICJ in vivo; the action of 5 HT is mediated partly through muscarinic neurones and several 5 HT receptor subtypes...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the emetic {{effect of the}} anticancer drug cisplatin, and {{protective}} effects of 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists against cisplatin emesis were investigated in the pigeon.

In some experiments, the 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA content in tissues was estimated by the HPLC technique. It was observed that cisplatin (2. 5 - 10 mg/kg) is able to induce dose-dependent emesis in the pigeon. 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists (500 micrograms/kg) afford partial protection against cisplatin emesis, although some of them, i. e. indolic derivatives and <b>zacopride,</b> display intrinsic emetic activity at doses of 50 - 500 micrograms/kg. A serotonergic mechanism appears to be involved in both cisplatin- and 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist-induced emesis, since pretreatment with an inhibitor of 5 -HT synthesis, para-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg x 3 days), is able to hamper vomiting induced by either cisplatin or 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists.

In functional studies, the responses to 5 -HT, sumatriptan, ergotamine, serotonin-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl-tyrosinamide (SCMGT), α-methyl 5 -HT (α-Me) and 2 -methyl 5 -HT (2 -Me) were studied with WAY 100635, GR 127935, ritanserin, <b>zacopride</b> and SB 204070 as antagonists. All agonists produced concentration-dependent contractions of human pulmonary artery and vein preparations. The order of potency (−log EC 50 values) was ergotamine (6. 88) > 5 -HT (6. 41) ⩾SCMGT (6. 20) =sumatriptan (6. 19) ⩾α-Me (6. 04) in the artery, and ergotamine (7. 84) > 5 -HT (6. 96) >sumatriptan (6. 60) =α-Me (6. 56) >SCMGT (6. 09) in the vein. The potency of each agonist, except for SCMGT, was greater in vein than in artery preparations. Contractile responses to 5 -HT were similar in intact and endothelium-denuded preparations but responses to sumatriptan were enhanced in artery rings without endothelium. GR 127935 (1 [*]nM to 0. 5 [*]μM) produced an unsurmountable antagonism of the response to 5 -HT, sumatriptan, ergotamine and SCMGT. Ritanserin (1 [*]nM to 1 [*]μM) also reduced the maximum contractile responses to 5 -HT, ergotamine and α-Me in artery and vein preparations without affecting those to sumatriptan and SCMGT. In endothelium-denuded preparations, surmountable antagonism of sumatriptan by GR 127935 (in the presence of ritanserin) and of α-Me by ritanserin (in the presence of GR 127935) allowed for the calculation of the apparent pKB values of GR 127935 (9. 17 ± 0. 11 in artery and 9. 11 ± 0. 05 in vein) and ritanserin (8. 82 ± 0. 09 in artery and 8. 98 ± 0. 12 in vein). WAY 100635 (1 [*]nM to 1 [*]μM), <b>zacopride</b> (1 [*]nM to 1 [*]μM), or SB 204070 (1 [*]nM) did not significantly alter the concentration-response curves for 5 -HT, sumatriptan, ergotamine, SCMGT or 2 -Me in human pulmonary artery or vein thus indicating that 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 3 and 5 -HT 4 receptors are presumably {{not involved in the}} contractile response to these agonists. Binding studies using selective radioligands for different 5 -HT receptors could not detect the presence of 5 -HT 1 A receptor binding in human pulmonary blood vessels whereas the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D radioligand [3 H]- 5 -CT significantly labelled a population of specific binding sites in both vessel types. The presence of 5 -HT 2 A receptors could also be inferred from the level of binding of [3 H]-ketanserin to membranes obtained from human pulmonary vessels, although significance {{could not be reached for}} arteries. 5 -HT 4 specific receptor binding was scarce in veins and absent in the case of arteries.

Studies of their in vivo functions have been hampered by the molecular and functional diversity of GPCRs and the paucity of ligands with specific signaling effects. To better compare the effects of activating different G-protein signaling pathways through ligand-induced or constitutive signaling, we developed a new series of RASSLs (receptors activated solely by synthetic ligands) that activate different G-protein signaling pathways. These RASSLs are based on the human 5 -HT 4 b receptor, a GPCR with high constitutive G s signaling and strong ligand-induced G-protein activation of the G s and Gs/q pathways. The first receptor in this series, 5 -HT 4 -D 100 A or Rs 1 (RASSL serotonin 1), is not activated by its endogenous agonist, serotonin, but is selectively activated by the small synthetic molecules GR 113808, GR 125487, and RO 110 - 0235. All agonists potently induced G s signaling, but only a few (e. g., <b>zacopride)</b> also induced signaling via the G q pathway. Zacoprideinduced Gq signaling was enhanced by replacing the C-terminus of Rs 1 with the C-terminus of the human 5 -HT 2 C receptor.

In the present study, we report the molecular nature of a 5 -HT 4 receptor cloned from human atrium, h 5 -HT 4 A. Sequence analysis reveals that h 5 -HT 4 A displays a 93 % protein identity with the short form of the 5 -HT 4 receptor recently isolated from rat brain. h 5 -HT 4 A mRNA is expressed in human atrium but not ventricle, and is also found in brain and GI tract. h 5 -HT 4 A transiently expressed in COS- 7 cells displays a classical 5 -HT 4 pharmacological profile. However, affinities of the h 5 -HT 4 A receptor for agonists such as ML 10302, BIMU 1, renzapride or <b>zacopride</b> were 4 – 10 -fold lower than the ones found in brain. Moreover, the stimulatory patterns of cAMP formation by h 5 -HT 4 A in response to the 5 -HT 4 agonists ML 10302 and renzapride were very similar to the patterns of stimulation of ICa obtained in response to these compounds in human atrial myocytes.

We have evaluated the effects of a 21 day treatment with venlafaxine at doses of 10 and 40 mg/kg/day (p. o.) in the sensitivity of 5 -HT 4 receptors in rat hippocampus. The density of 5 -HT 4 receptors (autoradiography, [3 H]GR 113808) was significantly decreased in the CA 1 field of hippocampus after chronic treatment with 40 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine (41. 5 ± 3. 9 %; P < 0. 05 unpaired t test), but it was unchanged after chronic treatment with 10 mg/kg/day. We also tested the effect of venlafaxine in the neuronal excitability of CA 1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus after <b>zacopride</b> application. For the concentration of 10 lM, there was a significant reduction in the zacopride-mediated excitatory effect from rats treated with both doses of the drug, more marked for the 40 mg/kg/day dose (red = 39. 5 ± 9. 0 % and 55. 5 ± 12. 2 %, for 10 and 40 mg/kg/day respectively; P < 0. 05). In conclusion, our results demonstrate the existence of a dose-dependent, 5 -HT 4 receptor desensitization following chronic administration of venlafaxine. Taking into account that a high dose is required to obtain a complete desensitization pattern, it is suggested that the noradrenergic component may play a relevant role in the regulation of 5 -HT 4 receptors by chronic NSRI drugs.

Venlafaxine is an {{antidepressant}} {{drug for}} which clinical {{studies have suggested}} higher efficacy and earlier action onset than those of classical antidepressants. Although venlafaxine blocks both 5 -HT and NE reuptake systems, their antidepressant effects might be due, at least in part, to adaptive changes in some 5 -HT receptors. Some evidence suggests the involvement of 5 -HT 4 in the pathophysiology of depression. In this way, electrophysiological and behavioural data demonstrates that 5 -HT 4 receptor agonists show antidepressant-like effects. In addition, previous studies have described an increase of both 5 -HT 4 receptor density and functionality in the brain of suicide victims. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the long-term effects of venlafaxine (10 and 40 mg/kg/day, p. o., 21 days) on 5 -HT 4 receptor neurotransmission using [35 S]GTP¿S binding, adenylate cyclase assays and extracellular recordings in slices of the hippocampus. Adecrease of zacopride-stimulated [35 S]GTP¿S binding in striatal membranes following chronic venlafaxine treatment (% reduction = 17. 1 and 58. 2 % (p < 0. 01) for 10 and 40 mg/kg respectively) was found. Consistent with [35 S]GTP¿S binding studies, we also found a significant lower response in zacopride-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the same area in both 10 mg/kg (% reduction = 19. 5 %; ns) and 40 mg/kg (% reduction = 40. 5 %; p < 0. 05) venlafaxine-treated groups. Finally, the excitatory action on the population spike in the pyramidal cells of CA 1 of 10 ¿M <b>zacopride,</b> an indication of 5 -HT 4 receptor function, was also attenuated, in a dose-dependent way, following the two doses of venlafaxine (reduction = 36. 7 %; p< 0. 05 and 55. 5 %; p< 0. 05, for 10 and 40 mg/kg/day respectively). In conclusion, our results demonstrate the existence of dose-dependent 5 -HT 4 receptor desensitisation following chronic administration of venlafaxine. Taking into account that a high dose is required to obtain a complete desensitization pattern, it is suggested that the noradrenergic component may play a relevant role in the regulation of 5 -HT 4 receptors by chronic NSRI drugs.
