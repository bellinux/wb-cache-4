40|$|Zoning in pyroxenes in martian meteorites {{contains}} a rich {{record of the}} petrogenesis of these samples. In the clinopyroxene cumulate nakhlite group, major <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> is generally limited to the outer rims of the pyroxenes. However, minor <b>element</b> <b>zoning,</b> especially of Al, Ti, and Cr, is extensive, complex, and difficult to interpret [e. g., 1 - 3]. To help mine the rich information about petrogenetic processes from these samples, we have been comparing minor <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> in synthetic pyroxenes grown under known conditions with zoning observed in natural nakhlite pyroxenes.

40|$|Carbonate {{globules}} {{have been}} found in amphibole-bearing glass veins of peridotite xenoliths from Szentbékálla (Balaton Highland, Central Hungary). Strong resorption of amphibole suggests multiple fluid-melt infiltration. Textural features of carbonate globules and the surrounding silicate glass indicate a magmatic melt origin for the carbonate and exclude the possibility of significant alteration. The application of the cpx structural barometer for clinopyroxenes formed in the silicate glass indicates high-pressure vein formation. Laser-ablation ICP-MS analyses revealed trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> within the carbonate. Uniform profiles observed for various elements within the carbonate indicate that the zoning is related to non-diffusive mixing during carbonate–silicate interaction rather than to element diffusion. The trace element composition of the centers of the globules (e. g. low Ce/Pb and Nd/Pb ratios) suggests a crustal origin for the carbonate melt. The C, O, and Sr isotope compositions of the calcite globules (13 C about − 14 ‰; 18 O about 22 ‰; 87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 70533) also argue for a crustal origin of the carbonate melt. Trace element and C–O–Sr isotopic compositions of calcite globules suggest that the carbonate melt was derived from subducted material. Injection of the carbonate melt into the peridotite triggered amphibole melting. The carbonate and silicate melts intermingled, but their interaction was confined to the margins of carbonate globules. Preservation of trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> and <b>element</b> diffusion calculations indicate that the vein-hosting peridotite was rapidly brought to the surface after the carbonate melt injection...|$|R

40|$|Nakhlites are olivine-bearing clinopyroxene cumulates [e. g., 1]. Based on {{petrographic}} characteristics, {{they may}} be divided into groups that cooled at different rates {{and may have been}} formed at different depths in a single flow [e. g., 2, 3]. The order of cooling rate is Lafayette < Governador Valadares ~ Nakhla < Yamato 000593 < NWA 817 ~ MIL 03346. Nakhlite cumulus pyroxene grains consist of large cores that are nearly homogeneous in major element composition surrounded by thin rims that are zoned to Fe-rich compositions. Detailed study of these pyroxenes is important because they retain a record of the crystallization history of the nakhlite magma. Moreover, because the composition of the nakhlite parent melt cannot be directly determined, inversion of the major and minor element composition of the cumulate pyroxene cores can be used to estimate the composition of that melt. Thus {{it is important to understand}} the major and minor <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> in the cumulus pyroxenes.

We present a formulation to model diffusion of trace elements in plagioclase paying special attention to certain thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. In particular, we account for the compositional dependence on anorthite content of the chemical potential and diffusion coefficients of trace elements (e. g., Mg), the choice of suitable boundary conditions and potential effects of diffusion {{in more than one}} dimension. We show that contrary to intuition, diffusive fluxes of trace elements may be coupled to major element concentration gradients, and ignoring such coupling can lead to incorrect estimates of timescales. We illustrate application of the model using plagioclase crystals from a suite of gabbroic xenoliths from a Holocene dacitic lava flow of Volcán San Pedro (Chilean Andes, 36 °S). The inferred timescale for metasomatism of the xenoliths by evolved liquids is on the order of 100 (30 to 148) yr and serves to illustrate how trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> in plagioclase provides a window into timescales of magmatic processes inaccessible by isotopic or other methods...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two separate papers on color in fluorite. In the first paper, synthetic fluorites doped with various REEs (10 - 300 ppm) were analyzed using direct current plasma spectrometry, optical absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence spectrophotometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after receiving 10 - 25 Mrad of 60 Co gamma irradiation. The combined results of these techniques indicate that the irradiation-induced color of the Y-, Gd-, La- and Ce-doped samples {{are the result of}} a REE-associated fluorine vacancy that traps two electrons. Divalent samarium may be the cause of the irradiation-induced green color of the Sm-doped sample. In the second paper, fluorite crystals from Bingham, NM, Long Lake, NY, and Westmoreland, NH were similarly investigated to determine the relationship between sectorally <b>zoned</b> trace <b>elements,</b> defects, and color.

40|$|Major {{and minor}} element abundances in pyroxene, principally pigeonite, from Zagami {{meteorite}} samples {{were determined by}} electron microprobe; abundances of trace elements Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ga were obtained by synchrotron X-ray (SXRF) microprobe. Abundances of Ni and Cr in the magnesian zones and cores are partially decoupled from abundances of other compatible (Mg) and incompatible (Fe,Ti) elements. The textures, chemical <b>zoning,</b> and <b>element</b> decouplings in the pigeonites are consistent with igneous crystal growth at moderate cooling rates, not isothermally or near equilibrium. From element partitioning and mass balance, Zagami is estimated to contain 20 +/- 5 percent or less cumulus pyroxene (half augite and half pigeonite), half the proportion suggested by equilibrium distribution of Fe/Mg between pigeonite and melt. This inconsistency may be resolved if all pigeonite/melt element partitioning was affected by {{the rapid growth of}} the pigeonites. The inference that the pyroxene zoning patterns reflect only magmatic events is consistent with an igneous age of 180 m. y. for Zagami...|$|R

Concentrations of P in trace-element-rich bands exceed expected equilibrium values, and similar enrichment bands are observed in olivines grown experimentally at constant cooling rate [2]; thus, {{it seems likely that}} this phenomenon in natural olivine reflects local kinetic processes during crystal growth rather than oscillations in magma temperature or bulk composition...|$|R
40|$|The Barchi-Kol {{terrain is}} a classic {{locality}} of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism within the Kokchetav metamorphic belt. We provide a detailed and systematic characterization of four metasedimentary samples using dominant mineral assemblages, mineral inclusions in zircon and monazite, garnet zonation with respect to major and trace elements, and Zr-in-rutile and Ti-in-zircon temperatures. A typical diamond-bearing gneiss records peak conditions of 49 ± 4 kbar and 950 – 1000 °C. Near isothermal decompression of this rock resulted in the breakdown of phengite associated with a pervasive recrystallization of the rock. The same terrain also contains mica schists that experienced peak conditions close {{to those of the}} diamond-bearing rocks, but they were exhumed along a cooler path where phengite remained stable. In these rocks, major and trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> in garnet has been completely equilibrated. A layered gneiss was metamorphosed at UHP conditions in the coesite field, but did not reach diamond-facies conditions (peak conditions: 30 kbar and 800 – 900 °C). In this sample, garnet records retrograde zonation in major elements and also retains prograde <b>zoning</b> in trace <b>elements.</b> A garnet-kyanite-micaschist that reached significantly lower pressures (24 ± 2 kbar, 710 ± 20 °C) contains garnet with major and trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning.</b> The diverse garnet zoning in samples that experienced different metamorphic conditions allows to establish that diffusional equilibration of rare earth element in garnet likely occurs at 900 – 950 °C. Different metamorphic conditions in the four investigated samples are also documented in zircon trace element zonation and mineral inclusions in zircon and monazite. U-Pb geochronology of metamorphic zircon and monazite domains demonstrates that prograde (528 – 521 Ma), peak (528 – 522 Ma), and peak to retrograde metamorphism (503 – 532 Ma) occurred over a relatively short time interval that is indistinguishable from metamorphism of other UHP rocks within the Kokchetav metamorphic belt. Therefore, the assembly of rocks with contrasting P-T trajectories must have occurred in a single subduction-exhumation cycle, providing a snapshot of the thermal structure of a subducted continental margin prior to collision. The rocks were initially buried along a low geothermal gradient. At 20 – 25 kbar they underwent near isobaric heating of 200 °C, which was followed by continued burial along a low geothermal gradient. Such a step-wise geotherm is in good agreement with predictions from subduction zone thermal models...|$|R
40|$|Diogenites are {{coarse-grained}} orthopyroxenite breccias of remarkably uniform {{major element}} composition. Most diogenites contain homogeneous pyroxene fragments up to 5 cm across of Wo 2 En 74 Fs 24 composition. Common minor constituents are chromite, olivine, trolite and metal, while silica, plagioclase, merrillite and diopside are trace phases. Diogenites are generally {{believed to be}} cumulates from the eucrite parent body, although their relationship with eucrites remains obscure. It {{has been suggested that}} some diogenites are residues after partial melting. I have performed EMPA and INAA for major, minor and trace elements on most diogenites, concentrating on coarse-grained mineral and lithic clasts in order to elucidate their igneous formation and subsequent metamorphic history. Major element compositions of diogenites are decoupled from minor and trace element compositions; the latter record an igneous fractionation sequence that is not preserved in the former. Low equilibration temperatures indicate that major element diffusion continued long after crystallization. Diffusion coefficients for trivalent and tetravalent elements in pyroxene are lower than those of divalent elements. Therefore, major element compositions of diogenites may represent means of unknown portions of a cumulate homogenized by diffusion, while minor and trace elements still yield information on their igneous history. The scale of major element equilibration is unknown, but is likely to be on the order of a few cm. Therefore, the diogenite precursors may have consisted largely of cm-sized, igneously zoned orthopyroxene grains, which were subsequently annealed during slow cooling, obliterating major <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> but preserving minor and trace incompatible <b>element</b> <b>zoning...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Au-Ag (-Pb-Zn) Apacheta deposit {{is located}} in the Shila district, 600 km {{southeast}} of Lima in the Cordillera Occidental of Arequipa Province, southern Peru. The vein mineralization is found in Early to Middle Miocene calc-alkaline lava flows and volcanic breccias. Both gangue and sulfide mineralization express a typical low-sulfidation system; assay data show <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> with base metals enriched at depth and higher concentrations of precious metals in {{the upper part of the}} veins. Three main deposition stages are observed: (1) early pyrite and base-metal sulfides with minor electrum 1 and acanthite; (2) brecciation of this mineral assemblage and cross-cutting veinlets with subhedral quartz crystals, Mn-bearing calcite and rhombic adularia crystals; and finally (3) veinlets and geodal filling of an assemblage of tennantite/tetrahedrite + colorless sphalerite 2 + galena + chalcopyrite + electrum 2. Fluid inclusions in the mineralized veins display two distinct types: aqueous-carbonic liquid-rich Lw-c inclusions, and aqueous-carbonic vapor-rich Vw-c inclusions. Microthermometric data indicate that the ore minerals were deposited between 300 and 225 °C from relatively dilute hydrothermal fluids (0. 6 - 3. 4 wt% NaCl). The physical and chemical characteristics of the hydrothermal fluids show a vertical evolution, with in particular a drop in temperature and a loss of H 2 S. The presence of adularia and platy calcite and of co-existing liquid-rich and vapor-rich inclusions in the ore-stage indicates a boiling event. Strong H 2 S enrichment in the Vw-c inclusions observed at - 200 m, the abundance of platy calcite, and the occurrence of hydrothermal breccia at this level may indicate a zone of intense boiling. The vertical <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> observed in the Apacheta deposit thus seems to be directly related to the vertical evolution of hydrothermal-fluid characteristics. Precious-metal deposition mainly occurred above the 200 -m level below the present-day surface, in response to a liquid/vapor phase separation due to an upward boiling front...|$|R
40|$|The {{partitioning}} {{behavior of}} the trace elements Be, Sc, Ba, La, Ce, and Tm between melilite and liquid has been determined using stepwise integration of a Rayleigh fractionation equation for ion microprobe analyses of synthetic zoned melilite crystals. Distribution coefficients between melilite and liquid (D^(Mel/L) _i) were determined over {{the entire range of}} melilite + spinel crystallization for one bulk composition corresponding to that of an average Type B inclusion from the Allende C 3 V carbonaceous chondrite. Beryllium is incompatible in gehlenitic meliliters (e. g.,D^(Mel/L) B_e = 0. 5 for X_(ak) = 0. 3) but compatible in åkermanitic melilites (e. g., D^(Mel/L) B_e = 1. 9 for X_(Ak) = 0. 75). Barium (D^(Mel/L) B_a = 0. 04 - 0. 05), Sc (D^(Mel/L) S_c = 0. 01 - 0. 02), La (D^(Mel/L) L_α ≤ 0. 07 - 0. 29), Ce (D^(Mel/L) C_e ≤ 0. 05 - 0. 21), and Tm (D^(Mel/L) T_m ≤ 0. 03 - 0. 14) are all incompatible in melilites in the range Ak 25 -Ak 75. Variations in D^(Mel/L) i as a function of X_(Ak) are explicable in terms of a simple thermodynamic treatment of trace element partitioning based on crystal chemical considerations. Characteristic trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> patterns are predicted for early crystallizing melilite from meliliterich Type B inclusions. For example, concentrations of the REEs in melilite should continually decrease with increasing degrees of crystallization, opposite the behavior normally expected of an incompatible element. Concentrations of Be should rise with increasing degrees of crystallization even when the element is compatible, again opposite the behavior normally expected of compatible <b>elements.</b> In general, <b>zoning</b> patterns of trace elements in melilite from Type B inclusions are consistent with those predicted for fractional crystallization from a melt in a closed system.

40|$|The Courageous Lake Greenstone Belt (CLGB) is hosted in the Yellowknife Supergroup of the Central Slave Province, NWT, Canada: {{a fertile}} gold {{district}} {{that includes the}} former Giant, Con and Lupin orogenic gold mines. The largest deposit in the CLGB is the FAT deposit, which has a proven and probable reserve of 91 MT at 2. 20 gpt gold owned by Seabridge Gold Inc. The FAT deposit differs from other gold deposits in the Yellowknife Supergroup in that deformation and shear textures are intermittent, and where present, deformation does not correlate spatially with mineralisation. The CLGB formed as a volcanic succession that was deposited on a 3218 Ma sodic granitoid gneissic complex. Periodic volcanism commencing at 2660 Ma formed an extrusive cycle of mafic flows to rhyolitic tuffs. The felsic units reach a maximum (post compression) thickness of 1800 m proximal to the FAT deposit. Volcanic textures of the rocks hosting the FAT deposit are well preserved sub-aerial lapilli and lesser amounts of ash and bomb tuff. There is periodic intercalation with aqeuously reworked beds. These are overlain by greywacke turbiditic rocks. Three distinct structural/metamorphic events have affected the Courageous Lake Greenstone Belt: 1. compression and vertical tilting of stratigraphy and associated regional dynamothermal metamorphism to mid-greenschist facies commencing at 2592 Ma; 2. concurrent discreet thermal metamorphism associated with local granitic intrusions; and 3. late retrograde hydrothermal alteration. Gold is refractory within acicular and rhombic arsenopyrite. Petrography, SIMS, EMP and LA-ICP-MS analysis have defined three arsenopyrite styles of distinct crystal habit with distinct inclusion abundance, Au enrichment and <b>zoning</b> and trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning.</b> The greatest enrichment is in the earliest type of arsenopyrite, attributed to hydrothermal events associated with volcanism.

Overlaying of inverse layers facilitates analysis by creating an overall view on multiple elements (Suyash Kumar et al. 2007).

Afterward, pairs of layers (one as the top and one as the bottom map) were selected according to the correlations between their elements. In top and bottom layers, red to blue and blue to red (reverse) represented maximum to minimum amounts, respectively. Top layers were then demonstrated at a contrast of 100 and transparency of 60. Finally, similar to FCC, the anomaly of elements was interpreted based on the composition of the obtained colors.|$|R

40|$|Lofgren (1989) and {{the further}} {{analysis}} of Lofgren's 1989 experiments by Jones and Lofgren (1993) established that cooling rates as slow as 5 C/hour produced analog textures and {{major and minor}} <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> profiles in minerals, implying that a lower limit on chondrule cooling rate may be approximately 5 C/hour These results, however, are in conflict with those reported by Radomsky and Hewins (1990). In their paper, Radomsky and Hewins (1990) established a lower limit on chondrule cooling rates of I 100 C/hour a factor of 20 higher than that suggested by Jones and Lofgren (1993). The higher cooling rates suggested by Radomsky and Hewins (1990) have gained considerable favor within the meteoritic community largely because it appears more consistent with the preservation of Na in chondrules, which tends to volatilize at the slower cooling rates. In their study, however, Radomsky and Hewins (1990) did not use Pt hang wires that were coated or saturated with Fe. The lack of such techniques likely facilitated Fe loss from their experimental chondrules to the hang wire during formation (Jones and Lofgren, 1993). The effect of Fe loss could produce an inaccurate determination of cooling rates since these rates are largely determined by the Mg-Fe distributions in individual crystals...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{wide-range}} in chemical properties, trace <b>element</b> partitioning and <b>zoning</b> in metamorphic systems provides valuable information on various metamorphic processes {{which are not}} recorded or preserved by major elements. Trace element partitioning between coexisting minerals and major and trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> patterns were investigated using an electron microprobe and a laser ablation microprobe - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry for pelites in Gagnon terrane, western Labrador. [...] Large variations in the partitioning of Sc and Cr between coexisting garnet and biotite indicate lost or modification of equilibrium compositions by garnet resorption and disquilibrium, respectively. Crystal lattice strain of garnet controls trace element partitioning, so that the distribution of elements occupying each cation site in the garnet structure shows parabolic relations with ionic radius. Sc and Ti partitioning are controlled by Al contents in biotite and Ca in garnet, respectively. Weak to moderate thermal dependence of Co, Zn and Zr partitioning maybe related to increases in thermal expansivities with metamorphic grade. [...] Similar to garnet and biotite pairs, trace element partitioning between biotite and muscovite shows controls of crystal lattice strain. The distributions of Li, Sc, Sr and Ba show dependence on both temperature and major element compositions. V and Zr partitioning is moderately dependent on temperature. [...] For garnets with spiral internal fabrics, growth zoning for some major and trace elements exhibits a spiral pattern (spiral zoning), implying that incorporation of these elements was mainly restricted to discrete growth regions of the crystal at any one time. Low amphibolite-facies garnets show Cr zoning parallel to foliation, indicating that the garnet overprinted a matrix fabric with a heterogeneous Cr distribution during growth (overprint zoning). In contrast, in mid/upper amphibolite-facies garnet porphyroblasts, Cr zoning becomes concentric, indicating an enhanced diffusion rate. [...] Various Mn concentrations in the same annulus from garnet porphyroblasts in a thin-section suggests that Mn did not achieve thin-section scale equilibrium during the annulus formation, raising questions concerning the use of Mn concentration as a time marker. The origins of Y-annuli are suggested in this study: (1) Y-annuli produced by garnet resorption and regrowth characterized by an irregular and discontinuous annulus with a steeper slope {{on the inner side}} of the annulus, (2) Y-annuli produced by discontinuous breakdown of Y- and REE-rich minerals characterized by euhedral annuli and (3) Y-annuli produced by changes in garnet growth speed. Trace minerals responsible for the formation of Y-annuli are identified using REE ratios on small intervals on the annuli.

40|$|Accepted: 21 June 2009. Published online: 10 July 2009 Garnet {{is a vital}} mineral for {{determining}} constrained P–T–t paths as it can give both the P–T and t information directly. However, estimates of the closure temperature of the Sm–Nd system in garnet vary considerably leading to significant uncertainties in the timing of peak conditions. In this study, five igneous garnets from an early Proterozoic 2414 ± 6 Ma garnet—cordierite bearing s-type granite—which was subjected to high-T reworking have been dated to examine their diffusional behaviour in the Sm–Nd system. Garnets 8, 7, 6 and 2. 5 mm in diameter were compositionally profiled and then dated, producing two-point Sm–Nd isochron ages of 2412 ± 10, 2377 ± 5, 2370 ± 5 and 2365 ± 8 and 2313 ± 11 Ma, respectively. A direct correlation exists between grain size and amount of resetting highlighting the effect of grain size on closure temperature. Major element EMPA and LA-ICPMS REE traverses reveal homogenous major element profiles and relict igneous REE profiles. The retention of REE zoning and homogenisation of major <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> suggest that diffusion rates of REEs are considerably slower {{than that of the}} major cations. The retention of REE zoning and the lack of resetting in the largest grains suggest that Sm–Nd closure temperature in garnet is a function of grain size, thermal history and REE zoning in garnetRian Dutch and Martin Han...|$|R
40|$|The Christmas Point area is {{dominated}} by well-layered gneisses, of which garnet-orthopyroxene gneiss and garnet felsic gneiss are the most abundant types. Orthopyroxene-bearing quartz-rich granulite, layering of which is indistinct to massive, is present as layers within the garnet felsic gneiss. Garnet-amphibole gneiss is present as layers in both the garnet-orthopyroxene gneiss and the garnet felsic gneiss. Orthopyroxene-bearing quartz-rich granulites contain coexisting orthopyroxene, sillimanite and quartz. The occurrence of sapphirine as inclusions in sillimanite implies that metamorphic conditions changed from the stability field of sapphirine+quartz to that of orthopyroxene+sillimanite+quartz. P-T conditions estimated using garnet-orthopyroxene geothermobarometry range from 920 to 1040 ℃ and 8. 8 to 11. 5 kbar. Garnet exsolution lamellae present in orthopyroxene from the garnet-orthopyroxene gneiss suggest that a precursor aluminous orthopyroxene was present during the ultrahigh-temperature stage. For the retrograde event, although chemical <b>zoning</b> of major <b>element</b> composition of garnet developed during cooling and reflects high-temperature diffusion, compositional zoning of more slowly diffusing elements, such as Ca, show a complicated pattern caused by partial resorbtion and overgrowth. Garnet rims in all rock types are intergrown with quartz and have relatively high grossular composition. Plagioclase in the garnet-orthopyroxene gneiss and garnet felsic gneiss show reverse zoning. Garnet-amphibole gneiss contains two amphiboles (gedrite and cummingtonite) with different fluorine contents; gedrite occurs as finely crystalline overgrowths surrounding cummingtonite, implying that the retrograde process after peak (ultrahigh-temperature) metamorphism was not simple cooling...|$|R
40|$|Pyrite {{samples from}} the Radka epithermal, {{replacement}} type, volcanic rock-hosted copper deposit, Bulgaria, have been studied using near-infrared (IR) microscopy. Two generations of pyrite based on their textures, composition and behaviour in IR light can be distinguished. Electron microprobe analyses, X-ray elemental mapping and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to study the relationship between crystal <b>zoning,</b> trace <b>element</b> contents and IR transmittance of pyrite. The observed crystal zoning is related to variable arsenic contents in massive fine-grained and colloform pyrite from the early pyrite-quartz assemblage, and cobalt contents in pyrite crystals from the late quartz-pyrite vein assemblage. There is a negative correlation between trace element content and IR transmittance of pyrite. The IR transparency of pyrite is thus a sensitive indicator of changes in trace element concentrations. Fluid inclusions have only {{been found in the}} second pyrite generation. Scanning electron microscopy observations on open fluid inclusion cavities permitted the crystallographic features of vacuoles to be determined. A characteristic feature of primary fluid inclusions in pyrite is a negative crystal habit, shaped mainly by { 100 }, { 111 } and { 210 }. This complicated polyhedral morphology is the reason for the observed opacity of some isometric primary inclusions. Secondary fluid inclusion morphology depends {{on the nature of the}} surface of the healed fracture. Recognition of the primary or secondary origin of fluid inclusions is enhanced by using crystallographically oriented sections. Microthermometric measurements of primary inclusions indicate that the second pyrite generation was deposited at maximum P-T conditions of 400 °C and 430 bar and from a fluid of low bulk salinity (3. 5 - 4. 6 wt%), possibly KCl-dominant. There are large ranges for homogenisation temperatures in secondary inclusions because of necking-down processes. Decrepitation features of some of pyrite-hosted inclusions and of all inclusions in associated quartz indicate reheating of the veins to 500 - 550 °C. The late cobalt-rich quartz-pyrite vein assemblage in the Radka deposit may be the shallow manifestation of deeper and genetically related porphyry copper mineralisation. This is a common observation of many intermediate- to high-sulfidation epithermal replacement-type ore bodies in this ore district and possibly the Cretaceous Banat-Srednogorie metallogenic belt in general...|$|R
40|$|A Barrovian {{sequence}} of the Silgará Formation at the southwestern Santander Massif, Colombian Andes, con-tains zoned garnets in which major and trace <b>element</b> <b>zoning</b> correlates with distribution of mineral inclusions, which may indicate that garnet growth rate varied through time and affected both composition and texture of garnets, although different garnet producing reactions have also {{played an important role}} in the chemical zoning of garent. However, a local metasomatism process associated to the action of late magmatic fluids associated to the emplacement of the Pescadero Pluton (external forcing mechanism) would be also considered. In particular, Ca, Mn and Y zoning patterns in some garnets correspond with inclusion-rich vs. inclusion-free zones, although the distribution of inclusions does not correlate with chemical zoning (i. e., the same inclusions are found in Ca-rich and Ca-poor zones of the garnet). There is a similar lack of correlation with accessory phases (apatite, monazite, xenotime, ilmenite or rutile). In a garnet from the garnet-staurolite zone, a high Mn core contains abundant and randomly oriented apatite, monazite and ilmenite inclusions, while a euhedral low Ca mantle zone is inclusion-free and the high Ca / low Mn rim zone contains apatite, monazite and ilmenite aligned parallel to the margins of the garnet. Inclusions in garnet can also represent mineral phases were not completely consumed during garnet growth. Association of garnet zoning trends and patterns with inclusion distribution may help dif...|$|R
40|$|A textural and geochemical {{investigation}} of titanite from the Ross of Mull Granite, Scotland, reveals that <b>zoning</b> in trace <b>elements</b> strongly correlates with field evidence of magma-mixing processes within the pluton. Diorite enclaves contain {{a range of}} textures indicative of variable states of interaction with the host granite and suggest {{that a number of}} discrete mixing events have occurred in the pluton, both in situ and prior to emplacement at the present level. Single titanites within both the enclaves and the host are compositionally zoned and provide a detailed record of magmatic processes. Zoning includes concentric fine-scale oscillatory types and major discontinuities linked to dissolution events associated with changes in titanite stability. The zones reflect growth during changing melt chemistry and correlate with variations in rare earth element and high field strength element contents. Geothermometry using the Zr content of titanite indicates that titanite crystallization occurs at temperatures of c. 750 – 700 °C. Titanites respond to changes in melt composition, oxygen fugacity and temperature caused by mixing and the introduction of fresh diorite magma into the granite host. Mixing processes recorded by the titanites include complete mixing of crystal-free melts, crystal transfer between partially crystallized magmas, melt segregation and transfer from crystalline enclaves and late-stage diffusive exchange. Titanite chemistry responds to local activity adjacent to sites of mixing but is also influenced by more distal magma-mixing events. In this respect titanite is capable of revealing many otherwise hidden events within the magma chamber...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} various {{patterns}} seen in Galápagos magmatism is investigated using numerical simulations of mantle plume-ridge {{interaction with the}} realistic geometry and evolution of the Galapágos Spreading Center (GSC). Models predict magma generation and composition from a mantle composed of fusible veins of material enriched in incompatible elements, and a more refractory depleted matrix. Model 1 simulates a low-viscosity plume, owing to a temperature-dependent mantle rheology; Model 2 includes the added dependence on water content, which leads to high viscosities in the dehydrated, shallow upper mantle. Model 1 produces the most favorable results. It shows how a modest crustal thickness anomaly observed along the Western GSC can arise from a plume with large excess temperatures (greater than 100 °C). Model 1 also predicts geographic patterns in magma isotopic compositions broadly resembling those observed along the GSC as well as around the Galapágos Archipelago. These patterns are predicted to arise out {{of the differences in}} melting depths between the enriched veins and depleted matrix, coupled with spatial variations in the rate of mantle upwelling and decompression melting. The results provide an alternative to traditional explanations involving the plume mixing with or entraining the ambient mantle. The models are still missing some essential factors, as indicated by the predicted increases, rather than the observed decrease in incompatible element concentration away from the hotspot along the GSC. Possible factors include a regional-scale <b>zoning</b> in incompatible <b>element</b> and water content within the plume, or melt migration that delivers a larger flux of incompatible-element-rich melts to the GSC...|$|R
40|$|The Soufrière Hills Volcano in Montserrat erupts a Cl-rich, {{porphyritic}} andesite. HCl degassing accompanies eruption and {{is dependent}} on the growth rate of the lava dome. The magma contains hornblende phenocrysts that show repetitive <b>zoning</b> in most <b>elements,</b> including Cl. On the basis of the zoning data, (Cl/OH) ratios in the melt, calculated from partitioning data, increase rimward through each zone, indicating that the phenocrysts formed under conditions of varying (Cl/OH) m. An empirical relationship between A-site occupancy in the hornblende and temperature implies that crystallisation of each zone is also accompanied by increasing temperature. Each zone ends at a resorption horizon, and crystallisation recommences at lower temperature and (Cl/OH) m. Melt inclusion H 2 O and Cl contents for the 8 th January 2007 explosive eruption can be explained by closed-system degassing with DClfl-m between 5 and 30, or by open-system degassing accompanied by a small amount of crystallisation. However, neither simple closed-system degassing nor convective circulation of magma can explain the positive correlation of (Cl/OH) m with temperature. We suggest that the zoning can be caused by accumulation of CO 2 -rich vapour in the andesite, probably as a result of mafic magma injection into the chamber. Decreasing H 2 O fugacity and/or increasing Clm result in increasing (Cl/OH) m while heat transferred with the volatiles causes the rise in temperature. Intermittently, the accumulated fluid is lost to the surface, possibly as a result of renewed eruptive activity. This model requires the CO 2 -rich fluid to be decoupled from the magma, consistent with previous observations of continuous CO 2 emissions at the surface. ...|$|R
