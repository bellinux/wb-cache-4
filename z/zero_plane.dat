40|$|In this work, we {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility to}} modify the electric-field distribution of a radio frequency (RF) coil to generate electric field-free zones in the body without significantly altering the transmit sensitivity. Because implant heating {{is directly related to}} the electric-field distribution, implant-friendly RF transmit coils can be obtained by this approach. We propose a linear birdcage transmit coil with a <b>zero</b> electric-field <b>plane</b> as an example of such implant-friendly coils. When the <b>zero</b> electric-field <b>plane</b> coincides with the implant position, implant heating is reduced, as we demonstrated by the phantom experiments. By feeding RF pulses with identical phases and shapes but different amplitudes to the two orthogonal ports of the coil, the position of the <b>zero</b> electric-field <b>plane</b> can also be adjusted. Although implant heating is reduced with this method, a linear birdcage coil results in a whole-volume average specific absorption rate that is twice that of a quadrature birdcage coil. To solve this issue, we propose alternative methods to design implant-friendly RF coils with optimized electromagnetic fields and reduced whole-volume average specific absorption rate. With these methods, the transmit field was modified to reduce RF heating of implants and obtain uniform transmit sensitivity. Magn Reson Med, 2011. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

50|$|A Japanese Float <b>Zero</b> <b>plane</b> strafed the PT {{boats that}} were {{screening}} the convoy {{on the same}} date, and then strafed the LCT 325 and LCT 327. When the plane came in at low altitude of approximately 500 yards, the LCTs opened fire. The plane dropped a bomb {{at that time and}} then proceeded {{in the direction of the}} APc-25. The APc-25 opened fire with three 20 mm Oerlikon machine guns and two 50 caliber machine guns when the plane came within range at a distance of about 500 yards. The remaining guns were not in position to open fire. The APc-25 fired about five magazines of 20 mm ammunition and about 150 rounds of 50-caliber ammunition. Some of the crew believed that the plane was hit after seeing a short burst of flame. Rev. Paul Redmond, chaplain of the Forth Marine Raiders Battalion found the remains of a Japanese plane the following morning, shot down on the shore in that area near Enogai. However, Commanding Officer John D. Cartano reported that he could not positively state whether the APc-25 had shot down the plane.|$|E
40|$|An {{unstable}} zero-dynamics is a known obstruction to inducing exact asymptotic tracking for an {{open set}} of output trajectories with internal stability. This paper proposes a procedure for achieving approximate tracking for a nonlinear system whose linearization possesses real right-half <b>plane</b> <b>zeros.</b> The method is guaranteed to remove the right-half <b>plane</b> <b>zeros</b> while the other zeros remain in their previous location; moreover, it provides information on the class of signals for which good approximate tracking can be obtained. With other methods, the right-half <b>plane</b> <b>zeros</b> are eliminated but the final location of the remaining zeros is not known a priori. The design procedure is illustrated on a trajectory control problem of an aircraft in rapid manoeuvres. Simulations illustrate the computations involved and show that precise lateral and longitudinal manoeuvres can be performed, even {{in the presence of}} uncertainties...|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{exchange}} of heat, moisture and momentum above the earth's surface depends strongly on the turbulence generated by surface roughness.

40|$|Let N be {{the class}} of closed simply connected, smooth n–manifolds that admit nonnegative {{sectional}} curvature and let P be the corresponding class for positive curvature. Known examples suggest that N ought to be much larger than P. On the other hand, there is no known obstruction that distinguishes between the two classes. So its actually possible that N = P. In [PetWilh 2] we will give a deformation of the nonnegatively curved metric on the Gromoll-Meyer sphere [GromMey] to a positively curved metric. In this note we will elucidate a few abstract principles {{that will be used}} in this deformation that might possibly be useful for other deformations to positive curvature. Besides a few exceptions, [Cheeg], [Dear], [GrovVerdZil], [GrovZil 2], [Guij] all known examples of compact nonnegatively curved manifolds are constructed as Riemannian submersions of compact Lie groups. It follows from a result in [Tapp 2] that the <b>zero</b> curvature <b>planes</b> of the nonexceptional examples are contained in totally geodesic 2 –dimensional flats. As far as we are aware, the exceptional examples also have totally geodesic flats, provided of course that they have any <b>zero</b> curvature <b>planes</b> at all ([Dear] and [GrovVerdZil]). All known examples with nonnegative curvature, some zero curvatures, and positive curvature at a point, are the images of Riemannian submersions of compact Lie groups and hence have all <b>zero</b> <b>planes</b> contained in totally geodesic flats. ([EschKer], [Esch], [GromMey], [Ker 1], [Ker 2], [PetWilh 1], [Tapp 1], [Wilh], and [Wilk]) So in most cases, any attempt to put positive curvature on a known nonnegatively curved example must confront the issue of how to put positive curvature on a neighborhood of a totally geodesic flat torus. More than 20 years ago Strake observed that the presence of a totally geodesic, flat torus in a nonnegatively curved manifold means {{that there can be no}} deformation that is positive to first order. In principle, a first order deformation should be much easier to construct and verify than a higher order one. In fact, if {gt} t∈R is C ∞ family of metrics with g 0 a metric of nonnegative curvature, and if ∂t secgt P...|$|R
