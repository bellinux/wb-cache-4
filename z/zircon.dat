40|$|The magmatic and {{metamorphic}} <b>zircons</b> {{were investigated}} with Raman spectrum microprobe analysis. We found notable {{differences between these}} two kinds of <b>zircons</b> exhibited by the variation trend of Raman peak intensity from core to rim of a crystal. In magmatic <b>zircons,</b> the intensity and the ratio H/W of Raman spectrum peaks gradually decrease from core to rim of a crystal, which is produced {{by an increase in}} metamictization degree and suggests an increase in U and Th concentrations from core to rim. In metamorphic <b>zircons,</b> {{there are two kinds of}} crystals according to their Raman spectra: the first group of <b>zircons</b> exhibits a variation trend opposite to those of magmatic <b>zircons,</b> tending to increase in the Raman peak intensity and H/W value from core to rim of a crystal, which is produced by a decrease in metamictization degree and indicates a decrease of U and Th concentrations from core to rim of a crystal. The second group of <b>zircons</b> exhibits no change in Raman peak intensity and H/W value through a crystal. The data of infrared and Raman spectra of these crystals show that they are well crystallized and have no lattice destruction induced by metamictization, and are thought to crystallize in high temperature stages of metamorphism. During these stages, the U and Th ions have been removed by metamorphic fluids from the parent rocks of these <b>zircons.</b> The other difference between magmatic and metamorphic <b>zircons</b> is the background level of their Raman spectra, which is high and sloped in magmatic <b>zircons,</b> but low and horizontal in metamorphic <b>zircons.</b> The differences between magmatic and metamorphic <b>zircons</b> can be used to identify the genesis of <b>zircons</b> and understand the origin and evolution history of their parent rocks.

Three populations of <b>zircons</b> separated from two rock samples comprised xenogenic, magmatic (gabbroic), and metamorphic <b>zircons,</b> with the latter found exclusively in the sample of retrograded eclogitized gabbroids. Group I <b>zircons</b> are xenogenic and have a Meso- to Neoarchean age. Mineral inclusions in them (quartz, apatite, biotite, and chlorite) are atypical of gabbroids, and geochemistry of these <b>zircons</b> is very diverse. Group II <b>zircons</b> contain mineral inclusions of ortho- and clinopyroxene and are distinguished for their very high U, Th, Pb, and REE concentrations and Th/U ratios. These <b>zircons</b> formed during the late magmatic crystallization of the gabbroids at temperatures of 1150 - 1160 °C, and their U-Pb age 2389 ± 25 Ma corresponds to this process.

The Hf isotope compositions of thirty-seven <b>zircons</b> reveal that these clastic materials have different origins. Minor <b>zircons</b> crystallized from magma generated from relatively juvenile crust, while the parental magma of most <b>zircons</b> was derived from ancient crust. Integration of U-Pb dating and Hf isotope analysis of these <b>zircons</b> suggests that the generation of juvenile crust in the Cathaysia block mainly occurred at 2. 5 – 2. 6 Ga.

The peridotitic <b>zircons</b> record early Mesozoic UHP metamorphism (²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U age of 223. 5 ± 7. 5 Ma), but their Hf isotope compositions indicate that the protolith of the peridotite is at least Mesoproterozoic in age (minimum depleted-mantle ages [T DM] of 1. 4 Ga). <b>Zircons</b> from the gneiss also reflect the Mesozoic metamorphism, with a cluster of ²⁰⁶Pb/²³⁸U ages at 224. 5 ± 11. 5 Ma; a trail of discordant grains indicates a protolith age older than 800 Ma, consistent with T DM model ages of younger than 1. 2 Ga.

40|$|Granite-hosted {{uranium ore}} {{deposits}} {{are the most}} important commercial U-producers in South China. These U-bearing granites generally contain high-U-concentration <b>zircons.</b> <b>Zircons</b> in the U-bearing Douzhashan Granite show black rims in cathodoluminescence images, which have very high U concentrations of up to > 25, 000 ppm. The high-U black rim domains of <b>zircons</b> show similar REE patterns to those of low-U mantle domains with oscillatory zoning, but have higher REE concentrations and weaker positive Ce anomalies. The high-U black rim domains of <b>zircons</b> may have formed from late-stage evolved U-rich and H 2 O-rich magma. We carried out a SHRIMP U-Pb dating for these <b>zircons</b> and the results show that the high-U (12, 007 – 26, 706 ppm) rim domains of the <b>zircons</b> always yield older 206 Pb/ 238 U ages (268 ± 9 Ma, n= 5, MSWD= 2. 7) than the low-U (558 – 3667 ppm) mantle domains (228 ± 11 Ma, n= 4, MSWD= 3. 1), and both of these ages are older than the emplacement age (211 ± 3 Ma) of the U-barren Xiangchaoping Granite, which was intruded by the Douzhashan Granite. Hence, these results demonstrate a matrix effect associated with SHRIMP U-Pb analyses of high-U <b>zircons.</b> The reverse discordance for SHRIMP results of high-U <b>zircons</b> was produced by analytical artifact. However, our LA-ICP-MS analyses show that the black rim domains (12, 840 – 26, 018 ppm U) of the <b>zircons</b> have the same U-Pb ages as the low-U mantle domains (1215 – 4075 ppm U). Both domains yield a weighted mean 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 203 ± 4 Ma (n= 13, MSWD= 1. 4), which is consistent with the 40 Ar- 39 Ar age (207 ± 4 Ma) of muscovite from this granite. It thus indicates that LA-ICP-MS U-Pb analyses for high-U <b>zircons</b> (up to 26, 000 ppm U) show an insignificant matrix effect and likely yield more reliable U-Pb ages for the high-U <b>zircons</b> than SHRIMP analyses.
