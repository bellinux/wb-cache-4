An inner metal bond coating contacts the substrate, and a thermal barrier coating covers the bond coating. NiCrAlR, FeCrAlR, and CoCrAlR alloys are satisfactory as bond coating compositions where R=Y or Yb. These alloys contain, by weight, 24. 9 - 36. 7 % chromium, 5. 4 - 18. 5 % aluminum, and 0. 05 to 1. 55 % yttrium or 0. 05 to 0. 53 % ytterbium.

Similarly, 0. 5 wt% multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) dispersed phenolic resin was used to make CNT–C–Ph composite.

A common shade system used is the Vita guide (Vita Classical and Vita 3D Master). There are two types of porcelain restorations: porcelain fused to metal and complete porcelain. For porcelain fused to metal, the black color of metal is first masked with an opaque layer to make it a shade of white and then consecutive layers are built up. The powder corresponding to the desired shade of dentine base is mixed with water, and then fired. Further layers are built up to mimic the natural translucency of the enamel of the tooth. The porcelain is fused to a semi-precious metal or precious metal such as gold, for extra strength.

The catalytic activity in the synthesis of propyl paraben, expressed as moles of ester formed at 5 h/mol acid in the catalyst, decreased when samples obtained from supports thermally treated at higher temperature were used.

Physico-chemical characterization results showed that addition of H 3 PW 12 O 40 acted as both a textural and chemical promoter of <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxide.</b> The incorporation of phosphotungstic acid into the ZrO 2 matrix delayed the sintering of the material and stabilized ZrO 2 in the tetragonal phase. ZrO 2 acidity was also enhanced, developing strong acid sites on its surface. The Pt/ZrO 2 -H 3 PW 12 O 40 catalyst was active for n-pentane isomerization at 250 °C, exhibiting high selectivity to iso-pentane (95 %). This result is probably due to its suitable acidity...|$|R

The anodic stress, i. e. the superposition {{of growth and}} electrostrictive stresses, {{was found to be}} compressive whereas the open-circuit stress was found to be tensile in the growing <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxide.</b> For a constant value of anodization time, the anodic stress was observed to decrease and the opencircuit stress to increase with increasing thickness of the growing <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxide.</b> © 1991...|$|R
