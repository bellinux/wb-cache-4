5000|$|Nevertheless, it {{was known}} that yeast {{extracts}} can ferment sugar {{even in the absence}} of living yeast cells. While studying this process in 1897, Eduard Buchner of Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany, found that sugar was fermented even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture, by an enzyme complex secreted by yeast that he termed <b>zymase.</b> [...] In 1907 he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research and discovery of [...] "cell-free fermentation".|$|E
5000|$|Some science historians {{suggest that}} Eduard Buchner, in his 1897 work, merely {{repeated}} experiments already made by Antoine Béchamp in 1857. This {{is not the}} case : what Buchner obtained with yeast <b>zymase,</b> and without yeast cells, was alcoholic fermentation, while Béchamp had explicitly stated that, in absence of yeast cells, and by use of what he, also, called [...] "zymase", he obtained only sugar inversion and no alcoholic fermentation. According to K.L. Manchester, what Béchamp called [...] "zymase" [...] was invertase.|$|E
50|$|In 1929, Euler-Chelpin and Arthur Harden {{received}} the Nobel Prize in chemistry {{for research on}} alcoholic fermentation of carbohydrates {{and the role of}} enzymes. Arthur Harden dealt only with the chemical effects of bacteria from 1903 with alcoholic fermentation. Harden discovered that the enzyme <b>zymase,</b> discovered by Eduard Buchner, only produces fermentation in interaction with the coenzyme cozymase. Euler-Chelpin, in turn, convincingly described what happens in sugar fermentation and the action of fermentation enzymes using physical chemistry. This explanation led {{to the understanding of the}} important processes taking place in the muscles for the supply of energy.|$|E
50|$|By 1893, Büchner {{was fully}} {{involved}} in seeking the active agent of fermentation. He obtained pure {{samples of the}} inner fluid of yeast cells by pulverizing yeast within a mixture of sand and diatomaceous earth, then squeezing the mixture through a canvas filter. This process avoided the destructive method of using solvents and high temperatures which had foiled previous investigations. He assumed that the collected fluid was incapable of producing fermentation because the yeast cells were dead. However, when he attempted to preserve the fluid in concentrated sugar, he was startled to observe carbon dioxide being released, a sign that fermentation was taking place. Büchner hypothesized that the fermentation was caused by an enzyme which he named <b>zymase.</b> His findings that fermentation {{was the result of}} chemical process both inside and outside cells, were published in 1897.|$|E
50|$|Fermentation {{typically}} {{begins when}} viable baker's yeast or a starter culture {{is added to}} flour and water. Enzymes in the flour and yeast create sugars, which are consumed by the yeast, who in turn produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. Specifically, the grain enzyme diastase begins to convert starch in the grain to maltose. The baker's yeast enzyme maltase converts maltose into glucose, invertase converts any added sucrose to glucose and fructose, and <b>zymase</b> converts glucose and fructose to carbon dioxide gas which makes the dough rise, and alcohol which gives the baked bread flavor. Sourdough starters also produce lactic and acetic acids, further contributing to flavor. When the yeast cells die, they release high quantities of a protease which snip protein strands, and in large dieoffs result in soft, sticky dough, less baked volume and a coarse crumb, but in smaller dieoffs, increase dough extensibility and baked volume.|$|E

40|$|Cozymase {{is one of}} the {{essential}} components of the complex enzyme mixture which effects alcoholic fermentation in the absence of living cells. The separation of the mixture into <b>zymase</b> and cozymase was first accomplished by Harden and Young [1] by means of ultrafiltration through a gelatin-impregnated Chamberland filter candle.

The active constituent of the residue was named <b>zymase,</b> while that constituent of the filtrate responsible for the reactivation of the residue was named cozymase. We studied the purification produced in our material by a variety of reagents.

40|$|THE DETERMINATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN FERMENTING MIXTURES. In {{connection}} with a research on enzymic behavior {{it was necessary to}} develop a simple and expeditious method for the determination of the carbon dioxide formed during fermentations. The most suitable method of carbon dioxide analysis appeared to be the procedure evolved by Cain and Maxwell for the determination of carbon in steel. They absorbed the carbon dioxide, formed by combustion, in known volumes of barium hydroxide solution, and followed the precipitation of barium carbonate by measurements of the electrical conductivity of the solution. The idea has been applied by Spoehr and McGee to the determination of carbon dioxide in their studies on plant respiration. This paper describes the development of this general method so as to render it applicable to studies on fermentation. The technique which was finally adopted consisted in liberating the carbon dioxide from the fermentation mixtures by shaking, carrying it by means of stream of air, free from carbon dioxide to the absorption vessels containing barium hydroxide, and measuring the change in resistance of the barium hydroxide solutions. CO-ZYMASE: A STUDY OF PURIFICATION METHODS. Co-zymase is one of the essential components of the complex enzyme mixture which effects alcoholic fermentation in the absence of living cells. The separation of the mixture into "zymase" and "co-zymase" was first accomplished by Harden and Young by means of ultrafiltration through a gelatin-impregnated Chamberland filter candle. The residue and filtrate as thus prepared possessed, separately, no fermentative action, but when mixed were found to produce a rapid fermentation. The active constituent of the residue was names <b>zymase,</b> while that constituent of the filtrate responsible for the reactivation of the residue was named co-zymase. The mechanism of the activation of the <b>zymase</b> was investiaged by Euler and Myrbach, who {{came to the conclusion that}} the co-zymase was involved in that stage of the process in which inorganic phosphates are converted to carbohydrate esters. The same authors have described a comprehensive and successful series of experiments of the purification of co-zmase. A complete knowledge of the properties and function of co-zymase would be of extreme importance, as it should throw considerable light upon the mechanism of enzyme action as a whole, and should in addition have important bearing upon the entire question of carbohydrate utilization. It has been shown, for example, by Myerhof that a substance, either identical with, or very similar to co-zymase exists in most animal tissue, and the demonstration of a complete identity of the two would have important metabolic connotations. In view of the importance of the field, as well as of the interest of one of us in the problem of carbohydrate utilization, we decided to attempt an extension of the work of Euler and Myrbach on the purification of co-zymase. At the beginning, however, we found that our yeast produced much less active enzyme preparations that those of Euler and Myrbach, as regards both the <b>zymase</b> and co-zymase content, and also that the technic of the above authors with lead precipitation, which enabled them to secure an initial purification of from ten to thirty fold, was in our case practically useless. We therefore abandoned our original intention and have instead studied the purification produced in our material by a variety of reagents. In the investigation we have repeated much of the work done by Euler and Myrbach, and several differences have been found, which appear difficult to explain solely upon the basis of the lower initial purity of our material. As certain of the experiments show distinct promise, we hope to be able to extend the work upon a material of considerably higher original purity, such as was employed by Euler and Myrbach...|$|E
