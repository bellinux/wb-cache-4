Carcass fat percentage tended to be reduced by 7. 4 % in implanted lambs, however, there was no difference in daily fat gain (g/d) in implanted vs non implanted lambs. Yet <b>zeranol</b> increased carcass protein by 33 %(P<. 10). Restricted feeding reduced (P <. 05) daily fat gain (40 %) and CP gain (32 %) but increased (P <. 06) feed to gain (45 %), percentage carcass ash (12 %), and dressing percentage (9 %). <b>Zeranol</b> increased pituitary weight (P <. 001), plasma glucose (P <. 05), mean serum growth hormone (GH; P <. 05), baseline GH (P <. 05), GH pulse amplitude (P <. 05), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF- 1; P <. 00 1) levels by 40 %, 13 %, 42 %, 7 1 %, 33 %, and 53 %, respectively. Restricted feeding reduced(P<. 10) serum IGF-I by 16 %. These results indicate that continuous administration of <b>zeranol</b> alters the GH-IGF-I axis regulation of growth and carcass composition in lambs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Zeranol</b> (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 -Decahydro- 7, 14, 16 -trihydroxy- 3 -methyl- 1 H- 2 - benzoxacyclotetradecin- 1 -one) is a {{synthetic}} oestrogenic agent {{used as an}} animal growth promoter. The effects of occupational exposure to <b>zeranol</b> in 11 exposed workers from a pelletising plant and 14 nonexposed subjects were assessed. A questionnaire showed that more breast symptoms were reported by male and female plant workers compared with non-exposed subjects, although {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. Clinical assessment showed no cases of gynaecomastia in all the male participants. Blood samples analysed by high performance liquid chromatography for <b>zeranol,</b> its precursor zearalenone, and its main metabolites did not show any of these compounds above the laboratory limit of detection. Serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), prolactin, and oestradiol showed no striking differences between the exposed and the non-exposed subjects. Total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) levels did not significantly differ between the two groups but mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) levels were higher in the exposed group; this could be due to relatively high HDL cholesterol in two women exposed to <b>zeranol</b> or relatively low HDL cholesterol in three non-exposed men...|$|E
40|$|An EU project, FAIR 5 -CT- 1997 - 3443, {{has been}} {{undertaken}} to distinguish illegal use of <b>zeranol</b> from consumption of food contaminated with Fusarium spp. toxin. One {{of the tasks}} was development of screening and confirmatory methods of analysis. This paper describes a new method based on two-step clean-up and GC-MS analysis. The first clean-up step is matrix-dependant; the second is applicable to both urine and meat. The MS is operated in negative chemical ionisation mode. The method is quantitative for <b>zeranol</b> and taleranol, alpha- and beta-zearalenol, and zearalenone and qualitative for zearalanone. Validation was performed {{according to the latest}} EU performance criteria (Commission Decision 2002 / 657). For analysis of urine CC(alpha) and CC(beta) for the method (microg L(- 1)) were 0. 06 - 0. 11 for <b>zeranol,</b> 0. 07 - 0. 12 for taleranol, 0. 07 - 0. 11 for alpha-zearalenol, 0. 21 - 0. 36 for beta-zearalenol, 0. 35 - 0. 60 for zearalenone, and 0. 19 - 0. 33 zearalanone. Within-laboratory reproducibility was 16. 2, 11. 2, 31. 9, 30. 1, 26. 6, and 54. 2 % for <b>zeranol,</b> taleranol, alpha-zearalenol, beta-zearalenol, zearalenone, and zearalanone, respectively. It was found that all the compounds are stable in urine at - 20 degrees C for at least a year. Part of the validation program was organisation of a small proficiency study (ringtest) and a correlation study with an LC-MS-MS method developed by the Veterinary Science Division (VSD; Belfast, UK-NI). This study showed there was good correlation between results from both laboratories. The method can be used for quantitative analysis discriminating illegal use of <b>zeranol</b> from consumption of zearalenone-contaminated food...|$|E
