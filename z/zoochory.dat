50|$|<b>Zoochory</b> is the {{dispersal}} of seeds by animals {{and can be}} further divided into three classes.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} <b>zoochory</b> are chiropterochory (by bats), malacochory (by molluscs, mainly {{terrestrial}} snails), ornithochory (by birds) and saurochory (by non-bird sauropsids). <b>Zoochory</b> {{can occur in}} more than one phase, for example through diploendozoochory, where a primary disperser (an animal that ate a seed) along with the seeds it is carrying is eaten by a predator that then carries the seed further before depositing it.|$|E
50|$|It {{is thought}} to be a <b>zoochory</b> plant because ants like the seeds and carry them away to new positions. Allowing the plant to form new colonies elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zoochory</b> is the {{dispersal}} {{of the seeds}} of plants by animals. This is similar to pollination in that the plant produces food resources (for example, fleshy fruit, overabundance of seeds) for animals that disperse the seeds (service).|$|E
50|$|The {{plant has}} narrow, {{floating}} leaves and white ray florets. The fruit is a cypsela with a pappus of coarse bristles and small tufts of hairs that become sticky and slimy when wet. These may be adaptations to <b>zoochory,</b> in which seeds are dispersed by animals, perhaps waterfowl.|$|E
50|$|The Hernandiaceae {{are a very}} {{important}} family; their species inhabit the ecosystems with monoecious, rarely dioecious, deciduous or evergreen trees, shrubs, and perennial climbing plants. The mode of dispersion is variable among the species.Most species of genus Hernandia have red domes, suggesting <b>zoochory,</b> while Hernandia guianensis is hydrochorian in fresh water, and H. nymphaeifolia and Gyrocarpus americanus are hydrochorian in sea water.|$|E
50|$|The flower has 2 notched petals, 2 stamens and a 2-lobed stigma. The open {{flowers are}} well spaced along the stalk {{and there are}} no bracts at base of {{individual}} flower stalks. The fruit consists of 2 equal cells, and usually sets seed. The flower stalks become angled downwards before fruiting. The fruit is a small bur 3.5-5mm which aids the plant's dispersal via <b>zoochory.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{is a major}} {{invasive}} {{plant species}} {{in parts of the}} Eastern United States. [...] It is invasive in urban settings as well as in more pastoral settings. Porcelain berry is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, old fields, and floodplains where sunlight is abundant Birds consume the seeds of porcelain berry and act as a vector to transport it. See <b>Zoochory.</b>|$|E
50|$|When awns {{occur in}} the Geraniaceae, they form the distal (rostral) points of the five carpels, lying {{parallel}} in the style above the ovary. Depending on the species, such awns have various seed dispersal functions, either dispersing the seed by flinging it out (seed ejection), flinging away the entire carpel so that it snaps off (carpel projection), entangling the awn or bristles on passing animals (<b>zoochory),</b> or possibly burying the seed by twisting as it lies on soft soil.|$|E
50|$|S. aeruginosa inhabits rice paddies, lakes, pools, slow flowing rivers, streams, ditches, ponds, and canals called khlongs in Vietnam. It has a benthic {{lifestyle}} and lives mainly in shallow littoral areas, usually in soft mud rich in organic matter. It can actively glide over the sediment or bury into it. This species is not actively migrating, rather its dispersal {{appears to be}} caused passively by floods, animals (<b>zoochory),</b> and accidentally by humans. The species prefers water temperatures typical of subtropical habitats, e.g., 6 to 30.1 C in Lake Tai.|$|E
5000|$|The plant may flower at {{any time}} of the year, but in {{temperate}} regions it blooms mainly in summer and autumn. Flowers are borne in small heads on relatively long peduncles. The heads bear about four or five broad white ray florets, surrounding many tubular yellow disc florets. The fruits are slightly curved, stiff, rough black rods, tetragonal in cross section, about 1 cm long, with typically two to three stiff, heavily barbed awns at their distal ends. The infructescences form [...] spherical burrs about one to two centimeters in diameter. The barbed awns catch onto fur or clothing, and can injure flesh. It is an effective means of seed dispersal by <b>zoochory,</b> as the seeds are transported by animals. This mechanism has helped the plant become a noxious weed in temperate and tropical regions.|$|E
50|$|Protogynous and autocompatible flowers, with a {{reduction}} in selfing through herkogamy, diurnal synchronization of anthesis and the tendency of the same plant to not flower on two consecutive days. Anthesis lasts one or two days, at the height the flower behaves functionally as a female, showing its gynoecium and with open staminodes, while the stamens remain below the flower. The flower later behaves as a male with the intrastaminal staminodes folded inwards hiding the gynoecium and with erect stamens. The staminodes secrete an oily exudate and emit a fruity smell that attracts beetles, particularly of the genus Elleschodes (Curculionidae), that visit the flowers in both phases, in addition the synandria {{fall to the ground}} (cantharophily pollination). The fruit is sweet and aromatic and it is dispersed by birds and mammals (<b>zoochory).</b> The fruit is also eaten by humans.|$|E
5000|$|Two major {{environmental}} {{issues facing the}} AENP: extinction and overpopulation, which are both interrelated. Since the AENP’s original mission was to reintroduce certain mega-herbivores (like the African Elephant and Black Rhinoceros), [...] primary ecological {{efforts were made to}} preserve mammalian species. However, by overlooking the other contributors to this environmental chain, certain plant species have been subjected to overgrazing and trampling, mostly by the elephants of the park. This overgrazing and trampling not only destroys much of the plant life, but also forces it to adapt its physiology to stimuli that are not inherent to its evolutionary progress. Some biologists argue that it is not herbivorization alone that is threatening the flora, but a number of other ecological factors including <b>zoochory</b> and nutrient cycling. Up to 77 species of South African endemic plant species have been listed as “vulnerable to elephant browsing.” ...|$|E
50|$|Animals can {{disperse}} plant {{seeds in}} several ways, all named <b>zoochory.</b> Seeds can be transported {{on the outside}} of vertebrate animals (mostly mammals), a process known as epizoochory. Plant species transported externally by animals can have a variety of adaptations for dispersal, including adhesive mucus, and a variety of hooks, spines and barbs. A typical example of an epizoochorous plant is Trifolium angustifolium, a species of Old World clover which adheres to animal fur by means of stiff hairs covering the seed. Epizoochorous plants tend to be herbaceous plants, with many representative species in the families Apiaceae and Asteraceae. However, epizoochory is a relatively rare dispersal syndrome for plants as a whole; the percentage of plant species with seeds adapted for transport {{on the outside of}} animals is estimated to be below 5%. Nevertheless, epizoochorous transport can be highly effective if seeds attach to wide-ranging animals. This form of seed dispersal has been implicated in rapid plant migration and the spread of invasive species.|$|E
50|$|Janzen, Martin and Barlow mainly {{discussed}} evolutionary anachronisms in {{the context}} of seed dispersal and passive defense strategies exhibited by plants that had evolved alongside disappeared megaherbivores. However, some examples have also been described in animal species. John Byers used the name relict behavior for animal behavior examples. Evolutionary anachronisms, as properly understood, {{should not be confused with}} examples of vestigiality. Though both concepts refer ultimately to organs that evolved to deal with pressures that are no longer present today, in the anachronisms case, the original function of the organ and the capacity of the organism to use it are still retained intact (e.g. the absence of gomphotheres to eat avocados doesn't make the avocado's pulp in any way vestigial, rudimentary or intrinsically incapable of playing its original function of helping disperse the avocado's seeds through <b>zoochory,</b> were a new suitable ecological partner to appear; while a true vestigial organ like the python's pelvic spurs cannot in any way be used to walk again).|$|E
5000|$|Epizoochory is the {{accidental}} dispersal by animals. Differing characteristics of <b>zoochory</b> syndromes include coloured fruits, scented fruits, and different textures for different animals. Endozoochory syndrome characteristics will develop based on palatability {{of the fruit}} by an organism. For example, mammals are attracted to scent of a seed and birds are attracted to colour. Endozoochory syndromes have evolved to be ingested by animals and later bypassed in a new environment so the seed can germinate. Synzoochory should possess hard skins to protect seeds from damage of mouthparts; for example, sharp beaks on animals such as birds or turtles. Epizoochory commonly has burrs or spines to transport seeds {{on the outside of}} animals. These syndromes are highly associated with animals that have fur, while burrs would be lacking on seeds that are dispersed by reptiles because of their smooth skin. It is believed that not all animals that interact with plant fruits are dispersers because some animals do not increase the successful dispersal of seeds but consume and destroy them. Therefore, some animals are dispersers and some are consumers.|$|E
5000|$|Seed {{dispersal}} syndromes {{have not}} been studied in complete breadth for every seed dispersal method. Therefore, further research should be conducted to fill the gaps of knowledge about dispersal syndromes. The following are problems areas or directions research can continue {{on the study of}} seed dispersal syndromes. There is a lack of understanding of morphology in correlation to behavioural traits of dispersers. Research in this area would assist in the understanding of why particular dispersers are selected by plants to enhance reproductive success. Also, understanding movement strategies of factors affecting departure to settlement [...] is important in determining whether seed dispersal syndromes are only affect by plant selection for a disperser. There are few studies concerning phenotype-dependent dispersal and how it affects spatial structures of populations. Distance of dispersal is not researched in enough detail to correlate to a seed dispersal syndrome. More experimental field studies on plant-animal interactions regarding seed dispersal need to be conducted [...] for a thorough understanding of seed dispersal syndromes. There is limited knowledge about the presence of elaisomes and ant behaviour affecting seed dispersal, and how ant-plant interactions evolved under various plant traits. Understanding these interactions would help clarify if myrmecochory did evolve seed dispersal syndromes. Micro and macroevolutionary processes are needed {{to determine the effects of}} biological dispersal of seeds. There cannot be inferences about seed dispersal syndromes without robust phylogenies and evolutionary studies. There is also a gap in the understanding of genetic consequences of <b>zoochory.</b> Using genetics could help clarify if these syndromes were formed at random or if they correspond to evolution of seed dispersal. It is unclear if these seed dispersal syndromes evolved for specialization between plants and animals to increase seed dispersal success or if these syndromes are simply formed from generalist plant-animal interactions. Understanding these relationships would clarify the confusion about seed dispersal syndromes and if they are true examples of evolution increasing plant reproductive success or if they have developed without selective pressures.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} the pollination and dispersal systems among the species in a disjunct marginal cerrado area and to compare the frequency of these systems {{to those found in}} other Neotropical vegetation. The floral and diaspore traits and the pollination and dispersal systems of 176 species were analysed in a cerrado remnant in Southeastern Brazil. The most frequent pollination system was melittophily (63 % of the studied species) with the remaining 37 % distributed among diverse pollination systems. <b>Zoochory</b> was the predominant system of dispersal (44. 9 %). The frequencies of melittophily and <b>zoochory</b> observed in diverse tropical areas were the main feature that allowed the formation of distinct groups in the dendrograms generated by cluster analysis...|$|E
40|$|Global {{occurrence}} of {{many species of}} freshwater cyanobacteria and algae shows, that they are dispersed easily. However, the exact transport mechanisms are not known for most of these microorganisms. This bachelor thesis introduces various mechanisms that could {{be responsible for the}} dispersal of freshwater cyanobacteria and algae. It includes information about four main methods of transport, which is dispersal by water (hydrochory), transport through atmospheric circulation and wind (anemochory), dispersal by animals (<b>zoochory)</b> and by human (anthropochory), who is recently also involved in the transportation of freshwater cyanobacteria and algae. The thesis also summarizes adaptation mechanisms that enable cyanobacteria and algae to colonize new habitats successfully, and discusses possible implications of the dispersal ability for the distribution of microorganisms. Currently there are two contradictory views - cosmopolitan distribution and the {{occurrence of}} endemic species. Despite their importance the dispersal mechanisms of freshwater cyanobacteria and algae are less-studied than it might seem at first sight.

40|$|Pollination and {{dispersal}} {{are critical}} ecological processes that directly affect the reproductive success {{of plants and}} are important for understanding the structure of plant communities. We compiled data on pollination and dispersal syndromes of 406 plant species distributed among different elevations in Área de Proteção Ambiental da Serra de Baturité (APASB) in northeastern Brazil. We aim {{to determine how the}} dispersal and pollination of the flora in the mountainous rainforest of APASB are affected by climate, relief and growth form. We hypothesized that plant community is comprised of different ecological groups based on biotic and abiotic syndromes. Melittophily was the most common (57 %) pollination syndrome followed by non-specialized and ornithophily (7 %). We found that 64 % of species exhibited <b>zoochory,</b> 19 % exhibited anemochory and 17 % exhibited autochory. Pollination syndromes differed significantly only between types of growth form. Dispersal syndromes differed between topology, growth form and elevation. Six ecological groups were formed based on the interaction between dispersal-pollination and growth form, with predominantly <b>zoochory</b> in woody and anemochory in non-woody plants. Water availability may be the principal factor responsible for variation among dispersal syndromes. The proportion of ruderal species in the non-woody component explains the differences in syndromes between growth forms...|$|E
40|$|Vectors that {{underpin}} {{the natural}} dispersal of {{invasive alien species}} are frequently unknown. In particular, the passive dispersal (<b>zoochory)</b> of one organism (or propagule) by another, usually more mobile animal, remains poorly understood. Field observations of the adherence of invasive freshwater bivalves to other organisms have prompted us to assess the importance of <b>zoochory</b> in the spread of three prolific invaders: zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha; quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis; and Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. An extensive, systematic search of the literature was conducted across multiple on-line scientific databases using various search terms and associated synonyms. In total, only five publications fully satisfied the search criteria. It appears that some fish species can internally transport viable adult D. polymorpha and C. fluminea specimens. Additionally, literature indicates that veligers and juvenile D. polymorpha can adhere to the external surfaces of waterbirds. Overall, literature suggests that zoochorous dispersal of invasive bivalves is possible, but likely a rare occurrence. However, even {{the establishment of a}} few individuals (or a single self-fertilising C. fluminea specimen) can, over-time, result in a substantial population. Here, we highlight knowledge gaps, identify realistic opportunities for data collection, and suggest management protocols to mitigate the spread of invasive alien species...|$|E
30|$|Higher plants use {{a variety}} of {{dispersal}} agents such as wind, water, animals and people [1]. Dispersal by animals is known as <b>zoochory.</b> The dispersal of seeds or fruit (known as diaspores, more often fruit than seeds) by attachment to animal fur or feathers is known as epizoochory. Diaspores of this kind do not provide valuable nutrition to the animal to which they attach themselves nor do they actively attract animals to parent plants. Instead, they have special structures such as hooks, barbs, burrs and spines or sticky secretions, and they detach easily from the parent plant.|$|E
40|$|A new {{locality}} of rye sedge Carex secalina, {{a critically}} endangered species was discovered {{on an island}} of Lake Kusowo, {{in the vicinity of}} Bydgoszcz (Kuyavian-Pomeranian Province), in June 2015. The species was found in a breeding colony of black-headed gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus. The population size was estimated at least at 30 individuals and all of them produced generative shoots. This locality of C. secalina is the northernmost in Poland and the only ascertained, apart from Inowrocław Plain. Colonization of the island by C. secalina was caused, probably, by <b>zoochory</b> as a result of accidental bringing of propagules by gulls, together with nesting material from outside the colony...|$|E
40|$|Este estudo foi desenvolvido visando identificar as proporções entre as síndromes de dispersão e os tipos de frutos encontrados em três áreas: nascente (Cerrado Rupestre), meio e foz (mata ciliar Floresta Estacional Semidecidual) ao longo do Rio Pindaíba, MT. No trecho de nascente, 55, 6 % das espécies amostradas eram zoocóricas, 43 % anemocóricas e apenas 1, 4 % autocóricas, respectivamente. No trecho do meio, 85, 7 % das espécies eram zoocóricas, 11, 7 % anemocóricas e apenas 1, 3 % autocóricas. Na foz do Rio Pindaíba foram encontradas 77, 5 % de espécies zoocóricas, 20 % de anemocóricas e apenas 2, 5 % de autocóricas. A hipótese levantada neste estudo foi de que em áreas abertas (nascente) a proporção de espécies anemocóricas seria maior do que em ambientes fechados (meio e foz), onde predominaria a zoocoria. Entretanto, não houve diferença significativa nas proporções de espécies anemocóricas e zoocóricas na nascente (Cerrado Rupestre), enquanto no meio e na foz (mata ciliar) as proporções de zoocoria foram maiores. Ambientes florestais, estruturalmente mais complexos com menor circulação do vento e menor incidência luminosa, requerem estratégias de dispersão mais direcionadas e previsíveis como a zoocoria. This {{study was}} carried out to {{identify}} the proportions between the dispersal syndromes and fruit types found in three regions: source (rupestrian cerrado), middle zone and estuary (riparian semideciduous forest) along the River Pindaíba-MT. At the source, 55. 6 % of shrub-tree species are zoochoric, 43 % are anemochoric and only 1. 4 % are autochoric. In the middle zone, 85. 7 % of species are zoochoric, 11. 7 % anemochoric and only 1. 3 % are autochoric. At the estuary of River Pindaíba, we found 77. 5 % of zoochoric species, 20 % of anemochory and only 2. 5 % of autochory. Our hypothesis for the study was that, in open areas (source), the proportion of anemochoric species would be higher than in closed environments (middle zone and mouth), with the predominance of <b>zoochory.</b> However, {{there was no significant}} difference in the proportions of anemochoric and zoochoric species for the source (rupestrian cerrado), whereas in the middle zone and at the estuary(riparian), the proportions of <b>zoochory</b> were higher.

40|$|The endozoochorous {{dispersal}} of seeds by mammals and birds between distinct vegetation communities was assessed {{to determine the}} importance of these processes in coastal dune field management. Isolated pockets of thicket vegetation (bush-pockets) within a large coastal dune field provided the opportunity to study vertebrate seed dispersal and its contribution to their origin and maintenance. Mammalian and avian faeces were collected for the quantification of seeds dispersed via endozoochory. Birds and mammals showed considerable overlap, dispersing intact seeds of 17 and 29 plant species, respectively, but mammals dispersed a greater diversity and size range than birds. Extrapolation of mammalian faecal data indicates an annual input of 23 million intact seeds to the dune field. Significantly more seeds are deposited by mammals and birds in the bush-pockets than on open sand, and birds deposited greater numbers of seeds nearer the seed source. <b>Zoochory</b> appears to be critical for the maintenance of the bush-pocket habitats through the {{dispersal of}} climax woody plant species into the dune field. Directional dispersal by birds and mammals to the bush-pockets is considered to be responsible for the maintenance and possible origin of these bush-pockets. The high number of exotic plant propagules dispersed by both avian and mammalian <b>zoochory</b> highlights the importance of management of the Alexandria Coastal Dunefield (ACD) beyond the reserve boundaries. In a dynamic system such as the ACD which is within a declared nature reserve, the continued existence of the bush-pockets may depend on the maintenance, beyond the reserve boundaries, of a reservoir of not only plant material but vertebrate dispersers as well.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} holoparasitic plants {{have focused on}} taxonomic or {{systematic}} issues. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the ecological aspects of parasitism of Langsdorffia hypogaea (Balanophoraceae) in the Pantanal wetlands. Individuals of L. hypogaea were dug out by hand and the host trees were identified. Eighty-eight percent of host trees exhibited <b>zoochory</b> dispersal syndrome. Protium heptaphyllum and Cordiera sessilis represented 50 % of the sampled trees. Both species are evergreen and are preferentially shade-tolerant species growing under the canopy of other trees. Fecal sample of collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) had seeds from both the host tree (Protium sp.) and the parasite L. hypogaea. We therefore propose the hypothesis that P. tajacu play a role as a seed disperser and may affect root parasitism...|$|E
40|$|Response to habitat {{fragmentation}} may not {{be generalized}} among species, in particular for plant communities {{with a variety of}} dispersal traits. Calcareous grasslands {{are one of the most}} species-rich habitats in Central Europe, but abandonment of traditional management has caused a dramatic decline of calcareous grassland species. In the Southern Franconian Alb in Germany, reintroduction of rotational shepherding in previously abandoned grasslands has restored species diversity, and it has been suggested that sheep support seed dispersal among grasslands. We tested the effect of rotational shepherding on demographic and genetic connectivity of calcareous grassland specialist plants and whether the response of plant populations to shepherding was limited to species dispersed by animals (<b>zoochory).</b> Specifically, we tested competing dispersal models and source and focal patch properties to explain landscape connectivity with patch-occupancy data of 31 species. We fitted the same connectivity models to patch occupancy and nuclear microsatellite data for the herb Dianthus carthusianorum (Carthusian pink). For 27 species, patch connectivity was explained by dispersal by rotational shepherding regardless of adaptations to <b>zoochory,</b> whereas population size (16 % species) and patch area (0 % species) of source patches were not important predictors of patch occupancy in most species. [Correction made after online publication, February 25, 2014 : Population size and patch area percentages were mistakenly inverted, and have now been fixed. ] Microsite diversity of focal patches significantly increased the model variance explained by patch occupancy in 90 % of the species. For D. carthusianorum, patch connectivity through rotational shepherding explained both patch occupancy and population genetic diversity. Our results suggest shepherding provides dispersal for multiple plant species regardless of their dispersal adaptations and thus offers a useful approach to restore plant diversity in fragmented calcareous grasslands...|$|E

Between October 2007 and September 2008, monthly collections identified 144 species. As for dispersal syndromes, <b>zoochory</b> prevails, followed by autochory and anemochory. The gallery forest is a heterogeneous formation that shelters floristic elements shared with the Atlantic rain forest, the Amazonian forest, semi-deciduous seasonal forests and dry forests of the Pantanal.

40|$|Ever since Darwin (1859), the {{dispersal}} of species from continents to oceanic islands, and between such islands, {{has been the}} subject of considerable speculation. These islands are those arising from the seafloor as a result of underwater geologic activity, typically volcanic or coralline, that have never been connected to continental land masses.
