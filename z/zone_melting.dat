5|$|The {{earliest}} {{routes to}} elemental boron involved {{the reduction of}} boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron {{for use in the}} semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the <b>zone</b> <b>melting</b> or Czochralski processes.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with <b>zone</b> <b>melting</b> or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Sintering powders of {{samarium}} oxide and boron, in vacuum, {{yields a}} powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their volume ratio {{can be controlled}} through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or <b>zone</b> <b>melting</b> techniques, relying on the different melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580°C), SmB4 (about 2300°C) and SmB66 (2150°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the local}} Seebeck {{coefficient}} distribution is helpful {{for the development}} of novel thermoelectric materials. Seebeck coefficient distributions of both <b>zone</b> <b>melted</b> and hot pressed samples of I-doped Bi 2 Te 3 based alloys were measured using microscopic Seebeck coefficient mapping method. Seebeck coefficient differences up to 40 – 50 μV/K were found between different locations on the same sample. There is no visible relationship between the microscopic Seebeck coefficient distribution and the local surface morphology and element distributions. It is suggested that the local Seebeck coefficient variations were mainly originated from the lattice defects for the <b>zone</b> <b>melted</b> sample and also due to the grain orientation for the hot pressed sample. ...|$|R

25|$|The annual {{precipitation}} {{in the lower}} parts of the park is 700–800mm. At the altitude of 1000–2200m it varies between 1050 and 1200mm, and at higher altitudes the precipitation decreases. The driest month is February and the most humid months are May and June. The annual evaporation is 450–500mm at the altitude of 800–1000m and 350–400mm at 1000–2200m, which determines a positive water balance. At higher altitudes the humidity of the air is 80–85% and falls to 30% {{in the cold and}} dry winter days. Due to the orientation of the slopes in the park, permanent snow cover is formed by mid-December. The duration of the snow cover at around 1200m is 160–180 days and reaches 190–200 days at higher altitudes. In March the thickness of the snow cover is 60–70cm in the lower areas of the park but it can surpass 200cm in the alpine <b>zone.</b> <b>Melting</b> begins during the first ten days of April. In the cirques the snow firn, which forms specific natural habitat, melts in mid-June.|$|E

The microstructural characteristics and mechanical properties of ZM 5 {{magnesium alloy}} joint were studied by optical microscopy, microhardness and tensile testers. The {{results show that}} the TIG weld joint of ZM 5 magnesium alloy is composed of heat affected <b>zone,</b> partially <b>melted</b> <b>zone</b> and weld metal.

40|$|Magma supply {{rate from}} depth {{to the summit}} at Kīlauea volcano, Hawai'i is not {{constant}} through time. Even during the current Pu'u 'Ō'ō-Kupaianaha eruption (1983 -present), a surge in supply occurred from 2003 - 2007. This surge was accompanied by summit inflation, increased CO 2 emissions, and finally culminated in a dike intrusion and surface eruption. Recent work has suggested that a surge in supply {{is a result of}} an increase in dissolved volatiles in the <b>melt</b> <b>zone.</b> Alternatively, the surge could come from a mechanical change in the <b>melt</b> <b>zone,</b> perhaps as an increase in permeability or melt production. I develop a numerical model of two-phase flow between the <b>melt</b> <b>zone</b> and summit at Kīlauea to explore the role of volatile composition, conduit geometry, and pressure in the <b>melt</b> <b>zone</b> on supply rate. Results suggest that volatiles have a limited role in increasing supply, a dike-shaped conduit is likely, and pressure increases in the <b>melt</b> <b>zone</b> drive changes in supply.
