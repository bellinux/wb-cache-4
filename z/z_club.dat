40|$|Ankara : The Institute for Graduate Studies in Economics and Social Sciences of Bilkent University, 1997. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 1997. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 88 - 89. Musa Kaz 1 m Efendi was Seyh-ul-islam {{six times}} in the Second Constitutional Period (1908 - 1919) of the Ottoman Empire {{and a member of}} the "Great Scientific Council" established by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). Between the years 1895 and 1918 he published many articles in journals and newspapers, as well as making speeches at the Sehzadeba <b>z</b> <b>Club</b> of the CUP. As a medrese scholar in the years 1893 - 1908, he wrote within the intellectual tradition of Islamic Modernism, expressing views in line with those of the Young Ottoman thinkers of the 1860 s and 1870 s, defending Islam as a source of civilization and progress. He accepted the need for reform to match the material progress of the West, but argued that for this too Islam could be the source. The traditional side of his attitudes perhaps most reveals itself in his writings on the subject of women. After the beginning of the Second Constitutional Period, the nature of his writings underwent a subtle change when he chose to cooperate with the Committee of Union and Progress. Many of the members of the CUP regarded Islam unfavorably or, at best, as a means of popularizing policies, of winning over the ulema and of creating social stability. Musa Kaz 1 m Efendi's writings of this period, while still claiming Islam as a positive force and as the basis for reforms, were directed towards justifying the policies of the CUP, even where these policies tended towards secularization. Musa Kaz 1 m's career showed that members of the ulema could obtain office and a voice within the new constitutional regime, but whether such a solution favored the objectives oflslamic Modernists is more doubtful.

50|$|In 1984, twenty-two-year-old Khabouth {{bought a}} defunct gay club The Manatee at 11A St. Joseph Street in the Yonge & Wellesley area and after renovations opened <b>Club</b> <b>Z.</b> The entire project was financed with {{approximately}} C$30,000 that Khabouth secured by combining a few thousands of personal savings, a bank loan against his Audi car, and money borrowed from his stepfather. After buying {{the club for}} C$15,000, he earmarked the rest for the decor. Decorating the basement space modestly with, among other things, merchandise from Canadian Tire, he painted the floors himself and rented a sound system from Long & McQuade while {{in an effort to}} make the walls shiny he covered them with the metal sheeting used to make heating ducts. He looked to build regular crowds by catering to various social strata and musical tastes — the club's specialty nights included house music Saturdays (one of the first nightclubs in the city to play that type of music) and gay nights on Sundays for the population of the nearby Gay Village. Khabouth worked hard trying to ensure <b>Club</b> <b>Z</b> becomes a success, driving down to Detroit with his DJs during workweek in order to get the latest tunes for the weekend due to nonavailability of house music in Canadian record stores. Still, the first six months were a tough go and it wasn't long before Khabouth fell five months behind on his rent payments. Fortunately for Khabouth, liking the young man's drive, the landlord showed extreme patience. Desperately trying to generate some buzz for <b>Club</b> <b>Z,</b> Khabouth even turned to displaying snakes and cougars during club nights courtesy of a local service renting exotic animals for film work and photo shoots. Still, the club didn't really take off until an infamous Halloween weekend incident when a tiger that had been brought and displayed in the enclosure of the front window thinking it would attract clientele, broke a window after the club had closed for the night, prompting the arrival of police with rifles, the Toronto Humane Society, and local media. The coverage received in the printed press (the incident made the Toronto Star front page) and on television brought increased popularity to <b>Club</b> <b>Z,</b> eventually ensuring profitability for the venue that had been on the verge of financial collapse several times up to that point.|$|R
50|$|Late 1992 Gordon {{was invited}} into the world-famous {{recording}} studios known as The Hit Factory by Pete Waterman {{and together they}} produced the UK Single No: 3 hit record, West End feat.

50|$|Soon {{after opening}} Stilife, Khabouth sold <b>Club</b> <b>Z,</b> a Yonge and Wellesley area club {{that was his}} first {{entrepreneurial}} effort in the hospitality industry, in order to fully concentrate on his ambitious new venue. In complete contrast to <b>Club</b> <b>Z</b> that was open to anyone who wanted to dance, Khabouth {{went out of his}} way to make every single aspect of Stilife exclusive. The goal was attracting a more mature, sophisticated, and free-spending urban crowd rather than settling for suburban youth that many downtown Toronto clubs catered to at the time. Inspired by the look of the recently opened Diamond club at Sherbourne Street whose interior differed significantly from the standard brass-and-mirrors decor of the numerous clubs in the city, Khabouth devoted particular attention to his new venue's interior design. He hired Toronto-based Yabu Pushelberg design studio (consisting of George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg who would go on to achieve international renown, but were still largely unknown outside of the city) to come up with ideas for the club's interior. They traveled to New York City for inspiration, ending up with dark, sculptured aesthetic and edgy, industrial design, which featured a heavy use of polished steel, concrete, and mosaic tile. The chain walls created by long chains hanging off the club's ceiling were a particularly big draw. Furthermore, Stilife's core interior elements referenced Art Deco, Salvador Dalí, and Blade Runner.|$|R
