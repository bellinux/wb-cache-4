Target screening procedures are limited to a small fraction of these substances, due to the inability to obtain standards for all that substances and the ignorance of the existence of many of them. Recent advances in high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) have opened up new windows of opportunity in the field of complex samples analysis.

However, in most cases many of the peaks showing greater intensity not correspond to substances included in the target and suspect screening lists. These substances are potentially relevant, due to their high concentration, and their identification is environmentally important. Nevertheless, full identification of unknown compounds is often difficult and there is no guarantee of a successful outcome.

Different amounts of each sorbent were used because of the varying properties of the sorbents (density and surface area). Tests were performed using a 2400 -micron screen over 30 minutes at 125 GPM (approximately 50 % of the CDS unit's nominal flow capacity). Used motor oil was introduced into the feed of the CDS at approximately 25 mgIL, which is generally the upper limit of oil and grease concentrations found in stormwaters. Oil and grease was measured at various times to determine the removal efficiency. Background oil and grease was measured as well as oil and grease released from the sorbents after the influent oil and grease was reduced to <b>zero.</b> <b>Removal</b> efficiencies for most sorbents varied from 63 to 96 % depending upon conditions.

40|$|Ultrafiltration (UF) is {{a proven}} {{technology}} in water treatment nowadays. However, fouling remains {{a major challenge}} {{in the operation of}} UF, especially in regard to colloidal NOM fouling. In general, a number of colloidal NOM fouling mechanisms may occur, such as adsorption, gel formation. Colloidal NOM fouling is influenced by multivalent cations, ionic strength and pH. In order to control membrane fouling, different pretreatments such as powder activated carbon adsorption, lime softening, ion exchange, conventional media filtration and coagulation with inorganic and polymeric coagulant have been investigated. In-line coagulation is the most commonly used pretreatment for UF of surface water. However, the problem with in-line coagulation is that a large amount of backwash-derived waste sludge containing dosed coagulants is produced. Since the backwash waste sludge with coagulant has to be treated before its discharge (in especially Western Europe), this option creates additional cost for the membrane treatment plant (up to 20 % of the total cost of the whole plant). This dissertation investigates the technical possibility of controlling the UF fouling by backwashing with low ionic strength water (demineralized water in the Netherlands), {{in order to reduce the}} ionic strength and the amount of multivalent cations and thus reduce NOM fouling. Chapter 1 briefly introduces this dissertation. The effectiveness of deminerlaized water backwashing is generally investigated on a pilot scale (with a 2. 4 m 2 membrane) in Chapter 2. Results show that regarding the removal of NOM foulants via hydraulic backwashes, demineralized water is better than UF and NF permeate. That is probably due to the absence of cations, reducing the charge screening effect and/or Ca-bridging effect between the negatively charged membrane and NOM, leading to a restoration of repulsion force and consequently an easy removal of fouling layer. However, it is not clear which components in backwash water lead to the low foulant removal in this chapter. Therefore, Chapter 3 investigates the influence of backwash water composition on fouling control. Different amount of CaCl 2 and NaCl was dosed in demineralized water to test their effect on fouling control. It became clear that the presence of monovalent and divalent cations in backwash water reduces the fouling control efficiency. Moreover, by isolating the organic matter in UF permeate for backwashing, it is found that the organic matter in UF permeate itself does not cause fouling problems when they are in backwash water. In terms of the influence of monovalent and divalent cations, both the elimination of the charge screening effect and the breakdown of the calcium bridging effect are possible mechanisms to explain this improvement. Therefore, these two effects are presumed to be the mechanisms of demineralized water backwashing. The investigation of the hypotheses of demineralized water backwashing is reported in Chapter 4, including the charge screening and the calcium bridging effects. By determining the zeta potential of the membranes and the colloidal NOM compounds at different conditions, the impact of pH and electrolyte valence and concentration on their charge was assessed. Furthermore, the adsorption of calcium on the membranes and the NOM compounds was also illustrated. Results showed that a membrane became less negatively charged when the pH decreased and the concentration of electrolyte increased, proving the presence of the charge screening effect. Furthermore, divalent cation has a much stronger effect on the increase of membrane zeta potential than monovalent cations which is generally in consistent with the DLVO theory. Calcium ions indeed adsorbed on either new or fouled membranes, and bridged NOM and membranes afterwards. However, the interaction of calcium with fouled membranes is more substantial than with new membranes. However, the charge screening effect played a dominant role in the membrane fouling and fouling control by demineralized water backwashing. Most of the fouling caused by calcium bridging is difficult to remove even with a demineralized water backwash. Chapter 5 illustrates the effectiveness of demineralized water backwashing on ultrafiltration fouling of different fractions of NOM. Results of natural waters show the same fouling removal via demineralized water backwashing as the previous chapters. Furthermore, LC-OCD analysis of Schie Canal water showed that biopolymers can be flushed away by hydraulic backwashes of either demineralized water or UF permeate. Compared to almost <b>zero</b> <b>removal</b> of humics and LMW substances by UF permeate backwashes, demineralized water backwashing was able to remove a substantial amount of humics, and a small amount of LMW substances. Fouling of sodium alginate model compound showed a high reversibility no matter what kind of backwash water was used. This is also consistent with the LC-OCD analysis of Schie Canal water. However, not all biopolymers were removed by hydraulic backwashes. A low fouling reversibility was observed for BSA fouling, but BSA may be in the part of unremoved biopolymers with demineralized water. No improvement in fouling control for fouling of Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) was observed as well when demineralized water was used for the backwash. This is probably because the calcium bridging via carboxyl functional groups is the main mechanism for SRHA fouling, which is difficult to break down. Since the charge screening effect is the main mechanism of demineralized water backwashing, theoretically speaking, its application on seawater treatment is also possible. Chapter 6 demonstrates that demineralized water backwashing can substantially improve seawater UF fouling control, similar to the previous findings in surface canal water. However, the duration of a successful demineralized water backwash should be extended from one to two minutes. This is due to the high salinity of seawater and thus more demineralized water was required to dilute the seawater and limit a higher dispersion effect of seawater than surface water. Monovalent cations in backwash water showed their impact on the fouling control efficiency, indicating the existence of a charge screening effect. Furthermore, the different UF membrane fouling behaviors in winter and spring indicated the impact of a seasonal influence on UF membrane fouling. In spring, the membrane showed more fouling probably due to the algae bloom which is widely considered an important fouling factor. The results of the long-term experiment reconfirmed the effectiveness of backwashing with SWRO permeate (similar quality as demineralized water) on the fouling control of seawater UF. Since it is very easy to access SWRO permeate in a UF-RO desalination plant, this approach can be implemented easily. In order to apply this technique in industry, optimization work was conducted on a pilot scale with a standard membrane element (40 m 2) and reported in Chapter 7. Results show that SWRO permeate (having similar qualities as demineralized water) backwashing substantially improved the seawater UF fouling control, consistent with the previous studies with small-scale membrane modules. The effectiveness of SWRO permeate backwashing on UF fouling control was observed at a recovery rate up to 95. 8 % during a low fouling period. Furthermore, the results of the DEMIFLUSH pilot were similar to the Evides desalination plant having the same operational settings, suggesting that the results obtained from the DEMIFLUSH pilot are applicable to full-scale plants. However, the results of high fouling period are missing. If the optimization results can be repeated in high fouling period as well, the application of SWRO permeate is also economically feasible due to the low consumption of SWRO permeate. Optimization work should be continued to reduce the consumption of SWRO permeate or demineralized water, since the usage of these water is expensive.

Both experiments provided evidence that articulation-induced artifacts may start up to 300 Â ms or more prior to voice onset or voice key onsetâdepending on the specific measure; they are highly similar in topography across many different phoneme patterns and differ mainly in their time course and amplitude.

Epibiota are major biogenic components of hard substrata in marine habitats, particularly on artificial structures such as pier pilings, and have the potential to influence organisms associated with these structures. This study tested hypotheses about effects of epibiota on abundances of fishes associated with pilings in Middle Harbour, Sydney. Amount of epibiota had no effect on abundances of most species of fish, suggesting that epibiota are not important resources for these species. Abundances of the hulafish, Trachinops taeniatus, were, however, found to be greater around pilings with large than pilings with small amounts of epibiota at one site, at each of two times. Experimental removals of epibiota from pilings were done to test the hypothesis that epibiota are an important resource to T. taeniatus. Despite great temporal fluctuations in abundances over the duration of the experiment, the response of T. taeniatus to the removal of epibiota from pilings was as predicted, falling to <b>zero</b> following <b>removal</b> of epibiota.

A combined photocatalytic-electrochemical system using TiO 2 /Ti plate as anode and {{stainless steel}} as cathode achieves the simultaneous decomplexation of Ni-EDTA and recovery of nickel. Ni-EDTA was efficiently destroyed in photoelectrocatalytic process in comparison with individual photocatalytic and electro-oxidation process. At 60 min, removal efficiencies of Ni-EDTA were 75 %, 12 %, and 5 %, respectively. At 180 min, the removal efficiency of Ni-EDTA in the photocatalysis and electrolysis processes is only 21 % and 18 %, respectively. By contrast, nearly 90 % Ni-EDTA is removed in the photoelectrocatalytic process. The recovery percentage of nickel {{was determined to be}} 45 %, 21 %, and 5 % in the photoelectrocatalysis, electrolysis, and photocatalysis process, respectively. The deposition of nickel ions at the cathode was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis and the nickel species were identified via X-ray photoelectron spectra as nickel with <b>zero</b> value. The <b>removal</b> of Ni-EDTA and recovery of nickel ions increased with the current density and favored at acid conditions. Intermediates detected using a capillary electrophoresis and a high performance liquid chromatography includes Ni-NTA, glycine, maleic acid, glycolic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, and oxamic acid were identified.

40|$|Standard Kt/Vurea (stdKt/V) is a {{hypothetical}} continuous clearance in patients treated with intermittent hemodialysis {{based on the}} generation rate of urea nitrogen and the average predialysis urea nitrogen. Previous equations to estimate stdKt/V were derived using a fixed-volume model. To determine the impact of fluid removal as well as residual urea clearance on stdKt/V, we modeled 245 hemodialysis sessions (including conventional 3 /week, in-center 6 /week, and at-home nocturnal 6 /week) in 210 patients enrolled in the Frequent Hemodialysis Network Daily and Nocturnal clinical trials. To examine the role of fluid removal, modeled stdKt/V was compared to stdKt/V estimated from a previously published simplified equation. In a subgroup of 45 sessions with residual urea clearance over 1. 5 ml/min, the contribution of residual urea clearance to stdKt/V was measured. For all dialysis schedules, the fixed-volume equation predicted stdKt/V well when both fluid removal and residual urea clearance were set to <b>zero.</b> When fluid <b>removal</b> was included, modeled stdKt/V was slightly underestimated for all three modes of hemodialysis. The shortfall correlated directly with weekly fluid removal and inversely with modeled urea volume. Modeled stdKt/V compressed residual urea clearance to about 70 % of its measured value and the fractional downsizing significantly correlated inversely with treatment Kt/V.

A 97 A y-intercept (corresponding to etch dur-ing the transfer and rinse) is found with buffering; this zero-time intercept is only 13 A without the NH 4 F buffer. Thus {{it is impossible to}} etch less than 97 A of TEOS in 40 weight percent (w/o) buffered hydrofluoric acid; for korophosphosili-cate glass the minimum exceeds 140 A. Buffering increases the etch rate of thermal oxide from 20 to 65 A/mm, but the y-intercept is invariant. The etch rate of BPSG in 0. 49 % HF is independent of buffering until the NH 4 F level exceeds 15 w/o, while TEOS and thermal oxide etch rates increase by a factor of five over the same range. The selectivity of TEOS to thermal oxide is strongly time dependent in both buffered and unbuffered HE The rinse rate for TEOS in BHF does not depend on the flow velocity of the rinse water; stagnant water shows identical results with high flow rates.

Beginning 8 h after oestradiol, saline or GnRH (500 ng, i. v.) was given at 2 h intervals with or without 8 h transport beginning 0. 5 h before the first GnRH injection (late transport) and effects were compared with those observed during early transport, that is, starting 2. 5 h before the first GnRH injection. In all ewes, GnRH alone induced a maximum LH response of 1. 9 =+-. 4 ng ml=-after the first challenge. The response was enhanced (P < 0. 01) after the second and third GnRH injections (7. 4 =+- 1. 4 ng ml=-and 7. 6 =+-. 7 ng ml=-, respectively). This self-priming effect after the second GnRH was reduced by late transport (7. 4 =+-. 4 versus 4. 2 =+-. 8 ng ml=-; P < 0. 05) but not early transport, that is, transport initiated closer to the time of GnRH administration had greater suppressive effects on LH secretion.

The sites also had a wide range of nitrate inputs, soil characteristics, and vegetation types. Dissolved forms of N in groundwater and associated hydrological parameters were measured at all sites; these data were used to calculate nitrate removal by the riparian buffers. Nitrate removal rates (expressed as the difference between the input and output nitrate concentration in relation to the width of the riparian zone) were mainly positive, ranging from 5 % m 1 to 30 % m 1, except for a few sites where the values were close to <b>zero.</b> Average N <b>removal</b> rates were similar for herbaceous (4. 43 % m 1) and forested (4. 21 % m 1) sites. Nitrogen removal efficiency was not affected by climatic variation between sites, and no significant seasonal pattern was detected. When nitrate inputs were low, a very large range of nitrate removal efficiencies was found both in the forested and in the nonforested sites. However, sites receiving nitrate inputs above 5 mg N L 1 showed an exponential negative decay of nitrate removal efficiency (nitrate removal efficiency 33. 6 e 0. 11 NO 3 input, r 2 0. 33, P 0. 001). Hydraulic gradient was also negatively related to nitrate removal (r 0. 27, P 0. 05) at these sites. On the basis of this intersite comparison, we conclude that the removal of nitrate by biological mechanisms (for example, denitrification, plant uptake) in the riparian areas is related more closely to nitrate load and hydraulic gradient than to climatic parameters...|$|R

In this study, a compound flocculant (CFAL-Chitosan) {{was developed for}} HABs mitigation where chitosan was modified by coal fly ash leachate (CFAL). When using optimized dosage of CFAL-Chitosan flocculant, the zeta potential of Microcystis aeruginosa (M. A.) flocs stayed close to <b>zero</b> and algal <b>removal</b> efficiency plateaued over 90 % in a wide dosage range from 3 to 6 mg L- 1. For chitosan without CFAL, removal efficiency peaked at 3 mg L- 1 with a maximum removal efficiency of 81 %, which quickly decreased as the dosage increased (> 3 mg L- 1) due to the fast reversal of zeta potential. This indicated that CFAL-Chitosan could maintain a better removal efficiency over a wide dosage range {{as a result of}} improved charge neutralization compared with the chitosan only treatment. The flocs of CFAL-Chitosan were larger and denser than produced in the presence of chitosan without CFAL. However, excessive CFAL beyond the optimized dose inhibited M. A. removal due to hydrolysis and declining molecular weight of chitosan that weakened the bridging netting properties, where surface charge reversal happened within a narrow dosage range and the removal dosage curve became parabolic. The pH and metal residuals that were assumed to pose a threat to the aquatic environment were not significantly affected by adding optimized dosage of CFAL-Chitosan. The study provides a HABs control method using a cheap material of CFA. Further studies are needed to check the potential influence of leachable metals and persistent organic pollutants in CFA under a wide range of environmental condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb {{have been}} {{analysed}} in suspended matter and water {{samples from the}} Scheldt estuary, collected during five cruises between May 1982 and May 1983. In order to evaluate the overall metal behaviour in the estuary, continuous longitudinal profiles of the total, the particulate and the dissolved metal concentrations are discussed in relation to various specific physico-chemical parameters. By means of correlation and multi-regression techniques, several estuarine processes could be identified which dominate and/or control the behaviour of the individual trace metals in three distinct areas of the Scheldt estuary. The behaviour of the four selected metals was found to show some common features, but is besides this also characterised by many individual and specific properties. The total metal concentrations seem to co-vary well with the turbidity in the maximum turbidity zone between salinities 2 and 10 psu. In the downstream area a dilution profile is observed for the total metal concentrations of Cu and Cd {{as well as for}} the dissolved concentrations of all metals. Dissolved metal production rates are high for Cu and Cd, but much lower for Zn and Pb, confirming the different longitudinal dissolved metal profiles. For Cu and Cd these dissolved metal profiles are characterised by a broad mobilisation area, covering the whole middle estuary. Pb on the other hand, shows a more confined mobilisation area, and for Zn no such area was found. During winter the dissolved metal production rates seem to be controlled, predominantly, by desorption processes. During summer dissolved metal production is correlated mainly to the dissolved oxygen content, suggesting the domination of redox processes solely or in combination with desorption processes. In some cases, co-existent with nearly <b>zero</b> oxygen concentrations, <b>removal</b> of dissolved metals was observed, possibly reflecting precipitation reactions. Longitudinal particulate metal profiles all show a negative deviation versus the dilution profile.

40|$|Sub) {{tropical}} {{highlands of}} the world are densely populated and intensively cropped. Agricultural sustainability problems resulting from soil erosion and fertility decline have arisen throughout this agro-ecological zone. Major changes are needed in land, livestock and water management in line with traditional lifestyles and customs to remedy the agricultural system. Can conservation agriculture, based on three basic principles (1) minimal soil movement, (2) retention of rational amounts of crop residues and (3) viable crop rotations, be an option towards these goals? It is essential to have an indication of the sustainability of a proposed agricultural system in addition to the potential, immediate benefits from introducing new technologies well before the catastrophic consequences of non-sustainability become apparent. Long-term experiments are best suited to test the sustainability of a given system. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT, Int.) has initiated various long-term agronomical trials (started 1991) at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19. 31 ° N, 98. 50 ° W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop residue management on maize and wheat grown under rain fed conditions. The objective of this dissertation is to come to an integrated evaluation of the different management systems. Toward improved more stable yields? Small-scale maize and wheat farmers can obtain yield improvements through zero tillage, appropriate rotations and retention of sufficient residues (average maize and wheat yield of 5091 and 5407 kg ha− 1), compared to the common practices of heavy tillage before seeding, monocropping and crop residue removal (average maize and wheat yield of 3411 and 4267 kg ha− 1). Leaving residue on the field is critical for zero tillage practices. However, it may take some time—roughly 5 years—before the benefits become evident. After that, zero tillage with residue retention results in higher and more stable yields than alternative management. Toward increased physical and chemical soil quality? Zero tillage combined with crop residue retention improved chemical and physical conditions of the soil. Soil quality under conventional tillage was intermediate (irrespective of residue management), especially in its physical status. In contrast, <b>zero</b> tillage with <b>removal</b> of residues, led to low aggregate stability, high penetration resistance, surface slaking resulting in low time-to-pond values and high runoff. Throughout the growing season, the highest soil moisture content was found in zero tillage with residue retention while conventional tillage had intermediate soil moisture values. Zero tillage without residue retention had more days of soil moisture values under permanent wilting point, while zero tillage with residue retention had the least. Comparable results on the interaction between zero tillage and residue retention were obtained with permanent raised beds. Permanent raised bed planting with retention of crop residue results in more stable macroaggregates and as such a reduced erosion potential, as well as an increased protection of C and N in the microaggregates within the macroaggregates, as compared to conventionally tilled raised beds. However, the positive effect of permanent raised beds is lost when all residues are removed. Permanent raised beds with partial residue retention for both crops have provided acceptable levels of aggregate stability and C and N accumulation. Toward increased biological soil quality and soil health? Crop residue retention resulted in increased microbial biomass, micro-flora catabolic activity, increased populations of soil micro-flora that promote plant growth and suppress diseases (total bacteria, fluorescent Pseudomonas, Actinomycetes, total fungi, and Fusarium spp.) and reduced numbers of the nematode Pratylenchus thornei. The continuous, uniform supply of C from crop residues serves as an energy source for microorganisms. When residue was retained, zero tillage showed much higher microbial biomass, micro-flora catabolic activity and beneficial soil micro-flora populations than zero tillage without residue, especially for maize. Zero tillage on its own does not induce better soil health, but the combination of zero tillage with residue retention does. Zero tillage with residue removal is clearly an unsustainable practice. This highlights the importance of crop residue for dry-land rain fed production systems. The increased microbial diversity under zero tillage and residue retention may be useful for biological control and integrated pest management. In our agro-ecological environment, detrimental effects of soil-borne diseases were not observed for zero tillage with residue retention. Incidence of root rot and parasitic nematode populations were not correlated with yield. Although root diseases may have affected crop performance, they affected yield less than the positive effects of other critical plant growth factors such as infiltration and water availability. Toward a time efficient use of resources? The NDVI-handheld sensor was evaluated as a tool for crop monitoring and to provide within season prediction of yield. The handheld sensor is a non-destructive system that samples at a very high rate and, compared to other methods, can easily and time-efficiently measure a representative area for a plot. Final maize yield and biomass could be predicted 2. 5 months before harvest by combining NDVI {{from the beginning of the}} season and NDVI measured at the beginning of the reproductive phase (coefficient of correlation in calibration ≥ 0. 921 and 0. 935 respectively). For wheat the period immediately after flowering is critical for yield prediction. The NDVI based crop growth curves clearly reflected crop performance and can explain in-season stress factors. Zero tillage induced different crop growth dynamics over time compared to conventional tillage. Zero tillage with residue retention is characterized by a slower, early crop growth, totally compensated for by an increased growth in the later stages, positively influencing final grain yield. Zero tillage with partial residue retention gave similar crop growth compared with full residue retention, indicating a promising potential to remove part of the straw for other uses (fodder, fuel etc.). Zero tillage with residue removal had low NDVI values throughout the growing season. Zero tillage with (partial) retention of crop residues results in time efficient use of resources, as opposed to conventional tillage, regardless of residue management, and zero tillage with residue removal. Toward a spatial efficient use of resources? The coefficient of variation (CV) for the NDVI measurement sequence in each plot was determined. Zero tillage systems without surface residue retention produced high CVs of the NDVI sequence and high spatial crop variability throughout the season, even after the vegetative period, as opposed to zero tillage with residue retention. Increased spatial variability throughout the season might reflect agronomical mismanagement leading to inefficient use of critical plant growth resources and increased fertility gradients. When one or more critical elements in the soil are limited, plant-to-plant competition will increase plant-to-plant performance variability and agronomical mismanagement will induce degradation processes resulting in increased spatial variability of crop performance. Comparison of the patterns of NDVI and soil moisture, made clear that soil moisture and water availability are limiting factors for our target zone, and any management practice that results in an increased time and spatial availability of this critical resource will increase production sustainability. Toward a more profitable agricultural system? Zero tillage and permanent raised bed planting with at least partial residue retention generate higher yields, lower costs, and higher incomes than the incumbent traditional agriculture management system, based on extensive tillage and residue <b>removal.</b> The <b>zero</b> tillage system with at least partial residue retention also demonstrates less income variability over years, decreasing risk. Moreover, the traditional farmer practices result in negative returns after variable costs. It is clear that an environmental friendly and profitable agriculture for the (sub) tropical highlands should be based on conservation agriculture practices. In the (sub) tropical highlands, a cropping system that includes zero tillage/permanent raised bed planting, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can have positive effects compared with commonly used farming practices of heavy tillage before seeding, monocropping and crop residue <b>removal.</b> <b>Zero</b> tillage with residue retention can clearly be a part of an integrated management scheme towards sustainable agriculture. It is clear that to develop new management practices to improve water use, reduce erosion and enhance human labour/(animal) power, the focus must be on the use of conservation agriculture both for rain fed as well as irrigated production systems which will need to be fine tuned for each system. Our results provide a sound basis to support the development of zero-till seeding equipment in order to extend the technology to the small-scale farmers of the target area.
