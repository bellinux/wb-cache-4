50|$|There {{are five}} known species of rock-rat. The Central Rock Rat (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus)</b> was once {{believed}} to be extinct until rediscovered in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The {{central rock-rat}} (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus)</b> is a {{critically}} endangered rodent that was presumed extinct {{until it was}} rediscovered in the MacDonnell Ranges Northern Territory in 1996. The last of the zoo's central rock rats were sent to Alice Springs Desert Park in 2007 and the breeding program closed.|$|R
30|$|The {{morphological}} appearance of leukocytes {{in the two}} species {{was similar to that}} described previously for other murids including the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) (Thrall et al. 2012), plains rat (Pseudomys australis), spinifex hopping-mice (Notomys alexis) (Old et al. 2005) and the central rock-rat (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus)</b> (Old et al. 2005). Neutrophils of both species in this study were larger in diameter when compared to the house mouse (Mus musculus) and brown rat (Thrall et al. 2012). Lymphocyte size greatly fluctuates from the size of erythrocytes to neutrophils (Thrall et al. 2012). Both species’ lymphocytes did not exceed the size of neutrophils. Monocyte size and morphology were similar to that previously described for other murid species (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007).|$|R
40|$|Captive {{breeding}} and reintroduction programs are becoming {{an increasingly important}} part of endangered species conservation. Relatively poor success of such programs has been at least partially due to deficiencies of key adaptive behaviours in reintroduced individuals, resulting from inadequate captive environments. In an attempt to improve the potential for successful reintroduction of the captive rock-rat (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus),</b> a critically endangered Australian rodent, the behaviour of two captive breeding populations being held at Alice Springs Desert Park and Perth Zoo, respectively, were compared. Behavioural {{differences between the two}} locations were observed in activity levels, levels of exhibited sterotypy and ways in which the respective enclosures were used. Variatins in enclosure design may have played a causal role in the observed behaviorual differences. This study highlights the importance of considering enclosure design when keeping captive populations, particularly for the purposes of reintroduction. 1 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The central rock rat (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus),</b> {{also known}} as the central thick-tailed rock-rat, Macdonnell Range rock-rat, Australian native mouse, rat à grosse queue (French), or rata coligorda (Spanish), is a species of rodent in the family Muridae that is found only in Australia. The rats have been found in rocky {{outcrops}} and on mountainsides with loose stones, as well as hilly grasslands and low open shrubland or woodland. Historically, Z. pedunculatus is only known to be found in a 77 km length of the West MacDonnell Ranges, Northern Territory. The species has previously been recorded from living animals or cave deposits in Northern Territory at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Illamurta (James Range), Haast's Bluff (West MacDonnell Ranges), Mount Liebig, Napperby Station, Devils Marbles, The Granites (Tanami Desert), and the Davenport Range. It is known from cave deposits in the Cape Range, Western Australia.|$|R
40|$|The sperm head {{morphology}} {{and tail}} length of {{two species of}} Australian rock rats, Zyzomys argurus and <b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus,</b> are presented. In Z. argurus the sperm head has an apical hook together with two ventral processes extending from the upper concave surface that are largely composed of cytoskeletal material, and the sperm tail is about 135 μm in length. By contrast, in Z. pedunculatus the sperm head is paddle-shaped with the nucleus capped by an acrosome that has a large apical segment and {{is surrounded by a}} thin layer of cytoskeletal material, and the sperm tail is only around 85 μm in length. Since the structure of the spermatozoon of Z. argurus {{is similar to that of}} most of the old endemic Australian rodents it is presumed to be the ancestral condition within the Zyzomys genus with that of Z. pedunculatus being highly derived and showing convergence with the sperm structure in some other orders of mammals...|$|R
5000|$|The {{central rock-rat}} <b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus</b> {{is one of}} five rock-rat species native to Australia. It is a nocturnal species that {{specifically}} forages for food in the nighttime. They can range from 10.6 to 14.9 cm long for the head and body, and around 30 cm from head to tail. They weigh between 50 and 120 g. Their fur is a light mustard above with a pale underbelly [...] The lightly furred tail is the most noticeable feature of the central rock-rat. The tail base is thick and bulky. The thickness of the tail has been reported to be a fat storage adaptation. This is an effect of scarce food distribution. Rock-rats are known to lose their tails, fur and skin very easily and are, therefore, known to be difficult to handle. As for their birthrate, captive animals have bred and have had litters of various sizes, such as 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1 and 4 young.|$|R
40|$|Stick-nest rat middens are {{preserved}} piles of macrofossils that record changes in {{plants and animals}} during the late Holocene at White Range. The builders, Lesser Stick-nest Rats (Leporillus apicalis), after at least 2500 years in the area, became extinct during the Modern radiocarbon period. The rats' collection {{of plant and animal}} material provides an ecological survey of the site during this period. The species composition of the vegetation has apparently responded to increased Aboriginal populations, ire incidence or rainfall in the last 2500 years. A dramatic increase in tree and shrub material between 2510 &PLUSMN; 40 BP and 835 &PLUSMN; 62 BP at the expense of herbs is possibly related to increasing moisture availability. The middens record a collapse of trees and shrubs by 606 &PLUSMN; 136 BP then a strong recovery. Grasses have generally decreased in importance throughout the record. Bones of the Central Rock Rat (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus),</b> which is currently restricted to the western MacDonnell Ranges, were found in middens dated at 433 &PLUSMN; 60 BP. Information about long-term changes in Australia's and areas is accessible using the middens of stick-nest rats and provides a useful long-term perspective for environmental management...|$|R
40|$|The {{challenges}} of sampling rare fauna limit efforts {{to understand and}} mitigate the factors that restrict their distribution. Camera traps have become a standard technique for sampling large mammals, but their utility for sampling small, rare species remains largely unknown. The central rock-rat (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus)</b> is critically endangered and restricted to rugged range country in central Australia. Using Z. pedunculatus as a focal species, we sought {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of camera trapping for sampling small mammals in this environment and to better understand the factors driving the occurrence of this species. We installed baited camera traps at 50 sites across 1795 ha of core refuge habitat for Z. pedunculatus. We recorded all six species of small mammals known previously from this area, including the highly detectable Z. pedunculatus at five sites. Occupancy modelling showed that distance to the nearest occupied site was the most important predictor of Z. pedunculatus occurrence, suggesting that this rodent occurs in discrete sub-populations within the matrix of refuge habitat. Fire history and ruggedness may also influence occupancy of Z. pedunculatus at the landscape-scale and could assist in locating additional sub-populations. At the site-scale, occupancy of Z. pedunculatus was high and there was no clear influence of any site-scale variables. Management of Z. pedunculatus will require protection and expansion of known sub-populations. We conclude that camera trapping provided useful and cost-effective insight into the factors limiting rock-rat distribution, and predict that it will become a standard tool for sampling rare small mammals in difficult-to-access environments...|$|R
40|$|Irruptive {{population}} dynamics {{are characteristic of}} a wide range of fauna in the world’s arid (dryland) regions. Recent evidence indicates that regional persistence of irruptive species, particularly small mammals, during the extensive dry periods of unpredictable length that occur between resource pulses in drylands occurs as a result of the presence of refuge habitats or refuge patches into which populations contract during dry (bust) periods. These small dry-period populations act as a source of animals when recolonisation of the surrounding habitat occurs during and after subsequent resource pulses (booms). The refuges used by irruptive dryland fauna differ in temporal and spatial scale from the refugia to which species contract in response to changing climate. Refuges of dryland fauna operate over timescales of months and years, whereas refugia operate on timescales of millennia over which evolutionary divergence may occur. Protection and management of refuge patches and refuge habitats should be a priority for the conservation of dryland-dwelling fauna. This urgency is driven by recognition that disturbance to refuges can lead to the extinction of local populations and, if disturbance is widespread, entire species. Despite the apparent significance of dryland refuges for conservation management, these sites remain poorly understood ecologically. Here, we synthesise available information on the refuges of dryland-dwelling fauna, using Australian mammals as a case study to provide focus, and document a research agenda for increasing this knowledge base. We develop a typology of refuges that recognises two main types of refuge: fixed and shifting. We outline a suite of models of fixed refuges on the basis of stability in occupancy between and within successive bust phases of population cycles. To illustrate the breadth of refuge types we provide case studies of refuge use in three species of dryland mammal: plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), central rock-rat (<b>Zyzomys</b> <b>pedunculatus),</b> and spinifex hopping-mouse (Notomys alexis). We suggest that future research should focus on understanding the species-specific nature of refuge use and the spatial ecology of refuges with a focus on connectivity and potential meta{{population dynamics}}. Assessing refuge quality and understanding the threats to high-quality refuge patches and habitat should also be a priority. To facilitate this understanding we develop a three-step methodology for determining species-specific refuge location and habitat attributes. This review is necessarily focussed on dryland mammals in continental Australia where most refuge-based research has been undertaken. The applicability of the refuge concept and the importance of refuges for dryland fauna conservation elsewhere in the world should be investigated. We predict that refuge-using mammals will be widespread particularly among dryland areas with unpredictable rainfall patterns. Chris R. Pavey, Jane Addison, Rob Brandle, Chris R. Dickman, Peter J.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the specificity of temperate dinoflagellate - anthozoan symbioses and the influence of any specificity on the percentage contribution of photosynthetically fixed carbon to the host's daily respiratory carbon budget (CZAR). The British symbiotic Anthozoa Cereus <b>pedunculatus</b> (Pennant) <b>I</b> Anthopleura ballii (Cocks), Anemonia viridis (Forskal) and Isozoanthus sulcatus (Gos 3 e) and the sub-tropical anthozoan Aiptasia pallida (Verrill) and their algal symbionts were investigated. The characteristics of freshly isolated and cultured symbionts were studied to determine whether the algal cells residing in each host species appeared different and how symbiont characteristics may be determined by the host environment. Horphology, division behaviour and photosynthetic pigment composition were examined using SEMO TEMO LMO TLC and HPLC respectively. The symbionts of each host species were identified as dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium, even though there was an absence of a motile phase in the cell cycle of the British hosts. Differences between symbionts of different host species and conspecific hosts were evident with respect to thylakoid arrangement, cell size and cell division rate, and possibly pigment concentrations. Host determined phenotypic plasticity was observed with respect to the absence of a "pellicle". Host-symbiont recognition and specificity were investigated - by reinfecting aposymbiotic C. _pedunculatus with symbionts from different host species and measuring the density and biomass of symbionts at different time intervals. The presence of different strains or species of Symbiodinium was evident, with recognition of these different symbionts being predominantly post-endocytotic. 'Homologous' symbionts were the most 'successful' at repopulating C. pedunculatus. After 9 months, the population densities and biomasses, and division rates of the different 'strains' Of 3 ymbionts were the same, suggesting a greater symbiotic integration with 'heterologous, 'strains' with time. The reflection of specificity by the photosynthetic fixation of carbon in vivo was measured using an 02 electrode. 1110 mologous, symbiontW photosynthesized at a greater rate than 'heterologous' symbionts in vivo, despite the higher photosynthetic rates of some of these 'heterologous' symbionts in their original hosts. Photosynthate translocation by symbionts in response to different host environments was investigated using in vivo and in vitro 14 C labelling and the 'growth rate method'. The percentage translocation was host-symbiont specific and appeared to be controlled by different mechanisms in different host species and conspecific hosts from different locations. The CZAR in 'natural' and reestablished symbioses was calculated. Values ranged from 25. 7 to 112. 2...|$|R
