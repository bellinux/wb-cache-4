25|$|The {{cutaneous}} form {{of disease}} {{is caused by}} introduction of S. schenckii into the body through disruption of the skin barrier. The first symptom of cutaneous sporotrichosis is a small skin lesion. These lesions may show ulceration and/or erythema. Commonly, infection spreads through the lymph along lymphatic vessels and causes lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis. This form of disease {{is characterized by the}} appearance of lesions at sites distant to the initial infection. Infection can occur in nonhuman animals and may be transmitted to humans through contact. Veterinarians are at particularly high risk of contracting disease from animals (<b>zoonotic</b> <b>infection).</b>|$|E

Transmission of influenza from swine to humans {{who work with}} swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance.

40|$|Background: Many {{diseases}} {{are known to}} be naturally transmissible between vertebrate animals, including cattle and humans. Currently, much effort is being made to promote dairy farming in Malawi but there is limited information about zoonotic diseases including public awareness and practices. This study was designed to determine factors associated with dairy producer's awareness and practices with regard to zoonoses in Northern Region of Malawi. Materials and Methods: A structured questionnaire was used to collect information from 140 randomly selected dairy producers between January and June 2011. Level of awareness and practices with respect to <b>zoonotic</b> <b>infections</b> was evaluated using a score ranging from 0 to 11. Chi-squared test followed by a multivariable logistic model were used to assess potential factors associated farmer's awareness and practices. Results: Awareness and practice level was unsatisfactory. Significantly higher number of respondents (75. 7 vs. 32. 9 %,x 2 = 51. 81, df = 1, p< 0. 001) had satisfactory level of awareness when compared to those who practiced preventive measures. Awareness of the existence of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>infections</b> and practices was higher in farmers who acquired animals through loan (p = 0. 008), farmers with above primary education (p = 0. 002) and farmers with more than six years of dairy farming experience (p= 0. 010). Most farmers (59. 3 %) received information about zoonoses through Agricultural extension services. Conclusion: Awareness and practices with respect to <b>zoonotic</b> <b>infections</b> was dependent on farmer's formal educational level, dairy farming experience and means of acquiring parent stock. Regular disease surveillance and promotion of education on the risk associated with <b>zoonotic</b> <b>infections</b> through dairy extension and medical services should result in increased awareness and efficient control of zoonoses in Malawi.

Not all theoretically zoonotic pathogens are truly zoonotic in practice, the prime example being influenza viruses; aviann H 5 N 1 influenza remains strictly zoonotic, whereas novel H 1 N 1 influenza displays an anthropocentric cycle that led to a pandemic, despite being of zoonotic origin. The burden of disease induced by zoonotic and viral pathogens is enormous: there are more than ten bacterial zoonoses, each of which affects hundreds of thousands patients annually, often leading to chronic infections and causing significant economic losses of a medical and livestock-related nature. Viral zoonotic agents are constantly emerging or re-emerging, and are associated with outbreaks of limited or expanded geographical spread: the typical trends of viral <b>zoonotic</b> <b>infections,</b> however, is to extend their ecological horizon, sometimes in an unexpected but successful manner, {{as in the case of}} West Nile virus, and in other instances less effectively, as was the case, fortunately, in the case of avian influenza.
