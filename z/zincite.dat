50|$|<b>Zincite</b> is {{the mineral}} form of zinc oxide (ZnO). Its crystal form {{is rare in}} nature; a notable {{exception}} to this is at the Franklin and Sterling Hill Mines in New Jersey, an area also famed for its many fluorescent minerals.

50|$|The {{naturally}} occurring mineral form, simonkolleite, {{was described as}} a new mineral in 1985 for samples collected at Richelsdorf, Germany. It is a rare secondary mineral formed by weathering of zinc-bearing slag, and is associated with native zinc, hydrocerussite, diaboleite, <b>zincite</b> and hydrozincite. It is named after Werner Simon and Kurt Kolle, Mineral collectors of Cornberg, near Michelsdorf who submitted the samples for investigation.

5000|$|When a DC {{bias voltage}} {{was applied to}} a cat's whisker detector, in order to {{increase}} its sensitivity as a detector in a crystal radio, it occasionally broke into spontaneous oscillation, producing a radio frequency alternating current. This was a negative resistance effect, and had been noticed around 1909 by researchers such as William Henry Eccles [...] and G. W. Pickard. but not much attention had been paid to it. In 1923 Losev began to research these [...] "oscillating crystals" [...] and discovered that biased <b>zincite</b> (zinc oxide) crystals could amplify a signal. [...] Losev was the first to exploit negative resistance diodes practically; he realized that they could serve as simpler, cheaper replacements for vacuum tubes. He used these junctions to build solid-state versions of amplifiers, oscillators, and TRF and regenerative radio receivers, at frequencies up to 5 MHz, 25 years before the transistor. He even built a superheterodyne receiver. [...] However his achievements were overlooked because of the success of vacuum tube technology. The Soviet authorities did not support him, and <b>zincite</b> crystals were hard to come by because they had to be imported from the United States. After ten years he abandoned research into this technology (dubbed [...] "Crystodyne" [...] by Hugo Gernsback), and it was forgotten.|$|E
50|$|Although {{usually the}} anion of the {{mineralizer}} is most active in dissolving the nutrient material, the cation also exerts an influence in some cases. The mineralizer can interact with impurities {{on the surface}} of the crystal and increase the growth rate. For example, the growth rate for sapphire (Al2O3) and <b>zincite</b> (ZnO) in potassium-containing solution (KOH, K2CO3) is higher in comparison to that in sodium-containing solution (NaOH, Na2CO3). This difference is not readily understood, but are attributed the interaction between potassium and an impurity absorbed on the surface.|$|E
5000|$|Jerrygibbsite {{has been}} found only in the Franklin Furnace mine in Franklin, New Jersey, and in the Kombat Mines in Namibia.

5000|$|The {{first person}} to exploit {{negative}} resistance diodes practically was Russian radio researcher Oleg Losev, who in 1922 discovered negative differential resistance in biased <b>zincite</b> (zinc oxide) point contact junctions.
