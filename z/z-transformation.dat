50|$|Several {{methods have}} been used for {{selecting}} a threshold in constructing gene co-expression networks. A simple thresholding method is to choose a co-expression cutoff and select relationships which their co-expression exceeds this cutoff. Another approach is to use Fisher’s <b>Z-transformation</b> which calculates a z-score for each correlation {{based on the number of}} samples. This z-score is then converted into a p-value for each correlation and a cutoff is set on the p-value. Some methods permute the data and calculate a z-score using the distribution of correlations found between genes in permuted dataset. Some other approaches have also been used such as threshold selection based on clustering coefficient or random matrix theory.|$|E

For a molecular structure described by a planar graph G, the resonance graph or (<b>Z-transformation</b> graph) of G is a graph whose vertices describe perfect matchings of G and whose edges connect pairs of perfect matchings whose symmetric difference is an interior face of G.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be described as subgraphs of a hexagonal tiling of the plane, and the resonance graph describes possible double-bond structures of these molecules.

40|$|A recent {{focus in}} the field of {{consciousness}} research involves investigating the propensity of initially non-conscious visual information to gain access to consciousness. A critical tool for measuring conscious access is the so-called breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm (b-CFS). In this paradigm, a high contrast dynamic pattern is presented to one eye, thereby temporarily suppressing a target stimulus that is presented to the other eye. The time it takes for observers to report (e. g., the location of) the initially suppressed stimulus provides a measure of conscious access. Typical observations in b-CFS studies include the finding that upright faces are released from suppression faster than inverted faces, and the finding that stimuli that match the current content of visual working memory are released from suppression faster than mismatching stimuli. Interestingly, the extent to which observers exhibit these effects varies extensively (in the range of hundreds of milliseconds). By re-analyzing existing datasets and a new dataset we establish that the difference in RTs between conditions in b-CFS tasks (i. e., the effect of interest) is highly correlated with participants' overall suppression durations, and with their trial-to-trial variability in RTs. We advocate the usage of a simple latency- normalization method, which (1) removes the between-subject variability in suppression duration from the effect of interest, while (2) providing distributions of RT differences that are better suited for parametric testing. We next compare this latency-normalization method to two other transformations that are widely applied on within-subject RT data (<b>z-transformations</b> and log-transformations). Finally, we tentatively discuss how trial-to-trial variability and overall suppression duration might relate to prolonged phases of shallow suppression that are more prone to modulations of conscious access...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study a Gersgorin type theorem, {{spectral}} inequalities, and simultaneous stability of linear transformations {{in the setting}} of Euclidean Jordan algebras. For complex square matrices, the Levy-Desplanques theorem asserts that a strictly diagonally dominant matrix is invertible. The well-known Gersgorin theorem on the location of eigenvalues is equivalent to this. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we extend the Levy-Desplanques theorem to an object in a Euclidean Jordan algebra when its Peirce decomposition with respect to a Jordan frame is given. As a consequence, we prove a Gersgorin type theorem for the spectral eigenvalues of an object in a Euclidean Jordan algebra. In matrix theory, the well known Cauchy's interlacing theorem states that if a row-column pair is deleted from a complex Hermitian matrix, then the eigenvalues of the resulting principal matrix interlace those of the original one. This result was generalized recently to the setting of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. In the second part of the thesis, we present some consequences of this generalization and prove the dual form of the min-max theorem of Hirzebruch. One of the applications of the min-max theorem from matrix analysis is the problem of comparing the eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices A and B with those of A + B, proved by Weyl. Using the min-max theorem of Hirzebruch, we extend Weyl's inequality to the setting of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras and study some consequences of it. Using duality and complementarity ideas, and <b>Z-transformations,</b> in the third part of the thesis, we discuss ways of describing simultaneous stability of linear transformations on Hilbert spaces. As a consequence, we discuss the existence of common linear/quadratic Lyapunov functions for switched linear systems. In particular, we extend a recent result of Mason-Shorten on positive switched system with two constituent linear time-invariant systems to an arbitrary finite system...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the significance of the correlation between. reading achievement and attitude toward reading. This relationship was further analyzed by comparing correlations utilizing the following variables: sex, grade level, and socioeconomic settings. The following information was available for each subject in the study 1. Sex 2. A reading achievement score 3. A reading attitude scoreThe population of this study consisted of five hundred fifty-three (553) students in grades four, five, and six from the Dayton City Schools, Kettering City Schools, and Wolfe County Schools. The students were all members of heterogeneously-grouped self-contained classrooms. All students completed the California Reading Achievement Test,Level 3, Form A and the Estes Attitude Scales: Elementary Form, and ninety (90) of these students were interviewed utilizing the Reading Attitude Interview. The California Reading Achievement Test, Level 3, Form A, contained two sections, the first section contained forty (40) vocabulary questions and the second section contained forty-two (42) comprehension questions. Both sections were answered by utilizing one of the four (4) multiple choice answers provided for each question. The Estes Attitude Scales: Elementary Form consisted section contained fourteen Likert rated questions. All three sections were administered but only the reading section was scored. The five (5) students at each grade level in each socioeconomic school setting achieving the highest five (5) pairs of scores on the reading achievement test and reading attitude scale (accounting for forty-five (45) students) were administered the Reading Attitude Interview. The same procedure was followed for the five (5) students at each grade level in each socioeconomic school setting who achieved the lowest five pairs of scores on the reading of three sections: mathematics, reading, and science. Each achievement test and the reading attitude scale (accounting for forty-five (45) students). The aforementioned procedures accounted for an interview population of ninety (90) students. The interview instrument was devised and field tested by the investigator to analyze various possible influences on the student's attitude toward reading. Statistical processing of the data was conducted by calculating Pearson Product-Moment correlations for null hypotheses one, two, and three. Hypotheses four through twelve were statistically treated by computing Pearson Product-Moment correlations, Fisher <b>Z-transformations,</b> and two-tailed t-test values. Twelve major null hypotheses were tested at the. 05 level of confidence to determine the relationship between reading achievement and attitude toward reading and also the influences exerted by the variables of sex, grade level, and socioeconomic setting. It appears from this study that reading achievement and attitude toward reading are correlated significantly. The degree of significance varied somewhat but the male students generally produced higher correlations than their female counterparts. Only one instance indicated a significant difference between correlations due to the sex variable. The fifth-grade rural male students produced significantly higher correlations than their female counterparts. One instance indicated a significant difference between correlations due to the variable of grade level. The fifth-grade students in a rural school setting produced significantly higher correlations than their sixth grade counterparts. Two instances of significant differences between correlations due to the variable of socioeconomic school setting occurred. In both instances, the sixth-grade students of rural and urban school settings produced significantly higher correlations than the sixth-grade students in a suburban school setting. Information from the Reading Attitude Interview revealed that the mother in the home appeared to be the greatest single influence on reading attitude, followed closely by the student's school environment and finally by the influence exerted by the student's peers.
