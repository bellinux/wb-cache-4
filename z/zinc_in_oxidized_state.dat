40|$|A broad post-edge peak (postpeak) in the core-loss {{spectrum}} {{of a relatively}} thick TEM specimen is readily accounted for by plural scattering of the transmitted electrons, involving a core-loss and a bulk plasmon. However, we observe a prominent postpeak, about 40 ?eV above iron L 3 edge, even in very thin films of iron fluoride. The peak gradually disappears as fluorine is removed by electron irradiation, as indicated by decay of the fluorine K-edge and change in white-line ratio, but appears when an iron film is oxidized, therefore {{it appears to be}} characteristic of iron <b>in</b> an <b>oxidized</b> <b>state.</b> To study its origin, we performed real-space multiple-scattering (RSMS) calculations of the near-edge fine structure of the Fe L-edge, allowing us to discuss the origin of the postpeak within the framework of electron-scattering theory.

The switch based on nicotinamide (3 / 6) is strongly fluorescent <b>in</b> its <b>oxidized</b> <b>state</b> (…F 1. 0) but nonfluorescent in the reduced state (…F < 0. 001) due to electron transfer from the reduced nicotinamide to the photoexcited fluorophore.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{near-infrared}} absorption spectra of three oxygen compounds of membrane-bound cytochrome oxidase (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1. 9. 3. 1) shows that the formation of compound A (oxycytochrome oxidase) causes no significant infrared absorbance changes at - 103 degrees. At - 64 degrees, the formation of compound C from the mixed-valence state of the oxidase leads to increased absorption at 740 - 750 nm. The formation of compound B at - 84 degrees from the fully reduced state of the oxidase causes increased absorption at 790 - 800 nm. Further oxidation of cytochrome oxidase results in increased infrared absorption at 820 - 830 nm at - 60 degrees. The position of the infrared absorption band in compound C thus depends at least upon the oxidation-reduction state of heme a and its associated copper atom. Compound C contains two types of oxidized (cupric) copper; that associated with heme a is initially oxidized, and that associated with heme a 3 is oxidized as a second step in the reaction with oxygen.
