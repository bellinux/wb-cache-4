40|$|<b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> or <b>ginger</b> {{known for}} its high {{medicinal}} compounds is extracted using hot compressed water (HCW). The two most important bioactive compounds namely 6 -gingerol and 6 -shogaol in the ginger extracts are analyzed using HPLC. The effects of temperature and time of extraction on 6 -gingerol and 6 -shogaol are studied using HCW extraction. It is found that HCW extraction can extract these two bioactive compounds; 6 -gingerol at 130 °C and 30 min whilst 6 -shogaol at 170 °C and 20 min. This finding shows that HCW extraction is potentially used in selective extraction of bioactive compounds at different conditions of HCW. The kinetics of extraction for both bioactive compounds is studied from the optimum temperatures obtained. The overall mass transfer coefficient which represents the extraction efficiency is calculated using mass transfer model. The optimum values of the overall mass transfer coefficient (k) for 6 -gingerol is 8 × 10 − 7 m/s at 130 °C whilst for 6 -shogaol, is 18 × 10 − 7 m/s at 170 °C using HCW extraction.

This research was carried out to evaluate the antiparasitic effect of ginger root extract (GE) and GE/F 1 (fraction 1 obtained from GE) against Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) in vitro and in vivo. The effects of GE and GE/F 1 against the proliferation of T. gondii-infected C 6 cells and T. gondii were evaluated by several indicators such as an MTT assay, nuclear staining, immunofluorescence staining, apoptotic proteins and animal testing. GE/F 1 strongly inhibited the proliferation of T. gondii-infected C 6 cells and T. gondii in a dose-dependent manner compared with sulfadiazine. After T. gondii invasion, C 6 cells induced the activation of caspase- 3, bax, p 53 and p 21 related to programmed cell death, and GE/F 1 effectively suppressed the expression of caspase- 3, bax, p 53 and p 21 causing cell death of the infected host cells. In addition, INF-gamma, and IL- 8 levels, and the viability of T. gondii-infected mice treated with GE/F 1 (500 microg/ml) were not changed or increased during the period of the experiment.

In Ayurveda system, ginger and milk or water {{in the form of}} paste are used externally for treatment of infantile colic. The combination of ginger with honey is used for asthmatic bronchitis, cough, hiccups, and respiratory colds. In traditional Chinese system, fresh ginger is believed to have mild warm temper, while dried and roasted ones are regarded as warm and hot, respectively [1]. It is used for digestive ailments, and appetite disorders [2]. Ginger is used for digestive problems in western medicine. Henry VIII recommended the use of ginger for preventing the plague. The prepared bread with ginger by Greeks is consumed after meal as digestive aid [3]. Blood purifying, aphrodisiac, sex stimulants, appetizing, anti-flatulent, anti-spasmodic, anti-hemorrhoid, anti-vomiting, and anti-nausea effects of ginger are other traditional prospects [4]. Ginger rhizomes are containing fatty oils (3 - 6 %), proteins (9 %), carbohydrates (60 - 70 %), crude fiber (3 - 8 %), ash (8 %), water (9 - 12 %), and volatile oil (2 - 3 %).

The study may be valuable to understand the structural and functional aspects of the enzymes for academic and industrial proposes...|$|E
40|$|An {{in vitro}} study was {{conducted}} for screening antibacterial activities of seeds of Trigonella foenum-graecum (fenugreek) and rhizomes of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> (<b>ginger),</b> in their different forms viz. aqueous extracts, essential oils and powders against some common food borne pathogens. Bacterial strains involved {{in the study were}} Bacillus cereus (MTCC 430), Enterococcus feacalis (MTCC 439), Escherichia coli (MTCC 1687), Psuedomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 424) and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 5021). Results revealed that powdered forms of T. foenum-graecum and Z. officinale remained ineffective in arresting the growth of all the bacterial strains under investigation. During preliminary screening, aqueous extracts and essential oils of test spices did not exhibit any growth inhibitory zone towards any test bacteria. In broth dilution technique, essential oil of Z. officinale arrested all the bacterial strains under observation while essential oil of T. foenum-graecum and aqueous extracts of T. foenum-graecum and Z. officinale remained ineffective...|$|E
30|$|<b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> Rosc. {{is widely}} used as spice and {{medicinal}} plant in folk and traditional medicines. The {{aim of this study}} was to review the chemical composition and biological activities of Z. <b>officinale</b> (<b>ginger)</b> essential oil. Ginger oil is extracted from Z. officinale rhizomes, which its chemical composition influences from geographical region, extraction methods, freshness or dryness of rhizomes. The antibacterial, antifungal, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, immunomodulatory, relaxant, and warming effects of ginger oil have been confirmed in experimental and preclinical studies. The safety issues of ginger oils are well documented and are generally regarded as safe. Due to wide pharmacological effects of ginger oil, attention to ginger oil as an ingredient of natural formulations in management of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases is valuable.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the immunomodulating effects of aqueous and methanol extracts of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> on the haematological profile in Schistosoma haematobium - infected mice. The weight and haematological profiles of Schistosoma haematobium - infected mice were assessed to evaluate the immunomodulating effects of aqueous and methanolic extracts of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> at post-infection and post-treatment. There was a non-significant decrease (p> 0. 05) in the weight of mice in all the groups. However, there was a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the total white blood cell counts, neutrophils and lymphocytes for group I (S. haematobium - infected mice treated with 9. 5 mg/kg aqueous extract of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale).</b> In group II - (S. haematobium - infected mice treated with 87 mg/kg methanolic extract of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale),</b> there was significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the haemoglobin level and white blood cells. Methanolic extract of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> has better anti-anaemic effect than the aqueous extract of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale.</b> There was no relationship between the level of eosinophils and the treated mice. No significant change in the haematological indices was observed in the group which was administered the standard drug- Praziquantel (PZQ). The immunomodualting effects of aqueous and methanol extracts of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> when compared to PZQ are promising in immunosuppressed Schistosoma haematobium- infected mice. Fractionation of the crude extract of <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> may further identify the bioactive components required for treatment of urinary schistosomiasis...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} the {{comparative study of}} serum calcium level after treatment of cissusquadrangularis linn and <b>zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rocs in osteoarthritis induced rats and osteoarthritis patients. Method: Estimation of serum calcium levels are before and after treatment of tested drugs in osteoarthritis rats and patients 1. Animal treated: Cissus quadrangularis linn- 450 mg/kg orally; <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rocs- 450 mg/kg orally; cissus quadrangularis linn+ <b>zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rocs- 450 mg/kg orally; 2. Patients treated: Cissus quadrangularis linn- 5 gm; <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rocs- 5 gm and Cissusquadrangularis linn+ <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rosc- 5 gm, all groups are twice a day orally with luke warm water. Results: Serum calcium levels are estimated before and after treatment of tested drugs in osteoarthritis rats and patients were: 1. Animal treated: Cissus quadrangularis linn (7. 56 ± 0. 35 to 9. 06 ± 0. 87) p 0. 001; 2. Patients treated: Cissus quadrangularis linn (8. 295 ± 0. 3069 to 8. 81 ± 0. 27) p< 0. 0001.; <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rosc was (8. 160 ± 0. 13 to 8. 20 ± 0. 13) p< 0. 001;Cissusquadrangularis linn+ <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rosc was (7. 86 ± 0. 36 to 8. 705 ± 0. 2724) p< 0. 0001. Conclusion: Study evident that improvement in terms of increase in serum calcium was observed in animal as well as patients treated groups. The combination treatment of Cissusquadrangularis linn+ <b>Zingiber</b> <b>officinale</b> rosc showed extremely significant and increase of serum calcium level compared to standard drug of Dexamethasone in both tested groups Key words: Cissusquadrangularis Linn, Zingiberofficinale rocs, calcium, animals, patient...|$|R
