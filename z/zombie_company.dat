5000|$|What {{causes the}} {{existence}} of zombie banks are bad loans. In slow economies, businesses who borrowed from banks become unable to pay the loans back. The capital infusions received primarily from the government, but also from central bank loans, form zombie banks. This phenomenon is generally referred to as regulatory forbearance. It is giving the lender leverage to enable the banks to postpone the recognition of their losses. The government is giving zombie banks leeway in hopes {{that they will be}} able to make profits over time to cover and reverse their losses and revitalize. Rather than pressing businesses for repayment, zombie banks extend their loans with the money received from the government, which in turn causes {{the existence of}} <b>zombie</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Drawing {{on social}} {{exchange}} theory, this study uses data on China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2016 to examine why zombie enterprises are “stiff but deathless. ” We find that these enterprises {{are able to}} “linger breathlessly” due to government support {{in the form of}} increased subsidies and bank loans. The government is more inclined to grant subsidies to <b>zombie</b> <b>companies</b> that assume greater policy burdens, specifically those offering more jobs. Furthermore, an enterprise’s property rights do not influence the level of “blood transfusions” received, and government assistance fails to bolster operating efficiency or value. This phenomenon is further explored {{in the context of the}} incentives local government officials have to maintain employment stability. Our conclusions highlight the necessity and urgency of cleaning up zombie enterprises...|$|R
30|$|Among the {{internal}} characteristics influencing the enterprises’ survival, the survival risk of state-owned enterprises is {{significantly lower than}} that of non-state-owned enterprises. Such conclusion is in line with expectations, for most of the state-owned enterprises are not expelled out of the market on account of continuous losses or no earnings expectations but due to policy factors. Therefore, we can see a phenomenon {{that a large number of}} state-owned enterprises are surviving in the form of loss in the market. Enterprises’ size, age, and productivity are negatively related to the innovation enterprises’ survival risk, which means that the large-scale enterprises with high productivity of can take advantage in economies of scale, efficiency, and ability to resist risks, all of which have reduced the enterprises’ risk in the market (Tsvetkova et al. 2014; Manjon-Antolın and Arauzo-Carod 2008; Jensen et al. 2008). Old enterprises’ survival risk, significantly {{lower than that of}} young enterprises, would show that there is inertia in old enterprises, increasing the difficulty of the “search matching” and incurring an unavoidable question of survival risk concentration. Extent of financing constraints is positively related to enterprises’ survival risk, associated with the degree of, which means to alleviate Chinese enterprises’ financing constraints, meaning that easing financial constraints of Chinese enterprises helps to extend the survival time of enterprises (Yuduo et al. 2014). What needs to be pointed out is that profitability and foreign trade do not significantly reduce enterprises’ survival risk. Instead, the more enterprises rely on export, the bigger enterprises’ survival risk is. This conclusion is vastly different from existing literature (Esteve and Ssanchis-Llopis 2010; Tsvetkova et al. 2014).The possible reason is that there is a large amount of zombies in the market. Due to the reason of the administrative system, the profitability of <b>zombie</b> <b>companies</b> is very poor, but the firms do not face the risk of exiting the market, that is to say, the presence of these <b>zombie</b> <b>companies</b> may interfere with the effects of profit ability of survival risk.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} {{to fill the gap}} in the literature on moral hazard amongst companies. It seeks to explore the moral hazard for companies by linking the leverage range with the risk involuntarily assumed by third parties. The paper takes the distinctive approach of trying {{to understand the nature of}} the moral hazard affected not only through asymmetries but also through lack of resources in companies. The paper also seeks to establish the importance of companies' moral hazard from an ethical perspective and proposes an index –the moral hazard index– which provides the option of reducing risk when managers make (moral) decisions on leverage and equity levels; subsequently the assumed risk is controlled. An extreme case is set out of companies that have such high leverage that they survive with negative equity (sometimes also known as <b>zombie</b> <b>companies).</b> In such cases the assumption of risk by third parties is undeniable. The paper explains the problem and shows the concern regarding company leverage. Although the index is still only theoretical, it offers opportunities for improvement to determine its applications and utility. Moral decisions are expected to be taken with regard to the structure of the capital of companies in order to reduce the risk assumed by third parties...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the backgrounds for the stagnant {{behavior of the}} Japanese economy {{during the last two}} decades and the failure of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to turn the economy around. I argue that the policy authorities did not act quickly enough to mitigate the pain of the deleveraging process {{in the aftermath of the}} burst of land and stock price bubble in the early 1990 s. Thus, the process became overly severe and protracted. The economy increasingly became vulnerable to negative external shocks and the decline in its population. Use of non-conventional monetary policy measures after deflationary expectations became entrenched substantially weakened their power to stimulate the economy. The U. S. economy since 2007 has exhibited many of the features seen for the Japanese economy during the last two decades; hence, the talk of the Japanization of the U. S. economy. There are, however, many dissimilarities as well as similarities between the two episodes. These are also discussed along with the analysis of Japanfs two lost decades. Popular discussions of Japanfs stagnation often focus on persistent deflation. Figure 1 shows core CPI inflation and a representative property price index for Japan and the U. S. since the peak of property prices, with the peak (T= 0) assumed to be 1990 for Japan and 2006 for the U. S. In addition, it also plots investment in structures relative to GDP in Japan. Inflation in Japan has been in negative territory since 1998. 1 There has been, however, no tendency for the deflation to accelerate. The cumulative decrease in the index since the late 1990 s has been only about 5 %. Thus, the classic debt-deflation type dynamic has not been a major cause of economic stagnation. In contrast, declines in property prices in Japan since the peak has been large and protracted-cumulating in a 60 % decline at the time of writing. They led to significant deleveraging by financial institutions and non-financial corporations, which put downward pressure on aggregate demand for goods and services, especially, investment in structures, the component of aggregate demand most sensitive to property prices. The figure shows that its movements have been highly correlated with those of property prices. 2 As may be seen from the figure, this component of aggregate demand alone subtracted about 0. 4 % per year from GDP growth during the 1990 s. Such a negative feedback loop among asset prices, economic activity and, as we discuss below, financial instability has been the key feature of Japanfs stagnation. It is also interesting to note that both CPI inflation and property prices in the U. S. since the recent financial crisis have followed closely that of Japan in the 1990 s, but inflation has so far avoided plunging into negative territory. Adjustment in asset prices and real investment were to some extent inevitable given the extent of the excesses created during the bubble period. The deleveraging process, however, became extremely protracted as a result of a forbearance game played by policymakers and financial institutions. Banks kept lending for a while to <b>zombie</b> <b>companies</b> in order to avoid recognition of losses on their balance sheets, and the authority stayed away for years from making the tough decision to recapitalize the banks. This resulted in a huge buildup of bad loans and eventually in a serious credit crunch in the late 1990 s, which aggravated the declines in asset prices and deleveraging by banks and nonfinancial corporations. Banks increasingly became risk averse and stopped lending to risky, but promising projects. The economy slowly, but steadily lost momentum and could not grow out of the negative shocks generated by external financial crises in the late 1990 s and 2000 s, and the declines in its population that started in the 2000 s. Deflation of the general price level did play a part in this process as well. It has hindered the effectiveness of monetary easing. This is ironic because monetary policy normally is a tool for avoiding deflation. Either the deleveraging forces outweighed the capacity of monetary policy to stimulate the economy or the BOJ easing came a bit too late. The BOJ tried to reverse the disinflation trend with fairly aggressive rate cuts - a conventional monetary policy tool [...] and brought the policy rate to near zero by late 1995, effectively hitting the zero lower bound (ZLB) constraint on interest rates. Deflation, however, developed in response to economic weakness. The real interest rate has stayed at higher levels than desirable, and undermined the power of a zero interest rate to stimulate the economy, although it did not throw the economy into a deflationary spiral. Since the late 1990 s, the BOJ has adopted a variety of non-conventional monetary policy measures. They have supported the financial system and prevented deflation from becoming worse, but have not turned the economy around. As I argue below, non-conventional measures work by reducing risk premiums and long-short interest rate spreads. The long period of economic stagnation had lowered these spreads to minimum levels and limited the effectiveness of such measures as was the case for conventional measures. In the following I will describe in more detail the deleveraging experience in Japan and then turn to discussing the experience of the BOJ to turn the economy around. Comparisons with the U. S. experience since 2007 are offered at each stage of the discussion...|$|R
