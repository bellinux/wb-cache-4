50|$|<b>Zipeprol</b> is a {{centrally}} acting {{cough suppressant}} developed in France in the 1970s. It {{is not an}} morphinan derivative (in contrast to codeine and dextromethorphan). <b>Zipeprol</b> acts as a local anaesthetic and has mucolytic, antihistamine and anticholinergic properties.It is sold with several brand names such as Zinolta and Respilene. It is not available in the United States or Canada and has been discontinued in Europe. It is still available in some countries in Asia and South America.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zipeprol</b> {{has been}} misused in Korea, mainly for the {{hallucinations}} it produces. Such use {{has become an}} issue due to the seizures and various neurological side effects it causes at high dosages.|$|E
40|$|<b>Zipeprol,</b> a {{piperazine}} ethanol derivative, is a non-essential but {{widely used}} (paediatric) antitussive, {{which is not}} legally considered as being capable of creating dependence or abuse liability. A first group of experimental results was obtained assaying the displacement of 1 nM [3 H]naloxone by <b>zipeprol</b> vs morphine on the rat brain homogenate fractions. A second group was carried out on the longitudinal muscle of guinea-pig ileum, using the field stimulation technique, either in the absence or {{in the presence of}} naloxone 1 x 10 (- 5) M or in the absence or in the presence of yohimbine 1 x 10 (- 5) M. Further investigations concerning the pharmacological and the biochemical characterization of the mechanisms involved in abuse liability were carried out by means of the in vitro inhibition of ACh response on the guinea-pig ileum preparation. The results indicate <b>zipeprol</b> as a moderate opioid agonist, which also shows a direct anticholinergic effect, independent of presynaptic alpha 2 interaction...|$|E
40|$|Drug testing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the provision of information to health authorities on trends in drug abuse. In the Republic of Korea, the testing of urine and postmortem specimens has been used as part of a programme to monitor and control the abuse of non-controlled drugs, i. e. substances that were not originally included in the lists of controlled substances in that country. <b>Zipeprol,</b> dextromethor-phan, carisoprodol and nalbuphine are examples of such drugs, which are widely used as medicines. Increasing levels of abuse of these drugs, including abuse that resulted in fatalities, were confirmed in the Republic of Korea by the results of drug testing. Based on the accumulated data from postmortem specimens, the health authorities in the Republic of Korea subsequently introduced controls on these drugs. A significant drop in fatalities related to the abuse of these non-controlled drugs underlined the importance of timely action for improving community health. In the context of drug testing, the analysis of non-controlled and new drugs always presents a scientific challenge, because specific analytical methods for test-ing for those drugs are not available. In the Republic of Korea, as part of the drug abuse warning programme, it was necessary to establish methods for the detec-tion and quantification in biological fluids of all four non-controlled drugs and their metabolites in order to monitor the trends in drug abuse. The present paper puts forward epidemiological and clinical data on abuse and fatalities associated with <b>zipeprol,</b> dextromethorphan, carisoprodol and nal-buphine, as well as details of the analytical methods developed...|$|E
40|$|Pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) is a co-factor in many enzymatic {{pathways}} {{involved in}} amino acid metabolism: the main biologically active form is pyridoxal 5 -phosphate. Pyridoxine {{has been used}} as an antidote in acute intoxications, including isoniazid overdose, Gyromitra mushroom or false morrel (monomethylhydrazine) poisoning and hydrazine exposure. It is also recommended as a co-factor to improve the conversion of glyoxylic acid into glycine in ethylene glycol poisoning. Other indications are recommended by some sources (for example crimidine poisoning, <b>zipeprol</b> and theophylline-induced seizures, adjunct to d-penicillamine chelation), without significant supporting data. The value of pyridoxine or its congener metadoxine as an agent for hastening ethanol metabolism or improving vigilance in acute alcohol intoxication is controversial. This paper reviews the various indications of pyridoxine in clinical toxicology and the supporting literature. The potential adverse effects of excessive pyridoxine dosage will also be summarized.
