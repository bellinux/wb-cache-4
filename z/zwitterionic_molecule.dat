5000|$|Squalamine is an amphipathic <b>zwitterionic</b> <b>molecule.</b> At {{physiological}} pH it {{is positively}} charged. Because of the stereochemistry of its steroid framework, it assumes a flat, plate-like structure. As {{a consequence of}} these physical properties, squalamine binds electrostatically to membranes made of negatively charged phospholipids(PLs). The orientation of the polar substituents on squalamine causes it {{to sit on the}} surface of the membrane to which it binds, rather than penetrate the surface. Bacteria, unlike most eukaryotic cells, display negatively charged PLs on the membrane surfaces that are exposed to the environment. Squalamine, like many of the cationic antimicrobial peptides and proteins that have been discovered to date, interacts with the plasma membranes of bacteria and disturb function; precisely how squalamine's membrane attack kills its microbial targets remains unknown. Eukaryotic cells position negatively charged PLs on the inner leaflet (the cytoplasmic face)of the plasma membrane;the outer leaflet, the surface exposed to the outside world, is populated principally by zwitterionic PLs, such as phosphatidyl choline. Why such asymmetry in the anionic phospholipid composition of the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane exists is not known. Squalamine does not normally interact with the plasma membranes of normal eukaryotic cells because of the absence of negatively charged PLs on their surface. However, certain cells possess specific [...] "transporters" [...] that provide squalamine with an access through the membrane. Liver, capillary, and certain hematopoetic cells possess these transporters and define the pharmacology of the compound, restricting its bio-distribution to a limited numbers of tissues and organs in an animal. Once squalamine has traversed the plasma membrane, it binds electrostatically to the negatively charged cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, effectively neutralizing the negative surface potential. As a consequence, proteins that are bound to that surface through electrostatic interactions are displaced. The cellular consequences of this [...] "displacement" [...] will vary depending upon the specific cellular context. Since proteins such as the Rho GTPases, which play a role in actin dynamics and cellular movement, are linked to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane, squalamine disrupts several Rac1-actin-dependent processes, such as growth factor dependent endothelial migration and angiogenesis.|$|E

30|$|Tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (“BF 15 ”) is {{a strong}} Lewis acid and as such {{can be used for}} the {{activation}} of Group 4 alkyl-based olefin polymerisation precatalysts. This was employed by Marks et al.

Polymer chain scission was suppressed by H-abstraction from methyl groups under long-wavelength UV irradiation (lambda > 300 nm), which avoided the photodegradation of PSF ultrafiltration membrane. The effects of MPDSAH concentration, UV irradiation time and BP concentration on grafting degree (GD) and the improvement of membrane antifouling properties were investigated, respectively. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR/ATR) and scanning electron micrograph (SEM) were used to characterize the chemical and morphological changes of the membrane surface. Static contact angle (CA) measurements showed that the hydrophilicity of MPDSAH-modified PSF ultrafiltration membranes was enhanced {{with the increase of}} grafting degree. The flux of pure water decreased slightly after modification, while the rejection to bovine serum albumin (BSA) increased. The improvement of antifouling property for MPDSAH-modified membrane was accordant with the increase of grafting degree.

To date, optical and electrochemical methods have not been able to satisfy all of the criteria necessary to build such a device, with the main challenge being able to overcome background noise due to non-specific events when attempting to transduce the signal for a particular analyte. In attempting to solve this problem, Blocked Electrochemical Sensing Technology (BEST) has a redox-active reporter molecule that is dispersed on the electrode surface amongst an anti-fouling diluent. The main advantage of the design is that signal is proportional only to the degree to which binding of the analyte occurs around the reporting molecule (facilitated by an epitope in proximity to it), and not on the electrode surface in general. Of course, non-specific adsorption can still contribute to background signal, but the chance of this occurring is minimised for this design. Although BEST has been shown to work with various analytes, its current configuration is not suitable for commercialisation. The interface makes use of a difficult to synthesise, and unstable, molecular wire, which is necessary to facilitate electron transfer between the electrode surface and the redox reporting molecule, through the passivating oligo(ethylene glycol) -based anti-fouling layer. <b>Zwitterionic</b> <b>molecules</b> have shown great promise as an alternative to oxidation-prone oligo(ethylene glycol) -based antifouling molecules, however to date they have been attached to surfaces via long alkane tails, or have been polymer-based; either way, they passivate the surfaces to which they are attached.

Afforded by the separate treatment of matrix and guest properties, the energy transfer and the conformation dynamics were followed throughout the desorption process. The effect of the initial matrix temperature and the influence of guest molecule burial depth and charge state were investigated. Elevating the initial temperature of the matrix increased the desorption velocity of the guest molecules, but only a small change in their postdesorption internal temperature was seen. This observation may account for the lack of thermodecomposition of large guest molecules in MALDI. The liftoff velocity of the guest molecules dropped significantly as the burial depth was increased from 5 to 20 Å, indicating that the guest molecules located near the surface entered the plume with higher kinetic energy.

Also like DPH, PTE-ET- 18 -OMe has a moderate affinity for both gel state ordered domains and Lo state ordered domains (rafts). However, unlike fluorescent sterols or DPH (Megha and London (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9997 – 10004), PTE-ET- 18 -OMe is not displaced from ordered domains by ceramide. Also unlike DPH, PTE-ET- 18 -OMe shows only slow exchange between the inner and outer leaflets of membrane bilayers, and can thus be used to examine anisotropy of an individual leaflet of a lipid bilayer. Since PTE-ET- 18 -OMe is a <b>zwitterionic</b> <b>molecule,</b> it should not be as influenced by electrostatic interactions as are other probes that do not cross the lipid bilayer but have a net charge. We conclude that PTE-ET- 18 -OMe has some unique properties that should make it a useful fluorescence probe of membrane structure...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the thesis}} is to {{incorporate}} materials with either fluorescent or conductive properties in silk fibers, by feeding silkworms with a diet containing these materials. To achieve this, {{one would have to}} breed (rear) silkworm from eggs into larvaes, then to feed the silkworms with this special diet containing fluorescent or conductive materials. Samples of silk were then collected either from spun cocoons or via removing the silk producing organs (silk glands) from the silkworms via dissection. The samples were then analyzed with absorbance spectrometer, spectrofluorometer or via photoluminesecent measurement to determine if any materials had been incorporated into the silk fibers.    Silkworms were successfully reared from eggs up to moths, once the silkworm larvae had grown enough in size their diet were switches from their regular food (silkworm chow) to food containing conjugated molecules or polymers with fluorescent or conductive properties. A total of 14 materials were tested. One material gave a clear positive result and that was from the fluorescent compound Rhodamine B. Other fluorescent materials, Nile red and POWT yielded some results indicating their presence in the silk but the results were not conclusive. The rest of the materials all failed with being incorporated within the silk fibers; this was due to their lethality, size, lack of zwitterionic properties and such.   The properties of the materials are of great importance for the uptake process, where a small <b>zwitterionic</b> <b>molecule</b> has a great change of being taken up and incorporated in the silk fibers. Whereas a big materials such as a polymer without any zwitterionic will in most cases just follow through the food in the digestive track without any uptake. ...|$|E
3000|$|Interaction of the anion {{with the}} cation is {{important}} to consider as it can have a substantial effect on the polymerisation process. These types of interaction occur because of a low number of valence electrons at the metal centre. If a significant interaction exists between the anion and cation, and the active site is blocked, the anion must be removed from the active site before polymerisation can take place [126] which has been shown in various metallocene and post-metallocene systems to involve quite substantial energies [127, 128, 129]. It has already been discussed above that [MeBF 15]− forms a strong interaction with the cationic metal centre to form a <b>zwitterionic</b> <b>molecule.</b> Equally if the anion reacts with the cation to give a different non-active species, then this too has to be circumvented by the use of a different anion. It is also worth noting that anions that are usually considered non-coordinating such as [BF 4]− and [PF 6]− have been shown to react with [Cp 2 MR]+, e.g. reaction of [Cp 2 ZrMe(CH 3 CN)]+ with [PF 6]− produces Cp 2 ZrMeF via fluoride abstraction [113]. Even anions such a [BPh 4]− have been shown to interact with the cationic centres. Treatment of ZrBn 4 (Bn = CH 2 Ph) with dimethylanilinium tetraphenylborate leads to the formation of [ZrBn 3 (η 6 -C 6 H 5)BPh 3)] (21) in which the cationic centre is stabilised by the anion. This type of interaction has also been demonstrated with {C 2 H 4 (Ind) 2 }ZrMe 2 [130]. Hlatky and Turner [108] reported that [BPh 4]− can even react with cationic species such as [Cp* 2 ZrMe]+ to form 22 which is formed as a result of C–H activation.

40|$|Adsorption of l-alanine on the Cu{ 111 } {{single crystal}} surface was {{investigated}} {{as a model}} system for interactions between small chiral modifier molecules and close-packed metal surfaces. Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy are {{used to determine the}} chemical state, bond coordination and out-of-plane orientation of the molecule on the surface. Alanine adsorbs in its anionic form at room temperature, whilst at low temperature the overlayer consists of anionic and <b>zwitterionic</b> <b>molecules.</b> NEXAFS spectra exhibit a strong angular dependence of the π ⁎ resonance associated with the carboxylate group, which allows determining the tilt angle of this group with respect to the surface plane (48 ° ± 2 °) at room temperature. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) shows a p(2 √ 13 x 2 √ 13) R 13 ° superstructure with only one domain, which breaks the mirror symmetry of the substrate and, thus, induces global chirality to the surface. Temperature-programmed XPS (TP-XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments indicate that the zwitterionic form converts into the anionic species (alaninate) at 293 K. The latter desorbs/decomposes between 435 K and 445 K...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrahigh}} vacuum adsorption of cysteine layers on the Au(111) surface {{has been}} studied by means ofX-ray photoelectron (XPS) and high-resolution energy loss spectroscopies (HREELS). Room-temperaturedeposition determined {{the formation of a}} quite heterogeneous first layer, where both weakly and stronglybound molecules coexist. Deposition at a slightly higher temperature (330 K) led instead to the formation ofa homogeneous, self-assembled monolayer made of molecules chemisorbed through a thiolate bond. In thelatter case, HREELS measurements have been interpreted in terms of a well-organized H-bond network madeof <b>zwitterionic</b> <b>molecules.</b> Two vibrational modes, denoted as N and H modes, respectively, have been identifiedas distinguishing features of the homogeneous monolayer obtained at 330 K. The N mode lies at 3350 cm- 1 and is attributed to a stretching vibration of the N-H· · ·O bond. The H mode, observed at 74 cm- 1 for fullmonolayer coverage, is assigned to a collective vibration of the two-dimensional H-bond network. At halfmonolayercoverage, the H mode has been observed at 55 cm- 1. This red-shift indicates a coverage dependenceof the H-mode frequency, which clearly supports its intermolecular origin. This finding is a nice example ofthe extreme sensitivity of low-frequency vibrational modes to the details of molecule-molecule interactions...|$|R
