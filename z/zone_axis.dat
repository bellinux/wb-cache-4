25|$|Projected lattice {{geometries}} can {{be represented}} by so-called ‘lattice-fringe fingerprint plots’ (LFFPs), also called angular covariance plots. The horizontal axis of such a plot is given in reciprocal lattice length and {{is limited by the}} point resolution of the microscope.

A 2D data point is defined by the length of a reciprocal lattice vector and its (acute) angle with another reciprocal lattice vector.

40|$|Purpose: Retrospective {{study to}} analyse the {{difference}} between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing alignment in osteoarthritic knees planned for patient-specific instrumented (PSI) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim {{of the study is}} to observe whether a difference in alignment can be linked to arthritis staging or <b>zone</b> mechanical <b>axis.</b> Methods: Full-leg standing radiographs and non-weight-bearing MRI of the whole leg were compared for hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, measured according to Moreland criteria, in seventy osteoarthritic patients. Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) staging and classification according to <b>zone</b> mechanical <b>axis</b> with Kennedy <b>zones</b> was done. Results: A mean preoperative HKA angle on standing radiographs of 176. 4 ° ± 7. 2 ° was measured compared to 176. 4 ° ± 6. 9 ° for the MRI whole-leg HKA angle. A difference of 0 °- 1 ° was observed in 54 % of patients when comparing the weight-bearing with the non-weight-bearing HKA angle. Twenty-three per cent had a difference of 2 ° and another 23 % a difference of 3 ° or more. In female patients, the dynamic load pattern of weight-bearing increases the HKA angle due to convex side soft tissue laxity both in varus and valgus knees. More important differences were observed in the KL stage 3 and 4 patients (P < 0. 05) and with a load-bearing axis outside of the articular surface (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Surgeons should be aware that {{there is a difference between}} weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing alignment in patients with Kellgren-Lawrence 3 and 4 with a load-bearing axis outside of the articular surface (Kennedy 0 or 1 or 5). According to this study, these changes seem related to the amount of articular wear and the load-bearing axis. This is important for the preoperative planning process in PSI-assisted TKA. More concave side ligamentous release or more constraint can be necessary than imagined based on the PSI alignment result. Full-leg standing radiographs should be performed for PSI-assisted TKAs to analyse the position of the load-bearing axis. Level of evidence: IV. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

5000|$|Practical robustness: PED is less {{sensitive}} to small experimental variations than other electron diffraction techniques. Since the measurement is an average over many incident beam directions, {{the pattern is}} {{less sensitive}} to slight misorientation of the <b>zone</b> <b>axis</b> from the optic axis of the microscope, and resulting PED patterns will generally still display the <b>zone</b> <b>axis</b> symmetry.

5000|$|Quasi-kinematical {{diffraction}} patterns: While {{the underlying}} {{physics of the}} electron diffraction is still dynamical in nature, the conditions used to collect PED patterns minimize many of these effects. The scan/de-scan procedure reduces ion channeling because the pattern is generated off of the <b>zone</b> <b>axis.</b> Integration via precession of the beam minimizes the effect of non-systematic inelastic scattering, such as Kikuchi lines. Few reflections are strongly excited at any moment during precession, {{and those that are}} excited are generally much closer to a two-beam condition (dynamically coupled only to the forward-scattered beam). Furthermore, for large precession angles, the radius of the excited Laue circle becomes quite large. These contributions combine such that the overall integrated diffraction pattern resembles the kinematical pattern much more closely than a single <b>zone</b> <b>axis</b> pattern.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zone</b> <b>axis,</b> a term {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to [...] "high-symmetry" [...] orientations in a crystal, most generally refers to any direction referenced to the direct lattice (as distinct from the reciprocal lattice) of a crystal in three dimensions.

40|$|Heat flow {{measurements}} {{were made at}} 31 stations {{in the middle and}} southwestern Okinawa Trough to investigate the thermal structure and hydrothermal activity near the surface. The heat flow in the central graben of the southwestern Okinawa Trough is highly variable, ranging from 30 to 180 mW/m 2. The variability can be attributed to hydrothermal circulation associated with recent volcanic intrusions. In the middle Okinawa Trough, a detailed survey around the central axis has revealed that the area of extremely high and variable heat flow anomaly (with the average of 600 to 700 mW/m 2) is confined in a less than 10 km wide <b>zone</b> along the <b>axis.</b> 沖縄トラフでは現在大陸地殻のリフティングが進行中であるとされるが,その熱的構造と表層での熱水循環について調べることを目的として,南西部及び中部沖縄トラフの合計 31 地点において地殻熱流量測定を実施した. その結果,南西部沖縄トラフでは,中軸部に東西に延びる八重山地溝内の熱流量は 30 - 180 mW/m 2 と,中東沖縄トラフでの熱流量値に 1000 mW/m 2 を超すものがあるのに比べてかなり低く,中軸での熱的活動度が中部より低いことを示唆している. その一方で,熱流量のばらつきは非常に大きく,地溝内に存在する貫入岩体にともなって熱水循環が起こっているのではないかと考えられる. また, 1984 年のDELP航海で発見された中部沖縄トラフ中軸部の高熱流量異常域は,軸と平行な方向にはある程度延びているが,その幅はせいぜい 10 km以内であることが明らかになった...|$|R
30|$|For the {{vertical}} inlet (Fig.  5), flow enters the tank through the inlet as a jet and flows with high velocity towards the free surface. At the water surface, the upward flow was spread into one lobe towards {{the center and}} two circulation zones {{to the left and}} right of the central surface jet. As the water flows toward the center, it was diverted toward the tank bottom, creating a recirculation <b>zone</b> around an <b>axis</b> parallel to the x-axis. Some portion of this water gets back into the jet to mix with new water entering through the inlet. The other portion of water flows out through the outlet. Again high velocities were found near the inlet, the outlet, and in the outer parts of the recirculation regions. Very low velocities were observed in the central areas of the re-circulation regions.|$|R
50|$|Energy-dispersive x-ray {{spectroscopy}} (EDS) and {{electron energy}} loss spectroscopy (EELS) {{are commonly used}} techniques to both qualitatively and quantitatively probe the composition of samples in the TEM. A primary challenge in the quantitative accuracy of both techniques is the phenomenon of channelling. Put simply, in a crystalline solid, the probability of interaction between an electron and ion in the lattice depends strongly on the momentum (direction and velocity) of the electron. When probing a sample under diffraction conditions near a <b>zone</b> <b>axis,</b> {{as is often the}} case in EDS and EELS applications, channelling can have a large impact on the effective interaction of the incident electrons with specific ions in the crystal structure. In practice, this can lead to erroneous measurements of composition that depend strongly on the orientation and thickness of the sample and the accelerating voltage. Since PED entails an integration over incident directions of the electron probe, and generally does not include beams parallel to the <b>zone</b> <b>axis,</b> the detrimental channeling effects outlined above can be minimized, yielding far more accurate composition measurements in both techniques.|$|E
5000|$|One {{result of}} this, as {{illustrated}} in the figure above, is that [...] "low-index" [...] zones are generally perpendicular to [...] "low Miller-index" [...] lattice-planes, which in turn have small spatial-frequencies (g-values) and hence large lattice-periodicities (d-spacings). Put another way, in electron microscopy if you want your electron beam to be directed down wide (hence easily visible) tunnels between columns of atoms in a crystal, directing the beam down a low-index (and by association high-symmetry) <b>zone</b> <b>axis</b> may help to this end.|$|E
50|$|Precession {{electron}} diffraction enables {{much more}} direct determination of space group symmetries over {{other forms of}} electron diffraction. Because of the increased number of reflections in both the zero order Laue zone and higher order Laue zones, the geometric relationship between Laue zones is more readily determined. This provides three-dimensional information about the crystal structure {{that can be used}} to determine its space group. Furthermore, because the PED technique is insensitive to slight misorientation from the <b>zone</b> <b>axis,</b> it provides the practical benefit of more robust data collection.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} value of CT-arthrography imaging in the {{diagnosis}} of knee osteoarthritis and to facilitate the selection of partial versus total knee replacement. Methods: A retrospective study of 100 patients that had either medial unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) (N= 50) or total knee replacement (TKR) (N= 50). One observer measured lower limb mechanical alignment and osteoarthritis patterns of the knee in each compartment with radiographs, CT-arthrography and full leg standing radiographs. Results: All patients had Kellgren-Lawrence grade IV osteoarthritis of the medial femorotibial joint with a mean (SD) varus alignment of the lower limb (172 ° (3. 5 °) HKA-angle). <b>Zone</b> mechanical <b>axis</b> distribution showed strong correlation with HKA-axis. Arthritis patterns were different for patients selected for UKR or TKR. UKR patients had anteromedial osteoarthritis and wear of the medial facet of the patella in contrast to TKR patients who had medial osteoarthritis associated with diffuse or lateral patellofemoral wear and wear of the central or posterior zones of the lateral compartment. Medial facet wear of the patella is related to more important varus alignment of the lower limb (Kennedy zone 0 and 1). Conclusion: CT-arthrography imaging can show lesions that are not visible on plain or stress radiographs because of central or posterior localization with surrounding intact cartilage. Patients who develop tri-compartmental osteoarthritis despite varus alignment have probably other risk factors than their mechanical alignment and should be considered candidates for TKR...|$|R

50|$|The {{result of}} this process is a {{diffraction}} pattern that consists of a summation or integration over the patterns generated during precession. While the geometry of this pattern matches the pattern associated with a normally incident beam, the intensities of the various reflections approximate those of the kinematical pattern much more closely. At any moment in time during precession, the diffraction pattern consists of a Laue circle with a radius equal to the precession angle, φ. It is crucial to note that these snapshots contain far fewer strongly excited reflections than a normal <b>zone</b> <b>axis</b> pattern and extend farther into reciprocal space. Thus, the composite pattern will display far less dynamical character, and will be well suited for use as input into direct methods calculations.|$|E

The dependence of the problem of the structure of the flow in the interaction region on the dimensionless parameters is studied, and a simple expression is derived for the size of the pre-heating <b>zones</b> at the <b>axis</b> of symmetry.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} and magnetic properties of Ni–Mn–Sb intermetallic compounds {{are closely related}} to the martensitic transformation and martensite variant organization. However, studies of these issues are very limited. Thus, a thorough crystallographic investigation of the martensitic transformation orientation relationship (OR), the transformation deformation and their impact on the variant organization of an Ni 50 Mn 38 Sb 12 alloy using scanning electron microscopy/electron backscatter diffraction (SEM/EBSD) was conducted in this work. It is shown that the martensite variants are hierarchically organized into plates, each possessing four distinct twin-related variants, and the plates into plate colonies, each containing four distinct plates delimited by compatible and incompatible plate interfaces. Such a characteristic organization is produced by the martensitic transformation. It is revealed that the transformation obeys the Pitsch relation (0 1 1 A // 2 2 1 M and 〈 0 11 〉A // 〈 1 22 〉M; the subscripts A and M refer to austenite and martensite, respectively). The type I twinning plane K 1 of the intra-plate variants and the compatible plate interface plane correspond to the respective orientation relationship planes 0 1 1 A and 0 1 1 A of austenite. The three 0 1 1 A planes possessed by each pair of compatible plates, one corresponding to the compatible plate interface and the other two to the variants in the two plates, are interrelated by 60 ° and belong to a single 〈 11 1 〉A <b>axis</b> <b>zone.</b> The 0 1 1 A planes representing the two pairs of compatible plates in each plate colony belong to two 〈 11 1 〉A <b>axis</b> <b>zones</b> having one 0 1 1 A plane in common. This common plane defines the compatible plate interfaces of the two pairs of plates. The transformation strains to form the variants in the compatible plates are compatible and demonstrate an edge-to-edge character. Thus, such plates should nucleate and grow simultaneously. On the other hand, the strains to form the variants in the incompatible plates are incompatible, so they nucleate and grow separately until they meet during the transformation. The results of the present work provide comprehensive information on the martensitic transformation of Ni–Mn–Sb intermetallic compounds and its impact on martensite variant organization...|$|R
