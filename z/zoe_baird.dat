5000|$|After Clinton's inauguration, Hubbell became White House {{liaison to}} the United States Department of Justice, {{arriving}} at Justice on January 20, 1993. [...] During the period before an Attorney General was approved, Hubbell worked as the {{assistant to the}} Attorney General, but reported to Republican appointee, Acting Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson. Clinton considered Hubbell for the Attorney General position on January 30, 1993, after <b>Zoë</b> <b>Baird's</b> name was withdrawn, but Clinton nominated Janet Reno. [...] Hubbell was formally nominated as Associate Attorney General on April 2, 1993, and was immediately attacked for his ties to the Clintons. Hubbell's nomination was nonetheless quickly confirmed by the U.S. Senate and he served as Associate Attorney General until April 1994. He oversaw all the civil divisions of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and was appointed by Janet Reno as the Chief Operating Officer of Department and its 100,000 employees and $10 billion budget.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zoë</b> Eliot <b>Baird</b> (born June 20, 1952) is an American {{lawyer who}} is {{president}} of the Markle Foundation. She is known for her role in the Nannygate matter of 1993, which arose when she was nominated by President Bill Clinton as the first woman to be Attorney General of the United States, but she withdrew her nomination when it was discovered she had hired illegal immigrants and failed to pay taxes. In the last 15 years, she has led the Markle Foundation, which has worked primarily through task forces to achieve broad laws that modernize sectors like health care and the national security community.|$|R
25|$|On December 3, 2004, Kerik was {{nominated}} by President Bush to succeed Tom Ridge as United States Secretary of Homeland Security. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales vetted Kerik during that nomination period. But on December 10, {{after a week}} of press scrutiny, Kerik withdrew acceptance of the nomination. Kerik stated that he had unknowingly hired an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper. Similar violations of immigration law had previously caused the withdrawal of the nominations of Linda Chavez as secretary of labor by George W. Bush and of <b>Zoë</b> <b>Baird</b> and Kimba Wood for attorney general by President Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, Bill Clinton {{only had}} one {{outstanding}} Cabinet confirmation {{at the end of}} his first day in office and George W. Bush had all but one approved before February 1, 2001. Ronald Reagan had twelve of thirteen Cabinet members confirmed before February 1, and Jimmy Carter had all eleven of his confirmed. George H. W. Bush only had seven of thirteen confirmed by this time. Whereas his predecessors had to trade favours for contentious approvals such as <b>Zoe</b> <b>Baird</b> (Clinton), John Tower (G.H.W.

50|$|Formally {{incorporated}} on April 26, 1927, as the John and Mary R.

In 1998, when <b>Zoë</b> <b>Baird</b> became president, she shifted the foundation's focus to accelerating the use of information and information technology to address critical public problems, particularly in the areas of health and national security.

5000|$|On March 2, 1993, Wallwork made a {{late and}} {{surprising}} {{entrance into the}} Republican gubernatorial primary. The two leading candidates, both moderates, former New Jersey Board of Public Utilities President Christine Todd Whitman and former New Jersey Attorney General W.

This was an issue in early 1993, after President Clinton's first two nominees for U.S. Attorney General, <b>Zoe</b> <b>Baird</b> and Kimba Wood, were forced to withdraw their nominations after admitting that they hired undocumented aliens as nannies. Wallwork billed himself as a conservative businessman, and pledged to [...] "repeal every dime" [...] of Governor Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase.|$|E
5000|$|For Mr. Clinton, Mr. Jordan's roles {{have been}} manifold: Golfing companion. Smoother of ruffled {{feathers}} (he put the president {{back in touch}} with <b>Zoë</b> <b>Baird</b> after the withdrawal of her nomination to be attorney general). Consoler in chief (after Mr. Clinton was defeated for re-election as governor in 1980, after the suicide of Vincent W. Foster Jr. in 1993). Conduit to the high and mighty (he took Mr. Clinton in 1991 to the Bilderberg conference in Germany, an exclusive annual retreat for politicians and businessmen). Go-between (he told Mike Espy he had to go as secretary of agriculture, helped win Warren Christopher a larger role as secretary of state and sounded out Gen. Colin L. Powell for a Cabinet job).|$|E
5000|$|In the Nannygate {{matter of}} 1993, Wood was Bill Clinton's second {{unsuccessful}} choice for United States Attorney General. Like Clinton's previous nominee, <b>Zoë</b> <b>Baird,</b> Wood had hired {{an illegal immigrant}} as a nanny, but unlike Baird, she had paid the required taxes on the employee. Wood employed the illegal immigrant {{at a time when}} it was legal to do so, before the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made the hiring of illegal immigrants unlawful. The threat of a repetition of the same controversy nevertheless led to the hasty withdrawal of Wood from consideration. [...] Janet Reno was later nominated and confirmed for the post. White House officials said they were angry at Judge Wood because she had not told Clinton and other officials about the nanny, even when she had been directly asked. In her statement, however, Judge Wood said she had not misled the White House.|$|E

5000|$|Liberal lawyers wanted Harvard Law {{professor}} and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe, but Clinton {{and his aides}} next considered several candidates as [...] "outside-the-box" [...] choices. Clinton played {{with the idea of}} nominating a brilliant political philosopher instead of a practicing attorney. Professors Stephen L. Carter of Yale and Michael Sandel of Harvard would have fit the bill, but Clinton then hit upon what he considered to be a [...] "sexy" [...] idea: the nomination of his wife, Hillary Clinton. However, there was a huge problem associated with such a selection. George Stephanopoulos, a Clinton aide at the time, has written that the idea was dropped because the president's [...] "choice had to be ratified by the Senate, where Republicans hadn't forgotten the rejection of Robert Bork, and Democrats were reeling from their recent encounters with <b>Zoe</b> <b>Baird,</b> Kimba Wood, and Lani Guinier. Sexy was good, but safe was better. We simply couldn't afford another failed nomination."

5000|$|While {{some men}} were {{affected}} by Nannygate, most of the public commentary revolved around its effect on women. [...] The February 10, 1993, op-ed page of The New York Times, which carried considerable Nannygate coverage in general, was exclusively devoted towards discussing it as a women's issue.The press themselves came in for some criticism in this respect, with the group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting complaining that the Times and other media outlets focused {{on the effect of}} Nannygate on white, upper-middle-class women, and excluded the perspective of the actual immigrant childcare workers.Stuart Taylor, Jr., in his March 1993 piece [...] "Inside the Whirlwind: How <b>Zoë</b> <b>Baird</b> Was Monstrously Caricatured for the Smallest of Sins, Pounded by Press and Popular Righteousness, and Crucified by Prejudice and Hypocrisy" [...] for The American Lawyer, concluded that Baird was done in by a political-media culture bent on populism and symbolic blood sport and that she was penalized for being honest.
