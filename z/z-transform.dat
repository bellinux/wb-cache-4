25|$|Certain {{difference}} equations - in particular, linear {{constant coefficient}} difference equations - {{can be solved}} using <b>z-transforms.</b> The <b>z-transforms</b> are a class of integral transforms that lead to more convenient algebraic manipulations and more straightforward solutions. There are cases in which obtaining a direct solution would be all but impossible, yet solving the problem via a thoughtfully chosen integral transform is straightforward.|$|R

25|$|The {{region of}} {{convergence}} (ROC) is {{the set of}} points in the complex plane for which the <b>Z-transform</b> summation converges.|$|E
25|$|John R. Ragazzini {{introduced}} {{digital control}} {{and the use of}} <b>Z-transform</b> in control theory (invented by Laplace) in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The 'z-plane' is a discrete-time {{version of}} the s-plane, where <b>z-transforms</b> are used instead of the Laplace transformation.|$|R
40|$|Based upon new identities between <b>z-transforms</b> at a basis rate, <b>z-transforms</b> at faster rates, and {{modified}} <b>z-transforms,</b> the equivalence between the frequency decomposition method and the switch decomposition method is precisely presented so that results of one method are easily obtained from {{results of the}} other. Next, a method is developed for determining the closed loop transfer function of multiloop, multirate sampled-data systems with noninteger ratio sampling rates. Previously, this process involved solving a complex system of equations with rational polynomial coefficients. Herein, this is avoided by introducing a systematic decomposition of matrix operators which naturally arise from the switch decomposition method. The matrix operators are simplified by introducing the shifted transforms of signals sampled {{at one of the}} faster rates...|$|R

25|$|In signal processing, this {{definition}} {{can be used}} to evaluate the <b>Z-transform</b> of the unit impulse response of a discrete-time causal system.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematics}} and signal processing, the <b>Z-transform</b> converts a discrete-time signal, {{which is a}} sequence of real or complex numbers, into a complex frequency domain representation.|$|E
25|$|From a {{mathematical}} view the <b>Z-transform</b> {{can also be}} viewed as a Laurent series where one views the sequence of numbers under consideration as the (Laurent) expansion of an analytic function.|$|E

5000|$|The {{same result}} can be {{obtained}} from <b>Z-transforms,</b> constrained to values of complex-variable, z, of the form [...] Then the transform is the same Fourier series with different frequency normalization. By comparison with , we deduce: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{discrete}} Fourier transform can {{be viewed}} as a special case of the <b>z-transform,</b> evaluated on the unit circle in the complex plane; more general z-transforms correspond to complex shifts a and b above.|$|E
25|$|The idea {{contained}} within the <b>Z-transform</b> is also known in mathematical literature as the method of generating functions which {{can be traced back}} as early as 1730 when it was introduced by de Moivre in conjunction with probability theory.|$|E
25|$|Examples 2 & 3 clearly {{show that}} the <b>Z-transform</b> X(z) of x is unique when and only when specifying the ROC. Creating the pole–zero plot for the causal and anticausal case {{show that the}} ROC for either case {{does not include the}} pole that is at 0.5. This extends to cases with {{multiple}} poles: the ROC will never contain poles.|$|E

500|$|In many cases, {{the system}} under {{consideration}} is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. [...] In such cases, it is convenient {{to express the}} transfer matrix {{in terms of the}} Laplace transform (in the case of continuous time variables) or the <b>z-transform</b> (in the case of discrete time variables) of the variables.

30|$|The {{z-transformation}} is {{a linear}} transformation whereby the transformed mean is 0 {{and the standard}} deviation is 1.
