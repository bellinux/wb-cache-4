5000|$|The {{zygotene}} stage, {{also known}} as <b>zygonema,</b> from Greek words meaning [...] "paired threads", occurs as the chromosomes approximately line up with each other into homologous chromosome pairs. In some organisms, {{this is called the}} bouquet stage {{because of the way the}} telomeres cluster at one end of the nucleus. At this stage, the synapsis (pairing/coming together) of homologous chromosomes takes place, facilitated by assembly of central element of the synaptonemal complex. Pairing is brought about in a zipper-like fashion and may start at the centromere (procentric), at the chromosome ends (proterminal), or at any other portion (intermediate). Individuals of a pair are equal in length and in position of the centromere. Thus pairing is highly specific and exact. The paired chromosomes are called bivalent or tetrad chromosomes.|$|E

40|$|Allium porrum L. (cultivated leek) (2 n = 4 x = 32) is {{a fertile}} {{tetraploid}} that forms bivalents with pericentric chiasmata at metaphase I. To investigate {{the basis of}} this unusual behavior for a tetraploid, we describe the karyotype, axial cores, synaptonemal complexes (SCs), and meiotic nodules of A. porrum. The karyotype appears to be autotetraploid. This conclusion is also supported by presynaptic alignment of axial cores in groups of four and partner trades between pairs of SCs. Numerous early nodules are distributed all along axial cores and SCs during <b>zygonema,</b> but they are lost by late <b>zygonema</b> - early pachynema. Late (recombination) nodules (RNs) are present on SCs near kinetochores throughout the remainder of pachynema. This pattern of RNs corresponds to the pattern of pericentric chiasmata. Pachytene quadrivalents usually are resolved into bivalents because partner trades between SC lateral elements rarely occur between RNs on the same segment of SC. Thus, the patterns of crossing-over and partner trades promote balanced disjunction and high fertility in autotetraploid A. porrum. Rare quadrivalents observed at metaphase I must be due to infrequent partner trades between RNs. Polycomplexes, unusual in their number and size, were observed during <b>zygonema.</b> Key words : synaptonemal complex, recombination nodules, localized chiasmata, polycomplex, Allium porrum...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{chromosomes}} to {{move across the}} nuclear space {{is essential for the}} reorganization of the nucleus that takes place in early meiotic prophase. Chromosome dynamics of prophase I have been studied in budding and fission yeasts, but little is known about this process in higher eukaryotes, where genomes and chromosomes are much larger and meiosis takes a longer time to complete. This knowledge gap has been mainly caused by difficulties in culturing isolated live meiocytes of multicellular eukaryotes. To study the nuclear dynamics during meiotic prophase in maize, we established a system to observe live meiocytes inside intact anthers. We found that maize chromosomes exhibited extremely dynamic and complex motility in <b>zygonema</b> and pachynema. The movement patterns differed dramatically between the two stages. Chromosome movements included rotations of the entire chromatin and movements of individual chromosome segments, which were mostly telomere-led. Chromosome motility was coincident with dynamic deformations of the nuclear envelope. Both, chromosome and nuclear envelope motility depended on actin microfilaments as well as tubulin. The complexity of the nuclear movements implies that several different mechanisms affect chromosome motility in early meiotic prophase in maize. We propose that the vigorous nuclear motility provides a mechanism for homologous loci to find each other during <b>zygonema...</b>|$|E
40|$|Meiosis is the {{biological}} process that, after {{a cycle of}} DNA replication, halves the cellular chromosome complement, leading {{to the formation of}} haploid gametes. Haploidization is achieved via two successive rounds of chromosome segregation, meiosis I and II. In mammals, during prophase of meiosis I, homologous chromosomes align and synapse through a recombination-mediated mechanism initiated by the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by the SPO 11 protein. In male mice, if SPO 11 expression and DSB number are reduced below heterozygosity levels, chromosome synapsis is delayed, chromosome tangles form at pachynema, and defective cells are eliminated by apoptosis at epithelial stage IV at a spermatogenesis-specific endpoint. Whether DSB levels produced in Spo 11 (+/-) spermatocytes represent, or approximate, the threshold level required to guarantee successful homologous chromosome pairing is unknown. Using a mouse model that expresses Spo 11 from a bacterial artificial chromosome, within a Spo 11 (-/-) background, we demonstrate that when SPO 11 expression is reduced and DSBs at <b>zygonema</b> are decreased (approximately 40  % below wild-type level), meiotic chromosome pairing is normal. Conversely, DMC 1 foci number is increased at pachynema, suggesting that under these experimental conditions, DSBs are likely made with delayed kinetics at <b>zygonema.</b> In addition, we provide evidences that when zygotene-like cells receive enough DSBs before chromosome tangles develop, chromosome synapsis can be completed in most cells, preventing their apoptotic elimination...|$|E

40|$|The {{nomenclature}} {{and identity}} of Chiropsalmus quadrigatus have been extensively confused. Originally described from Rangoon, Burma, {{based on an}} immature and badly damaged specimen, subsequent Philippine and Australian redescriptions do not match primary characters of the holotype. This has led to widespread messiness in identification and classification of this and related species. In order to clarify the nomenclature of the Chiropsalmus-type cubomedusae, a preliminary revision of the Chiropsalmidae is given. Chiropsoides quadrigatus comb. nov. is proposed, in order to reflect the close relationship of this taxon with Chiropsoides buitendijki, based on the shared character of linear-branching pedalia. A common Australian form, often attributed to Chiropsalmus quadrigatus, is herein described as a new genus and species, Chiropsella bronzie.

40|$|Mammalian meiocytes feature four meiosis-specific cohesin {{proteins}} {{in addition to}} ubiquitous ones, but {{the roles of the}} individual cohesin complexes are incompletely understood. To decipher the functions of the two meiosis-specific kleisins, REC 8 or RAD 21 L, together with the only meiosis-specific SMC protein SMC 1 β, we generated Smc 1 β-/-Rec 8 -/- and Smc 1 β-/-Rad 21 L-/- mouse mutants. Analysis of spermatocyte chromosomes revealed that besides SMC 1 β complexes, SMC 1 α/RAD 21 and to a small extent SMC 1 α/REC 8 contribute to chromosome axis length. Removal of SMC 1 β and RAD 21 L almost completely abolishes all chromosome axes. The sex chromosomes do not pair in single or double mutants, and autosomal synapsis is impaired in all mutants. Super resolution microscopy revealed synapsis-associated SYCP 1 aberrantly deposited between sister chromatids and on single chromatids in Smc 1 β-/-Rad 21 L-/- cells. All mutants show telomere length reduction and structural disruptions, while wild-type telomeres feature a circular TRF 2 structure reminiscent of t-loops. There is no loss of centromeric cohesion in both double mutants at leptonema/early <b>zygonema,</b> indicating that, at least in the mutant backgrounds, an SMC 1 α/RAD 21 complex provides centromeric cohesion at this early stage.

40|$|Bloom’s {{syndrome}} (BS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder of humans characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, immunodeficiency, genomic instability, and a predisposition {{to a wide variety}} of neoplasms. The genomic instability is evidenced in BS somatic cells as a high incidence of gaps and breaks, chromatid exchanges, chromosome rearrangements, and locus-specific mutations. BS arises from a mutation in BLM, a gene encoding a protein with homology to the RecQ helicase family. Men with BS are sterile; women have reduced fertility and a shortened reproductive span. The current immunocytological study on mouse spermatocytes shows that the BLM protein is first evident as discrete foci along the synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of homologously synapsed autosomal bivalents in late <b>zygonema</b> of meiotic prophase. BLM foci progressively dissociate from the synapsed autosomal axes during early pachynema and are no longer seen in mid-pachynema. BLM colocalizes with the single-stranded DNA binding replication protein A, which has been shown to be involved in meiotic synapsis. However, there is a temporal delay in the appearance of BLM protein along the SCs relative to replication protein A, suggesting that BLM is required for a late step in processing of a subset of genomic DNA involved in establishment of interhomologue interactions in early meiotic prophase. In late pachynema and into diplonema, BLM is more dispersed in the nucleoplasm, especially over the chromatin most intimately associated with the SCs, suggesting a possible involvement of BLM in resolution of interlocks in preparation for homologous chromosome disjunction during anaphase I...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} earlier that DNA {{polymerase}} beta (Pol beta) localizes to the synaptonemal complex (SC) during Prophase I of meiosis in mice. Pol beta localizes to synapsed axes during <b>zygonema</b> and pachynema, and it associates with {{the ends of}} bivalents during late pachynema and diplonema. To test whether these localization patterns reflect a function for Pol beta in recombination and/or synapsis, we used conditional gene targeting to delete the PolB gene from germ cells. We find that Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are defective in meiotic chromosome synapsis and undergo apoptosis during Prophase I. We also find that SPO 11 -dependent gammaH 2 AX persists on meiotic chromatin, indicating that Pol beta is critical for the repair of SPO 11 -induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes yielded reduced steady-state levels of the SPO 11 -oligonucleotide complexes that are formed when SPO 11 {{is removed from the}} ends of DSBs, and cytological experiments revealed that chromosome-associated foci of replication protein A (RPA), RAD 51 and DMC 1 are less abundant in Pol beta-deficient spermatocyte nuclei. Localization of Pol beta to meiotic chromosomes requires the formation of SPO 11 -dependent DSBs. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that Pol beta is required at a very early step in the processing of meiotic DSBs, at or before the removal of SPO 11 from DSB ends and the generation of the 3 ' single-stranded tails necessary for subsequent strand exchange. The chromosome synapsis defects and Prophase I apoptosis of Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are likely a direct consequence of these recombination defect...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} our observations at pachytene on opposite-arms intercrosses between {{stocks of}} interchanges that involve chromosomes 1 and 5 in maize. —Pairing {{does not begin}} at the centromeres in these intercrosses. —We propose a model which assumes different probability values along each chromosome arm for the initial or primary site of pairing. Observations on the frequencies of {{the different types of}} configurations at pachytene were used to estimate probability values which satisfactorily fit the data. —There is a relatively low probability (of the order of. 1 to. 3) for the initial pairing to be in a short terminal segment (about. 1 of the arm length). Initial pairing in the one or two short segments adjacent to the tip segment is much higher. Initial pairing is much lower in segments successively closer to the middles of the chromosome arms, and then zero or nearly zero in the proximal half of the arm. This means that the initial pairing may fail occasionally even in a relatively long interchanged segment and produce a T-shaped (3 -armed) configuration. —After the initial pairing has occurred, the average probability that a secondary site of pairing is adjacent to the centromere in a segment. 3 to. 4 the length of an arm is low (. 13, ranging from. 02 to. 29). —We can predict that in an intercross in which both breakpoints in both parental interchanges are far out on the chromosomes, "pairs" will be formed with nonhomologous ends (homologous differential segments paired). In these pairing could have begun at any point in the interstitial segments, but not likely in segments close to the centromeres. —Multiple secondary sites which vary in time or in order of pairing will explain the variation in position of the cross-shaped pachytene configuration in interchange heterozygotes. —The observed configuration in any one cell {{is the result of a}} particular combination of pairing events at the various sites. This is a very different concept of pairing from previous interpretations which described it as a result of zipper-like action, and the variation in position of the pachytene cross-configuration as the result of "shifts" in position. —Our cytogenetic results and their interpretation are in close agreement with reports on chromosome ultrastructure and molecular events in the early stages of meiosis, i. e. the attachment of chromosome ends to the nuclear membrane, the manner in which synaptonemal complexes develop, and the regions of DNA whose replication is delayed until <b>zygonema...</b>|$|E
40|$|Meiosis is {{a special}} type of cell {{division}} that produces haploid gametes from diploid parental cells. As such, meiosis stands at the gateway to sexual reproduction in most eukaryotic organisms. During meiosis, a complex, but tightly coordinated series of events occur. Homologous chromosomes come together and pair along their entire length. If all goes well, these same chromosomes exchange reciprocally {{and in doing so}} generate new gene combinations, as well as {{set the stage for the}} subsequent disjunction at meiosis I. The 'hows' and 'whens' of these remarkable events have been under investigation for over 100 years. One central character in these events is the synaptonemal complex (SC), which is a conspicuous player in the meiotic story. The present study aims at understanding two major aspects of the SC: * the constituents of the SC * the organisation and function of the individual components within the SC The SC consists of three parts: a central element (CE), two flanking lateral elements (LEs, which are called axial elements (AEs) prior to homologous chromosome pairing), and linking transverse filaments (TFs). Three protein components of the SC have been characterised, SCP 1, 2 and 3. SCP 1 has been shown to be a component of the TF, while both SCP 2 and SCP 3 are part of the LE. We have used immunoelectron microscopy to study how the SCP 1 protein molecules are organised within SC. We found that the N-terminal end of SCP 1 was located within the CE of the SC, whereas the C-terminal end was close to the LEs. We also established in a yeast twohybrid assay that the N-terminal domain of SCP 1 strongly interacted with itself. We have therefore proposed a model in which the TFs consist of one or more pairs of SCP 1 dimers, each pair being organised in a head-to-head arrangement, with the C-termini anchored in the LEs and the two N-termini being joined in the CE. We investigated the fiber-forming properties of SCP 3 both in vitro and in vivo. We found that in cultured somatic cells SCP 3 could self-assemble into multi-stranded and cross-striated fibers, which resemble the highly ordered LE in some organisms. An in vitro binding assay and an in vivo coexpression study also supported this self-polymerising feature of SCP 3. The former showed that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of SCP 3 mediates homophilic protein-protein interactions, while the coexpression of SCP 3 cDNAs encoding the coiled coil domain and the entire SCP 3 could inhibit fiber formation in vivo. We therefore proposed that SCP 3 fibers could constitute the core of the AE/LE and function as a molecular framework to which other proteins attach. To test this model, we successfully generated SCP 3 -deficient mice. The male mice were found to be sterile due to disruption of spermatogenesis at <b>zygonema,</b> which led to massive germ cell apoptosis. This suggests that lack of SCP 3 triggers a surveillance mechanism that rids the seminiferous tubule of incompetent meiotic cells. In no case was an AE or a SC formed in the mutant spermatocytes, showing that SCP 3 indeed constitutes the core. SCP 3 was also found to be required for homologous chromosome synapsis, but appears to be dispensable for sister-chromatid cohesion. While the absence of SCP 3 affected the nuclear distribution of Rad 51, RPA and SCP 1, a residual chromatin organisation remained in the mutant meiotic cells. We propose that the sister chromatids are held together by a meiotic cohesin complex functioning as a basic protein backbone. As germ cells enter leptonema, the SC proteins attach to this backbone, forming AEs, and subsequently a synaptonemal complex...|$|E
