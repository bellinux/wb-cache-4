5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Herv√© de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|R
25|$|The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) issued two statements, one on 1 May and {{the other}} on 4 May 1995, during and {{immediately}} after the operation, respectively. The first statement demanded that Croatia end its attack in the area, and that both Croatia and the RSK should abide with the economic and ceasefire agreements in place. The second statement reiterated the requests made three days earlier, adding the UNSC's condemnation of RSK attacks on Zagreb and other population centres, urged an immediate ceasefire brokered by Akashi and condemned the incursions of the HV in <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> in Banovina, Kordun, Lika and northern Dalmatia, near Knin (UNCRO Sectors North and South), as well as incursions by both the HV and the military of the RSK in eastern Slavonia (UNCRO Sector East). The statement called for the withdrawal of forces from the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> in the Sectors North, South and East, but failed to request any pullout from the UNCRO Sector Westthe area where Operation Flash had just been fought. The statements were supported by the UNSC Resolution 994. In August 1995, after Operation Storm, the UNCRO withdrew to the eastern Slavonia.|$|R

40|$|The {{displacement}} per {{pulse of}} lambda, T 4, and G DNA during pulsed-field {{agarose gel electrophoresis}} has been measured for a fine mesh of pulse durations T between 0. 02 and 120 s. The slopes of these curves show that the DNA moves by two distinct processes, designated 1 and 2, depending upon the pulse duration T. Process 1 operates at short T and causes dx/dT to decrease gradually with increasing T. This process is independent of molecular weight M. Process 2 is effective at longer T and causes dx/dT to rise sharply in sigmoidal fashion at a value of T which increases as M 1. 2, finally reaching a plateau of 1. 4 microns/s for E = 4 V/cm. The shape of the dx/dT curve and its dependence on M lead directly to 4 <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> in plots <b>of</b> mobility vs M for different T. The alignment of the 3 DNAs during PFGE was measured by fluorescence-detected linear dichroism for E between 4 and 10 V/cm.

40|$|Urban {{spaces are}} sites of dynamic connection, {{but may also}} be defined by their {{established}} boundaries. Walls and fences {{are just some of}} the forms of demarcation; legacies of inequality also forcefully structure cities. From Berlin to Philadelphia, modern history is rife with examples of urban segregation that is both architecturally built and socially inscribed. The daily life of a city includes <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> influenced by race, gender, sexuality, and class, while interaction across and within transnational cultural spaces remaps our understandings of global borders. Further, the expanding prison industrial complex is another prominent example of internal division in which narratives of freedom and repression are jointly expressed. But even with histories of struggle, cities continue to be ideal locales from which to transform communities, where individuals can work across lines of difference and pursue collective grassroots projects. Digital tools designed for cityscapes also offer new ways to explore and revise legacies of division. This writing course will approach the topic of divided cities through a range of interdisciplinary cultural approaches and comparative 20 th- and 21 st-century case studies. In addition to regular writing assignments, our class will take several class field trips to sites in Washington D. C. and Philadelphia, with the latter city serving as one of our primary sources for this course...|$|R
5000|$|Filtration {{differs from}} sieving, where {{separation}} occurs {{at a single}} perforated layer (a sieve). In sieving, particles that are too big {{to pass through the}} holes of the sieve are retained (see particle size distribution). In filtration, a multilayer lattice retains those particles that are unable to follow the tortuous channels of the filter. Oversize particles may form a cake layer on top of the filter and may also block the filter lattice, preventing the fluid phase from crossing the filter (blinding). Commercially, the term filter is applied to membranes where the separation lattice is so thin that the surface becomes the main <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> particle <b>separation,</b> even though these products might be described as sieves.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: to visualise the {{axial flow}} fields in {{standard}} and cuffed end-to-side anastomoses (ESA). Design: in vitro experiments using a flow rig, custom-built glass models and frame-by-frame video analysis of flow patterns in standard and cuffed ESA. Subjects: glass models of standard or cuffed (1 cm or 2 cm high) ESA of angles 15, 30, 45 and 60 degrees. Results: the cross-sectional area of standard ESA {{is much smaller}} than that of ESA between graft and cuff. The size of the vortex in the anastomotic <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> both standard and cuffed ESA increased with increasing ESA angle and cuff height, but did not change with flow rate. The presence of the vortex maintains a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>separation</b> and low shear at the heel of standard and graft/cuff anastomoses. Conclusions: the observations explain the clinical findings of intimal hyperplasia (IH) at the heel of PTFE/cuff anastomoses. The improved patency rates of cuffed ESA may be due not to decreased IH, but to an increased ability of the cuff to accommodate IH before causing a significant stenosis...|$|R

40|$|Full-potential, Euler, and Navier-Stokes {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) codes were evaluated for use in analyzing the flow field about airfoils sections operating at Mach numbers from 0. 20 to 0. 60 and Reynolds numbers from 500, 000 to 2, 000, 000. The potential code (LBAUER) includes weakly coupled integral boundary layer equations for laminar and turbulent flow with simple transition and separation models. The Navier-Stokes code (ARC 2 D) uses the thin-layer formulation of the Reynolds-averaged equations with an algebraic turbulence model. The Euler code (ISES) includes strongly coupled integral boundary layer equations and advanced transition and separation calculations with the capability to model laminar separation bubbles and limited <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> turbulent <b>separation.</b> The best experiment/CFD correlation was obtained with the Euler code because its boundary layer equations model the physics of the flow {{better than the other}} two codes.

40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented for simulating {{the occurrence of}} localized slip and separation along the interfaces of multiple, randomly distributed, circular elastic inclusions in an infinite elastic plane. The method {{is an extension of}} a direct boundary integral approach previously described elsewhere for solving problems involving perfectly bonded circular inclusions. Here, we allow displacement discontinuities to develop along the inclusion/matrix interfaces in accordance with a linear Mohr‚ÄìCoulomb yield condition combined with a tensile strength cut-off. The displacements, tractions, and displacement discontinuities on the inclusion boundaries are all represented by truncated Fourier series, and an explicit iterative algorithm is adopted to determine <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> slip and <b>separation</b> under the prevailing loading conditions. Several examples are given to demonstrate the accuracy and generality of the approach...|$|R

40|$|The current {{paradigm}} for clinical diagnostic {{for the treatment}} of vascular disease relies exclusively on diagnostic imaging data to define the present state of the patient, empirical data to evaluate the efficacy of prior treatments for similar patients. These techniques are insufficient to predict the outcome of a given treatment for an individual patient. We here propose a new paradigm of predictive medicine where physician could use computational simulation to construct and evaluate a specific geometrical/anatomical model to predict the outcome for an individual patient. For this purpose it is necessary to develop a complex software system which combines user friendly interface, automatic solid modeling, automatic finite mesh generation, computational fluid dynamics and post-processing visualization. The flow dynamics is defined according to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. Mass transport of oxygen and macromolecules is modeled by the convection diffusion equation and coupled with flow dynamics. The computer simulations are based upon finite element analysis where the new computer methods for coupling oxygen transport and fluid flow are described. The comparison results shows a good agreement between clinical observation for critical <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> flow <b>separation,</b> flow recirculation, low wall shear stresses which may {{contribute to the development of}} atherosclerotic diseases...|$|R
