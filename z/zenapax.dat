50|$|Interleukin-2 is an {{important}} immune system regulator necessary for the clone expansion and survival of activated lymphocytes T. Its effects are mediated by the trimer cell surface receptor IL-2a, consisting of the α, β, and γ chains. The IL-2a (CD25, T-cell activation antigen, TAC) is expressed only by the already-activated T lymphocytes. Therefore, it is of special significance to the selective immunosuppressive treatment, and research {{has been focused on}} the development of effective and safe anti-IL-2 antibodies. By the use of recombinant gene technology, the mouse anti-Tac antibodies have been modified, leading to the presentation of two chimeric mouse/human anti-Tac antibodies in the year 1998: basiliximab (Simulect) and daclizumab (<b>Zenapax).</b> These drugs act by binding the IL-2a receptor's α chain, preventing the IL-2 induced clonal expansion of activated lymphocytes and shortening their survival. They are used in the prophylaxis of the acute organ rejection after bilateral kidney transplantation, both being similarly effective and with only few side-effects.|$|E

Malignant primary brain tumors {{are the most common}} cause of death among children, and account for more deaths in adults than melanoma. This is principally because conventional therapy is severely constrained by the need to eradicate tumor cells that are hidden behind a restrictive blood-brain barrier or that have invaded eloquent brain tissue. As a result, surgery and radiation must be curtailed to avoid incapacitating collateral damage, and chemotherapy becomes toxic to rapidly dividing extracerebral normal tissues before eliminating all intracerebral tumor cells. The immune system, however, has the capacity to eliminate altered neoplastic cells with incredible specificity. A consistent in-frame deletion in the extra-cellular domain of the EGFR produces...|$|E
40|$|Two LC-ESI-MS {{methods for}} the {{analysis}} of antibody glycosylation are presented. In the first approach, tryptic glycopeptides are separated by RP chromatography and analyzed by ESI-MS. This "glycopeptide strategy" allows a protein- and subclass-specific quantitation of both neutral and sialylated glycan structures. Additional information about under- or deglycosylation and the protein backbone, e. g., termini, can be extracted from the same data. In the second LC-ESI-MS method, released oligosaccharides are separated on porous graphitic carbon (PGC). A complete structural assignment of neutral and sialylated oligosaccharides occurring on antibodies is thereby achieved in one chromatographic run. The two methods were applied to polyclonal human IgG, to commercial mAb expressed in CHO cells (Rituximab, Xolair, and Herceptin), in SP 2 / 0 (Erbitux and Remicade) or NS 0 cells (<b>Zenapax)</b> and the anti-HIV antibody 4 E 10 produced either in CHO cells or in a human cell line. Both methods require comparably little sample preparation and can be applied to SDS-PAGE bands. They both outperform non-MS methods in terms of reliability of peak assignment and MALDI-MS of underivatized glycans with regard to the recording of sialylated structures. Regarding fast and yet detailed structural assignment, LC-MS on graphitic carbon supersedes all other current methods. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is an {{aggressive}} and fatal disease. We have examined 32 patients with smoldering, chronic, lymphoma and acute leukemia using Affymetrix HG-U 133 A 2. 0 arrays. Using the BRB array program, we identified genes differentially expressed in leukemia cells compared with normal lymphocytes. Several unique genes were identified that were overexpressed in leukemic cells, including TNFSF 11, RGS 13, MAFb, CSPG 2, C/EBP-α, and TCF 4; 200 {{of the most}} highly overexpressed ATL genes were analyzed by the Pathway Studio, version 4. 0 program. ATL leukemia cells were characterized by an increase in genes linked to “central” genes CDC 2 /cyclin B 1, SYK/LYN, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and BIRC 5. Because of its potential therapeutic importance, we focused our studies on the regulation and function of BIRC 5, whose expression was increased in 13 of 14 leukemia samples. TCF 4 reporter assays and transfection of DN-TCF 4 demonstrated that TCF 4 regulates BIRC 5 gene expression. Functionally, transfection of ATL cells with BIRC 5 shRNA decreased BIRC 5 expression and cell viability 80 %. Clinical treatment of ATL patients with <b>Zenapax</b> or bortezomib decreased BIRC 5 expression and cell viability. These experiments represent the first direct experimental evidence that BIRC 5 {{plays an important role in}} ATL cell viability and provides important insight into ATL genesis and potential targeted therapies...|$|E
40|$|Gene amplification, over-expression, and {{mutation}} {{of growth}} factors, or the receptors themselves, causes increased signaling through receptor kinases, {{which has been}} implicated in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Tumor growth {{has been shown to}} be decreased by interrupting this process of extensive growth factor-mediated signaling by directly targeting either the surface receptor or the ligand and thereby preventing cell survival and promoting apoptosis. Monoclonal antibodies have long been eyed as a potential new class of therapeutics targeting cancer and other diseases. Antibody-based therapy initially entered clinical practice when trastuzumab/Herceptin became the first clinically approved drug against an oncogene product as a well-established blocking reagent for tumors with hyperactivity of epidermal growth factor signaling pathways. In the first part of this review we explain basic terms related to the development of antibody-based drugs, give a brief historic perspective of the field, and also touch on topics such as the "humanization of antibodie" or creation of hybrid antibodies. The second part of the review gives an overview of the clinical usage of bispecific antibodies and antibodies "armed" with cytotoxic agents or enzymes. Further within this section, cancer-specific, site-specific, or signaling pathway-specific therapies are discussed in detail. Among other antibody-based therapeutic products, we discuss: Avastin (bevacizumab), CG 76030, Theragyn (pemtumomab), daclizumab (<b>Zenapax),</b> TriAb, MDX- 210, Herceptin (trastuzumab), panitumumab (ABX-EGF), mastuzimab (EMD- 72000), Erbitux (certuximab, IMC 225), Panorex (edrecolomab), STI 571, CeaVac, Campath (alemtuizumab), Mylotarg (gemtuzumab, ozogamicin), and many others.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the recent {{dramatic}} ad-vances in the applications of monoclonal antibody therapy to hematopoietic and neoplastic disease. The increase {{in the understanding of}} the role of growth factors and their receptors in the pathogen-esis of malignancy and other undesirable hemato-logical events taken in conjunction with the ability to produce humanized chimeric monoclonal antibodies to these targets is providing a new perspective for the treatment of leukemia, lym-phoma and breast cancer, autoimmune disease and for prevention of ischemic complications. Dr. Waldmann describes approaches targeting the Her 2 /neu and the Il- 2 /IL- 15 receptor systems. The Her 2 /neu receptor is overexpressed in select breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic neoplasms. The use of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of patients with breast cancer whose tumors overexpress this receptor are reviewed. The IL- 2 receptor (Tac) is expressed on select malignant cells (adult T cell leukemia, hairy cell leukemia) and activated T cells involved in autoimmune disease and organ rejection. Humanized anti-Tac alone (daclizumab, <b>Zenapax)</b> or armed with toxins or radionuclides have been used successfully in the treatment of leukemia. Dr. Levy updates the experi-ence with rituximab targeting CD 20 on B cell lymphomas and reviews the antibodies to CD 3, CD 22, CD 33, CD 52, HLA-DR chain and HLA-D currently in or proposed for clinical trials, including radiolabelled antibodies. In the last section, Dr. Coller reviews the therapeutic results achieved with abciximab (ReoPro), an antagonist of platelet receptor GPIIbIIIa for the prevention of restenosis in percutaneous coronary interventions and the treatment of unstable angina. The mechanism of action, pharmacology and safety and efficacy of abciximab are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|HuCD 25 mAb is a humanized anti-CD 25 {{antibody}} {{which has}} the same amino acid sequence as daclizumab (<b>Zenapax,</b> Roche). HuCD 25 mAb is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells while daclizumab is expressed in the NSO myeloma cell line. A comparative study was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between huCD 25 mAb and daclizumab in a two-dose regimen incorporating triple immunosuppressant treatment regimens (MMF, CsA and steroids). Fifteen patients were enrolled and randomized to receive intravenous infusion of either huCD 25 mAb (n = 10) or daclizumab (n = 5) at a dosage of 1 mg·kg− 1 on operation day 0 and post-operation day 14. Serum concentrations of huCD 25 mAb and daclizumab were measured by a validated competitive ELISA. Subgroups of CD 3 +, CD 25 +, CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes were monitored periodically by flow cytometry. The concentration-time curves of huCD 25 mAb and daclizumab were found to fit well to a one-compartment model. A significant decline of proportion (%) of CD 3 -CD 25 + and CD 3 +CD 25 + lymphocytes was observed 30 min after first infusion on day 0 (3. 40 ± 1. 83 to 0. 03 ± 0. 07, 3. 35 ± 2. 02 to 0. 37 ± 0. 49), and these levels remained low for at least 70 days (0. 03 ± 0. 05, 0. 31 ± 0. 47). All pharmacokinetic parameters of huCD 25 mAb seemed {{similar to those of}} daclizumab. The two-dose huCD 25 mAb regimen was as effective as daclizumab in rapidly achieving high therapeutic concentration in the treated patients, and a significant decrease of CD 3 −CD 25 + and CD 3 +CD 25 + lymphocytes was demonstrated. This suggests that two-dose regimen is feasible in maintaining host immunosuppression and may provide an effective and economical strategy for reducing incidence of acute graft rejection...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} avoid {{nephrotoxicity}} our > 65 year-old receipients of > 65 year-old donor kidneys were administered initial immunosuppression without calcineurin inhibitors in favour {{of a combination of}} an IL- 2 receptor antagonist together with MMF and cortisone. After stabilisation of graft function, calcineurin inhibitors were added to the protocol. Patients and methods: From June 1999 to November 2003 a total of 38 patients {{with a mean age of}} 67, 9 (65 – 80 yrs) receiving local organs of donors with a mean age of 69, 3 (65 – 83 yrs) were administered immunosuppressive therapy without initial use of calcineurin inhibitors within a regimen consisting of Simulect (n = 30) or <b>Zenapax</b> (n = 8) together with MMF and cortisone. Cyclosporin A (n = 28, target C 0 -level 180 – 200 ng/ml) was started on day 8, 2 (4 – 42) and Tacrolimus (n = 10, target level 8 – 10 ng/ml) on day 4, 1 (1 – 6), respectively. With a rather bad HLA mismatch of MM-AB 2, 6 (0 – 4) and MM-DR 1, 3 (0 – 2), respectively, the mean cold ischemia time was relatively low at 14 : 01 (05 : 04 – 22 : 50). Results: The initial rate of non-function of 31, 6 % (12 / 38) was reversible. The total of 10 rejection episodes (26, 3 %) treated with steroid bolus therapy also were reversible. All infections except 1 Listeria meningitis with ensuing neurological complications were treated successfully. 1 graft loss at month 6 was due to chronic rejection. One patient each died from cardiac cause at month 11, from neurological problems at month 17 and from oncological cause at month 27. The 1 -year patient and graft survival was 97, 4 and 94, 7 %, respectively, the 2 -year patient and graft survival was 92, 1 % each. Mean serum creatinine value was 1, 5, 1, 5 and 1, 7 mg% at months 6, 12 and 24, respectively. Conclusions: In patients older than 65 years receiving kidneys from donors older than 65 years, very good results can be achieved using an initial calcineurin inhibitor free immunosuppression by administration of a IL- 2 receptor antagonist together with MMR and cortisone...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to determine whether T cell depletion through pretreatment with either Thymoglobulin or Campath influences the incidence and severity of PGD (primary graft dysfunction) after human lung transplantation. This is a single center study, conducted between July 2000 and November 2004, and is a retrospective analysis of 206 patients. Patients received one of following forms of induction therapy: <b>Zenapax</b> (n= 28), Thymoglobulin (n= 37), Campath (n= 76), or no induction (n= 65) therapy. Donor and recipient demographic, operative information, and survival data were collected. Assignment of primary grading dysfunction (PGD) grading was based on the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading guidelines. While baseline characteristics were similar for most variables, grafts for patients that received Campath (293 ± 64 min) or Thymoglobulin (282 ± 66 min) had a longer duration of ischemic time compared to the control group, no induction therapy (246 ± 65 min). A significant difference between Campath (78. 9 %) and no induction (92. 3 %) group was observed with a p-value of 0. 047 for the overall severity of PGD. In the multivariate analysis, Perfadex (p= 0. 009, OR= 0. 31), the preservation solution, remained as a protective agent on preventing recipients from severe PGD, and use of CPB (cardiopulmonary bypass) (p<< 0. 001, OR= 4. 53) was identified to be a statistically significant risk factor for development of grade 3 PGD. There was improved early oxygenation and improved one year survival in patients that received Campath compared to the control group. The combined use of Campath as induction therapy and the graft preservation solution of Perfadex seem to be protective against the development of grade 3 PGD as their roles on defending cumulative incidence of PGD were hindered. The use of CPB was an independent risk factor to the development of grade 3 PGD. These results suggest that the development of PGD after human lung transplantation is mainly due to intrinsic immune or non-immune mechanisms, further study will be necessary to unravel the role of T cells, and it will have significant impact on public health relevance application...|$|E
