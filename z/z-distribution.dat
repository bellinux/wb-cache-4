Fisher stated that deviations exceeding twice the standard deviation are regarded as significant. Before this deviations exceeding three times the probable error were considered significant. For a symmetrical distribution the probable error is half the interquartile range. For a normal distribution the probable error is approximately 2/3 the standard deviation.

40|$|The spatial distribution, galactic model {{parameters}} and luminosity function of cataclysmic variables (CVs) {{in the solar}} neighbourhood have been determined from a carefully established sample of 459 CVs. The sample contains all of the CVs with distances computed from the Period-Luminosity-Colours (PLCs) relation of CVs which has been recently derived and calibrated with 2 MASS photometric data. It {{has been found that}} an exponential function fits best to the observational <b>z-distributions</b> of all of the CVs in the sample, non-magnetic CVs and dwarf novae, while the sech 2 function is more appropriate for nova-like stars and polars.

On the other hand, the vertical scaleheights are 128 ± 20 and 160 ± 5 pc for dwarf novae and nova-like stars, respectively. The local space density of CVs is found to be ∼ 3 × 10 − 5 pc − 3 which is in agreement with the lower limit of the theoretical predictions. The luminosity function of CVs shows an increasing trend toward higher space densities at low luminosities, implying that the number of short-period systems should be high.

40|$|This paper explores various {{distributional}} {{aspects of}} random variables {{defined as the}} ratio of two independent positive random variables where one variable has an α-stable law, for 0 -α. When θ= 0, these variables equate with the ratio investigated by Lamperti [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 88 (1958) 380 [...] 387] which, remarkably, was shown to have a simple density. This variable arises {{in a variety of}} areas and gains importance from a close connection to the stable laws. This rationale, and connection to the PD(α,θ) distribution, motivates the investigations of its generalizations which we refer to as Lamperti-type laws. We identify and exploit links to random variables that commonly appear in a variety of applications. Namely Linnik, generalized Pareto and <b>z-distributions.</b> In each case we obtain new results that are of potential interest. As some highlights, we then use these results to (i) obtain integral representations and other identities for a class of generalized Mittag [...] Leffler functions, (ii) identify explicitly the Lévy density of the semigroup of stable continuous state branching processes (CSBP) and hence corresponding limiting distributions derived in Slack and in Zolotarev [Z.

40|$|We {{determine}} {{the source of}} the diffuse [CII] emission by studying its spatial (radial and vertical) distributions. We used the HIFI [CII] Galactic survey (GOT C+), along with HI, 12 CO, and 13 CO data toward 354 lines of sight, and several HIFI [CII] and [CI] position-velocity maps. We quantified the emission in each spectral line profile by evaluating the intensities in 3 km/s wide velocity bins, 'spaxels'. Using the detection of [CII] with CO or [CI], we separated the dense and diffuse gas components. We derived 2 -D Galactic disk maps using the spaxel velocities for kinematic distances. We separated the warm and cold H 2 gases by comparing CO emissions with and without associated [CII]. We find evidence of widespread diffuse [CII] emission with a z-scale distribution larger than that for the total [CII] or CO. and it consists of (i) diffuse molecular (CO-faint) H 2 clouds and (ii) diffuse HI clouds and/or WIM. In the inner Galaxy we find a lack of [CII] detections in a majority (~ 62 %) of HI spaxels and show that the diffuse component primarily comes from the WIM (~ 21 %) and that the HI gas is not a major contributor to the diffuse component (~ 6 %). The warm-H 2 radial profile shows an excess in the range 4 to 7 kpc, consistent with enhanced star formation there. We derive, for the first time, the 2 -D [CII] spatial distribution in the plane and the <b>z-distributions</b> of the individual [CII] gas component. We estimate the fractional [CII] emission tracing (i) H 2 gas in dense and diffuse molecular clouds as ~ 48 % and ~ 14 %, respectively, (ii) in the HI gas ~ 18 %, and (iii) in the WIM ~ 21 %.

This correlation strongly supports the conclusion that the gamma rays are produced as a result of cosmic ray interactions in molecular H 2 clouds rather than HI. One important implication of this is that the interstellar magnetic field lines to which cosmic rays are confined must therefore not be excluded from these dense clouds.

In contrast {{to most of the}} standard methods available in the literature we take into account the full three-dimensional information of the disk. We minimize the difference between the observed 2 D-image and an image of our 3 D-disk model integrated along the line of sight. Thereby we specify the inclination, the fitting function for the <b>z-distribution</b> of the disk, and the best values for the structural parameters such as scalelength, scaleheight, central surface brightness, and a disk cut-off radius. From a comparison of two independently developed methods we conclude, that the discrepancies e. g. for the scaleheights and scalelengths are of the order of ~ 10 %. These differences are not due to the individual method itself, but rather to the selected fitting region, which masks the bulge component, the dust lane, or present foreground stars.

This anisotropy characterises the sheet mechanical properties, structure and filler distribution. Analyses of the cross section of the paper sheet with a low-vacuum scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive spectrometer analysis module can show this distribution.

Adult male Wistar rats were observed during the exploration of a soundproof observation box. Each rat was acoustically stimulated after 150 s {{from the beginning of the}} experimental session, lasting 300 s, and recorded through a digital videocamera. A frame by frame analysis was thereafter carried out using a professional video-recording system. Thirteen behavioral patterns were selected: immobility, immobile-sniffing, walking, rearing, climbing, chewing, paw-licking, face-grooming, body-grooming, head-turning, tuning, oriented-sniffing, focusing. Both descriptive and multivariate analyses (cluster, stochastic, adjusted residuals) were carried out. Through descriptive statistical analysis, latencies and per cent distribution of each pattern were studied. A multivariate cluster analysis revealed the presence of three main behavioral clusters, an additional one being identified following acoustic stimulation. Multivariate stochastic analysis showed that all the patterns converged on immobile-sniffing which could represent a key component in behavioral switching processes related to environmental exploration. Moreover, through adjusted residuals, the degree of relationship among different patterns was shown according to statistic <b>Z-distribution.</b> Our data assign new ethological meanings to different behavioral patterns.

Using the mid-plane density and <b>z-distribution</b> of sdB stars, the ratio of sdB stars to all HB stars, and the RG mass loss, the infall due to total mass lost by all halo RG stars at z> 1 kpc is calculated. For the extended halo component Ṁ_ halo RGs≃ 1. 4 · 10 ^- 5 kpc^- 2 yr^- 1 while the thick disk component RGs contribute Ṁ_ thick disk RGs≃ 5. 4 · 10 ^- 5 kpc^- 2 yr^- 1, each with an uncertainty of a factor 4.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a search for {{transient}} radio bursts of between 0. 125 and 32 millisecond duration in two archival pulsar surveys of intermediate galactic latitudes with the Parkes multibeam receiver. Fourteen new neutron stars have been discovered, seven of which belong to the recently identified "rotating radio transients" (RRATs) class. Here we describe our search methodology, and discuss the new detections in terms of how the RRAT population relates to the general population of pulsars. The new detections indicate (1) that the galactic <b>z-distribution</b> of RRATs in the surveys closely resembles the distribution of pulsars, with objects up to 0. 86 kpc from the galactic plane; (2) where measurable, the RRAT pulse widths are similar to that of individual pulses from pulsars of similar period, implying a similar beaming fraction; and (3) our new detections span a variety of nulling fractions, and thus we postulate that the RRATs may simply be nulling pulsars that are only "on" for less than a pulse period. Finally, the newly discovered object PSR J 0941 - 39 may represent a link between pulsars and RRATs. This bizarre object was discovered as an RRAT, but in follow-up observations often appeared as a bright (~ 10 mJy) pulsar with a low nulling fraction. It is obvious therefore that a neutron star can oscillate between being an RRAT and a pulsar. Crucially, the sites of the RRAT pulses are coincident with the pulsar's emission, implying that the two emission mechanisms are linked, and that RRATs are not just pulsars observed from different orientations.

Pulsar distances are obtained from measurements of annual parallax, HI absorption spectra or associations where available and otherwise from the observed pulsar dispersion and {{a model for the}} distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy. We fit the cumulative distribution function for a sech^ 2 (z) distribution function, representing an isothermal self-gravitating disk, with uncertainties being estimated using the bootstrap method. We take pulsars having characteristic age τ_c< 10 ^ 6. 5 yr and located within 4. 5 kpc of the Sun, omitting those within the local spiral arm and those significantly affected by the Galactic warp, and solve for z_ and the scale height, H, for different cutoffs in τ_c. We compute these quantities using just the independently determined distances, and these together with DM-based distances separately using the YMW 16 and NE 2001 Galactic electron density models. We find that an age cutoff at 10 ^ 5. 75 yr with YMW 16 DM-distances gives the best results with a minimum uncertainty in z_ and an asymptotically stable value for H showing that, at this age and below, the observed pulsar <b>z-distribution</b> is dominated by the dispersion in their birth locations. From this sample of 115 pulsars, we obtain z_= 13. 4 ± 4. 4 pc and H= 56. 9 ± 6. 5 pc, similar to estimated scale heights for OB stars and open clusters. Consistent results are obtained using the independent-only distances and using the NE 2001 model for the DM-based distances. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, accepted (MNRAS...|$|E
40|$|The warps in many spiral {{galaxies are}} now known to asymmetric. Recent {{sensitive}} observations {{have revealed that}} asymmetry of warps may be the norm rather than exception. However there exists no generic mechanism to generate these asymmetries in warps. We have derived the dispersion relation in a compact form for the S-shaped warps(described by the m= 1 mode) and the bowl-shaped distribution(described by the m= 0 mode) in galactic disk embedded in a dark matter halo. We then performed the numerical modal analysis and used the linear and time-dependent superposition principle to generate asymmetric warps in the disk. On doing the modal analysis we find {{the frequency of the}} $m= 0 $ mode is much larger than that of the $m= 1 $ mode. The linear and time-dependent superposition of these modes with their unmodulated amplitudes(that is, the coefficients of superposition being unity) results in an asymmetry in warps of ~ 20 - 40 %, whereas a smaller coefficient for the m= 0 mode results in a smaller asymmetry. The resulting values agree well with the recent observations. We study the dependence of the asymmetry index on the dark matter halo parameters. This approach can also naturally produce U-shaped warps and L-shaped warps. We show that a rich variety of possible asymmetries in the <b>z-distribution</b> of the spiral galaxies can naturally arise due to a dynamical wave interference between the first two bending modes(i. e. m= 0 and m= 1) in the disk. This is a simple but general method for generating asymmetric warps that is independent of how the individual modes arise in the disk. Comment: Accepted for publication in A &...|$|E

Copper deficiency has been associated with disease states that decrease commercial beef production. Clinical manifestations of copper disease include anemia, diarrhea, long bone fractures, generalized ill-thrift, and decreased fertility. Recent studies have demonstrated that copper deficiency is common in North American beef cattle. This body of work addresses diagnosis, epidemiology and the immunologic consequences of copper deficiency in calves. For serum copper concentration of 0. 45 microgram/gram as a test endpoint, serum copper concentration had sensitivity of 0. 53 and specificity of 0. 89 for detection of low liver copper concentration. A number of management factors were significantly associated with either serum copper concentration or copper status. The relationship between geographic areas of copper deficiency occurrence and the state's two major rivers, the Missouri and Mississippi, was the most intriguing factor identified. The true influence of these rivers could not be determined with this study, but it warrants further investigation. The binomial distribution was used to calculate the probability of k positive test results in n trials at varying prevalences. This process provided a de facto hypothesis test for the lower 95 % confidence limit of prevalence. The binomial model provided a more satisfactory method to interpret imperfect test results than the <b>z-distribution</b> for population proportions. In relation to copper supplementation there were no statistically significant differences in the immunologic parameters studied. This however, may not represent the true benefit copper supplementation may have on copper deficient calves...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The spatial {{distribution}} {{and the population}} nature of subdwarf B type stars in the galaxy is investigated based on the kinematics of these stars. With new and available proper motions, radial velocities, and distances, the orbits of 41 stars have been calculated using a galactic mass model. The orbits are well behaved and 10 stars reach to |z | ≥ 2 kpc. Many orbits are very eccentric, reaching in to just 2 kpc from the galactic centre, or veering out to beyond 20 kpc. None of the stars can be identified uniquely as classical Population II objects. The average eccentricity ecc of the orbits of our sample is 0. 24, the average normalised z-extent nze of the orbits is 0. 16, and the asymmetric drift of our sample is − 36 km s − 1. This suggests that our sample of sdB stars {{is part of a}} population of thick disk stars. A statistical analysis of the orbits shows that the subdwarf stars have a {{spatial distribution}} in z compatible with an exponential one with a scale height hz of about 1. 0 kpc. However, since only few stars reach to large z the spatial distribution is only well defined to z ≃ 2 kpc. The distribution in z shows a relative minimum near z = 0 pc and has maxima near z = 300 pc. This reflects the smaller probability to find the stars in the disk than away from the disk, as expected for any orbit reaching to larger z. Scale height studies based on limited samples of stars in specified directions can therefore easily be flawed when they do not reach to large enough distances to overcome this aspect of the <b>z-distribution...</b>|$|E
