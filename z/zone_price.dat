PJM {{proposes to}} change its market rules to use a {{residual}} <b>zone</b> <b>price</b> rather than the <b>zone</b> <b>price,</b> as the default price for load that has not elected to settle at a nodal price. PJM explains that this change is proposed because residual zone pricing reflects more accurately the locational distribution of load than the <b>zone</b> <b>price</b> in those cases where at least some portion of the load in the zone is nodally priced.

40|$|Amid growing {{recognition}} {{of the costs of}} downtown congestion and scarcity of revenues for new roads, congestion pricing for downtown areas [...] a practice we call “zone pricing” [...] has begun to receive wide attention. From 1975 - 2003, <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> failed to spread beyond Singapore, but by the 2000 ’s technological advances had made the practice more widely practical. Now London, Stockholm, Milan and Gothenburg have schemes of their own, and <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> is on the agenda in many world cities. The research summarized in this report has sought to advance practical knowledge of <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> in several ways. First, we have created a very detailed, scholarly history of <b>zone</b> <b>pricing,</b> covering the circumstances under which cities have implemented <b>zone</b> <b>pricing,</b> what technologies have been used and what results these cities have obtained. Second, we investigated the theory of “usage tolls. ” A drawback of all tradition <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> systems is that, for practical reasons, they fail to charge different tolls to drivers who use the network to different degrees: someone who enters the downtown and immediately parks pays the same toll as someone who circles for an hour. But with new technology {{it will be possible to}} charge drivers for some index of road use, such as how far or how long they travel inside the network. Our research highlights two major advantages of usage tolling: (i) it can reschedule trips in optimal ways; (ii) it can discourage long trips [...] such as those traveling across the downtown between points outside [...] from happening by car in the first place. In both cases, an interesting result is the added precision of usage tolls means congestion reduction can be accomplished while charging drivers relatively little. We cite this as a political advantage that will help make <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> more palatable...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} {{productivity of}} cow-calf units in low-input production systems in tropical Africa is reviewed. Four production systems (pastoralists agropastoralists, crop-livestock farmers and smallholder farmers) are identified. Fifty-five data sets from monitoring and systems {{research conducted by}} ILCA and from other secondary sources are analysed to detect interactions between performance variables including calving rate, cow and calf mortality, milk offtake and calf growth, and relate these to factors of environment, mangement and producer goals. Through equating 1 kg of calf weight to 9 kg of milk offtake, the index kg liveweight/ 100 kg cow/yr is used to compare systems that vary in production goals and breeds. In low-input traditional systems cow productivity is constrained by disease and seasonal shortages of breed and water, cows produce at sub-optimal, level. To access this depression the indices from traditional systems are {{compared with those of}} indigenous cows raised in ranches and research stations. Zebus and Sanga in the semi-arid and subhumid zone produced between 15 and 25 kg/ 100 kg cow/yr, the proportions of low and high-yielding herds being similar. Trypanotorant cows in the sub-humid zone were relatively high-yielding (up to 30 kg) due to high extraction rates, suggesting that increased milk offtake may enchance overlal productivity. The majority of indigenous cows in ranches and research stations produced a weaned calf weight of 33 - 38 kg/ 100 kg cow or on average 75 percent more than cows in traditional systems. Further analyses are required to substantiate that high milk offtake increases overall productivity, at least i the favourable environment of the subhumid <b>zone.</b> <b>Price</b> ratios between milk and liveweight averaged 1 : 3, explaining why milk offtake for sale has received high priority in many traditional production systems...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{practical}} to collapse spatial {{information about a}} transportation system into aggregate variables related by an aspatial model [...] -that is, a model in which individual interactions and directions of travel are not explicitly accounted for. This dissertation brings aspatial modelling to bear on two topics: downtown congestion pricing, referred to as ``zone pricing,'' and parking policy. Regarding <b>zone</b> <b>pricing,</b> {{a survey of the}} history of <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> shows that all existing systems fail to toll vehicles according to their use of the downtown network. To explore whether it would be advantageous to charge higher tolls to travelers who travel farther within the network, a static traffic model with probabalistic choice and variable trip lengths is proposed. Distance-based tolling turns out to be more socially efficient than charging all travelers the same price, but it leaves drivers themselves worse off since most of the welfare gains are converted to toll revenues for the government. Regarding parking, the thesis considers the idea of a ``feedback loop'' among landowners' uncoordinated decisions about how much off-street parking to provide on their parcels, when parking competes with floorspace as a use of land. One landowners' decision affects others' via two opposing channels. First, crowding: when there is too little off-street parking, on-street parking becomes crowded, making off-street parking relatively more valuable. Second, accessibility: when floorspace takes the place of off-street parking, the neighborhood becomes walkable through its higher density, making floorspace more valuable. A stylized model of development decision-making shows that each force leads to positive or negative feedback, resulting in multiple equilibria and counterintuitive results from policy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We review {{explanations}} for two controversial vertical restraints {{commonly used in}} gasoline marketing: <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> and territorial restrictions. After {{a discussion of the}} relevant empirical and theoretical economics literature, we consider procompetitive and anticompetitive theories behind the practices. <b>Price</b> <b>zones</b> may be one part of a complicated relationship between gasoline marketers and retailers that facilitates efficient risk-sharing, provides optimal incentives for marketers and retailers, and allows marketers to react more quickly to changes in localized retail competition. Alternatively, if gasoline marketers have substantial market power, <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> may facilitate coordination or help deter entry. Territorial restrictions may prevent inefficiencies in distribution and reduce free-riding on investments marketers make in developing networks of retail stations. At the same time, territorial restrictions help marketers maintain <b>price</b> <b>zones</b> (with the same welfare implications), and may, if marketers have substantial market power, facilitate coordination.

40|$|Five {{influential}} paradigms {{established by}} Beckmann, Lowry, Wilson, Mills, and McFadden are unified {{by developing a}} long-run economic general equilibrium model of urban land-use based on probabilistic discrete choice theory. The model {{takes into account the}} interdependence of export-oriented and service employment with population. Households' choices of employment type, employment location, type and location of housing, shopping destination, and choice of travel routes in the journey to work and journey to shop are determined simultaneously by means of stochastic utility maximization. Firms' choices of building type and location and landowners' choices of land-use type and density are determined by means of stochastic profit maximization. Travel occurs on a congestible link - node network.

40|$|In {{the words}} of Joel I. Klein, former Assistant Attorney General of the United States, ??????[a]ntitrust {{enforcement}} in the merger area has never been as time-consuming, complex, or as central to the functioning of our economy as it is today?????? (Klein, 1998). As such, the development of transparent, efficient, and accurate merger analysis tools is an endeavor whose value continues to increase {{in the eyes of}} regulators and industry participants alike. Arguably, the most visible result of such endeavors is the emergence and advancement of a practice known as merger simulation. The first goal of this dissertation is to evaluate the merits of the Distance Metric (DM) demand model and its usefulness in merger simulations. Revered by its creators as easy-to-use, flexible, and able to handle large numbers of products, the DM approach has not received the ??????road-testing?????? necessary for establishing its practical usefulness. The DM model is used to estimate demand elasticities for 45 bottled-juice products. Elasticities are then used to simulate numerous hypothetical mergers. While adding validity to the alleged strengths of the DM approach, an additional contribution is made by demonstrating the robustness of merger simulation results across 22 DM specifications. Despite the oft-recognized reality of <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> by food retailers, this form of price discrimination has received little attention within the context of upstream merger analysis. Thus, the second objective of this dissertation is to relax the conventional merger simulation assumption of uniform pricing by retailers, allowing us to explore the impacts of <b>zone</b> <b>pricing</b> on post-merger price effects. Using the ready-to-eat cereals industry as a backdrop, it is shown that ignoring retail price discrimination veils a potentially diverse set of price effects that are otherwise lost in uniform pricing analyses. The goal of the final essay is to explore the implementation of more realistic supply channel interactions in merger simulations. In particular, a two-stage pricing game is used to conduct merger simulations in the refrigerated orange juice category. The overriding finding is that comparisons with conventionally used models will not be practical until the relationship between demand specification and two-stage game modeling is better understood...|$|R
