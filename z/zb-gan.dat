40|$|Eu was {{implanted}} {{into high}} quality cubic (zincblende) GaN (<b>ZB-GaN)</b> layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Detailed structural characterization {{before and after}} implantation was performed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Rutherford backscattering/channeling spectrometry. A low concentration (direction, while a Ga substitutional site is observed for W-GaN:Eu. The implantation damage in ZB-GaN:Eu could partly be removed by thermal annealing, but {{an increase in the}} wurtzite phase fraction was observed at the same time. Cathodoluminescence, photoluminescence (PL), and PL excitation spectroscopy revealed several emission lines which can be attributed to distinct Eu-related optical centers in <b>ZB-GaN</b> and W-GaN inclusions...|$|E
40|$|We report calculated, {{electronic}} and related properties of wurtzite and zinc blende gallium nitrides (w-GaN, <b>zb-GaN).</b> We employed a local density approximation (LDA) potential and the linear combination of atomic orbital (LCAO) formalism. The {{implementation of this}} formalism followed the Bagayoko, Zhao, and Williams (BZW) method, as enhanced by Ekuma and Franklin (BZW-EF). The calculated {{electronic and}} related properties, for both structures of GaN, are in good agreement with corresponding, experimental data, unlike results from most previous ab initio calculations utilizing a density functional theory (DFT) potential. These results include the electronic energy bands, the total and partial densities of states (DOS and pDOS), and effective masses for both structures. The calculated band gap of 3. 29 eV, for w-GaN, is in agreement with experiment and is an average of 1. 0 eV larger than most previous ab-initio DFT results. Similarly, the calculated band gap of <b>zb-GaN</b> of 2. 9 eV, for a room temperature lattice constant, is the ab-initio DFT result closest to the experimental value...|$|E
40|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) and Photoluminescence (PL) of Eu-implanted zincblende-GaN (ZB-GaN:Eu) and wurtzite-GaN (W-GaN:Eu) are {{compared}} {{in order to}} investigate the optical activation of GaN by Eu. The EU 3 + emission spectrum depends critically on the crystal structure of the GaN host; implantation and post-annealing at 800 degrees C partially converts implantation-damaged ZB-GaN:Eu to W-GaN:Eu. Selective excitation of PL at wavelengths below the <b>ZB-GaN</b> band edge reveals a new sharp emission line at 627 nm, together {{with a number of}} satellites, which we ascribe to ZB-GaN: Eu...|$|E
40|$|Lattice-symmetry-driven epitaxy of {{hierarchical}} GaN nanotripods is demonstrated. The nanotripods emerge {{on the top}} of hexagonal GaN nanowires, {{which are}} selectively grown on pillar-patterned GaN templates using molecular beam epitaxy. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirms that two kinds of lattice-symmetry, wurtzite (wz) and zinc-blende (zb), coexist in the GaN nanotripods. Periodical transformation between wz and zb drives the epitaxy of the hierarchical nanotripods with N-polarity. The <b>zb-GaN</b> is formed by the poor diffusion of adatoms, and it can be suppressed by improving the ability of the Ga adatoms to migrate as the growth temperature increased. This controllable epitaxy of hierarchical GaN nanotripods allows quantum dots to be located at the phase junctions of the nanotripods and nanowires, suggesting a new recipe for multichannel quantum devices...|$|E
40|$|We {{combine the}} effect of the electron-electron and electron-phonon {{interactions}} to study the electronic and optical properties of <b>zb-GaN.</b> We show that only by treating the two effects {{at the same time it}} is possible to obtain an unprecedented agreement of the zero and finite-temperature electronic gaps and absorption spectra with the experimental results. Compared to the state-of-the-art results our calculations predict a large effect on the main absorption peak position and width as well as on the overall absorption lineshape. These important modifications are traced back to the combined electron-phonon damping mechanism and non uniform GW level corrections. Our results demonstrate the importance of treating on equal footing the electron and phonon mediated correlation effects to obtain an accurate description of the III-nitrides group physical properties.

40|$|International audienceFirst {{principles}} {{calculations of}} the electronic band structures of zinc blende-type GaN and BN and their 1 : 1 mixture B 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 N were carried out within DFT using the augmented plane wave method with both GGA and LDA approximations {{for the effects of}} exchange and correlation. Equilibrium lattice constants were determined from the total-energy minimization method. The results are compared with those of previous calculations and with experimental measurements. In agreement with these data, ZB-BN is an indirect (Γ →X) wide-gap semiconductor (4. 35 eV) while <b>ZB-GaN</b> has a direct gap of 1. 9 eV atΓ. For ZBB 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 N we predict a direct band gap of 3. 35 eV. Electron charge densities are computed for the unit cell, and ionicity factors are derived for all systems...|$|E
40|$|We employ {{effective}} mass theory for degenerate hole-bands {{to calculate the}} acceptor binding energies for Be, Mg, Zn, Ca, C and Si substitutional acceptors in GaN and AlN. The calculations are performed through the 6 × 6 Rashba-Sheka-Pikus and the Luttinger-Kohn matrix Hamiltonians for wurtzite (WZ) and zincblende (ZB) crystal phases, respectively. An analytic representation for the acceptor pseudopotential is used to introduce the specific nature of the impurity atoms. The energy shift due to polaron effects is also considered in this approach. The ionization energy estimates are in very good agreement with those reported experimentally in WZ-GaN. The binding energies for <b>ZB-GaN</b> acceptors are all predicted to be shallower than the corresponding impurities in the WZ phase. The binding energy dependence upon the crystal field splitting in WZ-GaN is analyzed. Ionization levels in AlN are found to have similar `shallow' values to those in GaN, but with some important differences, which depend on the band structure parameterizations, especially the value of crystal field splitting used.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research has been the study of device properties for emerging wide-bandgap cubic-phase semiconductors. Though the wide-bandgap semiconductors have great potential as high-power microwave devices, many gaps remain in the knowledge about their properties. The simulations in this work are designed to give insight into the performance of microwave high-power devices constructed from the materials in question. The simulation are performed using a Monte Carlo simulator which was designed {{from the ground up}} to include accurate, numerical band structures derived from an empirical pseudo-potential model. Improvements that have been made to the simulator include the generalized device structure simulation, the fully numerical final state selector, and the inclusion of the overlap integrals in the final-state selection. The first comparison that is made among the materials is direct-current breakdown. The DC voltage at which breakdown occurs is a good indication of how much power a transistor can provide. It is found that GaAs has the smallest DC breakdown, with 3 C-SiC and <b>ZB-GaN</b> being over 3 times higher. This follows what is expected and is discussed in detail in the work. The second comparison made is the radio-frequency breakdown of the transistors. When devices are used in high-frequency applications it is possible to operate them beyond DC breakdown levels. This phenomenon is caused by the reaction time of the carriers in the device. It is important to understand this effect if these materials are used in a high-frequency application, since this effect can cause a change in the ability of a material to produce high-power devices. MESFETs made from these materials are compared and the results are discussed in detail. Ph. D. Committee Chair: W. Russell Callen; Committee Co-Chair: Kevin F. Brennan; Committee Member: Albert B.
