40|$|The {{widespread}} use of non-biodegradable low temperature thermal insulation is impacting negatively on the environment with respect to disposal. In this study the effectiveness of using biodegradable locally available coconut fiber for insulation in ice-coolers was investigated. A comparative method {{was used to determine}} the effectiveness of a <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>metal</b> sheet ice-cooler with coconut fiber insulation in relation to standard commercially available Rubbermaid and polystyrene ice-cooler. The density of the coconut fiber insulation was varied from 50 kg/m 3 to 95 kg/m 3 for ice-coolers with wall thickness 38 mm, 51 mm, and 64 mm, respectively. For each density the melt rate was measured and compared with the Rubbermaid and polystyrene coolers. The laboratory built ice-coolers were approximately the same volume and similar in shape to the commercial ice-coolers. From the melt rate experimental results of the three laboratory built coconut fiber insulated ice coolers the 64 mm thick 95 kg/m 3 density ice cooler performed the best. The 51 mm and 64 mm thick ice coolers performed consistently better than the Rubbermaid cooler. The 51 mm and 64 mm thick ice coolers performance were comparable to that of the polystyrene ice cooler...|$|E
50|$|<b>Zinc-coated</b> <b>metals</b> {{were first}} {{patented}} in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a “hot dipping” process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 “galvanized” sheet iron roofing {{was being used}} in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan {{was one of the}} first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a popular technique in the Victorian era.|$|R
40|$|Contrast {{experiments}} of lap joints among dissimilar AZ 31 B Mg alloy, Mg 99. 50, zinc-coated DP 600 sheet, and non-zinc-coated DP 600 sheet {{were made}} by friction stir keyholeless spot welding (FSKSW) and vacuum diffusion welding (VDW), respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) were used to investigate the microstructures and components of the joints welded. The experimental {{results show that the}} FSKSW bonding method is a kind of compound mode that contains a mechanical connection and element diffusion fusion connection, in which mechanical connection has the main decisive function on joints of Mg/steel. Elements diffusion exists in the interfacial region of the joints and the elements diffusion extent is basically the same to that of VDW. The elements’ diffusion in Mg/steel using FSKSW is defined in the reaction between small amounts elements of the base <b>metal</b> and <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>metals.</b> The intermetallic compounds and composite oxide perform some reinforcement on the mechanical connection strength...|$|R

40|$|A {{process for}} {{producing}} of corrosion-resistant thin steel sheet, {{in which a}} zinc-contg. coating (5) of at least 80 wt. % Zn is produced upon carbon-deficient thin steel sheet (1) by electrolytic means or immersion in a metal melt, is novel in that one or more metals (4) apart from Zn, or a metal alloy not contg. Zn is deposited by vacuum coating on the <b>zinc-coated</b> thin <b>metal</b> sheet, and then, without exposing it to an oxidising atmosphere, the sheet is heat treated in an inert gas atmosphere. The metal or metals or metal alloy not contg. zinc is produced by electron beam evaporation or magnetron sputtering. The corrosion-resistant thin steel sheet is subjected to ion bombardment or is heated to 150 - 400 deg. C, pref. 220 deg. C before the vacuum coating. The heat treatment following the vacuum coating is carried out at an inert gas pressure of 10 - 100 kPa, pref. 80 kPa for max. 100 seconds, pref. 0 seconds at 300 - 400 deg. C. USE - Production of corrosion-resistant thin steel sheet used in the c onstruction industry, in household devices, and in the automobile industry, {{as well as in}} other industries. ADVANTAGE - The process combines the advantages of pure zinc coatings, i. e. cathodic protective effect, high ductility and comparatively low wear on shaping as well as simple, economical prodn., with those of zinc alloys, and, above all, good spot weldability and phosphate coating ability, good paint adhesion properties and good corrosion protection in the painted state. The process provides good flexibility in the choice of materials and high coating speed, and causes no environmental damage...|$|R
40|$|Remote {{laser welding}} {{technology}} offers opportunities for high production throughput {{at a competitive}} cost. However, the remote laser welding process of <b>zinc-coated</b> sheet <b>metal</b> parts in lap joint configuration poses a challenge due {{to the difference between}} the melting temperature of the steel (∼ 1500 C) and the vaporizing temperature of the zinc (~ 907 C). In fact, the zinc layer at the faying surface is vaporized and the vapour might be trapped within the melting pool leading to weld defects. Various solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem over the years. Among them, laser dimpling has been adopted by manufacturers because of its flexibility and effectiveness along with its cost advantages. In essence, the dimple works as a spacer between the two sheets in lap joint and allows the zinc vapour escape during welding process, thereby preventing weld defects. However, {{there is a lack of}} comprehensive characterization of dimpling process for effective implementation in real manufacturing system taking into consideration inherent changes in variability of process parameters. This paper introduces a methodology to develop (i) surrogate model for dimpling process characterization considering multiple–inputs (i. e. key control characteristics) and multiple–outputs (i. e. key performance indicators) system by conducting physical experimentation and using multivariate adaptive regression splines; (ii) process capability space (Cp–Space) based on the developed surrogate model that allows the estimation of a desired process fallout rate in the case of violation of process requirements in the presence of stochastic variation; and, (iii) selection and optimization of the process parameters based on the process capability space. The proposed methodology provides a unique capability to: (i) simulate the effect of process variation as generated by manufacturing process; (ii) model quality requirements with multiple and coupled quality requirements; and (iii) optimize process parameters under competing quality requirements such as maximizing the dimple height while minimizing the dimple lower surface area...|$|R
