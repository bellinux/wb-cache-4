Whenever a computer is used in measurement, signal processing or control applications, the data as seen from the computer and systems involved are naturally discrete-time because a computer executes program code at discrete points of time. Theory of discrete-time dynamic signals and systems is useful in design and analysis of control systems, signal filters, state estimators and model estimation from time-series of process data system identification. In this paper, a new approximated discretization method and digital design for control systems with delays is proposed. System is transformed to a discrete-time model with time delays. To implement the digital modeling, we used the <b>z-transfer</b> <b>functions</b> matrix which is a useful model type of discrete-time systems, being analogous to the Laplace-transform for continuous-time systems. The most important use of the z-transform is for defining <b>z-transfer</b> <b>functions</b> matrix is employed to obtain an extended discrete-time. The proposed method can closely approximate the step response of the original continuous timedelayed control system by choosing various of energy loss level. Illustrative example is simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method...|$|R

First, a set of parameters is defined, whose values uniquely determine the given system. Then an always stable reduced approximant is obtained by neglecting the parameters which do not contribute significantly {{in the formation of}} the system's responses. The proposed method slightly modified also preserves, in the reduced model, the rank of the given system. Formulae are provided to select the reduced order. © 1984...|$|R

This application is based on obtaining the temperature z-transfer function's coefficients {{by means of an}} experimental method. These coefficients are used to predict the temperature-time history of an homogeneous body and the results are compared with analytical and numerical solutions.

The algorithms are derived by calculating the <b>Z-transfer</b> <b>function</b> of the filters for filter orders up to n= 4.

40|$|The order {{reduction}} {{problem of}} z-transfer functions is solved {{by using the}} multipoint Jordan continued-fraction expansion (MJCFE) technique. An efficient algorithm that {{does not require the}} use of complex algebra is presented for obtaining an MJCFE from a stable <b>z-transfer</b> <b>function</b> with expansion points selected from the unit circle and/or the positive real axis of the z-plane. The reduced-order models are exactly the multipoint Pade approximants of the original system and, therefore, they match the (weighted) time-moments of the impulse response and preserve the frequency responses of the system at some characteristic frequencies, such as gain crossover frequency, phase crossover frequency, bandwidth, etc...|$|E

The design process {{is based on the}} pole-zero mirroring technique; with equalizer <b>z-transfer</b> <b>functions</b> generated using an optimization algorithm. To facilitate the systematic implementation of the equalizers, a model describing the design process is developed. A novel feature of the equalizers implementation is that wave structures are employed in realizing the equalizer poles instead of integrators. MATLAB and SI simulation results based on a 6 th-order equalizer are included. The results demonstrate that the equalizer can reduce the delay of a 5 th-order, 1 MHz lowpass SI elliptic filter from 155 ns to < 20 ns over the entire filter bandwidth...|$|R

A polynomic approximation {{can be achieved by}} the truncation of a Poisson series representation of the <b>z-transfer</b> <b>function.</b> This approach was proposed in an earlier publication. In the present paper two practical examples are studied by using only one or two terms of the series: In the first example of a track-guided bus the approximation is very good, in the second example of a vibration suppression control system for a helicopter sampling was relatively slow for the plant dynamics and the approximation would require more terms of the series and unreasonable computational effort...|$|E
40|$|Frequency domain {{regression}} (FDR) {{method was}} developed to calculate z-transfer functions of multilayer walls. This method {{is based on the}} theoretical frequency characteristics of transient heat conduction through a multiplayer wall to estimate a simple polynomial s-transfer function. The simple polynomial s-transfer function is equivalent to the hyperbolic s-transfer function of the wall in terms of frequency characteristics. First, the frequency characteristics of transient heat conduction of the wall were calculated within the frequency range concerned. Then, a set of linear equations was solved to yield a simple polynomial s-transfer function for internal, cross and external heat conduction. Finally, z-transfer functions were obtained by applying z-transforms on the time-domain response of the polynomial <b>z-transfer</b> <b>function.</b> The comparisons and validations show that this method is simple, efficient, fast and accurate.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the design of multiplier-less {{decimation}} filters suitable for oversampled digital signals. The aim is twofold. On one hand, it proposes an optimization framework for the design of constituent decimation filters in a general multistage decimation architecture. The basic building blocks embedded in the proposed filters belong, for a simple reason, to the class of cyclotomic polynomials (CPs) : the first 104 CPs have a <b>z-transfer</b> <b>function</b> whose coefficients are simply {− 1, 0,+ 1 }. On the other hand, the paper provides a bunch of useful techniques, most of which stemming from some key properties of CPs, for designing the proposed filters in a variety of architectures. Both recursive and non-recursive architectures are discussed by focusing on a specific decimation filter obtained {{as a result of the}} optimization algorithm. Design guidelines are provided with the aim to simplify the design of the constituent decimation filters in the multistage chain.

40|$|A semi-empirical {{model for}} {{simulating}} thermal and energy performance of an automotive air-conditioning (AAC) system in passenger vehicles has been developed. The model {{consists of two}} sections, namely empirical evaporator correlations and dynamic load simulation. The correlations used consider sensible and latent heat transfer performance of the evaporator coil. The correlations {{were obtained from the}} experimental data of actual air conditioning system for a compact size passenger car. The sensible heat transfer correlation relates the evaporator air off drybulb temperature to inlet air dry-bulb temperature, humidity ratio, evaporator air velocity, condenser inlet air dry-bulb temperature, condenser air velocity and compressor speed. The latent heat transfer correlation relates the coil air-off humidity ratio to the same six independent variables. The dynamic load simulation model was developed based on the <b>z-transfer</b> <b>function</b> method with a one-minute time step. The cooling load calculations were performed using heat gain weighting factors. Heat extraction rate and cabin air dry-bulb temperature calculations were carried out using air temperature weighting factors. The empirical evaporator sensible and latent heat transfer correlations were embedded in the loads calculation program to enable the determination of evaporator inlet and outlet air conditions, the cabin air temperature and relative humidity. Comparisons with road test data indicated that the program was capable of predicting the performance of the automotive air-conditioning system with reasonable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Repetitive control (RC) systems aim {{to achieve}} zero {{tracking}} error when tracking a periodic command, or when tracking a constant command {{in the presence}} of a periodic disturbance, or both a periodic command and periodic disturbance. This dissertation presents a new approach using Taylor Series Expansion of the inverse system <b>z-transfer</b> <b>function</b> model to design Finite Impulse Response (FIR) repetitive controllers for single-input single-output (SISO) systems, and compares the designs obtained to those generated by optimization in the frequency domain. This approach is very simple, straightforward, and easy to use. It also supplies considerable insight, and gives understanding of the cause of the patterns for zero locations in the optimization based design. The approach forms a different and effective time domain design method, and it can also be used to guide the choice of parameters in performing in the frequency domain optimization design. Next, this dissertation presents the theoretical foundation for frequency based optimization design of repetitive control design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems. A comprehensive stability theory for MIMO repetitive control is developed. A necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic stability in MIMO RC is derived, and four sufficient conditions are created. One of these is the MIMO version of the approximate monotonic decay condition in SISO RC, and one is a necessary and sufficient condition for stability for all possible disturbance periods. An appropriate optimization criterion for direct MIMO is presented based on minimizing a Frobenius norm summed over frequencies from zero to Nyquist. This design process is very tractable, requiring only solution of a linear algebraic equation. An alternative approach reduces the problem to a set of SISO design problems, one for each input-output pair. The performances of the resulting designs are studied by extensive examples. Both approaches are seen to be able to create RC designs with fast monotonic decay of the tracking error. Finally, this dissertation presents an analysis of using an experiment design sequence for parameter identification based on the theory of iterative learning control (ILC), a sister field to repetitive control. This is suggested as an alternative to the results in optimal experiment design. Modified ILC laws that are intentionally non-robust to model errors are developed, as a way to fine tune the use of ILC for identification purposes. The non-robustness with respect to its ability to improve identification of system parameters when the model error is correct is studied. It is demonstrated that in many cases the approach makes the learning particularly sensitive to relatively small parameter errors in the model, but sensitivity is sometimes limited to parameter errors of a specific sign...|$|E
