40|$|Various oxygen- and nitrogen-donor ligands were {{investigated}} as potential zirconium masking agents in <b>zirconium</b> <b>tanning.</b> α-Hydroxycarboxylic acid ligands {{were identified as}} effective zirconium(IV) chelators in acidic aqueous solution. Glycolic acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, 4 -hydroxymandelic acid, 4 -chloromandelic acid and 4 -bromomandelic acid complexes were synthesised, isolated and characterised using a range of analytical techniques. Linear Free Energy Relationships were examined to optimise {{the stability of the}} zirconium complexes. Hammett [sigma] plots and Yukawa-Tsuno modified σ plots of the mandelate ligand and zirconium complex series indicated that inductive effects dominate within the benzene ring, however, mesomeric effects are significant outside the ring. Zirconium 4 -hydroxymandelate complex solutions were identified as the most effective tanning agents and achieved shrinkage temperatures of 80 and 97 ºC for hide powder and goatskin, respectively. The zirconium and 4 -hydroxymandelic acid interact synergistically to yield leather equivalent to combination tanned leather in one step. Tanning was performed similarly to vegetable tanning processes with a pickle pH of approximately 5 and fixation was achieved upon acidification. Pilot-scale tanning of goatskin produced white tanned leathers and crust leathers which were physically and aesthetically comparable to matched chromium tanned material...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zirconium</b> tanning: <b>Tanning</b> by <b>zirconium</b> salts offers great {{advantages}} in obtaining a final product of great color brilliance and very light colours. However {{it is another}} aggressive process; it requires a very acid medium (about pH 1.0). Such strong acid causes rapid corrosion of metallic parts of the traditional drums. The polypropylene-lined drum prevents any contact between the acid and metal equipment.|$|R
