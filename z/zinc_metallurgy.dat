50|$|Prof. Biswas’ {{academic}} {{interest and}} firm conviction that both {{social sciences and}} humanities and science and technology are essential for human progress, propelled him to publish {{a large number of}} research papers and reviews on a wide spectrum of topics. The topics covered included: Epic of Saltpetre to Gunpowder; Why did Scientific Renaissance take place in Europe and not in India; Brass and <b>zinc</b> <b>metallurgy</b> in the ancient and medieval world : India’s primacy and the technology transfer to the west, Raman, Krishnan and the IACS Episodes of the 1930s; The Era of Science Enthusiasts in Bengal (1841-1891): Akshayakumar's; Vidyasagar and Rajendralala; Calcuttan Science 1784-1930 and the Awakening in India; Rammohun Roy, his Intellectual Compatriots and their Scientific Contributions; Science in the Path of Syncretism, Syncretism in the Future of Humankind - Some Golden thoughts of Swami Vivekananda; Social Factors in the Development of Technology in Ancient India; Science, Spirituality and Socialism: A Tribute to Joseph Needham; Science and Music with a Special Note on Helmholtz, James Jeans to Pandit Ravishankar. He also published some interesting book reviews, such as: Images and Contexts: The Historiography of Science and Modernity in India; Story of the Delhi Iron Pillar; The Indus Civilization, A People’s History of India. Jagadish Chandra Bose and National Science; Kautilya’s Arthasastra in the light of modern science and technology; An Eye For Excellence: (Fifty Innovative Years of IIT Kanpur); la vintage metallurgie (coffee table book, CSIR-NML); Caught between two Cultures - Science in Nineteenth Century Bengal, etc.|$|E
40|$|Secondary zinc {{and lead}} {{production}} is addressed {{as one of}} the potential sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dioxin-like PCBs) due to the impurity of the raw material. However, the release inventory of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs is very scarce for these secondary nonferrous metallurgies. This study selected typical secondary zinc and lead plants to investigate the emissions of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs released from such plants in China. The toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) emission factor of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs released into the environment is higher for secondary zinc production, at 52 298. 02 ng TEQ ton(- 1) than for secondary lead production, at 646. 05 ng TEQ ton(- 1). The most abundant congeners of PCDD/Fs are 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -PeCDF and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDF for the secondary <b>zinc</b> and lead <b>metallurgies,</b> respectively. The most abundant congener of dioxin-like PCBs in the samples collected from both metallurgies is CB- 126. According to the distribution of PCDD/Fs (PCDF/PCDD >> 1) and the dominant contribution of higher chlorinated congeners, the de novo synthesis is assumed to be the main formation pathway of PCDD/Fs in the secondary <b>zinc</b> <b>metallurgies.</b> For the secondary lead metallurgies, the role of precursor formation is also very important. Based on the emission factor and production level, the total estimated emission amounts of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs in both stack gas and fly ash released into the environment from secondary zinc and lead production is estimated to be at least 2. 76 and 0. 42 g TEQ yr(- 1), respectively. The dioxin-like PCBs contribute 2. 8 % and 0. 6 % of the total emission from secondary zinc and lead plants, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|Intellectual {{activities}} of Prof. Biswas extended far beyond mineral engineering and covered languages, archaeometallurgy, minerals and gems in ancient India,literature, music and religions - {{mostly in the}} Indian context. Prof. Biswas was the Founder-President of the Indian Languages Society which organized a national seminar on Profiles in Indian languages during December 10-12, 1982. The proceedings of the seminar were published as a multi-authored book ‘Profiles in Indian languages and literatures’ which received international acclaim. The period around 1980 was also {{the beginning of his}} increasing interest in archaeometallurgy. Characterisation studies on ancient slag and retorts from Zawar mines later culminated in a number of papers on the primacy of India in brass and <b>zinc</b> <b>metallurgy.</b> During 1987-90, History of Science Division of Indian National Science Academy (INSA) sponsored a project on ‘Minerals and Metals in Ancient India up to 1200 AD from Sanskrit Literature and other Sources’. In this project, he was ably assisted by his wife, Sulekha, a Sanskrit scholar. The project completion report submitted in 1991 later (in 1996) resulted in the publication of the monumental monograph called ‘Minerals and Metals in Ancient India’. This two volume monograph (volume 1 - Archaeological Evidence, Volume - 2 Literary Evidence) tells the fascinating, coherently woven story of the Mineral and Metals from across the entire sub-continental sprawl of the old-world India (including Pakistan and Bangladesh). In following years (1991-94), INSA sponsored another project on Minerals and Metals in Pre-Modern period (1200-1900 AD) which led to the publication of several interesting papers in Indian J History of Science; Gem minerals in pre-Modern India, Non-Gem Minerals in Pre-modern India and Iron and Steel in Pre-modern India. Prof. Biswas delved deep into the ancient Indian texts and established the etymology of beryllium-containing minerals in the Indian and world literature - particularly of Beryl (Vaidurya) and emerald (Marakata). Similarly, other topics related to history of science included : History of science in India : In search of a new paradigm, Rasa-Ratna Samuccaya and Mineral Processing State of Art in the 13th Century A.D.

The material is dumped without further treatment though {{the values of}} yttrium and europium are over 10 and 1 %,respectively. The technology here proposed shows the method of isolation of both valuable components by liquid-liquid extraction. Dust or sludge is dissolved in nitric acid and yttrium and europium salts are extracted out from the leaching liqour by bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid. The final products are pure oxides of Y,Eu.

40|$|International audienceZinc oxide (ZnO) {{polycrystalline}} ceramics are {{the focal}} point of lightning arrester technology. These semiconductor materials are able to switch rapidly from high to low impedance while handling large amounts of electrical energy. Since the early 1970 s, considerable efforts have been made to improve the specific energy absorption capacity and device reliability of such components. This document describes a case study carried out on the life cycle impacts of three different designs of electroceramics made of ZnO. Results show that the best design involves decreasing the diameter while maintaining the thickness of the compound. Of the production, transport, use, and end-of-life phases, the use phase is found to contribute by far the most to environmental impacts, with leakage currents in the 10 − 6 ampere range. The next-largest impacts come in the transport and production stages. Sensitivity analysis shows that impacts associated with the production stage originate from ZnO production and are related to the by-products (heavy metals) of <b>zinc</b> <b>metallurgy...</b>|$|E
