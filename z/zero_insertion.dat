30|$|Among these insertion-type oxide anode {{materials}} for Li-ion batteries, Li 4 Ti 15 O 12 {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising alternatives due to its special characters, such as a small volume change during charge/discharge process (<b>zero</b> strain <b>insertion</b> materials), which enables a long and stable cycle life, and a stable insertion potential at 1.55 V versus Li, which avoids the reduction reaction of electrolyte. Additionally, Li 4 Ti 15 O 12 also has an excellent Li+ mobility, hence promising for high rate battery applications. Zhou et al. reported the fabrication of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 hollow microspheres by a sol–gel process using carbon microspheres as templates [32]. The Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 hollow microspheres show higher Li storage capacity, especially at higher current rates. It is believed that the short Li+ diffusion distance and large contact area between Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 electrode and electrolyte increased both the efficiency of Li+ and electronic conductivity, hence the rate capability. Jiang et al. prepared hollow spherical Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 by the emulsion method [33]. This hollow spheres can be charged/discharged at 20 C (3.4 A g− 1) with the specific capacity of 95 mA h g− 1. Over 500 cycles charge and discharge at 2 C, the specific capacity stays very stable at 140 mA h g− 1 with a loss of 0.01 % per cycle. Besides these common hollow spheres of Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 anode materials, three-dimensional hierarchical hollow microspheres assembled by thin nanosheets were reported [34]. Hollow structured nanomaterials of other insertion-type oxide materials such as TiO 2 have also been reported [35, 36].|$|R
40|$|The first 79 {{residues}} of {{the yeast}} Ste 2 p G protein-coupled pheromone receptor, including the negatively charged N-terminal domain, the first transmembrane segment, {{and the following}} positively charged cytoplasmic loop, has been fused to a Kex 2 p-cleavable beta-lactamase reporter. Insertion orientation was determined by analysis of cell-associated and secreted beta-lactamase activities and independently corroborated by analysis of membrane association and glycosylation patterns. This fusion inserts with exclusively N terminus exofacial (Nexo) topology, serving as a model type III membrane protein. Orientation is unaffected by removal of all three positively charged residues in the cytoplasmic loop or by deletion of all but 12 residues from the N-terminal domain. The residual - 2 N-terminal charge apparently provides a signal sufficient to determine Nexo topology. This is entirely consistent with the statistically derived rule in which the charge difference, Delta(C-N), counted for the 15 immediately flanking residues, is the primary topology determinant. Mutations altering Delta(C-N) to <b>zero</b> favors Nexo <b>insertion</b> by 3 to 1, whereas increasingly negative values cause increasing inversion of orientation.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} reported in this thesis is to establish the feasibility of a novel optical architecture for an optical route & select circuit switch suitable for implementation as a photonic integrated circuit. The proposed architecture combines Optical Phased Array (OPA) switch elements implemented as multimode interference coupler based Generalised Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (GMZI) with a planar Lüneburg lens-based optical transpose interconnection network implemented using graded metamaterial waveguide slabs. The proposed switch is transparent to signal format and, in principle, can have <b>zero</b> excess <b>insertion</b> loss and scale to large port counts. These switches will enable the low-energy consumption high capacity communications network infrastructure needed to provide environmentally-friendly broadband access to all. The thesis first explains the importance of switch structures in optical communications networks and the difficulties of scaling to {{a large number of}} switch ports. The thesis then introduces the Talbot effect, i. e. the self-imaging of periodic field distributions in free space. It elaborates on a new approach to finding the phase relations between pairs of Talbot image planes at carefully selected positions. The free space Talbot effect is mapped to the waveguide Talbot effect which is fundamental to the operation of multimode interference couplers (MMI). Knowledge of the phase relation between the MMI ports is necessary to achieve correct operation of the GMZI OPA switch elements. An outline of the design procedures is given that can be applied to optimise the performance of MMI couplers and, as a consequence, the GMZI OPA switch elements. The Lüneburg Optical Transpose Interconnection System (LOTIS) is introduced as a potential {{solution to the problem of}} excessive insertion loss and cross-talk caused by the large number of crossovers in a switch fabric. Finally, the thesis explains how a Lüneburg lens may be implemented in a graded ‘metamaterial’, i. e. a composite material consisting of ‘atoms’ arranged on a regular lattice suspended in a host by nano-structuring of silicon waveguide slabs using a single etch-step. Furthermore, the propagation of light in graded almost-periodic structures is discussed. Detailed consideration is given to the calibration of the local homogenised effective index; in terms of the local parameters of the metamaterial microstructure in the plane and the corrections necessary to accommodate slab waveguide confinement in the normal to the plane. The concept and designs were verified by FDTD simulation. A 4 × 4 LOTIS structure showed correct routing of light with a low insertion loss of - 0. 25 dB and crosstalk of - 24. 12 dB. An - 0. 45 dB excess loss for 2 D analysis and an - 0. 83 dB insertion excess loss for 3 D analysis of two side by side metamaterial Lüneburg lenses with diameter of 15 μm was measured, which suggests that the metamaterial implementation produces minimal additional impairments to the switch...|$|R
40|$|Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and Campylobacter play a {{major role}} in {{foodborne}} illness caused by the consumption of food contaminated by pathogens worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic factors that increase the survival fitness of these foodborne pathogens will effectively help us formulate mitigation strategies without affecting the nutrition ecology. The objective of this study was to identify the genetic determinants of Salmonella and Campylobacter that are required for fitness under various in vitro conditions. For the purpose, we used a high throughput Transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) that utilizes next generation sequencing (NGS) to screen hundreds of thousands of mutants simultaneously. In Chapter 1, we reviewed the technical aspects of different Tn-seq methods along with their pros and cons and compressive summary of recently published studies using Tn-seq methods. In Chapter 2, we exposed complex Tn 5 library of Salmonella Typhimurium 14028 S (S. Typhimurium) to the mimicked host stressors in vitro conditions. Such as low acidic pH (pH 3) found in the stomach, osmotic (3 % NaCl) and short chain fatty acid (SCFAs, 100 mM Propionate) found in intestine, and oxidation (1 mM H 2 O 2) and starvation (12 -day survival in PBS) found in macrophage. There was an overlapping set of 339 conditionally essential genes (CEGs) required by S. Typhimurium to overcome these host stressors. In Chapter 3, we screened of S. Typhimurium Tn 5 library for desiccation survival. Salmonella spp. is the most notable and frequent cause of contamination in low-water activity foods. We identified 61 genes and 6 intergenic regions required for fitness during desiccation stress. In Chapter 4, the essential genome of Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) NCTC 11168 and C. jejuni 81 - 176 was investigated using Tn-seq.

40|$|Herein is {{presented}} a novel {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD) route for the fabrication of oxide ferroelectrics. A versatile layer-by-layer growth mode was developed to prepare naturally super-latticed bismuth based materials belonging to the Aurivillius phase family, with which good control over composition and crystal structure was achieved. In chapter 3, the effect of epitaxial strain {{on one of the}} very simple oxide materials TiO 2 was studied. It has been found that the ultra-thin TiO 2 films demonstrate ferroelectric behaviour when grown on NdGaO 3 substrates. TiO 2 exists in various crystal phases, but none of them show ferroelectric behaviour. The epitaxial strain due to the substrate, changes the crystal structure from tetragonal to orthorhombic which in turn leads to ferroelectric behaviour. In chapter 4, a unique growth method for multiferroic BiFeO 3 (BFO) thin films is shown, where a phase pure BFO thin films can be prepared even in the presence of excess bismuth precursor during the growth process. This type of growth is usually called adsorption controlled growth and can be used for growing various bismuth containing compounds, where the volatility of bismuth can create various types of defects. Chapter 5 describes the growth of Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 thin films in a layer-by-layer growth mode. In this section, the effect of Bi and Ti precursor flows on the growth of thin films is discussed and it is shown that how change in precursor flows leads to out-ofphase boundary defects during the layer-by-layer growth mode.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand for new wireless services and applications, {{the high level of}} integration and the coexistence of multi-standard (MS) or multi-band operations into a single device are becoming defining trends in designing microwave filters. This has driven considerable technological advances in reconfigurable/tunable and miniaturized filters. More specifically, reconfigurable/tunable filters that tune to different frequency bands instead of classical filter banks have great potential to significantly reduce the system size and complexity; while reducing the filter size becomes essential to achieve the highest degree of integration density in compact and portable wireless devices. In the light of this scenario, the objective of this dissertation is to develop the new design technologies, concepts and filtering configurations for tunable microstrip filters and compact passive microwave filters. To this aim, this dissertation is divided into two main parts. The first part (Part I) focuses on the designs of novel varactor-tuned microstrip filters with advanced performances. In this aspect, new topologies for realizing tunable lowpass and highpass filters are firstly developed. State-of-the-art performances, including wide tuning range, high selectivity with multiple transmission <b>zeros,</b> low <b>insertion</b> loss and compact size for all the tuning states are obtained in both of these filters. Secondly, two novel classes of tunable bandpass filters are presented. One of them is designed based on varactor-loaded parallel-coupled microstrip lines (PCML) and short-circuited stubs, which allows the lower passband edge together with two transmission zeros located around the lower passband skirt to be reconfigured separately. While the other tunable bandpass filter is constructed by the combination of tunable bandpass and lowpass filters, featuring both centre frequency and bandwidth tunabilities, as well as high selectivity with abundant transmission zeros. Furthermore, a new concept of tunable lossy filter is demonstrated, which attempts to achieve an equivalent high-Q tunable performance by using low-Q resonators. This concept makes the presented tunable combline filter interesting for some frequency-agile applications in which the low in-band loss variation and high selectivity are much desired while the absolute insertion loss can be a tradeoff. The second part (Part II) is devoted to the design of miniaturized passive microwave filters with improved characteristics. For this, the concept of artificial right-handed and left-handed transmission lines are applied to the signal interference filtering topology, which results in a compact circuit size and good out-of-band performance. In particular, for a further size reduction, such filter is implemented in the forms of multilayered structure by using liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology. Additionally, another two types of miniaturized bandpass filters using stepped impedance resonators are demonstrated, which are implemented based on different fabrication processes (i. e. LCP bonded multilayer PCB technology and a standard planar PCB technology). Among their main features, the compact size, wide passband, broad stopband with multiple transmission zeros and circuit simplicity are highlighted. For all the proposed design techniques and filtering structures, exhaustive theoretical analyses are done, and design equations and guide rules are provided. Furthermore, all the proposed schemes and/or ideas have been experimentally validated through the design, implementation and measurement of different filters. The fabrication processes of multilayer technology utilized: liquid crystal polymer (LCP) technology and liquid crystal polymer (LCP) bonded multilayer printed circuit board (PCB) technology, are also demonstrated for reference. All of the results achieved in this dissertation make the proposed filters very attractive for their use in modern wireless communication systems...|$|R

This new topology {{is based on}} the combination of two directive three-port elements with a four-port phase-shifting network: the proposed MMIC is featured by an average <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> loss, 180 °± 2 ° differential phase-shift and good port matching over the 3 - 7 GHz operating bandwidth. The MMIC size is 3. 5 × 3. 4 mm 2. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E
