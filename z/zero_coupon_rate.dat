40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the term {{structure}} of interest rates. We show that the term structure of interest rates is a static function that relates the term to maturity to the yield to maturity for a sam- ple of bonds at a given point of time. We also short describe four mainstream theories attempt to explain {{the shape of the}} yield curve. The yield curve is a basic instrument for understanding the relationship between the interest rate of bonds and the maturity of a financial instrument. It has the same relevance for all economic subjects in the form of interest rates determination. Estimation of the term structure discussed in the paper involves obtaining <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates,</b> or discount functions from a set of coupon bond prices. The bootstrapping method is used here to determinate the particular <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates</b> of bonds, where the method consists of iteratively extracting <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates</b> using a sequence of increasing maturity coupon bond prices. Using these rates it becomes possible to derive interest rates for all maturities by making a few assumptions including linear in- terpolation as we discuss in conclusion of this paper. The particular spot and forward <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates</b> resulting from the bootstrapping method can be used as input in different economic categories like financial management, portfolio management, actuary science, company valuation, management of firm value, financial risk management, etc. The matrix approach derived and described in this paper can be used instead of solving the <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> sequentially for obtaining a direct solution with particular <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>rates.</b> This helps us to diminish the computing severity related to the sequential determination of interest rates using an iterative approach. Fortunately, however, the application of matrix theory helps us to solve this issue very well...|$|R

This theoretical background is applied to an estimation of the zero-coupon yield curve derived from the Czech coupon bond market. There are many methodologies and each can provide surprisingly different results.

40|$|The <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> {{yield curve}} {{is one of}} the most {{fundamental}} tools in finance and is essential in the pricing of various fixed-income securities. <b>Zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>rates</b> are not observable in the market for a range of maturities. Therefore, an estimation methodology is required to derive the <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> yield curves from observable data. If we deal with approximations of empirical data to create yield curves it is necessary to choose suitable mathematical functions. We discuss the following methods: the methods based on cubic spline functions, methods employing linear combination of the Fourier or exponential basis functions and the parametric model of Nelson and Siegel. The current mathematical apparatus employed for this kind of approximation is outlined. In order to find parameters of the models we employ the least squares minimization of computed and observed prices. The theoretical background is applied to an estimation of the zero-coupon yield curves derived from the Czech coupon bond market. Application of proper smoothing functions and weights of bonds is crucial if we want to select a method which performs best according to given criteria. The best performance is obtained for Bspline models with smoothing...|$|R

40|$|This study uses {{a unique}} data set on Australian coupon bonds {{to test a}} number of yield curve models. A {{non-linear}} least squares technique is employed to directly fit four alternative, <b>zero</b> <b>coupon,</b> forward <b>rate,</b> yield curve models to the data. The four yield curve models tested were two, 4 -parameter polynomial curves and two 3 -parameter models including a Laguerre function. We show that a fourth order polynomial with the cubic term omitted best fits the data. This preferred model provides good estimates of both the forward and spot rate curves as well as producing volatility structures that accorded with our a priori expectation. The preferred, fourth order polynomial model is {{used as the basis}} of a market trading strategy. In this strategy, a model predicted underpriced bonds are purchased and a model predicted overpriced bonds are sold. This strategy is shown to be superior to a random trading strategy. There is however, little evidence of market inefficiency as transaction costs account for any profit generated by the strategy. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{yield curve}} or term {{structure}} {{of interest rates}} is {{the relation between the}} (level of) interest rate (or cost of borrowing) and the time to maturity of the debt for a given borrower in a given currency. The yield curve forms the basis for the valuation of all fixed income instruments, because the price of a fixed income security can be calculated as the net present value of the stream of cash flows, and each cash flow has to be discounted using the <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rate</b> for the associated term to maturity. The term structure of interest rates as the interception of macroeconomics and finance has increasingly been employed as a means of explaining the upward slope of the yield curve and the bond premium puzzle [see Gürkaynak and Wright (2012) for a survey on macroeconomics and the term structure or Lange (2013) and Pericoli and Taboga (2012) for recent specific examples]. Accordingly, fixed income portfolio managers, central bankers and market participants apply econometric models to achieve a better representation of the evolution of interest rates, in the view that these models are useful decision-orienting tools for their purposes.|$|R
40|$|This thesis studies a multi-factor Heath-Jarrow-Morton {{model and}} a LIBOR mar- ket model on the Norwegian, European and US {{interest}} rate market. The main concerns are the low-rate environment {{and exposure to}} negative interest rates in these models. We begin by introducing financial markets and the mathematical models explaining them. Further we discuss {{the problem with the}} current low-rate environment and the historical market practice. The focuses are implementations of two multi-factor interest rate models and the presence of negative interest rates. The historical data is provided by DNB and consists of <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> swap <b>rates</b> for several maturities in the period 2000 - 2012. The volatility factors are derived from historical data using principal component analysis and covariance matrices. With today?s yield curve the probability of negative rates is highly significant in the HJM model, whereas it is zero in LMM because of lognormality. Monte Carlo is used on the models to compare prices of caps and floors. We show that the models do not produce the same price especially around strikes near the current 3 -month rates. Further we price long butterfly spreads to show the absence of arbitrage in both models...|$|R
40|$|Using {{estimated}} {{principal components}} as factors, three-factor models are shown to produce forecasts {{comparable to those}} of autoregressive models for 2 - to 10 -year <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rates</b> IRS markets both, for short- and medium-term forecasting horizons. Evidence is provided for the Deutsche mark, Spanish peseta, Japanese yen and US dollar. Forecasts from factor models are also shown to preserve the correlation matrix of interest rates across a given term structure, an important property regarding risk management. The result is quite striking, because factor models are purely static, and forecasts for the factors must be obtained in advance of interest rate forecasts. The use of three-factor models greatly simplifies forecasting computations, since three univariate models, rather than nine, need to be used for prediction purposes. Besides, our results open the possibility that the type of simulations needed for VaR analysis could successfully be performed by just simulating the factors, again with a very substantial reduction in computational needs.

40|$|Most trading {{software}} {{in the market}} uses linear interpolation in the bootstrap procedure to create a <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> interest <b>rate</b> curve. Forward interest rate curves created by interpolation method have a zigzag form that is inconsistent with arbitrage condition. Furthermore {{in the real world}} we are not able to detect the spot rates for all periods because the number of traded instruments is limited. Nelson and Siegel in 1987 proposed a model to estimate the interest rates. They demonstrated that their model was flexible to capture the various possible shapes of the yield curve and estimates the term structure of interest rates over time. Many Central banks are using the extended Nelson-Siegel model (sometimes called the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model). This curve is parameterized with exponential functions, is smooth in both zero rate and forward rate and overcome those barrier (data mining problems and zigzag shape of forward interest rate curve), that we face by using linear interpolation to build the yield curve. The objective of this thesis is to study the Nelson and Siegel model and its extended version by Svensson, furthermore, study the adequacy and forecast performance of Nelson-Siegel-Svensson model in building the term structure of interest rate comparing with the linear interpolation method...|$|R

Consequently, we establish a theoretical basis to explain previous empirical findings regarding the significant impact of taxation on defaultable bond prices.
