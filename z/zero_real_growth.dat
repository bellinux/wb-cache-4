The {{case of a}} “pure” non growing perpetuity (<b>zero</b> <b>real</b> <b>growth</b> and zero inflation) is of academic interest but in practice it might be difficult to find. The findings contradict what is generally accepted in the literature. In particular we examine the textbook formula for calculating {{the value of a}} perpetuity. When working with perpetuities we are in presence of a Chinese box: we have found that when working with perpetuities in a scenario of non zero inflation and <b>zero</b> <b>real</b> <b>growth</b> value increases with inflation. On the other hand, the textbook formula for calculating a non growing perpetuity in the same scenario under values the value of the perpetuity by relevant amounts. ...|$|E

In this work we show that even with adjustments in the calculation of the proper Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC, in order to grant that the model with <b>zero</b> <b>real</b> <b>growth</b> and inflation is inflation neutral it has some inconsistencies. We develop a formulation for Ke, the cost of levered equity that is consistent and is inflation neutral. We identify problems of consistency and non inflation neutrality when using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the past trends {{and evolution of}} safeguards over time and projects growth through 2030. The report documents the amount of nuclear material and facilities under safeguards from 1970 until present, along with the corresponding budget. Estimates for the future amount of facilities and material under safeguards are made according to non-nuclear-weapons states’ (NNWS) plans to build more nuclear capacity and sustain current nuclear infrastructure. Since nuclear energy {{is seen as a}} clean and economic option for base load electric power, many countries are seeking to either expand their current nuclear infrastructure, or introduce nuclear power. In order to feed new nuclear power plants and sustain existing ones, more nuclear facilities will need to be built, and thus more nuclear material will be introduced into the safeguards system. The projections in this study conclude that a <b>zero</b> <b>real</b> <b>growth</b> scenario for the IAEA safeguards budget will result in large resource gaps in the near future...|$|E

During the 1970 s, UNESCO was criticized for becoming too politicized.

The United States plans to rejoin UNESCO on October 1, 2003. To facilitate oversight of U.

30|$|A {{common mistake}} in {{macroeconomic}} analysis that may potentially lead to misguided policies is to confuse demand factors {{of economic growth}} with supply factors. As far as the potential growth rate is concerned, demand factors can only influence the difference, i.e., growth gap, between the <b>real</b> <b>growth</b> rate and the potential growth rate. A strong short-term demand can push the <b>real</b> <b>growth</b> rate beyond potential growth capacity, while inadequate demand can cause <b>real</b> <b>growth</b> to fall short of potential growth capacity. However, the potential of economic growth ultimately depends on the potential growth rate, which is constrained by production factors {{on one hand and}} TFP on the other. Therefore, without an increase to the potential growth rate, expanding demand arbitrarily in order to spur economic <b>growth</b> may cause <b>real</b> economic <b>growth</b> to exceed the potential growth rate, which may also lead to distortion.|$|R
