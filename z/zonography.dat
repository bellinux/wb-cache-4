Findings are discussed with reference to similar radiographic techniques...|$|E

Eight depositional {{sequences}} (DS) {{delimited by}} regional disconformities had been {{recognized in the}} Miocene of Lisbon and Serubal Peninsula areas. In {{the case of the}} western coast of the Setu bal Pen insula, outcrops consisting of Lower Burdigalian to Lower Torto nian sed iments were studied. The strat igraphic <b>zonography</b> and the environmental considerations are main ly supported on data concerning to foraminifera, ostracoda, vertebrates and palynomorphs. The first mineralogical and geochemical data determined for Foz da Fonte, Penedo Sui and Penedc Norte sedimentary seque nces are presented. These analyt ical data mainly correspond to the sedi ments ' fine fractions. Mineralogical data are based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), carried ou t on both the less than 3811 m and 2 11 m fractio ns. Qualitative and semi-quan titative determinations of clay and non-clay minera ls were obtained for both fractions. The clay minerals asse mblages complete the lithos tratigra phic and paleoenvironmental data obtai ned by stratigraphic and palaeontological stud ies. Some palaeomagnetic and isotopic data are discussed and correlated with the mineralogical data. Multivariate data analys is (Principal Components Analysis) of the mineralogical data was carried out using both R-mode and Q-mode factor analysis. RES UM...|$|E
