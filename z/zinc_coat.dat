Ultrasonic {{spot welding}} of {{galvanized}} steel sheets {{has been conducted}} to investigate formation process of the weld microstructure, and effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>coat</b> on joint property. The joint strength showed a rapidly increase at the weld time of 0. 8 s, {{and it has the}} maximum value over 1. 0 s. In the weld time range from 0. 1 s to 0. 8 s, fracture occurred in <b>zinc</b> <b>coat</b> / steel interface. In contrast, the fracture partially occurred in the base steel in the weld time over 1. 0 s, and concaves in which the steel substrate of one specimen partially remains on the other specimen were observed. The formation process of weld microstructure of ultrasonic welding was proposed to be a two-steps process. First, <b>zinc</b> <b>coat</b> in the interface was mechanically removed by the vibration and clamping force, and some zinc particles dispersed in the weld interface. Second, the zinc particles melted due to the friction, and partially bonded regions were simultaneously formed around the zinc particles. The partially bonded regions were stirred with the steel substrate as the weld time increased. The joint strength increased by development of the stirred zone. At the weld time over 1. 2 s, the joint strength decreased due to growth of crack around the stirred zone...|$|E

When {{stamping}} galvanized sheet, the formability usually decreases {{for failure}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating.</b> In this paper, formability of galvanized sheet was firstly researched by Erichsen experiment. The {{results show that}} <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> has lost efficacy when the cup arrives the value of Erichsen depth (ED).

Then depth of the cup when <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> reaches critical state was got, which decreased about 5 %- 10 % compared with bare sheet. At last, failure mechanism of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> was discussed, the reason is that material of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is soft and the friction leads to pulverization and exfoliation of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating.</b> The simulation results are consistent with the Erichsen experiment ones.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Zinc</b> <b>coated</b> steels are {{nowadays}} {{used for}} different applications as for example for household appliances, automotive or offtakes. Due to the boiling temperature of zinc (907 °C), which {{is lower than}} the steel melting point, the welding of <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> steel sheets presents many difficulties. As a result of the violent evaporation of zinc, pores in the weld seam are present after solidification and the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> near the weld is damaged. Brazing of <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> steels with CuSi-alloys offers some advantages, as the joining temperature is about 950 - 1000 °C. Nevertheless the high melting point of these filler materials requires very restricted process strategies and damaging of the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> near the brazing seam can’t be avoided. Although laser-, plasma- and MIG-joining with CuSi and CuAl are performed nowadays. ZnAl-alloys are characterized through low melting temperature, which are comparable to the melting point of zinc, so that the damaging of the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> can be reduced. In this paper investigations carried out with ZnAl-materials for joining <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> steel sheets as DC 04 ZE 75 / 75 and DX 56 Z (thickness 0, 9 mm) are reported. First investigations were performed by resistance spot soldering and show that using low temperature melting materials leads to a lower damaging of the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating.</b> Further the process reliability of laser soldering with ZnAl-alloys and a Nd:YAG as well as a diode laser is reported and confirms the suitability of these alloys for a damaging free joining <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> steels. The low surface tension leads to a wide bearing section, so that advantageous properties are expected.

40|$|Abstract:During {{forming process}} of sheet metal, {{friction}} phenomenon occurs everywhere. Galvanized sheet {{is the combination}} of substrate and <b>zinc</b> <b>coating,</b> which are two different materials of different properties. Compared with ordinary cold-rolled steel sheets, friction during forming process of galvanized sheet is more complicated. Factors like load, velocity, etc. have different effects. In this paper, effects of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating,</b> velocity and load on galvanized sheet friction coefficient were researched based on orthogonal tables with using friction wear tester. The results show the following conclusions. <b>Zinc</b> <b>coating</b> has great effect on galvanized sheet friction, friction coefficient of zinc-coated sheet is {{greater than that of}} bare board under low load (0. 3 ~ 1 N), but smaller than that of bare board under high load (1 ~ 5 N). Galvanized sheet friction coefficient also changes when load or velocity changes, with load increases, it first increases and then decreases; with velocity increases, it first increases and then decreases. Mechanism of the influence rules above was simply analyzed. Significance of the three factors above could also be seen. Under low load, effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> on galvanized sheet friction coefficient is the greatest, followed by that of load, and finally that of velocity, but none of them is significant; under high load, effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is significant, those of velocity and load are not significant...|$|R

50|$|The {{protection}} {{provided by}} hot-dip galvanizing is insufficient for products {{that will be}} constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses.
