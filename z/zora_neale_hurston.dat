5|$|The Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s {{established}} the African-American literary canon in the United States and introduced writers Langston Hughes and <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> <b>Hurston.</b> Manhattan's vibrant visual art {{scene in the}} 1950s and 1960s was a center of the American pop art movement, which gave birth to such giants as Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. The downtown pop art movement of the late 1970s included artist Andy Warhol and clubs like Serendipity 3 and Studio 54, where he socialized.|$|E
5|$|Although Du Bois {{attended}} a New England Congregational {{church as a}} child, he abandoned organized religion while at Fisk College. As an adult, Du Bois described himself as agnostic or a freethinker, {{but at least one}} biographer concluded that Du Bois was virtually an atheist.Lewis, p. 550 (agnostic, atheist).Johnson, passim (agnostic). However, another analyst of Du Bois's writings concluded that he had a religious voice, albeit radically different from other African-American religious voices of his era, and inaugurated a 20th-century spirituality to which Ralph Ellison, <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> <b>Hurston,</b> and James Baldwin also belong.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the 1997 {{discovery}} of Harlem Renaissance author <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> <b>Hurston???s</b> previously unknown play manuscripts??????The Copyright Deposit Plays??????in an effort to broaden the range of academic study on Hurston as an African-American female playwright of the 1920 s and 30 s. The analysis attempts to understand how Hurston translated the oral history of rural African Americans into her brand of folk plays. This thesis also explores how Hurston???s plays promote a distinctive and innovative theatrical portrait of the emerging new African-American persona of the Harlem Renaissance era, breaking free from the denigrating, and still lingering, minstrelsy stereotypes. The examination revolves around plays and skits routinely overlooked for academic critique and theatrical production: Meet the Mama (1925); four skits from the Fast and Furious revue: Forty Yards, Lawing and Jawing, Poker!, and Woofing (1931); and Spunk (1935) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{collection}} of ???coming of age??? short stories not only investigates the complicated theme {{of physical and}} figurative survival in a patriarchal world, both passive and hostile, it also explores specific cultural landscapes that create hybrid identity. In Borderlands Gloria Anzaldua claims that our whole understanding of identity has to be revised because all identities are hybrids, formed over time through the interaction of multiple cultures and is constantly being transformed by new encounters in the borderlands between one culture and another. There are multiple cultural landscapes in this collection that help create hybrid identity through the struggle of each protagonist. Some of these struggles include surviving poverty, violence, religion, Mother Nature???s onslaught, mental illness, death, {{and a lack of}} roots. Inspired by the realistic struggle of African-Americans in <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> <b>Hurston???s</b> Their Eyes Will Be Watching God and John Steinbeck???s examination of Americans during the Depression in The Grapes of Wrath, this collection is strung together like a pearl necklace, many stories exploring the ethical choices faced by the insurgent lower-middle class, influenced by each cultural landscape. First, a post WWII baby boomer generation entrenched in poverty deep in the hills of Appalachia. Second, there is Appalachian migration in search of a better life, and the struggle in rural Texas. Third, there is the broke and desperate outsider trying to survive the drug and gang culture of Venice Beach, California during the 1960 - 1970 ???s counter-culture generation. Most of the stories are told in first person, the narrative arc driven by interiority. In one story, ???Armadilla,??? the inner struggle of the young boy is juxtaposed with the outer struggle of the armadillo to survive the barrage of gunfire. The quick pacing is realized by short staccato words and sentences representing rapid gun fire. Anzaldua says that the struggle has always been inner, but is played out in the outer terrains. ???Armadilla??? is about a boy???s inner struggle played out on the hostile Texas landscape. The armadillo???s thick leather hide does not protect the armadillo from the boy???s bullets, and the boy???s secret does not protect him from his father???s wrath. The only story to extend beyond the scope of realism is ???The Killing Chant,??? a distortion story that explores the 1960 ???s culture of racism. Sigmund Freud claimed that distortion and disguise filled dreams, and literary texts, the unconscious wish was unacceptable and had to evade censorship. The story is about the hybrid identity of a fifteen-year-old boy who not only has Hispanic, Middle-Eastern, and African American heritage, but, most importantly, has grown flippers. What it underscores is survival in a culture of bigotry and violence. And, with the use of metaphor and symbolism, the use of provocative and uncensored colloquial language, and the taboo subject matter of pedophilia, the story becomes an honest personal attack on innate prejudice and decadence. By writing this forbidden story, and though it is one of distortion, it may well be the most truthful story in the collection. Friedrich Nietzsche said that truth was a useful illusion; one that served a fundamental drive to survive. This book is about survival and the truths told in each and every story will bring an understanding of what it takes for a boy to reach manhood, how to exist in a cross-pollination of cultures, and how to survive those cultures, especially those in a hostile world of patriarchy. Each survivor is an illusion on a landscape, a hybrid, transformed, into a product of what not only was, but, of what will be...|$|R

25|$|Misotheistic and/or dystheistic {{expression}} has a {{long history}} in the arts and in literature. Bernard Schweizer’s book Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism is devoted to this topic. He traces the history of ideas behind misotheism from the Book of Job, via Epicureanism and the twilight of Roman paganism, to deism, anarchism, Nietzschean philosophy, feminism, and radical humanism. The main literary figures in his study are Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Swinburne, <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> <b>Hurston,</b> Rebecca West, Elie Wiesel, Peter Shaffer, and Philip Pullman. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium for the expression of God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism, while ingeneously veiling their blasphemy.|$|E

25|$|Modernity and {{migration}} of black communities to the North {{has had a}} history of placing strain on the retention of black cultural practices and traditions. The urban and radically different spaces in which black culture was being produced raised fears in anthropologists and sociologists that the southern black folk aspect of black popular culture were at risk of being lost in history. The study over the fear of losing black popular cultural roots from the South have a topic of interest to many anthropologists, who among them include <b>Zora</b> <b>Neale</b> <b>Hurston.</b> Through her extensive studies of Southern folklore and cultural practices,Hustron has claimed that the popular Southern folklore traditions and practices are not dying off. Instead they are evolving, developing, and re-creating themselves in different regions.|$|E
25|$|Studying in Germany, Boas {{was awarded}} a {{doctorate}} in 1881 in physics while also studying geography. He then participated in a geographical expedition to northern Canada, where he became fascinated with the culture and language of the Baffin Island Inuit.

In 1887 he emigrated to the United States, where he first worked as a museum curator at the Smithsonian, and in 1899 became {{professor of anthropology at}} Columbia University, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} career. Through his students, many of whom went on to found anthropology departments and research programmes inspired by their mentor, Boas profoundly influenced the development of American anthropology.
