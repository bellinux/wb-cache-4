40|$|This work {{investigates the}} impact of mud from a <b>zinc-plating</b> plant and zeolite {{saturated}} with zinc on early hydration processes of ordinary Portland cement. During the first 48 hours of hydration, the addition of mud significantly affects the cement hydration kinetics. The partial replacement of cement with zeolite saturated with zinc ions, reduces {{the negative impact of}} mud on the hydration processes. Samples with the additions showed lower compressive strength than the sample without additions. With regard to the standard limits for this type of cement, mud shares are eligible up to 5 wt. % and a mixture of mud and saturated zeolite up to 10 wt. %...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} sewage in water in {{electroplating}} and galvanoplastic implies a costly cleansing {{process and the}} use of chemical products. This work tries to explain different processes to re-use rinsing water in the whole process of surface treatment, like anodizing, <b>zinc-plating,</b> nickel-plating, gold-plating, electroforming, phosphating, etc. 1. Quality control of the washing water for quantity of the water. 2. Systems for voluntary and involuntary wastage of water and the process for re-use it. Wastage can be due to evaporation, seepage, filtration, decantation, oozes, additional washing. 3. Systems for washing racionalization to reduce consumption and contamination. 4. Recovering and recycling processes by electrolysis, electrodialysis, electro-electrodialysis, inverted osmosis, ultrafiltration, evaporation, ionic interchange. 5. Baths regeneration through crystalization oxidizing, incineration, liquid interchange, liquid...|$|E
