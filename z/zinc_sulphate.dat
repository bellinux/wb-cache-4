Materials and methods: A Total of 60 patients with psoriasis vulgaris were recruited for the study during the period October 2006 to October 2007.

Results: There were 34 (56. 7 %) men and 26 (43. 3 %) women, with a male: female ratio 1. 3 : 1. Their age ranged from 15 - 70 years with a mean of 32 ± 11 years. Oral <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> produced a good response in about 60 % of the cases; with a relapse rate amounts to 58 % noticed 4 weeks after cessation of treatment. Combination of oral <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> and methotrexate induced a good response in 85 % of the patients, with a relapse rate of 59 % that was noticed 4 weeks after treatment cessation.

For estimating the cohesive energies, formal charges on the experimentally determined atomic posi-tions in the molecules of ZTS are calculated by ab initio molecular-orbital computations, with wave functions obtained by the Hartree–Fock procedure.
