5|$|The {{history of}} malaria {{stretches}} from its prehistoric origin as a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> in the primates of Africa {{through to the}} 21st century. A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak malaria infested every continent, except Antarctica. Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and medicine for hundreds of years. Since {{the discovery of the}} parasites which cause it, research attention has focused on their biology, {{as well as that of}} the mosquitoes which transmit the parasites.|$|E
5|$|While living indoors {{decreases}} {{the risk of}} contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health {{to make them more}} prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with strep throat. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{primates}} whose habitats overlap with or are encroached upon by human settlement activities, {{there is some}} risk of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> transference to individuals who come into close contact with them. One 1984 study has identified their susceptibility to malarial parasites.|$|E
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} survey utilizing semi-structured questionnaires {{was used}} to study the herdsmen and livestock farmers’ perception, attitudes and risk factors towards <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in Awka North and South Local Government Area. Data obtained were analyzed using chi-square on SPSS (Version 15. 0) at a significance level of p < 0. 05 to determine possible associations between variables and perceptions of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Out of the 384 respondents, 214 (55. 7 %) had heard about <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Avian influenza (95. 3 %), rabies (90. 9 %) and bovine tuberculosis (64. 3 %) were perceived by the respondents to be zoonotic. Viruses (82. 3 %), punishment from gods (72. 4 %) and bacteria (52. 1 %) were also perceived by the respondents as major causes of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases,</b> whereas 62 % were of the view that <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> are of no consequence. Only 26. 3 % (101) had overall knowledge of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Slaughtering of sick animals, drinking of raw milk, skin to skin contact with animals, contact with animals’ placenta, handling of animal with open wounds/cuts and keeping of pets were indicted as attitudes and risk factors of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> amongst the respondents. Significant associations (p < 0. 05) were found between perceptions/awareness of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> and age, educational status and location. In conclusion, the herdsmen and livestock farmers’ awareness/perception of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> is abysmally poor in the study area, thus public education on <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> is therefore hugely recommended...|$|R

40|$|<b>Zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> {{present an}} ongoing public health concern. Most human infections with zoonoses come from livestock, {{including}} pigs, chickens, cattle, goats, sheep and camels. Butchers constitute the high risk {{group in the}} transmission of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The educational status and awareness regarding the information, identification and transmission of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> among this high risk group, is critical in controlling the spread of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Hence, a study {{has been designed to}} evaluate the educational status, awareness among the butchers regarding the various <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> and their modes of transmission and the effluent treatment methods followed by the butchers in and around Proddatur, Andhra Pradesh. The survey revealed that 86 percent of the butchers had high school education and most of them acquired this profession from their ancestors. 60 percent of the butchers were having awareness regarding the commonly occurring <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases,</b> 81 percent of butchers identified the disease by observing the lesions and were familiar with their control. Some of the butchers follow the hygienic practices and majority of them (81. 4 %) were interested in attending training programmes pertaining to <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

25|$|Uncertainties {{have existed}} of B. {{pertussis}} and whooping cough as a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> since around 1910 {{but in the}} 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.|$|E
25|$|Zoonoses are of {{interest}} because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity.

40|$|The causative {{agents of}} <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{maintained}} in nature {{in an ongoing}} enzootic cycle between wildlife reservoirs and vectors. Over the past decade, <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in the U.

Recently, vaccines, acaricides, antibiotics, and contraceptives distributed in the landscape targeting wildlife reservoirs have been proven {{to be safe and}} effective in controlling rabies and Lyme disease in wildlife reservoirs. Furthermore, similar efforts are under research to control West Nile Virus in birds. This review is intended to explore the recent efforts to control the three major <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in the U.

40|$|Many {{factors have}} been {{mentioned}} as contributing to under-diagnosis and under-reporting of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> particularly in the sub-Sahara African region. These include poor disease surveillance coverage, poor diagnostic capacity, the geographical distribution of those most affected and lack of clear strategies to address the plight of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The current study investigates the knowledge of medical practitioners of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> as a potential contributing factor to their under-diagnosis and hence under-reporting. The study {{was designed as a}} cross-sectional survey. Semi-structured open-ended questionnaire was administered to medical practitioners to establish the knowledge of anthrax, rabies, brucellosis, trypanosomiasis, echinococcosis and bovine tuberculosis in selected health facilities within urban and rural settings in Tanzania between April and May 2005. Frequency data were analyzed using likelihood ratio chi-square in Minitab version 14 to compare practitioners' knowledge of transmission, clinical features and diagnosis of the zoonoses in the two settings. For each analysis, likelihood ratio chi-square p-value of less than 0. 05 was considered to be significant. Fisher's exact test was used where expected results were less than five. Medical practitioners in rural health facilities had poor knowledge of transmission of sleeping sickness and clinical features of anthrax and rabies in humans compared to their urban counterparts. In both areas the practitioners had poor knowledge of how echinococcosis is transmitted to humans, clinical features of echinococcosis in humans, and diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans. Knowledge of medical practitioners of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> could be a contributing factor to their under-diagnosis and under-reporting in Tanzania. Refresher courses on <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> should be conducted particularly to practitioners in rural areas. More emphasis should be put on <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in teaching curricula of medical practitioners' training institutions in Tanzania to improve the diagnosis, reporting and control of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Veterinary and medical collaboration should be strengthened to enable more effective control of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in Tanzania...|$|R
25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different zoonotic pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter. The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> linked to the rat is the foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
25|$|Dogs {{are known}} to be {{susceptible}} to L. donovani infection. Especially in the New World, infection is a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease,</b> involving different canine species, including domestic dog and the two fox species, Lycalopex vetulus and Cerdocyon thous. In the Mediterranean region domestic dogs and the three fox species Vulpes vulpes, V. corsac and V. zerda are common reservoir hosts. In Africa and Brazil, some marsupials and rodents are also reported to harbour L. donovani.|$|E
25|$|Major modern {{diseases}} such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> transmitted to humans {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, though it has now evolved to a separate human-only disease. Most strains of influenza that infect humans are human diseases, although many strains of swine and bird flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu. Taenia solium infection is one of the neglected tropical diseases with public health and veterinary concern in endemic regions. Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. Most human diseases originated in animals; however, only diseases that routinely involve animal to human transmission, like rabies, are considered direct zoonosis.|$|E

This is highlighted {{by the fact that}} visitors to the zoos are increasing year by year and they generate sizeable revenue. Veterinary professionals play a pivotal role in health management of wild animals in zoos {{and biological}} parks. Since veterinarians work in close contact with wild animals, there is a potential risk of transmission of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> from wild animals to humans and vice versa. There are approximately 1415 infectious agents causing diseases in humans, out of which 868 (61 %) are known to be zoonotic in nature.

40|$|Introduction Forestry {{workers and}} other people who come into close contact with wild animals, such as hunters, natural science researchers, game {{managers}} or mushroom/berry pickers, {{are at risk of}} contracting bacterial, parasitological or viral <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Synthetic data on the incidence and prevalence of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in both animals and humans in European forests do not exist. It is therefore difficult to promote appropriate preventive measures among workers or people who come into direct or indirect contact with forest animals. Objectives The objectives of this review are to synthesise existing knowledge on the prevalence of the three predominant bacterial <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in Europe, i. e. Lyme borreliosis, tularemia and leptospirosis, in order to draw up recommendations for occupational or public health. Material and Methods 88 papers published between 1995 – 2013 (33 on Lyme borreliosis, 30 on tularemia and 25 on leptospirosis) were analyzed. Conclusions The prevalences of these three <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> are not negligible and information targeting the public is needed. Moreover, the results highlight the lack of standardised surveys among different European countries. It was also noted that epidemiological data on leptospirosis are very scarce...|$|R
