40|$|Zinc as a {{nutrition}} {{element is}} required to plants in small quantities to maintain normal functions of metabolism mechanisms. Our work analyses the efficiency of red clovers “Arimaičiai” for cleaning zinc from the soil contaminated with zinc under laboratory conditions. Seeds were sown in three differently polluted soils: clean soil, once contaminated with zinc and periodically contaminated with zinc soil. Zinc concentration in one time contaminated soil was 45 mg/kg. After 6 months of phytoremediation, the remained zinc concentration in the soil was 3 times lower comparing with the initial concentration. It was also determined that under such conditions, the uptake of red clovers made approximately 65 % of zinc. Permanent soil contamination with zinc increased concentration before phytoremediation up to 80 mg/kg. After 6 months of phytoremediation, zinc concentration {{was determined to be}} 1. 9 times lower. Otherwise, the soil was permanently contaminated with larger zinc quantities and after application of which reached 300 mg/kg. In this case, following half a year of phytoremediation, zinc concentration in the soil was 1. 7 times lower comparing with the initial concentration after contamination. It was determined that the uptake of red clovers made approximately 17 % of <b>zinc.</b> <b>Article</b> in Lithuanian</p...|$|E

50|$|A {{critical}} step {{in improving the}} pace of updating and improving entries was {{to open up the}} functional annotation of Pfam domains to the Wikipedia community in release 26.0. For entries that already had a Wikipedia entry, this was linked into the Pfam page, and for those that did not, the community were invited to create one and inform the curators, in order for it to be linked in. It is anticipated that while community involvement will greatly improve the level of annotation of these families, some will remain insufficiently notable for inclusion in Wikipedia, in which case they will retain their original Pfam description. Some Wikipedia articles cover multiple families, such as the <b>Zinc</b> finger <b>article.</b> An automated procedure for generating articles based on InterPro and Pfam data has also been implemented, which populates a page with information and links to databases as well as available images, then once an article has been reviewed by a curator it is moved from the Sandbox to Wikipedia proper. In order to guard against vandalism of articles, each Wikipedia revision is reviewed by curators before it is displayed on the Pfam website. Almost all cases of vandalism have been corrected by the community before they reach curators, however.|$|R

Well-aligned and long ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays, {{as well as}} leaf-like ZnO nanostructures (which consist of modulated and single-phase structures), were fabricated by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method without {{the assistance of a}} catalyst. On the other hand, needle-like ZnO NW arrays were first fabricated with the CVD process followed by chemical etching of the NW arrays. The use of chemical etching provides a low-cost and convenient method of obtaining the needle-like arrays. In addition, the field emission properties of the different ZnO NW arrays were also investigated where some differences in the turn-on field and the field-enhancement factors were observed for the ZnO nanostructures of different lengths and shapes. It was experimentally observed that the leaf-like ZnO nanostructure is most suitable for field emission due to its lowest turn-on and threshold field as well as its high field-enhancement factor among the different synthesized nanostructures.|$|R

40|$|Heavy metals are {{the second}} major {{environmental}} pollutants. Especially toxic is lead, increased content of which {{in the body of}} a pregnant determines the development of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum period complications and is potentiated by deficiency of essential trace elements - <b>zinc</b> and copper. <b>Article</b> presents the results of impact of solutions of lead acetate and citrate in experimental models. Solutions of metals were injected into the stomach through a tube once a day during 19 days of pregnancy in the dose of 0, 05 mg/kg in the form of inorganic compound - lead acetate and in organic form – lead citrate. The content of trace elements - lead, cadmium, copper and zinc were determined by stripping voltamperometry. In addition, indices of placental and fetal accumulation, as well as index of transplacental migration were calculated. Effect of lead during pregnancy in all biosubstrates is increased by 1, 3 - 1, 9 times as compared with the control group. This causes imbalance of essential trace elements due to significant reduction in zinc content in all the studied biological substrates. Prolonged contact with lead during pregnancy leads to disruption of placenta, inability of the placenta to fully protect the fetus from excessive intranatal influence of xenobiotics...|$|R
5000|$|Affected objects {{may show}} surface {{irregularities}} such as small cracks and fractures, blisters or pitting. Over time, the material slowly expands, cracking, buckling and warping in an irreversible process {{that makes the}} object exceedingly brittle and prone to fracture, and can eventually shatter the object, destroying it altogether. Due to the expansion process, attached normal material may also be damaged. The occurrence and severity of <b>zinc</b> pest in <b>articles</b> made of susceptible zinc alloys depends both on the concentration of lead impurities in the metal and on the storage conditions of the article in the ensuing decades. Zinc pest is dreaded by collectors of vintage die-cast model trains, toys, or radios, because rare or otherwise valuable items can inescapably be rendered worthless as the process of zinc pest destroys them. Because castings of the same object were usually made from various batches of metal over the production process, some examples of a given toy or model may survive today completely unaffected, while other identical examples may have completely disintegrated. Since the 1940s, some model railroad hobbyists have claimed, {{with varying degrees of}} success, that a method of [...] "pickling" [...] zinc alloy parts by soaking them in vinegar or oxalic acid solution for several minutes before painting and assembling them could prevent or delay the effects of zinc pest.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} <b>article.</b> <b>Zinc</b> oxide, ZnO, is an {{important}} material for wide range of optoelectronic device applications. Especially, ZnO is famous with its large exciton binding energy of 60 meV {{which makes it a}} good candidate for ultraviolet light emitting diodes and lasers. Moreover, its high carrier mobility and wide band gap of 3. 37 eV (368 nm) makes it a promising material for transparent electronics and UV photodetectors. However, ZnO has crystallographic defect states (e. g. oxygen vacancies, zinc interstitials) which degrade the performance of ZnO based LEDs, lasers and UV photodiodes. In this thesis, ZnO based photo-thin-film-transistors (photo-TFTs) with visible light response by using their defect states to absorb subbandgap photons are investigated. The design, fabrication and characterization of ZnO based photoTFTs are presented. A photo-TFT is a three-terminal optoelectronic device that is a photoconductor structure with an additional gate terminal which actively tunes electrical and optical properties of photoconductive material. In a clean room environment, ZnO based photo-TFTs with various device sizes are fabricated at different ZnO channel layer deposition temperatures (ranging from 80 to 250 °C). Initially, TFT characteristics of fabricated devices are characterized to show that the gate terminal dynamically modulates ZnO’s channel conductivity. Moreover, the effects of the device size and the deposition temperature on device performance are investigated. Then, the optical characterization of ZnO film deposited at 250 ° C is conducted via absorption and photoluminescence measurements in order to investigate its visible light absorption characteristics and the energy levels of its defect states in the forbidden band gap of ZnO. After that, the responsivity measurements are reported from ZnO based photo-TFTs fabricated at 250 °C and the active tuning mechanism of visible light photoresponse is discussed. Finally, the effects of the deposition temperature and the device size on the visible light responsivity are presented. Oralli, SinemM. S...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The Mahour {{exploration}} {{area is a}} polymetallic system containing copper, zinc and silver. The mineralization {{can be seen in}} {{two forms}} of veins and disseminations. This area is structurally within the Lut block, west of Deh-salm Village. Recent exploration work and studies carried out by geologists on this volcanic-plutonic area of Lut demonstate its importance indicating new reserves of copper, gold, and lead and <b>zinc.</b> Several <b>articles</b> have been published on the Mahour deposit in recent years, including work on fluid inclusions (Mirzaei et al., 2012 a; Mirzaei et al., 2012 b). The present report aims at completion of previous studies on Mahour. During the course of this research, the IP/RS geophysical methods were used to locate the extent and depth of sulfide veins in order to locate drill sites. The IP/RS method has been used extensively worldwide in locating sulfide mineralization at deposits such as Olympic Dam in Australia (Esdale et al., 1987), Hishikari epithermal gold deposit in Kagoshima, Japan (Okada, 1995) and Cadia-Ridgeway copper and gold deposit in New South Wales, Australia (Rutley et al., 2001). Materials and Methods 1. Determination of mineralogy of ore and alteration by examination of 70 thin sections and 45 polished sections. 2. Compilation of geological and mineralization maps of the studied area at a scale of 1 : 1000. 3. Geological, alteration, mineralization and trace element geochemical studies of 6 drill holes. 4. IP/RS measurements for 2585 points on a rectangular grid with profile intervals of 50 meters and electrode intervals of 20 meters. 5. Interpretation of IP/RS results. Discussion The Mahour area is covered by a volcanic sequence of basalt, andesite, dacite, rhyolite and pyro-clastics. During the Late Eocene through Early Oligocene this volcanic complex was intruded by several diorite and quartz-diorite bodies, which were responsible for mineralization of the area. Mineralized veins hosted by dacite show NNE trends with 85 t 0 90 ° dips, and which are accompanied by argillic, silicic, quartz-sericite-pyrite and propylitic alteration zones. The primary minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, tetrahedrite, and quartz along with supergene minerals such as malachite, atacamite, azurite and goethite. High anomalies of copper (up to 103062 ppm), zinc (up to 213520 ppm) and silver (up to 1988 ppm) are present in the studied area. The IP/RS surveys were carried out on profiles perpendicular to the veins. The chargeability levels reached 40 msce, indicating the presence of sulfide minerals in the area. Two especially anomalous resistivity zones, high and low, were detected within the deposit. The high resistivity zone, up to 350 ohm. m, occurs along geophysical profiles in association with less-crushed zones, whereas the low anomaly zone is related to highly crushed zones. The geophysical anomalies agree with drilling results indicating zones of highest mineralization. Results Generally, the chargeability surveys have clearly revealed two anomalous zones: one in the northeast and the other in the southwest of the studied area. Six holes have been drilled through these anomalous zones and geochemical samples taken at intervals of 1 meter in each hole. Most of the anomalies are associated with quartz-sericite-pyrite, silicification and chloritic alteration as well as the intense distribution of secondary iron oxides. Geochemical results from the drill holes show the highest anomalies as follows: GBH- 1, 78 - 92 m, 246 - 281 m GBH- 3 20 - 40 m and 133 - 152 m GBH- 7 20 - 32 m and 57 - 65 m PB- 1 85 - 94 m. and 133 - 140 m PD- 1. 50 - 55 m, 298 - 301 m and 360 - 365 m PA- 1 48 - 57 m, 152 - 161 m and 212 - 218 m References Esdale, D.
