Optical detection of second harmonic Rayleigh waves by means of a heterodyne laser interferometer has advantages over traditional detection techniques such as contact transducers. Laser detection is a non-contact point measurement, which provides absolute readings of the surface displacements and the particle velocity of the Rayleigh surface waves. Frequency or phase modulation of the laser is caused by the Doppler effect on the velocity and displacement amplitudes of a vibrating specimen. This modulation can be recovered with suitable demodulators. This research explores digital demodulation techniques and their effects on higher harmonic measurements.
