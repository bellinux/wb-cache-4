40|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) {{consists}} of two facilities, LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO) and LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Gravitational-wave astronomy began when LIGO observed gravitational-waves {{for the first time}} in 2015 during the inaugural observation run (01) of the advanced detector era. Isolation of LIGO detectors from seismic noise is necessary to achieve a desired level of performance. Analysis of seismic noise is essential to make improvements in seismic isolation, and to validate gravitational-wave candidates with a high degree of certainty. Hourly trends of seismic noise in the 0. 1 – 0. 3 Hz frequency band from Guralp CMG- 40 T three-axis seismometers located at LHO’s Corner Station (CS), End Station-X (EX), and End Station-Y (EY) were analyzed over a three year period, 2014 through 2016. Seismic noise in the 0. 1 – 0. 3 Hz band is primarily attributed to the microseismic peak caused by pressure exerted on the ocean floor by ocean waves and deep-sea storms. The 01 50 % threshold for this band was determined by the percentage of hours that laser lock in LHO’s gravitational-wave detector was maintained when ground velocity exceeded given thresholds ranging from 0. 1 – 2 μm/s during the 01 observation run. No significant differences in ground motion were observed between hours of the day, days of the week, or between stations. Average ground motion was about four times greater during December than during summer months. Greater ground motion occurred in the <b>z</b> <b>direction</b> (<b>vertical)</b> than in the horizontal directions (x and y) at all three stations, with no significant difference between the x and y directions. In winter months, ground motion in the <b>z</b> <b>direction</b> was about 1. 4 times the motion in the horizontal axes. Our results suggest that the microseismic peak may contribute to difficulties maintaining laser lock in 40 times as many hours in December as in summer months...|$|R

A nozzle protrudes from below into a drawing nozzle, via which the air is blown into the glass tube. The nozzle also holds the drawing onion {{so that it does}} not move out laterally. Since the quality and drawing speed achieved during the vertical tube drawing process are relatively low, this process has nowadays almost no practical significance.|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{objective}} of the thesis is {{to see how the}} effect of water is displacing the oil through gravel pack. Experimental solutions have been developed for displacement performance of two vertical displacements and one horizontal. The two vertical displacements were done to calculate the absolute permeability, relative permeabilities and saturations. Production performance and displacement efficiency was also determined to find out the recovery of the vertical displacement. The horizontal displacement was performed to see the occurrence of viscous fingering. It was assumed that after a certain time, water started to cone upwards towards the well and entered the gravel pack. Then the experimental part was to see on how the water was fingering through the gravel pack. Viscous fingering appeared in both horizontal and vertical displacement. The vertical displacement was also affected by gravity segregation. This was because the displacing water is denser than the displaced oil and the displacing <b>direction</b> is <b>vertical</b> <b>upwards.</b> Two models have been designed for modeling the gravel pack. The original model was based on experimental setup of the formation and the gravel pack, to see water coning effect in gravel pack. The revised model is the horizontal model used for experimental visualization of the water flow through gravel pack...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{direction}} dependency of tool-workpiece compliance {{of machine}} tool {{was investigated in}} three dimensions. The tool-workpiece compliance {{is defined as the}} frequency response of the relative displacement between the tool and the workpiece to the cutting force. The tool-workpiece compliance of a vertical type machining center was measured. The direction dependency of the compliance magnitude was discussed using the polar plot. The compliance in the <b>Z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>direction</b> was smaller than that in the XY (horizontal) directions. The maximum value of the compliance in the X direction was almost twice as large as those in the Y and <b>Z</b> <b>directions.</b> The influence of the frequency on the direction dependency was also discussed. The direction dependency in the XY plane was small in the frequency range higher than 250 Hz. This {{can be explained by the}} symmetry of the spindle about the X and Y directions because the tool-workpiece relative displacement was dominated by the tool displacement in the high frequency range...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} to the measurement of nanofriction, and demonstrate {{the application of the}} method by measurement of the coefficient of friction for diamondlike carbon (DLC) on DLC, Si on DLC, and Si on Si surfaces. The technique employs an atomic force microscope in a mode in which the tip moves only in the <b>z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>direction</b> and the sample surface is sloped. As the tip moves vertically on the sloped surface, lateral tip slipping occurs, allowing the cantilever vertical deflection and the frictional (lateral) force to be monitored as a function of tip vertical deflection. The advantage of the approach is that cantilever calibration to obtain its spring constants is not necessary. Using this method, the authors have measured friction coefficients, for load range 0 < L M 6 mu N, of 0. 047 +/- 0. 002 for Si on Si, 0. 0173 +/- 0. 0009 for Si on DLC, and 0. 0080 +/- 0. 0005 for DLC on DLC. For load range 9 < L < 13 mu N, the DLC on DLC coefficient of friction increased to 0. 051 +/- 0. 003. (C) 2008 American Vacuum Society...|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} of mining machine cables in underground coal mines {{has been identified}} as a particularly stressful task and is a likely contributor to low back pain. In this experiment, seven experienced miners performed a cable pulling task while ground reaction forces and cable tension were measured. The independent variables were two levels of cable resistance (low and high) and lifting conditions (kneeling under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 2 meter [48 inch] roof, stooping under a 1. 5 meter [60 inch] roof, and unrestricted standing). The dependent variables were the peak values of the following: actual tension measured in the cable, ground reaction forces in the X (anterior), Y (lateral), and <b>Z</b> (<b>vertical)</b> <b>directions</b> and the magnitude of the resultant force vector. Work posture significantly affected the peak ground reaction forces in the Y-direction. The Y-forces were highest in the kneeling condition, indicating that there is less postural stability when performing cable pulling tasks in a kneeling posture. Thus, there may be a greater likelihood of injury in this posture. Additionally, biomechanical stresses which contribute to musculoskeletal injury may be greater in the kneeling posture...|$|R

Particularly in cases where the pressure distribution is resolved with too few measurement points, the results of the integration depend strongly on the integration technique used. The code can perform the following common tasks: • Integration of finely-distributed pressure distributions from CFD • Automatic reduction of finely-distributed pressure distributions from CFD to experimentally-measured pressure-tap positions and comparison with the original data • Integration of experimental pressure distributions • Handling of special cases: Pressure distributions without leading edge and trailing edge pressure sensors, scaling and translation of airfoil position, handling of geodesic (reversed) coordinate system. • Two simple sorting algorithms are implemented, which can deal with some simple cases. • A block-data mode is implemented which allows the sorting of large numbers (millions) of pressure distributions in acceptable time...|$|R
