The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. <b>Zeolite</b> sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} are very abundant in earth, both {{being among the}} ten most common elements in Earth's crust; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, nitratine, and <b>zeolite.</b> Many of these solid deposits occur {{as a result of}} ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as Utah's Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{evaluation}} of the performance of two <b>zeolites</b> with different structures (FAU and MFI) and acidity properties in the biosorption of Cr(VI) and catalytic oxidation of ethyl acetate. The starting <b>zeolites,</b> Y (FAU) and ZSM 5 (MFI), were modified by ion exchange treatments with NaNO 3 in order to obtain <b>zeolites</b> with different acidity and sodium content. A biosorption system consisting of a bacterium, Arthrobacter viscosus, supported on the different <b>zeolites</b> was used for Cr(VI) reduction and removal from solution [1]. The best removal efficiencies and uptake of chromium, above 90 % and 14 mgCr/gzeolite respectively, were achieved for Y <b>zeolites</b> due to their higher ion exchange capacity in comparison with ZSM 5 <b>zeolites.</b> The ion exchange treatment did not produce considerable changes on the uptake process performed by the modified <b>zeolites.</b> Y and ZSM 5 <b>zeolites</b> were characterized by ICPAES, SEM, NH 3 chemisorption, XRD and N 2 adsorption. Y and ZSM 5 <b>zeolites</b> obtained after biosorption presented chromium loadings between 0. 92 and 1. 20 %, and were successfully reused as catalysts in the oxidation of ethyl acetate [2]. The chromium-loaded ZSM 5 <b>zeolites</b> were considerably more active and selective towards CO 2 than chromium-loaded Y <b>zeolites,</b> essentially due to their different framework structure, textural and acidity properties.

50|$|Copper based type Y <b>zeolites</b> {{were first}} {{described}} {{as a means of}} hydrocracking in a patent filed in 1963, and were soon implemented in industrial hydrocracking processes.

In 1972, a patent was filed describing the production of Cu-Y <b>zeolites</b> from sodium-based <b>zeolites,</b> helping to further spread its use in the industry. The first documented use of Cu-Y <b>zeolites</b> for desulfurization was in 1977, in which a variety of <b>zeolites</b> including the Cu-Y variant were used to remove hydrogen sulfide from gases.

30|$|<b>Zeolites</b> are {{interesting}} materials for {{immobilization of enzymes}} due to their high surface area and participation in different interactions - hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and electrostatic. On the other hand, <b>zeolites</b> do not contain chemically active groups (until such groups are added deliberately) that can damage enzymes, and, generally, <b>zeolites</b> are low toxic [5]. After synthesis, <b>zeolites</b> can be modified to improve adsorption [6, 7]. Adsorption of enzymes on <b>zeolites</b> is a mild method of immobilization, which retains the enzyme activity. Thus, adsorption can be successfully used for immobilization of unstable enzymes. The most significant disadvantage of all adsorption methods is instability and gradual leaking of enzymes into the working solution [8, 9].
