25|$|Because of this, <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> bonds {{subject to}} U.S. {{taxation}} should generally {{be held in}} tax-deferred retirement accounts, to avoid paying taxes on future income.

40|$|The no {{arbitrage}} {{conditions are}} derived in the explicit {{form for the}} market, where the <b>zero</b> <b>coupons</b> bonds of various maturities are accessible for the investors to draw up the portfolios. It is supposed, that the investor at any moment of time has a possibility to make the self-financed portfolio of given value. It is considered that the processes of the short interest rate and rates of inflation follow the stochastic differential equations. The known result for a portfolio with two assets is extended on case of any number of assets and inflation. The no arbitrage condition for multi-factor models of a term structure of the interest rates is considered. The condition of existence of a risk free self-financed portfolio is obtained at first, and then for want of it fulfillment the no arbitrage condition is derived...|$|R
40|$|Life {{insurance}} {{rating is}} mainly {{based on two}} principles: discounting effect and mortality risk. The traditional way to price these contracts was to use a constant discount rate and a fixed life table. Nevertheless, evidences show that neither financial conditions nor mortality figures remain constant. If financial uncertainty is nowadays fully accepted and modelled quite a lot, longevity risk must be also considered and is of first importance for actuaries, especially in fair valuation of life insurance with profit. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a model taking into account simultaneously financial and longevity risks and to apply it to the valuation of life insurance contracts with a participation scheme based on the global profit of the insurer. In particular, we show that a life insurance contract with global participation can be seen as a portfolio of <b>zero</b> <b>coupons</b> and Margrabe options...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an alternative test of the rational expectations theory of the term structure of interest rates. Other researchers have also examined the validity of the expectations hypothesis of term structure. While there is more often rejection of the expectations hypothesis, no other theory (data-consistent with the entire yield curve) provides an empirically adequate explanation of this phenomenon. The study considers postwar US pure discount (<b>zero</b> <b>coupons)</b> bond yields with various maturities, from one month to 60 months. Based on the ex post formation of rational expectations, the expectations error is quantified and the level of truth of the expectations hypothesis tested, that is, the strength of the departure of the yield curve from the expectations theory. The results suggest that a significant amount of information available at no cost to market agents is not incorporated in forming people's expectations. ...|$|R
25|$|For a {{zero-coupon bond}} {{such as a}} US {{treasury}} bill, an annual effective discount rate may be specified instead of an effective interest rate, because <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> bonds trade at a discount from their face value.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>coupon</b> bonds {{were first}} {{introduced}} in the 1960s, {{but they did not}} become popular until the 1980s. The use of these instruments was aided by an anomaly in the US tax system, which allowed for deduction of the discount on bonds relative to their par value. This rule ignored the compounding of interest and led to significant tax-savings when the interest is high or the security has long maturity. Although the tax loopholes were closed quickly, the bonds themselves are desirable because of their simplicity.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 a {{group of}} {{derivatives}} traders led by Olivier Doria (then head of swaps at Deutsche Bank) and Michele Faissola, contributed to {{an extension of the}} swap yield curves in all the major European currencies. Until then the market would give prices until 15 years maturities. The team extended the maturity of European yield curves up to 50 years (for the lira, French franc, Deutsche mark, Danish krone and many other currencies including the ecu). This innovation was a major contribution towards the issuance of long dated <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> bonds and the creation of long dated mortgages.|$|E
40|$|Many {{continuous}} time term {{structure of}} interest rate models assume a factor structure where the drift and volatility functions are affine {{functions of the}} state variable process. These models involve very specific parametric choices of factors and functional specifications of the drift and volatility. Morevoer, under the affine term structure restrictions not all factors necessarily affect interest rates at all maturities simultaneously. This class of so called affine models covers {{a wide variety of}} existing empirical as well as theoretical models in the literature. In this paper we take a very agnostic approach to the specification of these diffusion functions and test implications of the affine term structure restrictions. We do not test a specific model among the class of affine models per se. Instead, the affine term structure restrictions we test are based on the derivatives of the responses of interest rates to the factors. We also test how many and which factors affect a particular rate. These tests are conducted within a framework which models interest rates as functions of fundamental factors, and the responses of interest rates to these factors are estimated with non-parametric methods. We consider two sets of factors, one based on key macroeconomic variables, and one based on interest rate spreads. In general, despite their common use we find that the empirical evidence does not support the restrictions imposed by affine models. Besides testing the affine structure restrictions we also uncover a set of fundamental factors which appear remarkably robust in explaining interest rate dynamics at the long and short maturities we consider. Nous étudions les modèles de strucutreà terme des taux d'intérêt. Nous nous penchons plus particulièrement sur une classe de modèles avec structure affinée. Cette classe contient une grande partie des modèles théoriques et pratiques recensés dans la littérature. Nous proposons des tests pour les restrictions imposées par la structure affinée. En utilisant des méthodes semi-paramétriques, nous arrivonsà dériver ces tests sous hypothèses très faibles sur la forme fonctionnelle du processus des facteurs et la forme des relations affinées. Nous introduisons l'estimateur de la dérivée moyenne qui est adaptéà un contexte de séries temporelles. Les résultats empiriques indiquent que les restrictions de la structure affinée sont fortement rejetées par les données.

2500|$|Arbitrage {{arguments}} ("Rational pricing") apply {{when the}} deliverable asset exists in plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created. Here, the forward price represents the expected future value of the underlying discounted at the risk free rate—as any deviation from the theoretical price will afford investors a riskless profit opportunity and should be arbitraged away. We define the forward price to be the strike K such that the contract has 0 value at the present time. Assuming interest rates are constant the forward price of the futures {{is equal to the}} forward price of the forward contract with the same strike and maturity. It is also the same if the underlying asset is uncorrelated with interest rates. Otherwise the difference between the forward price on the futures (futures price) and forward price on the asset, is proportional to the covariance between the underlying asset price and interest rates. For example, a futures on a <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> bond will have a futures price lower than the forward price. This is called the futures [...] "convexity correction." ...|$|E
