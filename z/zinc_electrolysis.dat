40|$|Before <b>zinc</b> <b>electrolysis,</b> {{zinc powder}} {{is added to}} the zinc {{sulphate}} electrolyte solution to facilitate the removal of harmful metallic ions. This purification process can be modeled by a time delay differential equation. Since some of the parameters in this model are unknown, zinc powder is normally added excessively. We use an optimization technique to estimate the unknown parameters from experimental data. Then, we formulate an optimal control problem to minimize the amount of zinc powder added. We solve this optimal control problem numerically by using the control parametrization method. The results indicate that the amount of zinc powder added can be decreased, on average, by approximately 7 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of arsenic in zinc sulphide concentrates is particularly harmful, because it creates problems in <b>zinc</b> <b>electrolysis.</b> The {{main source of}} arsenic in non-ferrous metallurgy is arsenopyrite (FeAsS). In oxidative roasting of zinc concentrates, FeAsS oxidizes to arsenic oxides (As 2 O 3, As 2 O 5). In this connection a natural FeAsS was examined, and also the distribution of arsenic in {{the products of the}} roasting process, the cycle of sulphuric acid obtaining and the leaching of zinc calcine were studied. The arsenic contamination of soils in the vicinity of nonferrous metals smelter KCM SA, Plovdiv, Bulgaria as a result of zinc and lead productions has been studied...|$|E
40|$|The hydrometallurgical {{treatment}} of zinc sulde concentrates involves {{the separation of}} zinc from iron, since most zinc concentrates contain 5 - 12 % iron. Several processes, such as hematite, magnetite, goethite and jarosite, {{have been developed for}} the removal of iron from solution prior to <b>zinc</b> <b>electrolysis.</b> The precipitation of iron is controlled by a set of thermodynamic and kinetic factors operative both in iron solutions and in precipitates. Identifying these factors and their relations is important for the control of these processes. Inbrief, thermodynamic stability regions of iron compounds formed during the jarosite and goethite processes, which are commercially used in the zinc industry, are outlined in this paper...|$|E

5000|$|Experimental {{attempts}} to extract <b>zinc</b> via <b>electrolysis</b> {{begun in the}} 19th century, but the only commercially successful application before 1913 was a process, used in Great Britain and Austria, where zinc and chlorine were co-produced by electrolysis of an aqueous zinc chloride solution. [...] The Anaconda Copper Company, at Anaconda, Montana, and the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, at Trail, British Columbia, both built successful electrolytic plants in 1915 using the currently used zinc sulfate process. [...] This method has continued to grow in importance and in 1975 accounted for 68% of world zinc production.|$|R
40|$|The {{recycling}} of spent batteries and recovery of metals from them {{is of great}} scientific and economic interest, on account of recycling requirement of these wastes and recovery of valuable materials (De Michellis et al., 2007). Usage of recycled materials is diminishing the energy consumption and pollution. It {{is important that the}} recycling process to be environmentally friendly, practical and cost-effective. Tests for the process of manganese removal from spent battery leaching solutions, with ammonium peroxodisulfate, prior to recovery of <b>zinc</b> by <b>electrolysis</b> are presented. The experiments were carried out according to a 23 full factorial design as a function of ammonium peroxodisulfate concentration, temperature and pH. Because the excessive manganese in the spent batteries leach solutions can cause problems in the process of Zn recovery by electrolysis the main focus of this study is the manganese removal without altering the concentration of zinc in solutions. Data from XRF and AAS during the reaction at different time are presented. Manganese is obtained with high extraction degree as MnO 2, which is economic and commercial important with applications in battery industry, water treatment plants, steel industry and chemicals (Pagnanelli et al., 2007). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out on the extraction yields of Zn after 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h of reaction. The preliminary results denoted that by chemical oxidation with ammonium peroxodisulfate is a suitable method for manganese removal as MnO 2 prior <b>zinc</b> recovery by <b>electrolysis,</b> from spent batteries solutions and it could be used in a plant for recycling batteries...|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{electrowinning}} {{is performed}} with {{the application of a}} current through insoluble electrodes (Pb - Ag), causing the electrolysis of zinc sulfate, with or without impurities, and zinc deposition on the cathode of aluminum. The impurities can reduce the current efficiency and increase the energy consumption in <b>zinc</b> <b>electrolysis.</b> In this work, the effect of nickel and magnesium on zinc electrodeposition was studied using the electrochemical techniques of galvanostatic deposition and cyclic voltammetry. Additions of nickel, magnesium or both cations in zinc sulfate electrolyte resulted in a marginal increase in current efficiency. Addition of nickel or magnesium polarizes the cathode; however, the extent of polarization in the presence of magnesium is more than that of nickel. Addition of magnesium to the zinc electrolyte caused zinc reduction at a more negative potential. The addition of nickel to the zinc electrolyte increased the current density of the anodic peaks, thus increasing the dissolution of zinc and hydrogenated phases. The addition of nickel to the zinc and magnesium solutions decreased the nucleation loop, facilitating zinc deposition...|$|E
40|$|Mitrovica had {{the largest}} metallurgic and mining complex (Trepca) in Europe which {{commenced}} activities in 1993 with the extraction of lead, cadmium and zinc. Many industrial plants existed in the complex such as lead smelter, fertilizer production plant, refinery, battery factory, <b>zinc</b> <b>electrolysis</b> facility and a sulfuric acid plant. The significant amount of heavy metal pollutants were released to the surrounding area including populated residential areas and therefore associated with human health risk. The minority communities in three refugee camps in Mitrovica, Kosovo have been significantly exposed to environmental lead originated from large-scale mining and smelting industries since 1999. Even the smelter was closed down in 2000 by United Nations but the impacts of the abandoned mining dumps, tailing dams are still left behind. The initial risk assessment by WHO in 2004 indicated children’s blood lead levels in these communities are dangerously high. Soil contamination due to historical and ongoing pollution from these complexes is also considered as a key source of exposure. A systematic investigation for the soil contamination by lead and other heavy metals was performed in year 2006. Most soil samples contain significantly high lead amount exceeding the US Environmental Protection Agency standard of 400 mg kg- 1. The highest amount of lead, 151, 000 mg kg- 1 with the average of 134, 000 mg kg- 1 {{was found in the}} sample close to the former smelter. Soil lead existed as relatively high amount of bioavailability fraction which may be confirmed with the recent study that no lead bearing phases coul...|$|E
40|$|The {{detrimental}} {{effect of the}} presence of cobalt upon the current efficiency, in the commercial production of <b>zinc</b> by <b>electrolysis,</b> has been recognized for some time. Most authorities differ upon the maximum amount of cobalt allowable. This {{is due to the fact}} that the presence of other impurities either increases or diminishes the {{detrimental effect}}s of the cobalt. The following tests were made with the object in view of ascertaining the relation, if any, between the amount of cobalt present and the current efficiency during the electrolysis of an otherwise pure zinc sulfate solution. The results obtained from these observations indicate that there is little apparent relation between the cobalt concentration of a given solution of zinc sulfate and the current efficiency that may be obtained on the electrolysis of that solution. For certain cobalt concentrations, however, it was noted that the time factor played an important part...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{a method of}} obtaining highly {{dispersed}} <b>zinc</b> powders by <b>electrolysis</b> and comparison of the properties of zinc-rich compositions prepared using as a pigment zinc powders obtained by different methods is provided. Conducted measurements {{have shown that the}} electrical conductivity of zinc-rich coatings comprising electrolytic zinc powder does not inferior to the conductivity of the film with PZHD- 0 powder obtained by the  evaporation-condensation method, despite the significant difference in the amount of zinc pigment. On the basis of the received data one can conclude that the use of electrolytic zinc powder as a pigment will significantly save zinc...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of hydrometallurgical research carried out from September 16, 1985 to June 30, 1986 on metals recovery from complex sulfide ores from the Delta deposit near Tok, Alaska. The leaching characteristics performed for 6 different ore samples indicate that the most valuable components form the following order: Zn > Au > Pb > Ag > Cu > So. Further study demonstrates that direct leaching of the ore is effective both in chloride as well [...] as in sulfate oxidizing solutions coupled with separating of leached solid components by flotation. Three variants of the ore processing with ferric chloride or fenic sulfate leaching are analyzed: one flowsheet with direct ore leaching in ferric chloride solution followed by leaching-flotation step, with subsequent zinc separation in a solvent extraction step and electrolysis in chloride solution; and two flowsheets of direct ore leaching with ferric sulfate solution followed by a leaching-flotation step, with <b>zinc</b> sulfate <b>electrolysis</b> and other metals recovery in chloride leaching sreps. In two last flowsheets silver is recovered during the chloride leaching steps and gold h m flotation products during the cyanide leaching. Preliminary economic and technical evaluation is presented. The engineering study on apparatus for the fast leaching- flotation processing and on better accumulation of gold and silver in one semi-product are concluded for the next year of research...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} nickel {{impurity}} in zinc sulfate electrowinning solutions was studied using voltammetry techniques. The reactions occurring {{at various points}} on the polarization curve are proposed and comparisons made for both pure electrolyte and those containing nickel. A nickel-activated hydrogen evolution peak was found to occur at low current densities during the anodic sweep portion of the curve, the height of which {{was found to be}} proportional to the nickel concentration i solution. The influence of certain operating parameters such as zinc ion concentration, potential scan limit, and scan rate on the nickel activated peak was also determined. The pr imary industrial process for the production of metallic <b>zinc</b> is the <b>electrolysis</b> of acid sulfate solutions containing approximately 60 g/l iter zinc ion and 200 g/l i ter H 2 SO 4 (1, 2). Zinc has a rather negative poten-tial ( [...] 0. 76 V vs. SHE) but it also exhibits a high hy...|$|R
500|$|Europium is {{associated}} with the other rare-earth elements and is, therefore, mined together with them. Separation of the rare-earth elements {{is a step in the}} later processing. Rare-earth elements are found in the minerals bastnäsite, loparite-(Ce), xenotime, and monazite in mineable quantities. Bastnäsite is an orthophosphate mineral [...] (Ln denotes a mixture of all the lanthanides except promethium), loparite-(Ce) is an oxide, and xenotime is a fluorocarbonate LnCO3F. Monazite also contains thorium and yttrium, which complicates handling because thorium and its decay products are radioactive. For the extraction from the ore and the isolation of individual lanthanides, several methods have been developed. The choice of method is based on the concentration and composition of the ore and on the distribution of the individual lanthanides in the resulting concentrate. Roasting the ore and subsequent acidic and basic leaching is used mostly to produce a concentrate of lanthanides. If cerium is the dominant lanthanide, then it is converted from cerium(III) to cerium(IV) and then precipitated. Further separation by solvent extractions or ion exchange chromatography yields a fraction which is enriched in europium. This fraction is reduced with <b>zinc,</b> zinc/amalgam, <b>electrolysis</b> or other methods converting the europium(III) to europium(II). Europium(II) reacts in a way similar to that of alkaline earth metals and therefore it can be precipitated as carbonate or is co-precipitated with barium sulfate. Europium metal is available through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten EuCl3 and NaCl (or CaCl2) in a graphite cell, which serves as cathode, using graphite as anode. The other product is chlorine gas.|$|R
40|$|A zinc-lead bulk {{sulphide}} concentrate from Kirki (Greece) was leached in {{aqueous solution}} with HClH 2 O 2 at atmospheric pressure and 95 °C to extract up to 97 % zinc, 40 % lead, 80 % silver and less than 12 % iron after 6 h. Highly pure PbCl 2 crystallized from the leach filtrate on cooling. Sulphur was oxidized to the elemental form; its loss as sulphate ion in solution and residue was 7. 5 %. During leaching no emission of H 2 S or SO 2 was detected. Conditions were determined for producing a pregnant solution (130 g/L Zn) low in iron and lead, to facilitate <b>zinc</b> extraction by <b>electrolysis.</b> Leaching experiments were conducted at 40 % solids, 0. 55 g HCl and 0. 26 g H 2 O 2 per gramme concentrate in a 1 -L reactor. After a second leaching of the residue {{in aqueous solution}} with HCl (1 M) for 1 h at 90 °C, the residual lead sulphate was extracted, so that total lead recovery was over 98 %. Other values, such as silver and sulphur, could be recovered by additional treatment of either the leach solution or leach residue. © 1987...|$|R
