The line climbs the western flank of the Blue Mountains, using railway <b>zig</b> <b>zags</b> to gain height. It was opened by the not for profit <b>Zig</b> <b>Zag</b> Railway Co-op. Ltd. as an unpaid volunteer staffed heritage railway in October 1975, using the alignment of the Lithgow <b>Zig</b> <b>Zag</b> line that formed part of the Main Western line between 1869 and 1910.|$|R

Today, it is one of Australia's most well-known tourist lines and the original station at Clarence has since been restored for use as the terminus.|$|R
