50|$|While {{the most}} {{well-known}} <b>zoanthids</b> are the zooxanthellate genera found in tropical and sub-tropical waters (primarily Zoanthus and Palythoa), many other species and genera exist, some still relatively unknown to science. Many <b>zoanthids</b> (in particular the genera Epizoanthus and Parazoanthus) are often found growing on other marine invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of this toxin is of significance to aquarists who keep reef aquariums, as Palythoa and related <b>zoanthids</b> are commonly kept as decorative specimens in marine aquaria. Aquarists have reported symptoms consistent with palytoxin poisoning prior to having exposure to <b>zoanthids</b> suspected to contain the toxin. One report involved an aquarist being accidentally poisoned through skin injuries after handling <b>zoanthids</b> Another report involved an aquarium hobbyist in Virginia who experienced a severe respiratory reaction after trying to eradicate colonies of brown <b>zoanthids</b> (suspected to be Palythoa) from rocks in their aquarium. A 2010 study found that a single specimen of Palythoa from a sample of fifteen colonies purchased from three aquarium stores in the Washington D.C. area contained high levels of palytoxin, indicating that toxic individuals {{are present in the}} captive population.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zoanthids</b> feed both by photosynthesis, {{aided by}} the zooxanthellae they contain, and by {{capturing}} plankton and particulate matter. Although photosynthesis aids in their nutrition, even species that do not actively capture plankton cannot live through photosynthesis alone. <b>Zoanthids</b> can eat meaty foods, such as lancefish, brine shrimp, krill and bloodworms.|$|R

30|$|Results of {{this study}} {{demonstrate}} that mt 16 S rDNA sequences can more clearly define closely related species of <b>zoanthids</b> than can COI sequences. In this and previous studies, COI sequences failed to resolve the following species groups from each other: Z. vietnamensis + Z. kuroshio and P. mutuki + Palythoa sp. “sakurajimensis”. A COI sequence from one specimen of P. mutuki was also seen within the P. tuberculosa clade. Future phylogenetic work on brachycnemic <b>zoanthids</b> should always include mt 16 S rDNA for this reason, and ITS-rDNA if possible.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>zoanthids</b> {{contain the}} highly toxic {{substance}} palytoxin. Palytoxin {{is one of}} the most toxic organic substances in the world, but there is an ongoing debate over the concentration of this toxin in these animals. However, even in small quantities, the toxin can be fatal should it be ingested or enter the blood stream. If delivered immediately, it has been suggested that vasodilators can be injected into the ventricle of the heart to act as an antidote.https://web.archive.org/web/20090317031203/http://www.cbwinfo.com/Biological/Toxins/Palytoxin.html A 2010 study found toxic <b>zoanthids</b> in three Washington D.C. area aquarium stores.|$|R

50|$|This species inhabits {{coral reefs}} of the Gulf of Mexico, {{typically}} {{on or near}} <b>zoanthids</b> and sponges. They can be found from the littoral zone down to around 50m.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{species of}} Ostreopsis contain the {{vasoconstrictor}} palytoxin, {{one of the}} most toxic, non-protein substances known. Palytoxin was first isolated from the <b>zoanthid</b> Palythoa toxica and proved to be an unusually long chain polyether-type phytotoxin. It is now postulated that the substance is synthesized by the dinoflagellates and is subsequently incorporated into the <b>zoanthid</b> tissues; it may be a symbiotic arrangement, and it is possible that bacteria are involved in the transfer.|$|E

50|$|Z. sociatus polyps obtain {{nearly half}} of their {{required}} energy from the zooxanthellae, organism that Z. Sociatus forms symbiosis with. Therefore, {{the rest of the}} energy must be obtained through feeding. <b>Zoanthids</b> have nematocysts on their mesenterial filaments that are used for prey capture. Z. sociatus will eat mostly anything that is the right size such as from Artemia cysts and dissolved organic matter. While <b>zoanthids</b> are less efficient heterotrophs, they produce more energy photosynthetically due to their lack of a calcified skeleton. The lack of a skeleton allows more light to reach the chloroplasts. To digest prey, it uses both extracellular and intracellular methods.|$|R

50|$|Other sources {{state that}} palytoxin can be absorbed through intact skin, {{and the danger}} of acute {{poisoning}} from venomous zoanthids is quite real. According to a report an aquarist was poisoned through skin injuries on fingers by a species of Parazoanthus, but recovered after 3 days. His <b>zoanthid</b> was found to contain 2-3 milligram of palytoxin per gram. For comparison, the intravenous LD50 dose of palytoxin for a grown man is less than 8 microgram. Thus each gram of the offending <b>zoanthid</b> contained enough venom to kill at least 125 grown men.|$|E
50|$|Antipathozoanthus hickmani is {{a species}} of macrocnemic <b>zoanthid</b> first found in the Galapagos. It can be {{distinguished}} by its exclusive association with Antipathes galapagensis, and having about 40 tentacles.|$|E

In this study, the diversity of <b>zoanthids</b> in the Cape Verde Islands is specifically examined for the first time.

50|$|The golden <b>zoanthid</b> often {{contrasts}} vividly in colour {{with its}} host sponge, {{which would be}} expected to advertise its presence to potential sponge predators. It contains toxic substances that may deter fish such as the rock beauty (Holacanthus tricolo) from eating the host sponge. The golden <b>zoanthid</b> may also benefit from living on a sponge in that the sponge is a filter feeder and actively draws in a current of water through its pores. It can only cope with the most minute particles and the polyps may be able to capture the bigger food items wafted along in the current.|$|E
50|$|Agelas {{gracilis}} is {{a species}} of demosponge. Its common name is candy cane sponge. It lives primarily in Australian waters. It has a symbiotic relationship with the white <b>zoanthid</b> making red and white polyps.|$|E
50|$|Parazoanthus darwini is {{a species}} of macrocnemic <b>zoanthid</b> first found in the Galapagos. It can be {{distinguished}} by its association with sponges, by having about 24-30 tentacles and polyps embedded in a well-developed coenenchyme.|$|E
40|$|Sessile {{organisms that}} live in {{consolidated}} substrates frequently compete for space. Coral species have many strategies to face this competition, including harming their opponents or hindering their growth. In the present study, the competitive interactions between three species of <b>zoanthids</b> were investigated in the intertidal zone of a sandstone reef environment in northeastern Brazil. The competitive abilities of the three species were evaluated by periodic observation of the natural fringes of contact and experimental evaluation of their growth rate through removal of 100 cm² of colonies of each species. Palythoa caribaeorum and Zoanthus sociatus had similar growth rates, and both species grew faster than Protopalythoa variabilis. The recolonization strategy seems to differ among species. The contact fringes between P. caribaeorum and Z. sociatus remained unchanged over time, without any type of aggressive interaction between them, suggesting that stand-off was the strategy used by these organisms. Palythoa caribaeorum and Z. sociatus grew among the polyps of P. variabilis, often killing its colonies. The coexistence of <b>zoanthids</b> reveals a capacity for survival {{in the face of}} competition for limited resources such as free substrate, which led to the colonization and establishment of <b>zoanthids</b> in intertidal environments...|$|R
