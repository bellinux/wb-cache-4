50|$|A {{concertina}} fold, {{also known}} as a <b>zig-zag</b> <b>fold,</b> accordion fold or z-fold, is a continuous parallel folding of brochures and similar printed material in an accordion-like fashion, that is with folds alternatively made to the front and back in <b>zig-zag</b> <b>folds.</b> Because they do not nest (as in Letter Folds) panels can be the same size. Seen from above, concertina folds resemble a Z or M or series of zigs and zags.|$|R
40|$|The {{monotypic}} genus Urariopsis, {{based on}} Uraria cordifolia Wall., {{has been compared}} with several S. E. Asiatic species of Uraria. The species Uraria prunellaefolia, U. collettii, and U. barbata {{are considered to be}} most closely related to U. cordifolia. The pods of U. cordifolia and U. collettii consist of longitudinally flattened, peltate loments, those of U. prunellaefolia consist of laterally flattened, longitudinally arranged loments; in the other species the loments are laterally flattened and <b>zig-zag</b> <b>folded.</b> No correlating characters were found, and the differences in shape of the pods are not considered sufficient ground to distinguish groups on generic level. Notes on morphology, nomenclature, and geographic distribution are presented...|$|R
