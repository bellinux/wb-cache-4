5000|$|Hymenaea verrucosa (<b>Zanzibar</b> <b>copal,</b> East African copal, or Amber tree) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It belongs to the paraphyletic subfamily Caesalpinioideae. It is a large tree native to the tropical regions of East Africa and is cultivated in many tropical parts of the world. [...] The species is currently treated as {{a species of}} Hymenaea, though a few authors isolate it into a separate monospecific genus Trachylobium as Trachylobium verrucosum.|$|E
50|$|The trees {{also make}} hard resins {{that are used}} to {{manufacture}} varnish, especially the resin from Hymenaea courbaril (jatob√°) in Brazil. The resin that is produced in Brazil is known as South American copal, and Hymenaea verrucosa {{is the source of the}} valuable <b>Zanzibar</b> <b>copal.</b> Resin may be collected from living trees, or from the soil near the place where a tree once stood. Throughout its American range, indigenous peoples use the resin for incense and as a cement. Resin from the extinct species Hymenaea protera is the source of Dominican amber, while the extinct Hymenaea mexicana produced the resin which is the source of Mexican amber.|$|E

The artefact is a very rare and highly significant find in East Africa, with only one other example being found previously (also at the same site), and likely represents early contact between coastal East Africa and the Indian Ocean world. Chemical analysis of the residue adhering to this artefact was undertaken to confirm its use to burn incense, and {{to determine whether the}} resin used was local or exotic to East Africa and thus likely acquired through long-distance trade. The residue extract was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and identified as <b>Zanzibar</b> <b>copal</b> (Hymenaea verrucosa Gaertn.), a local species that rose to major importance in colonial period trade. The results obtained from this study provide the first direct archaeological evidence for the ancient use of this East African species as an aromatic, suggesting that it might have had a much earlier role in long-distance incense trade than previously demonstrated. This finding also provides insights into local East African engagement with the material culture of the Indian Ocean world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
