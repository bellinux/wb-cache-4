40|$|The {{increased}} {{consumption of}} meat (including poultry) observed {{over the last}} decade has led to the intensification of its production. With the production increase, the amount of generated waste also increases. Appropriate disposal of waste from the meat industry will significantly reduce the amount of such waste and its negative impact on the environment. The paper presents a method for the thermal neutralisation of feathers, poultry litter and meat and bone meal (MBM). Waste incineration was carried out in a stationary electric furnace, at a temperature varying in the range of 600 – 900 °C. The resulting ashes were characterised by a high percentage of phosphorus (30 – 170 g/kg ash), calcium (20 – 360 g/kg ash) and other valuable macro- and micronutrients like copper, iron, manganese and <b>zinc.</b> The <b>ashes</b> produced during the thermal treatment are safe in terms of sanitary and can be used as additives enriching the fertilisers and soil improvers.

40|$|Efficient {{analytical}} methods for the quantification of plant-available Zn contained in mineral fertilizers and industrial by-products are fundamental {{for the control}} and marketing of these inputs. In this sense, there are some doubts {{on the part of}} the scientific community as well as of the fertilizer production sector, whether the extractor requested by the government (Normative Instruction No. 28, called 2 nd extractor), which is citric acid 2 % (2 % CA) (Brasil, 2007 b), is effective in predicting the plant availability of Zn via mineral fertilizers and about the agronomic significance of the required minimal solubility of 60 % compared to the total content (HCl) (Brasil, 2007 a). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the alternative extractors DTPA, EDTA, neutral ammonium citrate (NAC), buffer solution pH 6. 0, 10 % HCl, 10 % sulfuric acid, 1 % acetic acid, water, and hot water to quantify the contents of Zn available for maize and compare them with indices of agronomic efficiency of fertilizers and industrial by-products when applied to dystrophic Clayey Red Latosol and Dystrophic Alic Red Yellow Latosol with medium texture. The rate of Zn applied to the soil was 5 mg kg- 1, using the sources zinc sulfate, commercial granular <b>zinc,</b> <b>ash</b> and galvanic sludge, ash and two brass slags. Most Zn was extracted from the sources by DTPA, 10 % HCl, NAC, 1 % acetic acid, and 10 % sulfuric acid. Recovery by the extractors 2 % CA, EDTA, water, and hot water was low. The agronomic efficiency index was found to be high when using galvanic sludge (238 %) and commercial granular zinc (142 %) and lower with brass slag I and II (67 and 27 %, respectively). The sources galvanizing ash and brass ash showed solubility lower than 60 % in 2 % CA, despite agronomic efficiency indices of 78 and 125 %, respectively. The low agronomic efficiency index of industrial by-products such as brass slag I and galvanizing ash can be compensated by higher doses, provided there is no restriction, as well as for all other sources, in terms of contaminant levels of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury as required by law (Normative Instruction No 27 / 2006). The implementation of 2 nd extractor 2 % CA and the requirement of minimum solubility for industrial by-products could restrict the use of alternative sources as potential Zn sources for plants...|$|E

40|$|The char {{produced}} in the thermolysis of granulated scrap tyres has few market outlets, reducing the economic viability of the thermolytic process. This paper reports the potential of this char as a low-cost precursor of porous carbons. The tyre-derived char was demineralized in either alkaline or acidic media to reduce its <b>ash,</b> <b>zinc,</b> sulfur, and silica contents. The lowest impurity content was achieved with an HNO 3 /H 2 O treatment. The resulting demineralized char was then subjected to activation by KOH or CO 2.

40|$|A common {{assumption}} {{regarding the}} residual organic matter, in bottom ash, {{is that it}} does not represent a significant pool of organic carbon and, beyond metal-ion complexation process, it is of little consequence to evolution of ash/leachate chemistry. This article evaluates the effect of residual organic matter and associated microbial respiratory processes on leaching of toxic metals (i. e. arsenic, copper, chromium, molybdenum, nickel, lead, antimony and <b>zinc),</b> eco-toxicity of <b>ash</b> leachates. Microbial respiration was quantified with help of a respirometric test equipment OXITOP control system. The effect of microbial respiration on metal/residual organic matter leaching and eco-toxicity was quantified with the help of batch leaching tests and an eco-toxicity assay - Daphnia magna. In general, the microbial respiration process decreased the leachate pH and eco-toxicity, indicating modification of bioavailability of metal species. Furthermore, the leaching of critical metals, such as copper and chromium, decreased after the respiration in both ash types (fresh and weathered). It was concluded that microbial respiration, if harnessed properly, could enhance the stability of fresh bottom ash and may promote its reuse...|$|R

40|$|Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) fly ash {{contains}} {{significant amounts}} of leachable metals, and is therefore {{considered to be a}} hazardous waste. The increased amounts of fly ash generated cause environmental issues, management costs and accumulation of valuable metals in landfills. All these factors contribute to an increased interests to recognize the ash as an urban mining target of metal resources. Metals recovery, e. g. copper, <b>zinc</b> from fly <b>ash,</b> is not only beneficial for the availability of valuable metals that otherwise would be lost, but it can also decrease the amount of potentially soluble and toxic metal compounds in the ash residue,  making it possible to landfill the ash at a lower cost. A hydrometallurgical process for recovery of copper and <b>zinc</b> from MSWI <b>ash</b> is presented in this thesis. A process consisting of leaching followed by sequential solvent extraction of metals was developed. With respect to leaching efficiency and feasibility, it was found that hydrochloric acid is the best option for recovery if copper and zinc from the fly ash, in addition, efficient leaching of cadmium and lead was also achieved. LIX 860 N-I, a commercial extractant was chosen for the copper extraction. No third phase formations or phase separation problems were observed. The copper extraction gave a good extraction yield with high selectivity. The extracted copper in organic phase can be stripped in a one stage process using a selected sulfuric acidic solution (1. 5 M). Zinc extraction followed the copper extraction by extracting the raffinate using Cyanex 272, Cyanex 572 or Cyanex 923. Cyanex 923 showed the highest efficiency and no pH adjustment of the aqueous phase was needed. However, this extractant co-extracts iron, cadmium and lead with the zinc. Cyanex 572, a novel phosphorus-based chelating extractant is less effective, but more selective for zinc extraction compared to Cyanex 923.   Selective stripping processes were suggested for zinc extraction using Cyanex 572 and Cyanex 923 respectively. Laboratory pilot scale experiments using mixer-settler systems were carried out based on the batch experiment results. McCabe Thiele diagrams were used to model the processes with respect to the number of stages needed for conducting the extractions in mixer-settler systems. The solvent extraction process was then demonstrated in pilot size mixer settler equipment consisting of two stages for copper extraction and three stages for zinc extraction and gave a recovery of 90 % of the copper and ~ 100 % of the zinc in the leachate...|$|R
40|$|Ashes from {{municipal}} solid waste incineration (MSWI) may be a cumbersome waste to handle. Some ash fractions contain organic pollutants, such as dioxins, as well as heavy metals. Additionally, some of the metals have a high value and are considered as critical to the industry. Recovery of e. g. copper and <b>zinc</b> from MSWI <b>ashes</b> will not only recover valuable metals that would otherwise be land filled, but also reduce the toxicity of the ash and thereby make it less cumbersome to handle. Such processes are presently being investigated by the Industrial Materials Recycling group at Chalmers University of Technology. The processes are primarily based on acid leaching of the ash combined with selective solvent extraction. The work on recovery process development is supported by investigations of the chemical speciation of metals, i. e. identification of metal compounds, in ashes by, e. g. synchrotron based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The presentation will give an introduction to the validation of an optimized leaching process for MSWI and speciation results for Cu and Zn, as well as discuss the promising results that have been obtained using the suggested recovery processes for these metals...|$|R
40|$|Demolition wood {{can be used}} as a fuel in {{heat and}} power plants. However, it may contain {{elevated}} amounts of zinc, originating from white paint, which can cause problems related to deposit formation and corrosion on heat transfer surfaces. In this work, combustion tests with zinc addition were carried out in a fluidized bed boiler to investigate its effect on deposit formation. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed to complement the experimental data. The results show that combustion of demolition wood only contaminated with zinc generates a modest amount of deposit. Combustion of demolition wood contaminated with both zinc and chlorine promotes the deposit formation due to the increased amount of submicron particles in the flue gas. The thermodynamic equilibrium analyses show further that reducing conditions increase the release of zinc to the flue gas. On the other hand, in the case of oxidizing conditions, the retention of <b>zinc</b> in the <b>ash</b> is strong. <b>Zinc,</b> in combination with chlorine, gives rise to formation of zinc chloride in the flue gas.

Estimation of bone density using existing methods in experimental models has its advantages as well as drawbacks. Materials and methods: In this study, the X-ray histogram edge detection technique was used to estimate the bone mass density in ovariectomized rats treated orally with germinated brown rice (GBR) bioactives, {{and the results were}} compared with estimated results obtained using Archimede’s principle. New bone cell proliferation was assessed by histology and immunohistochemical reaction using polyclonal nuclear antigen. Additionally, serum alkaline phosphatase activity, serum and bone calcium and zinc concentrations were detected using a chemistry analyzer and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Rats were divided into groups of six as follows: sham (nonovariectomized, nontreated); ovariectomized, nontreated; and ovariectomized and treated with estrogen, or Remifemin®, GBR-phenolics, acylated steryl glucosides, gamma oryzanol, and gamma amino-butyric acid extracted from GBR at different doses. Results: Our results indicate a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, serum and bone calcium, and <b>zinc</b> and <b>ash</b> content in the treated groups compared with the ovariectomized nontreated group (P < 0. 05). Bone density increased significantly (P < 0. 05) in groups treated with estrogen, GBR, Remifemin®, and gamma oryzanol compared to the ovariectomized nontreated group. Histological sections revealed more osteoblasts in the treated groups when compared with the untreated groups. A polyclonal nuclear antigen reaction showing proliferating new cells was observed in groups treated with estrogen, Remifemin®, GBR, acylated steryl glucosides, and gamma oryzanol. There was a good correlation between bone mass densities estimated using Archimede’s principle and the edge detection technique between the treated groups (r 2 = 0. 737, P = 0. 004). Conclusion: Our study shows that GBR bioactives increase bone density, which might be via the activation of zinc formation and increased calcium content, and that X-ray edge detection technique is effective in the measurement of bone density and can be employed effectively in this respect.

40|$|AbstractAll {{processing}} systems of waterworks produce {{a substantial amount}} of sludge with the residues of treatment chemicals used as coagulants (commonly aluminum-based). Landfill is usually considered as a common disposal strategy for sludge and the incineration residues in most metropolitan areas worldwide However, the aluminum and/iron contained in the sludge will be largely wasted in landfills, and the metal ions might also be leached out and cause further pollution to the surrounding areas. Therefore, the need for “waste-to-resource” makes the increasing incentive to develop economically viable reuse and recycling options. The major elements in the incinerated ash of municipal wastewater sludge are aluminum and silicon detected from XRF results, which are major components for glass-ceramics. Therefore, in this study, the incineration ash of waterworks sludge was reused as raw materials to produce the glass-ceramics, and the metal transformation mechanisms were further explicated via the combination of advanced techniques. The ZnAl 2 O 4 spinels were produced with large quantity when sintering <b>zinc</b> oxide with <b>ashes</b> of waterworks sludge. The simulated system with clay and zinc oxide was also studied to investigate the incorporation mechanism of zinc in the glass-ceramics products Both zinc aluminate spinel (ZnAl 2 O 4) and willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4) phases were formed during the sintering process Furthermore, the efficiency of zinc transformation was determined through Rietveld refinement analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. The results show a competitive formation between ZnAl 2 O 4 and Zn 2 SiO 4, and the ZnAl 2 O 4 spinel is predominant at high temperatures. This study used a prolonged leaching test modified from the U.
