This act will enable administrative authorities to refuse - under strict conditions - permits, subsidies or government contracts {{if there is a}} serious danger that the applicant is planning to commit punishable offences with them. Those bodies can request advice from the BIBOB Bureau as to the degree of the danger. To facilitate an evaluation of the 'BIBOB' Act - which will take place three years after the act goes into effect - a <b>zero-measurement</b> has been conducted. The results of that study will offer comparison material for the evaluation three years later. In preparation for the <b>zero-measurement,</b> an evaluative framework was set up. The <b>zero-measurement</b> was conducted by means of a written survey of 732 administrative authorities. In addition, there was a meeting of experts in order to test and supplement the results...|$|E
40|$|The Corporate Agriculture {{division}} {{dealing with}} the procurement and growing of potatoes for Farm Frites in all production locations worldwide {{is in need of}} a strategy to initiate sustainable development. The scope of the project is limited to the activities in Belgium, Egypt, the Netherlands and Poland. A strategy for sustainable agriculture is developed, with goals and key performance indicators, and the methodology that led to this strategy is described as well. The methodology consists of seven steps, with an initial <b>zero-measurement</b> step. The zero- measurements is to describe the current status of sustainable agriculture (0), then the business priorities are identified (1), followed by setting of goals and key performance indicators (2). This leads to a strategy proposal (3), the strategy is then adopted by the general management (4), and integrated in the farming business operations (5). The progress on the strategy is reported on (6), and if need be, regularly revised and updated (7). The developed strategy on sustainable agriculture consists of four main strategic goals; Health and safety of workers first; Ensuring a safe and sustainable potato product; Using of farm inputs in the most responsible way; Sharing of best sustainable farming practices. The level of sustainable agriculture in Belgium and the Netherlands is more or less the same, where progress is made, mostly following requirements from laws and regulations. There are sustainable agriculture initiatives where best practices are shared. Sustainable agriculture in Poland is most advanced in the Farm Frites organisation, where Farm Frites Poland is actively collaborating with farmers to become more sustainable. Sustainable agriculture in Egypt has still a lot to improve, where the first priorities should be to follow and implement some basic good agriculture practices. The strategy building methodology of seven steps with an initial <b>zero-measurement</b> has been proved effective, resulting in a description of the level of sustainable agriculture and a strategy to further increase the sustainability of agriculture in Belgium, Egypt, the Netherlands and Poland. However, only steps zero till three have been carried out, and the strategy is still to be adopted (step four). ...|$|E
