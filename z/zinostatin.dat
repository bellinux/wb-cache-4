30|$|Polymer-based nanoformulations as {{pharmaceuticals}} It {{contains a}} very heterogenous group of nanosize therapeutics. Eligard, Genexol, Opaxio, and <b>Zinostatin</b> Stimalamer {{are some common examples}} of them.|$|E
40|$|Hypersensitivity {{reactions}} from cytotoxic agents {{have not been}} accorded much attention. Certain drugs (L-asparaginase, cisplatin, intravenous melphalan, topical mechlorethamine, <b>zinostatin,</b> and teniposide) produce reactions often {{enough to be a}} clinical problem. Others (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, methotrexate, and procarbazine) do so only occasionally. Bleomycin uniquely produces an occasional hyperpyrexic reaction with clinical findings similar to anaphylaxis. Some cytotoxic agents have never been known to produce hypersensitivity reactions. This paper reviews the frequency and clinical information about such reactions, factors augmenting or decreasing the frequency, and, where possible, the etiologic mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral nanoformulated {{anti-cancer}} substances {{are currently}} commercialized or under development. Pre-clinical and clinical results have revealed better properties, that is, larger efficacy and lower toxicity for these substances than for conventional anti-cancer treatments. Here, we review {{the development of}} several of these substances such as Marqibo, Myocet, Doxil, DaunoXome, MM 398, MM 302, Mepact, Versamune, Thermodox, Depocyt, Livatag, Abraxane, Eligard, Opaxio, <b>Zinostatin</b> Stimalamer (SMANCS), Pegasys and PegIntron, BIND- 014, CRLX- 101, Oncaspar, Neulasta, Aurimmune, Auroshell, AuNPs, Nanotherm, NanoXray, Magnetosome chains, Kadcyla (T-DM 1), Ontak (DAB/IL 2), Gendicine and Curcumin. We describe their specific properties, such as their stability, solubility, mean of administration or targeting, distribution, metabolism and toxicity. We discuss their categorization as medical devices or drugs, their fabrication process within a regulatory environment as well as intellectual property and financial aspects that are all essential to enable their industrial development...|$|E
40|$|Human {{transferrin}} (Tf) was conjugated {{with the}} anticancer polypeptide, neocar- <b>zinostatin</b> (NCS), by using N-succinimidyl 3 -(2 -pyridyldithio) propionate as the cross-linking re- agent. The resulting conjugate (Tf-NCS) consisted of 1. 94 mol of NCS per mol of Tf on average and retained appreciable bacteriocidal activity against Micrococcus luteus. This conjugate was capa- ble of binding to transferrin receptor (Tf・R) with {{almost the same}} affinity as native Tf and, in a complex with Tf・R, endocytosed into the human leukemia cell line, K 562. The in vitro cytotoxicity of this conjugate against K 562 cells was {{greater than that of}} native NCS as revealed by suppression of [?H] thymidine incorporation and cell growth inhibition assay. By treatment with Tf-NCS, a significant inhibition of growth was observed in human colon cancer tumors (M 7609) transplanted into nude mice. The molecular form of this conjugate, examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, was unchanged for 48 hours after the intravenous injection. A transient decrease in red blood cell count, which returned to normal levels within 14 days, was observed in these mice. This conjugate, therefore, serves as an appropriate model for the receptor-mediated targetting of anticancer drugs and may provide a new clinical approach for the treatment of cancer...|$|E
