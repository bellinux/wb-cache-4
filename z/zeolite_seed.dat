40|$|Stable zeolite Beta {{coatings}} with a {{thickness of}} 1 – 2 µm were synthesized on a borosilicate glass substrate by microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis. Prior to the synthesis, surface roughness of the substrate was increased to 1. 0 µm. Then, two thin films of zirconia and titania were successively deposited at 300 °C {{on the glass}} substrate by atomic layer deposition using ZrCl 4 as metal precursors for zirconia and TiCl 4 for titania, respectively. Oxygen and H 2 O were used as oxygen precursors in the ALD process. The internal zirconia film protects the glass substrate from dissolution in a highly alkaline synthesis solution. The outer titania film was made superhydrophilic (2 ̆ 6 gt; 15 OH/nm 2) by an UV irradiation, which enhances the nucleation and crystallization processes on the substrate. The duration of the zeolite nucleation period was decreased by using the additive effect between fluoride ions and the <b>zeolite</b> <b>seed</b> solution under microwave irradiation.

The chemical nature of the functionalizing agent on the formation of homogenous zeolite membrane was evaluated. One monomer and two cationic polymers were used: 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS), polyethylenimine (PEI) and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA). The support was subjected to chemical functionalization and then it was rubbed with zeolite crystals. The W zeolite was used as <b>zeolite</b> <b>seed</b> in two different Si/Al ratios. The functionalized and rubbed supports were submitted to hydrothermal treatment at 150  °C for 48  h. The bioactivity of the homogeneous zeolite membranes was evaluated by the biomimetic method through the membranes soaking in a simulated body fluid (SBF) at 37  °C for 21  days. Two immersion methods were evaluated. The products were characterized by XRD and SEM techniques. The results indicated that the supported functionalization with PDDA and the Si/Al ratio (higher than 1.8) of zeolite enhanced the interaction between the support and the zeolite precursor enhancing the formation of homogeneous zeolite membrane on the surface. The presence of the functional groups of PDDA on the membrane was detected by FTIR. After immersion in SBF, the zeolite membrane was stable and {{led to the formation of}} Ca–P layer on its surface. The re-immersion method led to the formation of richer Ca/P layer (1.36). These findings allowed generating a zeolite membrane with combined properties of calcium silicate and the controllable porosity of zeolitic material making it potentially useful for bone regeneration and drug releasing.|$|E

Normally, those samples cured at 150 °C contained a greater proportion of zeolite and as such were more SO 2 adsorptive than their low-temperature counterparts. However, in order for the project to be successful, on site synthesis must remain an option, i. e. _ 100 °C synthesis. In light of this, the experimental focus now has two aspects. First, compositions of the starting materials are being altered by blending the current suite of fly ashes with other fly ashes, ground glass cullet and silica fume to promote the formation and growth of well crystallized and highly adsorptive zeolites. Second, greater degrees of reaction at significantly lower temperatures are being promote by ball milling the fly ash prior to use, by the use of more concentrated caustic solutions, and by the addition of <b>zeolite</b> <b>seeds</b> to the reactants. In all cases studies will focus on the effect of structure type and degree of conversion on SO 2 adsorption. Future work will concentrate on the study of the effect of weathering on the suitability of converting fly ash into zeolites. This is an especially important study, considering the acres of fly ash now in storage throughout the country...|$|R

The {{results indicated that the}} as-synthesized SAPO- 34 /ZSM- 5 composite takes the form of sphere-like particles with a diameter ranging from 2. 3 to 4. 8 µm, through the accumulation of tiny ZSM- 5 and SAPO- 34 crystals; a large quantity of mesopores was formed in the interspaces between the ZSM- 5 and SAPO- 34 crystals. Owing to its proper acidity and porosity, the SAPO- 34 /ZSM- 5 composite exhibits higher stability in MTH and favors the formation of aromatics and alkanes, compared with the parent SAPO- 34 and ZSM- 5 zeolites and their mechanical mixture...|$|R

In this case, <b>zeolite</b> and <b>seeds</b> are mixed and fluidized by warm air as drying medium. The air will desorb water from seed, {{and at the same}} time, zeolite will adsorb vapor from air. Thus, the driving force of drying can be kept high. However, in Indonesia, the zeolite with high adsorption capacity is hardly found in market. This research studied the activation of natural zeolite using two different methods: by heating at 200 - 400 oC, and adding NaOH 0. 5 - 2. 0 N. Results showed that the adsorbing capacity of zeolite activated by 1. 0 N NaOH is 0. 170 gr water/gr dry zeolite. While, by heating at 300 oC for 3 hours, is 0. 140 gr water loaded/gr dry zeolite. With the performance, zeolite can be used for drying application. Keywords: zeolite, fluidized, adsorption, drying, activation...|$|R
40|$|Beta <b>zeolite</b> {{obtained}} from <b>seeded</b> synthesis {{without the use}} of organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) {{has been used as a}} catalyst in different types of reactions. The large number of strong acid sites resulted in a high activity for the alkylation of benzene with ethene and a high cracking activity in the hydroconversion of n-decane. However, the high framework polarity resulted in fast deactivation in the acylation of aromatic ethers. Dealumination treatments resulted in improved stability in alkylation reactions with the more reactive olefins like propene. In acylation reactions, the activity was significantly increased, and in hydroconversion, a better balance between the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation and the acid sites was obtained.

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CDFA:ING+FBG:NOG:PFOInternational audienceIn {{the last}} years, water {{separation}} by hydrophilic membranes has gained huge {{importance in the}} scientific and industrial community. Hydrophilic membranes {{can be used for}} selective water pervaporation from liquid mixtures or dehydration of organic compounds and these processes can positively replace distillation due to lower energy requirement. Moreover, water is produced in various chemical reactions as a by-product; its separation by hydrophilic membranes from the reaction media can displace the equilibrium and overcome thermodynamic limitations. As example, the selective removal of H 2 O during dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis (carbon dioxide hydrogenation into methanol followed by its dehydration to produce DME) by means of a membrane separation process would displace the equilibriums to enhance CO 2 conversion into methanol, improve DME productivity and also prevent catalyst deactivation. To develop this process, the main latch is undoubtedly the production of a membrane able to selectively separate water at high temperature and pressure from a gaseous mixture of H 2 O, H 2, CO, CO 2, CH 3 OH and DME. Zeolite membranes appear to offer great potential for this application in reason of their molecular sieving properties, uniform pore size distribution and wide range of hydrophilic behavior depending on their Si/Al ratio. Furthermore, it is known that they have higher thermal resistance and mechanical strength than polymeric membranes and provide higher separation factors than ceramic ones. Highly hydrophilic sodalite (SOD, Si/Al ratio of 1) membranes were produced in this work based on a new mechanical pore-plugging technique. This process involved the insertion of specific sized seeds within the pores of an asymmetric host support followed by their growth by hydrothermal synthesis steps. To obtain membranes with high water selectivity and flux, several parameters were investigated, including composition of the precursor solutions (nature and ratio of the reactants to get clear solutions, without the use of structure directing agents), hydrothermal synthesis conditions, mean pore size and nature of the support top-layer (0. 1 - 0. 5 um for TiO 2 or a-Al 2 O 3 on stainless steel) and membrane post-treatments. <b>Zeolite</b> <b>seeds</b> and/or synthesized membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopies (SEM), gas permeation and permporosimetry where hydrogen permeance was evaluated as a function of water P/Po up to 250 °C. Results revealed that membranes obtained under optimized synthesis conditions have good H 2 O/H 2 selectivity at high temperatures even for low water P/Po indicating their high potential to improve DME productivity industrially...|$|R

In this case, <b>zeolite</b> and <b>seeds</b> are mixed and fluidized by warm air as drying medium. The air will evaporate water from seed, {{and at the same}} time, zeolite will adsorb vapor from air. Thus, the humidity of air in dryer can be kept low in which improves the driving force for drying. So, the process can be more efficient in low or medium temperature and the corn quality can be retained. This paper discusses the process transport of the drying formulated in two dimensional modelling. In this case, the drying rate and water diffusivity in corn was estimated with experimental data. While, the adsorption rate and diffusivity of water in zeolite as well as other important process constants was assumed based on literature. Results showed that the drying can run well and the model can describe the profiles of moisture and temperature in corn and zeolite. It can be also noted that saturation time of zeolites particles is faster than drying time of corn. It means that more zeolite is required in the mixture to keep driving force being still high. ...|$|R
