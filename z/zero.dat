5|$|The {{ghost of}} <b>Zero</b> (Normand Fauteux) materializes {{at a local}} gay bathhouse. No one can see or hear him, until <b>Zero</b> runs into Burton while Burton is spying on Zero's friend George. <b>Zero</b> realizes that Burton can see him, {{although}} <b>Zero</b> does not show up on Burton's video camera.

5|$|By {{the events}} of Drakengard 3, <b>Zero</b> had forged a {{partnership}} with the dragon Michael: as dragons are the only beings that can destroy Intoners, Michael would help <b>Zero</b> kill her sisters, then kill her to finish off the flower. Their first attempt to take down all the Intoners ends in disaster, with <b>Zero</b> losing her arm and Michael being wounded and forced to reincarnate as the child dragon Mikhail. During their second attempt, they attack each one individually: after killing one, <b>Zero</b> takes on their disciple, a servant created to magnify the Intoners' powers, who each help in battle and act as a personal harem. Before facing One, <b>Zero</b> reverts her disciples to their original bird forms, releasing them from their servitude. During the battle, both One and Mikhail are killed, then <b>Zero</b> is killed by a male clone of One created as a fail-safe in the event of Zero's victory.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{recovery}} of the Akutan <b>Zero,</b> technical information from three other downed Zeros was available to the Allies. One <b>Zero</b> (serial number 5349), piloted by Hajime Toyoshima, crashed on Melville Island in Australia following the bombing of Darwin. The <b>Zero</b> was heavily damaged, and Toyoshima became Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the Pacific war. Another <b>Zero,</b> piloted by Yoshimitsu Maeda, crashed near Cape Rodney, New Guinea. The team sent to recover the plane erred when they chopped off the wings, severing the wing spars and rendering the hulk unflyable. The third came from China, where Gerhard Neumann was able to reconstruct a working <b>Zero.</b> He used a partly intact <b>Zero</b> (serial number 3372) that had landed in Chinese territory, repaired with salvaged pieces from other downed Zeros. However, bad conditions and the long delivery time from China prevented Neumann's <b>Zero</b> from reaching the United States for testing until after the {{recovery of the}} Akutan <b>Zero.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{location}} and asymptotic behaviour for large n of the <b>zeros</b> of exceptional Jacobi and Laguerre polynomials are discussed. The <b>zeros</b> of exceptional polynomials {{fall into two}} classes: the regular <b>zeros,</b> which lie in the interval of orthogonality and the exceptional <b>zeros,</b> which lie outside that interval. We show that the regular <b>zeros</b> have two interlacing properties: one is the natural interlacing between consecutive polynomials {{as a consequence of}} their Sturm-Liouville character, while the other one shows interlacing between the <b>zeros</b> of exceptional and classical polynomials. A generalization of the classical Heine-Mehler formula is provided for the exceptional polynomials, which allows to derive the asymptotic behaviour of their regular <b>zeros.</b> We also describe the {{location and}} the asymptotic behaviour of the exceptional <b>zeros,</b> which converge for large n to fixed values. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a patient (LD) showing a selective syntactic {{deficit in the}} production of Arabic numerals. Unlike in previously reported cases, LD's syntactic difficulties result in deletions rather than insertions of <b>zeros,</b> with a reduction of the number magnitude. The pattern of errors highlighted a distinction between "lexical zeros", i. e. the <b>zeros</b> in tens, that are semantically derived, and "syntactic zeros" that are syntactically produced as the result of specific production rules. In LD, only syntactic <b>zeros</b> were affected. Furthermore, the processing of numerals with final <b>zeros</b> was found to be easier than the processing of numerals with internal <b>zeros.</b> This pattern of errors is compatible with the lexical-semantic model of Power and Dal Martello. In this model, in fact, lexical <b>zeros</b> originate from a numerical concept, while syntactic <b>zeros</b> originate from a concatenation operation, plus an overwriting operation leaving one or more intermediary <b>zeros.</b> Thus, lexical <b>zeros</b> may be easier to manipulate than syntactic <b>zeros</b> that merely represent a null quantity associated to a specific power of 10.

5|$|The {{capture and}} flight tests of Koga's <b>Zero</b> is usually {{described}} as a tremendous coup for the Allies as it revealed the secrets of that mysterious aircraft and led directly to its downfall.
