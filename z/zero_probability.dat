The probabilistic version of Modus Ponens, for example, licenses the inference from P(A) =α and P(B|A) =β to P(B) ∈[αβ,αβ+ 1 −α]. We study generalized inference forms {{with three or}} more premises. The generalized Modus Ponens, for example, leads from P(A 1) =α 1,…,P(An) =αn and P(B|A 1 ∧⋯∧An) =β to an according interval for P(B). We present the probability intervals for the conclusions of the generalized versions of Cut, Cautious Monotonicity, Modus Tollens, Bayes’ Theorem, and some SYSTEM O rules.
