50|$|At the museum, Marshall and {{his team}} {{commence}} attack and eliminate Thomas' bodyguards, just in time Bond breaks free from his <b>zip-tie</b> handcuffs using a hidden blade in his wristwatch, acquires a Sten submachine gun from a dead goon he terminated {{in the process and}} goes after Marshall who already has had Secretary Thomas cornered. Bond takes the shot before Marshall could kill Thomas and saves the latter's life, an act which he believes to persuade Thomas to change his political tactics towards Britain.|$|E
5000|$|Running {{with the}} theme of the cast's resourcefulness of {{utilizing}} junkyard parts and cheap products to achieve their goals, Zip Ties are so frequently used that Roadkill Garage have a mock info-segment called [...] "The Roadkill Garage Zip Tie Moment" [...] - where David Freiburger or Steve Dulcich find new and creative ways to make use of zip ties in their project. The use of zip ties has become so emblematic of the [...] "budget car modification" [...] sub-culture that the Roadkill team (in association with Dodge) now hold the Roadkill <b>Zip-Tie</b> Drags event which is a day dedicated to Drag Racing, and other social activities. Originally held in Arizona on June 30, 2016 - the meet was a large success and further dates and venues have been scheduled.|$|E

50|$|On March 2, 2014, {{approximately}} 1000-1200 protesters marched from Georgetown University to the White House {{to stage}} a protest against the Keystone Pipeline. 398 arrests were made of people tying themselves to the White House fence with <b>zip-ties</b> and lying on a black tarp {{in front of the}} fence. The tarp represented an oil spill, and many protesters dressed in white jumpsuits covered in black ink, symbolizing oil-covered HazMat suits, laid down upon the tarp.|$|R
50|$|The TXT-1 {{exhibits}} a straight-axle suspension system damped via silicone-filled shocks, the latter {{a departure from}} friction shocks used on the Clod Buster. Of note is the fixed-ratio cantilever arrangement actuating the shocks which lengthens the effective range through which the shocks travel, increasing suspension articulation. By design the vehicle is somewhat prone to stability-degrading torque steer and body roll. The truck features <b>zip-ties</b> retaining metal anti-sway bars which significantly improve stability.|$|R
40|$|Este estudo {{experimental}} verificou a eficÃcia do uso de um lacre plÃstico no fechamento do coto distal do cÃlon sigmÃide comparando com sutura manual em plano Ãnico, contÃnuo e extramucoso utilizando fio de polipropileno. Foram utilizados 30 animais (Canis familiaris) fÃmeas, pesando entre 8, 0 e 18, 0 kg, clinicamente sadios, oriundos do canil da Prefeitura Municipal de Teresina, PiauÃ. Foram distribuÃdos em dois grupos de 15 animais; submetidos a laparotomia com secÃÃo do cÃlon sigmÃide, com fechamento do coto distal com sutura cotÃnua e extramucosa com fio de polipropileno (Grupo I â Controle) e fechamento do coto distal com lacre plÃstico (Grupo II- Estudo). Todos os animais de ambos os grupos foram submetidos Ã anastomose colo-retal, tÃrmino lateral e avaliados no trans e pÃs-operatÃrio imediato por mÃdico veterinÃrio, sendo a alimentaÃÃo Ã base de raÃÃo padrÃo e Ãgua, ad libitum, instituÃda quando se observou evacuaÃÃo. Todos os animais foram submetidos Ã eutanÃsia no 21 Â DPO apÃs anestesia venosa com Cloridrato de Cetamina e aplicaÃÃo de cloreto de potÃssio 20 % via endovenosa; realizou-se nova laparotomia e avaliaÃÃo da anastomose colo-retal, correspondendo o cÃto distal do sigmÃide,este segmento foi submetido a teste de rompimento de sutura. Estatisticamente foi realizado teste estatÃstico de VariÃncia aplicando-se o Teste SNK e confirmado com teste Qui-quadrado. Durante realizaÃÃo do teste de tensÃo, ocorreu rompimento do fechamento do coto cÃlico distal em quatro animais de cada grupo, nÃo havendo diferenÃa significativa entre os grupos (p> 0. 05). O tempo operatÃrio mÃdio foi 27, 7 min. E 24, 7 min., nos Grupos I e II respectivamente, nÃo havendo diferenÃa estatisticamente significante entre os dois grupos (p= 0, 09). A pressÃo mÃdia de ruptura foi 145, 0 mmHg e 195, 0 mmHg nos Grupos I e II respectivamente, nÃo havendo diferenÃa estatisticamente significante entre eles (p= 0, 057). O fechamento do cÃlon distal com lacre apresentou a mesma seguranÃa e eficÃcia do fechamento com fio polipropileno 3 - 0. The {{objective of}} this experimental study was to compare the efficacy of two techniques of distal sigmoid stump closure: plastic <b>zip-tie</b> versus manual, running extramucosal single-layer suture with polypropylene thread. The study included 30 clinically healthy female dogs (Canis familiaris) weighing 8 &# 8722; 18 kg supplied by the local municipal dog pound (Teresina, PiauÃ). The animals were distributed in two groups of 15 animals each and submitted to laparotomy, colon resection and closure of the distal sigmoid stump with either running extramucosal suture using 3 - 0 propylene thread (Group I) or a plastic <b>zip-tie</b> (Group II). All animals were submitted to latero-terminal colorectal anastomosis and were evaluated transoperatively and immediately after surgery by a veterinarian. Standard chow and water was provided ad libitum once evacuation had been observed. On the 21 st postoperative day the animals were anesthetized with Cloridrate Cetamina i. v. and euthanized with 20 % potassium chloride i. v. A second laparotomy was performed to evaluate the colorectal anastomosis and submit the sigmoid stump to a wound disruption test. Findings were submitted to variance analysis, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test and the Chi-square test for confirmation. Wound disruption occurred in four animals from each group, with {{no statistically significant difference}} between the groups (p> 0. 05). The average time of surgery was 27. 7 min (Group I) and 24. 7 min (Group II), with no statistically significant difference between the groups (p= 0. 09). The average disruption pressure was 145. 0 mmHg (Group I) and 195. 0 mmHg (Group II), with no statistically significant difference between the groups (p= 0. 057). Closure of the sigmoid stump may be as safely performed with plastic <b>zip-tie</b> as with conventional continuous suture using 3 - 0 polypropylene thread...|$|E

[...] Kadir did calm down and Waruch was able to secure his arms. Richmond shot Kadir as Waruch lead {{him back to the}} where captives were being assembled. Richmond said he saw Kadir [...] "lunge" [...] at Waruch, although it is widely reported that Kadir merely tripped, and fell against Waruch. Richmond claimed he wasn't aware that Kadir's limbs were secured.|$|R
40|$|Examination {{of a local}} power utility’s injury {{database}} revealed {{maintenance personnel}} to experience high injury rates. Maintenance jobs were analyzed using an ergonomic risk factor screening tool and scaffolding tasks, including walk-board tie-down and frame tube coupling, were found to pose high risks. Factors included high torques at joints and awkward posture positions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to conceptualize interventions to reduce risks and conduct experiments to assess the impact of interventions on worker muscle activation and performance. Nine male operators were recruited from the utility and participated in two tests of novel walk-board tie-down and frame coupling equipment. Muscle activation was measured using electromyography in scaffold assemble/disassemble tasks along with time-to-task completion. Results revealed plastic <b>zip-ties</b> and quick-clamping couplers to reduce mean normalized muscle responses and support performance comparable to conventional metal-wire ties and ratcheting clamps. These ergonomic interventions maybe implemented in other areas where scaffolding is used...|$|R
40|$|A local power utility’s injury {{database}} {{was analyzed}} to identify jobs with high injury rates for maintenance personnel. These jobs were analyzed for ergonomics-related hazards, first, using a subjective screening tool and then via a detailed quantitative {{analysis on the}} high risk jobs. This analysis revealed scaffold frame assembly tasks, including walk-board tie-down and frame tube coupling to pose high-risks. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (1) conceptualize ergonomic interventions with potential to reduce exposure to hazards for the two high-risk tasks; and (2) conduct experiments to assess the impact of the proposed interventions on muscle activation levels and task performance. The standard procedure adopted at the local utility for walk-board tie-down tasks involves use of a # 9 gauge metal wire to secure boards to a scaffold frame. Pre-cut wires are looped around the walk-boards and frame, and then tightened with pliers. An evaluation of this task revealed risk factors of high force, extreme postures and repetitious movements during plier use in tightening the metal wire. To reduce the effect of these problems, plastic <b>zip-ties</b> were proposed. For the scaffolding coupling task, standard ratchet couplers are used to secure tw...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{movements}} of palinurid (spiny) lobsters {{is important to}} fisheries management. However, movement data obtained with mark-capture techniques are often influenced by artefacts (e. g., displacement, tag-loss, tag-induced injury). To avoid these problems, a novel approach was employed to investigate the {{movements of}} an important coral reef palinurid, the painted lobster (Panulirus versicolor). Eighty adult individuals were captured by hand near Northwest Island, Australia. Each lobster was tagged internally (with elastomer) and externally (with plastic <b>zip-ties)</b> to enable both short- (1 – 10 days) and long-term (6 – 24 months) observations. Shortly thereafter, all lobsters were manually returned to their shelters (dens). After 6 – 24 months, 44 lobsters were recaptured, giving an overall recapture rate of 55 %. All of these individuals were recaptured within 500 m of their original den, thus indicating {{a high level of}} site-fidelity for this species. Short-term observations revealed that individuals moved frequently to and from nearby dens, and that male lobsters typically moved further than female lobsters. It is hypothesized that male lobsters move about their home range more actively, perhaps to seek mating opportunities or to defend resources. The significance of these observations is discussed with respect to the management of this important fishery resource...|$|R
5000|$|According to Amnesty International, detainees in Turkey {{are being}} {{subjected}} to beatings and torture, including rape, after the failed coup attempt. Police held detainees in stress positions, denied them food, water and medical treatment. Detainees were verbally abused, threatened as well as subjected to beatings and torture, including rape and sexual assault. Plastic <b>zip-ties</b> were often fastened too tight and left wounds on the arms of detainees. In some cases detainees were also blindfolded throughout their detention.In addition, detainees have been denied access to lawyers and family members and have not been properly informed {{of the charges against}} them, undermining their right to a fair trial.In general, it appears that the worst treatment in detention was reserved for higher-ranking military officers. Amnesty International said it wanted the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to send people to check on detainees conditions. [...] A person who'd been on duty at the Ankara police headquarters claimed that police denied medical treatment to a detainee. [...] "Let him die. We will say he came to us dead," [...] the witness quoted a police doctor as saying. Some of the detainees were in extreme emotional distress, with one detainee attempting to throw himself out of a sixth story window and another repeatedly slamming his head against the wall.|$|R
