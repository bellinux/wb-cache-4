40|$|Abstract. When {{stamping}} galvanized sheet, the formability usually decreases {{for failure}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating.</b> In this paper, formability of galvanized sheet was firstly researched by Erichsen experiment. The {{results show that}} <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> has lost efficacy when the cup arrives the value of Erichsen depth (ED). Then finite element analysis was used, it puts the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> and the substrate in connection by using automatic-surface-to-surface-tiebreak and sets {{up a series of}} forming limitation diagrams (FLD) of galvanized sheet and of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> under different punch strokes. Then depth of the cup when <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> reaches critical state was got, which decreased about 5 %- 10 % compared with bare sheet. At last, failure mechanism of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> was discussed, the reason is that material of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is soft and the friction leads to pulverization and exfoliation of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating.</b> The simulation results are consistent with the Erichsen experiment ones. Conclusions of this paper can provide theoretical guidance for the stamping process design of galvanized sheet...|$|R

In this study, the complex agents (anise aldehyde and Lugalvan P) were added into the electroplating bath to improve the anti-corrosion ability and inhibit dendritic structure on <b>zinc</b> <b>coating.</b> The Lugalvan P is added into the electroplating bath to inhibit dendritic structure during electroplating.

40|$|Abstract:During {{forming process}} of sheet metal, {{friction}} phenomenon occurs everywhere. Galvanized sheet {{is the combination}} of substrate and <b>zinc</b> <b>coating,</b> which are two different materials of different properties. Compared with ordinary cold-rolled steel sheets, friction during forming process of galvanized sheet is more complicated. Factors like load, velocity, etc. have different effects. In this paper, effects of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating,</b> velocity and load on galvanized sheet friction coefficient were researched based on orthogonal tables with using friction wear tester. The results show the following conclusions. <b>Zinc</b> <b>coating</b> has great effect on galvanized sheet friction, friction coefficient of zinc-coated sheet is {{greater than that of}} bare board under low load (0. 3 ~ 1 N), but smaller than that of bare board under high load (1 ~ 5 N). Galvanized sheet friction coefficient also changes when load or velocity changes, with load increases, it first increases and then decreases; with velocity increases, it first increases and then decreases. Mechanism of the influence rules above was simply analyzed. Significance of the three factors above could also be seen. Under low load, effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> on galvanized sheet friction coefficient is the greatest, followed by that of load, and finally that of velocity, but none of them is significant; under high load, effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is significant, those of velocity and load are not significant...|$|R

50|$|The {{protection}} {{provided by}} hot-dip galvanizing is insufficient for products {{that will be}} constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses. For these applications, more expensive stainless steel is preferred. Some nails made today are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many outdoor applications because it is cheaper than hot-dip <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> and looks good when new. Another reason not to use hot-dip <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is that for bolts and nuts of size M10 (US 3/8") or smaller, the thick hot-dipped coating fills in {{too much of the}} threads, which reduces strength (because the dimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to fit together).
