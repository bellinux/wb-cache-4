40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} the nano-composite oxides in dielectric materials which {{are suitable for}} increasing {{the efficiency of the}} destruction of strength and durability against voltage. Tests were conducted to compare the characteristics and details of epoxy resin materials doped with nano <b>zinc</b> <b>oxides</b> by using positive and negative impulse standard voltage to test the destruction of specimen in order to make insulators more efficient and durable against the positive and the negative impulse voltage. This research also studied the abilities of nano-composite oxides to be used as electrical insulators - epoxy resin doped with <b>zinc</b> <b>oxides</b> nano-composite in ratios of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % by weight. After that, there were destruction tests by using impulse voltage at levels of 75, 90, 98, and 115 kV connected to the specimen's electrodes immersed in oil transformer by using each voltage level against specimen usage in each of the aforementioned ratios to investigate the damages on insulator surfaces and the number of breakdowns. In viewing damages on insulator surfaces, microscopes with magnification levels of 20 - 800 X were used. From experimental results, it was found that regarding specimens used to doped an epoxy resin with <b>zinc</b> <b>oxides</b> nano-composite and each level of standard positive impulse voltage, {{in the first round of}} voltage feeding it was observed that the period of specimens surface destruction was higher than when negative impulse voltage were used, and the breakdown occurrences were also faster increasing than that the of standard negative impulse voltage were used. In conclusion, a 5 % doped epoxy resin with nano-composite <b>zinc</b> <b>oxides</b> tested with negative impulse voltage has better properties as an insulator than other samples in ratios of 0, 10, 15, and 20 %, respectively, as the 5 % ratio has a breakdown occurrences also happened later with smaller periods of insulator surface destruction in the first round of voltage feeding than the other cases...|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that soft annealing duration strongly affects {{the performance of}} solution-processed amorphous <b>zinc</b> tin <b>oxide</b> thin-film transistors. Prolonged soft annealing times are found to induce two important changes in the device: (i) a decrease in <b>zinc</b> tin <b>oxide</b> film thickness, and (ii) an increase in oxygen vacancy concentration. The devices prepared without soft annealing exhibited inferior transistor performances, in comparison to devices in which the active channel layer (<b>zinc</b> tin <b>oxide)</b> was subjected to soft annealing. The highest saturation field-effect mobility - 5. 6 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 with a drain-to-source on-off current ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 2 × 108 - was achieved {{in the case of}} devices with 10 -min soft-annealed <b>zinc</b> tin <b>oxide</b> thin films as the channel layer. The findings of this work identify soft annealing as a critical parameter for the processing of chemically derived thin-film transistors, and it correlates device performance to the changes in material structure induced by soft annealing. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
5|$|The Romans {{produced}} considerable {{quantities of}} brass (an alloy of zinc and copper) {{as early as}} 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with <b>zinc</b> <b>oxide.</b> The <b>zinc</b> <b>oxide</b> {{is thought to have}} been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace.

5|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>oxide</b> {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale <b>zinc</b> <b>oxide</b> fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature.

Exposure to <b>zinc</b> <b>oxide</b> in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever.
