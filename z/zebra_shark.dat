5|$|There is robust {{morphological}} {{support for}} {{the placement of the}} <b>zebra</b> <b>shark,</b> the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of the <b>zebra</b> <b>shark,</b> and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed the <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma.|$|E
5|$|The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of the <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> {{occurs in}} the {{tropical}} waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from South Africa to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (including Madagascar and the Maldives), to India and Southeast Asia (including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Palau), northward to Taiwan and Japan, eastward to New Caledonia and Tonga, and southward to northern Australia.|$|E

5|$|The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> has a {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day resting {{motionless}} on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.|$|E
5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E

5|$|The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> {{is taken}} by {{commercial}} fisheries across {{most of its}} range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat {{and low levels of}} dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations {{of several hundred}} zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors {{between male and female}} sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{recurring}} shark parthenogenesis {{over several}} years was demonstrated in a captive <b>zebra</b> <b>shark,</b> a type of carpet shark. DNA genotyping demonstrated that individual zebra sharks can switch from sexual to parthenogenetic reproduction.|$|E
5|$|During the day, <b>zebra</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{sluggish}} {{and usually}} found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. <b>Zebra</b> <b>sharks</b> are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|R
40|$|Site {{fidelity}} and migratory {{movements of}} vertebrate animals occur at many {{spatial and temporal}} scales. Larger migratory movements tend to occur in species that live in seasonal environments in which food supplies vary markedly, while species found in thermally stable environments are more site-attached. In the marine environment, seasonal migrations are often associated with predictable temporary aggregations that have largely been targeted for exploitation. We employed passive acoustic telemetry to investigate inter- and intraseasonal site fidelity of <b>zebra</b> <b>sharks</b> to an aggregation site in southeast Queensland, Australia, close to the southern latitudinal extent of this species 2 ̆ 7 range. We tracked 10 <b>zebra</b> <b>sharks</b> over two aggregation seasons (21 months). We applied a generalized linear mixed-effects model to investigate the presence/absence of these <b>zebra</b> <b>sharks</b> with respect to several environmental variables. We found that different environmental factors were associated with site fidelity of <b>zebra</b> <b>sharks</b> at different temporal levels and that these may be indicative of the mechanisms driving the movements. Seasonal patterns may be driven by endogenous systems, and cues such as photoperiod and water temperature {{are likely to be}} important. Intraseasonal patterns {{are more likely to be}} indicative of direct behavioural responses to changes in environmental conditions such as increased wave heights, as well as foraging bouts away from a core refuge. Understanding the relative contributions of these environmental parameters, as well as biological factors, will be important for making predictions of site fidelity and movements of migratory marine vertebrates under differing future scenarios such as increases in sea temperature...|$|R

500|$|The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> {{was first}} {{described}} as Squalus varius by Seba in 1758. No type specimen was designated, though Seba included a comprehensive description in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile. Müller and Henle placed this {{species in the}} genus Stegostoma in 1837, using the specific epithet fasciatus (or the neuter form fasciatum, as Stegostoma is neuter while Squalus is masculine) from an 1801 work by Bloch and Schneider. In 1984, Compagno rejected the name [...] "varius/m" [...] in favor of [...] "fasciatus/m" [...] for the <b>zebra</b> <b>shark,</b> because Seba did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in his species descriptions (though Squalus varius is {{one that can be}} construed as a binomial name). In Compagno's view, the first proper usage of [...] "varius/m" [...] was by Garman in 1913, making it a junior synonym. Both S. fasciatum and S. varium are currently in wide usage for this species.|$|E
500|$|The {{courtship}} {{behavior of}} the <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail, with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom. On occasion this leads to mating, in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for two to five minutes. The <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> is oviparous, with females laying large egg capsules measuring [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] thick. The egg case is dark brown to purple in color, and has hair-like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate. The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female's vent; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers, so as to anchor the eggs. Females have been documented laying up to 46 eggs over a 112-day period. Eggs are deposited in batches of around four. Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown.|$|E
500|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> {{is found}} from the {{intertidal}} zone {{to a depth}} of [...] over the continental and insular shelves. Adults and large juveniles frequent coral reefs, rubble, and sandy areas. There are unsubstantiated reports of this species from fresh water in the Philippines. Zebra sharks sometimes cross oceanic waters to reach isolated seamounts. Movements of up to [...] have been recorded for individual sharks. However, genetic data indicates that there is little exchange between populations of zebra sharks, even if their ranges are contiguous.|$|E

500|$|The {{color pattern}} in young sharks is dark brown above and light yellow below, with {{vertical}} yellow stripes and spots. As the shark grows to [...] long, the dark areas begin to break up, changing the general pattern from light-on-dark stripes to dark-on-light spots. There is substantial variation in pattern amongst adults, {{which can be}} used to identify particular individuals. In 1964, a partially albino <b>zebra</b> <b>shark</b> completely lacking spots was discovered in the Indian Ocean. The shark, a [...] long mature female, was unusual in that albino animals rarely survive long in the wild due to their lack of crypsis.|$|E
