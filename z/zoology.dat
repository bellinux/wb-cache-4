5|$|As {{a naturalist}} {{he had a}} great curiosity, observing the geography, geology, plants, animals, birds, reptiles, {{amphibians}} and fish around him and recording what he saw and heard about. He wrote acclaimed books including British <b>Zoology,</b> the History of Quadrupeds, Arctic <b>Zoology</b> and Indian <b>Zoology</b> although he never travelled further afield than continental Europe. He knew and maintained correspondence with many of the scientific figures of his day. His books influenced the writings of Samuel Johnson. As an antiquarian, he amassed a considerable collection of art and other works, largely selected for their scientific interest. Many of these works are now housed at the National Library of Wales.|$|E

5|$|He had {{intended}} to become a priest, and went to Cambridge to read theology, but after his first year {{he went on the}} university expedition to South America, where he studied natural forms in eastern Brazil in 1923, led by the entomologist Frank Balfour Browne, where he became fascinated by natural history, and changed his studies to <b>zoology</b> on his return. He then went on an expedition to the lower Amazon (1925–1926), and on research trips to the Zambesi river area in Africa (1927), including Mozambique, Zambia and East Africa, and Lanzarote (1930). He married Joyce Radford in 1928. He was a lecturer in <b>Zoology</b> at Bristol University from 1928 until 1932, when he moved to Glasgow University. He studied under another advocate of military camouflage, John Graham Kerr. His thesis, which he completed in 1935 under a Carnegie Fellowship, was on 'adaptive coloration' – both camouflage and warning coloration – in the Anura (frogs). In 1938 he was made a Doctor of Science at Glasgow, and he became a <b>Zoology</b> lecturer at Cambridge University and Strickland Curator of Birds at the university's Museum of <b>Zoology.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1945 Stebbins {{was hired}} an {{assistant}} professor of <b>zoology</b> at the University of California, Berkeley, and became the first curator of herpetology at the Museum of Vertebrate <b>Zoology,</b> where he would remain throughout his career. The first faculty member to teach herpetology at Berkeley, he wrote new lab manuals, created the herpetology teaching collection, and co-taught a popular course on vertebrate natural history.|$|E

5|$|Ralph Vary Chamberlin (January 3, 1879October 31, 1967) was an American biologist, ethnographer, and {{historian}} from Salt Lake City, Utah. He was {{a faculty member}} of the University of Utah for over 25 years, where he helped establish the School of Medicine and served as its first dean, and later became head of the <b>zoology</b> department. He also taught at Brigham Young University and the University of Pennsylvania, and worked {{for over a decade}} at the Museum of Comparative <b>Zoology</b> at Harvard University, where he described species from around the world.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance zoologists {{made use}} of Aristotle's <b>zoology</b> in two ways. Especially in Italy, {{scholars}} such as Pietro Pomponazzi and Agostino Nifo lectured and wrote commentaries on Aristotle. Elsewhere, authors used Aristotle {{as one of their}} sources, alongside their own and their colleagues' observations, to create new encyclopedias such as Konrad Gessner's 1551 Historia Animalium. The title and the philosophical approach were Aristotelian, but the work was largely new. Edward Wotton similarly helped to found modern <b>zoology</b> by arranging the animals according to Aristotle's theories, separating out folklore from his 1552 De differentiis animalium.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} inferred {{the position}} of the South Magnetic Pole, and made substantial observations of the <b>zoology</b> and botany of the region, resulting in a monograph on the <b>zoology,</b> and a series of four detailed monographs by Hooker on the botany, collectively called Flora Antarctica and published in parts between 1843 and 1859. The expedition was the last major voyage of exploration made wholly under sail.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>Zoology</b> Museum at Dundee became neglected {{after his}} move to St Andrews. In 1956 the building, {{which it was}} housed in, was scheduled for demolition and the museum collection was dispersed, with some parts going to the British Museum. A teaching collection was retained and forms {{the core of the}} University of Dundee's current D'Arcy Thompson <b>Zoology</b> Museum.|$|E
5|$|The park {{also has}} {{potential}} for the research in many scientific areas, such as: meteorology, geology, glaciology, botany, limnology, <b>zoology,</b> ecology, and wildlife management.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for some}} 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on <b>zoology</b> was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on <b>zoology</b> form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|Educated at {{home until}} she was seven, Bishop then went to a private {{elementary}} school {{until the age of}} nine. In 1909, then ten years old, she entered the progressive Fielden School in her hometown of Manchester, where she studied for three years. She completed her high school education at the Manchester High School for Girls. Though Bishop intended to study chemistry, her lack of education in physics meant that she could not pursue her preferred course in the Honours School of Chemistry. Instead, she matriculated at Manchester University in October 1918 to study botany, chemistry, and <b>zoology.</b> That first-year course in <b>zoology</b> sparked her lifelong interest in and commitment to the field. She graduated with honours from the School of <b>Zoology,</b> receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1921; she received her master's degree in 1922. During her undergraduate years, under the tutelage of the helminthologist R.A. Wardle and the protozoologist Geoffrey Lapage, Bishop studied ciliates acquired from local ponds.|$|E
5|$|Furniss {{graduated}} LSU with {{an academic}} major in <b>zoology</b> on a pre-medical track, and {{grade point averages}} above 3.5 {{in each of his}} last three years. He took his laboratory courses during the fall semester, so they did not distract from the baseball season in the spring semester.|$|E

5|$|In 1880 Nansen {{passed his}} {{university}} entrance examination, the examen artium. He decided to study <b>zoology,</b> claiming {{later that he}} chose the subject {{because he thought it}} offered the chance of a life in the open air. He began his studies at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania early in 1881.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Kincaid {{was hired}} as a {{lecturer}} in biology at the University of Washington. The following year he was promoted to assistant professor and made chairman of the university's newly created <b>zoology</b> department, a position he would continue to hold until his retirement 35 years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, English ornithologist Daniel T. Holyoak {{described}} {{some small}} parrot bones {{that he had}} discovered among a collection of broad-billed parrot (Lophopsittacus mauritianus) subfossils in the <b>Zoology</b> Museum of Cambridge University. These remains had been collected by Louis Etienne Thirioux in the early 20th century, who had found them in a cave on Le Pouce mountain, on the Mascarene island of Mauritius. They {{were placed in the}} <b>zoology</b> museum by 1908. Apart from their size and robustness, Holyoak did not find the bones to be distinct from those of the Mascarene parrot genera Lophopsittacus, Mascarinus (the Mascarene parrot), Necropsittacus (the Rodrigues parrot), and Psittacula (which had two or three other species inhabiting the Mascarene islands). Because of their similarities, Holyoak considered all these genera to be closely related.|$|E

5|$|Rasmussen is {{a visiting}} {{assistant}} professor of <b>zoology,</b> and assistant museum curator of mammalogy and ornithology, at Michigan State University, having formerly been a research associate for the eminent American ornithologist S. Dillon Ripley at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. She {{is a member of}} the American Ornithologists Union (AOU) Committee on Classification and Nomenclature, a scientific associate with the bird group of the British Natural History Museum <b>zoology</b> section at Tring, and an associate editor of The Ibis, the scientific journal of the British Ornithologists' Union. Pamela Rasmussen is married to Dr Michael D. Gottfried, who is Curator of Paleontology, Associate Professor of Geology, and Director of the Center for Integrative Studies in General Science at MSU.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins {{was also}} {{committed}} {{to education and}} conservation. He made appearances on the TV series Science in Action, traveled to Asia to promote science education, and chaired a U.C. elementary school science project which recommended that science be taught to children as early as six. In conjunction with the Sierra Club he produced two educational films: Nature Next Door (1962) and No Room for Wilderness? (1967). Stebbins co-authored revisions of the widely used textbooks General <b>Zoology</b> (5th ed.,1972; 6th ed., 1979) and Elements of <b>Zoology</b> (4th ed., 1974), books originally written by Tracy Storer and Robert Usinger.|$|E
5|$|Struthers became popularly {{famous for}} his {{dissection}} of the Tay Whale, his largest specimen. It {{was one of a}} wide range of specimens of many species that he energetically collected to form a museum of <b>zoology,</b> to illustrate Darwin's theories.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals had a {{powerful}} influence on <b>zoology</b> for some two thousand years. It {{continued to be a}} primary source of knowledge until in the sixteenth century zoologists including Conrad Gessner, all influenced by Aristotle, wrote their own studies of the subject.|$|E
5|$|The Xinyi Xiangfayao was Su's best-known treatise, but the polymath {{compiled}} {{other works}} as well. He completed a large celestial atlas of several star maps, several terrestrial maps, {{as well as}} a treatise on pharmacology.

5|$|The expedition's zoological discoveries {{included}} {{a collection of}} birds. They were described and illustrated by George Robert Gray and Richard Bowdler Sharpe in The <b>Zoology</b> of the Voyage of HMS Erebus & HMS Terror.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is divided}} into 37 books, {{organised}} into ten volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, human physiology, <b>zoology,</b> botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, painting, and precious stones.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to UC Berkeley in 1936, Eakin was {{appointed}} instructor of <b>zoology,</b> becoming assistant professor in 1940 and full professor in 1949. He was assistant dean of the College of Letters and Science from 1940 to 1943, {{and chairman of the}} Department of <b>Zoology</b> from 1942 to 1948, and again from 1952 to 1957. As an administrator he helped found the university's Bodega Marine Laboratory, Sagehen Creek Field Station, and Cancer Research Genetics Laboratory. In 1956 he published a history of zoological research at Berkeley spanning the period from the university's 1868 founding through 1956, followed by a 1988 companion article covering the intervening 32 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{skeleton}} of Deinonychus, including bones {{from the original}} (and most complete) AMNH 3015 specimen, {{can be seen on}} display at the American Museum of Natural History, with another specimen (MCZ 4371) on display at the Museum of Comparative <b>Zoology</b> at Harvard University. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens. Even these two skeletal mounts are lacking elements, including the sterna, sternal ribs, furcula, and gastralia.|$|E
