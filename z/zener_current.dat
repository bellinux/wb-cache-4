5000|$|A Zener diode, when {{reverse biased}} (as {{shown in the}} circuit) has a {{constant}} voltage drop across it irrespective of the current flowing through it. Thus, {{as long as the}} <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> (...) is above a certain level (called holding current), the voltage across the Zener diode (...) will be constant. Resistor, R1, supplies the <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> and the base current (...) of NPN transistor (Q1). The constant Zener voltage is applied across the base of Q1 and emitter resistor, R2.|$|E
5000|$|This {{regulator}} is {{used for}} very simple low-power applications where the currents involved are very small and the load is permanently connected across the Zener diode (such as voltage reference or voltage source circuits). Once R1 has been calculated, removing R2 will allow the full load current (plus the <b>Zener</b> <b>current)</b> through the diode and may exceed the diode's maximum current rating, thereby damaging it. The regulation of this circuit is also not very good because the <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> (and hence the Zener voltage) will vary depending on [...] and inversely depending on the load current. In some designs, the Zener diode may be replaced with another similarly functioning device, especially in an ultra-low-voltage scenario, like (under forward bias) several normal diodes or LEDs in series.|$|E
5000|$|The image shows {{a simple}} shunt voltage {{regulator}} that operates {{by way of the}} Zener diode's action of maintaining a constant voltage across itself when the current through it is sufficient to take it into the Zener breakdown region.

R1 can be calculated as , where [...] is the Zener voltage, and IR2 is the required load current.|$|E
40|$|The Landauer-Buettiker {{formalism}} {{combined with}} the tight-binding transfer matrix method is {{used to describe the}} results of recent experiments: the high tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in (Ga,Mn) As-based trilayers and highly polarized spin injection in p-(Ga,Mn) As/n-GaAs Zener diode. For both TMR and <b>Zener</b> spin <b>current</b> polarization, the calculated values agree well with those observed experimentally. The role played in the spin dependent tunneling by carrier concentration and magnetic ion content is also studied. Comment: 4 paker, 2 figures, submited to Phisica...|$|R
40|$|By the {{insertion}} of thin InGaN layers into Nitrogen-polar GaN p-n junctions, polarization-induced Zener tunnel junctions are studied. The reverse-bias interband <b>Zener</b> tunneling <b>current</b> {{is found to be}} weakly temperature dependent, as opposed to the strongly temperature-dependent forward bias current. This indicates tunneling as the primary reverse-bias current transport mechanism. The Indium composition in the InGaN layer is systematically varied to demonstrate the increase in the interband tunneling current. Comparing the experimentally measured tunneling currents to a model helps identify the specific challenges in potentially taking such junctions towards nitride-based polarization-induced tunneling field-effect transistors.

50|$|EL wire - {{in common}} {{with other types of}} EL devices - does have limitations: at high {{frequency}} it dissipates a lot of heat, and that can lead to breakdown and loss of brightness over time. Because the wire is unshielded and typically operates at a relatively high voltage, EL wire can produce high-frequency interference (corresponding to the frequency of the oscillator) that can be picked up by sensitive audio equipment, such as guitar pickups. There is also a voltage limit: typical EL wire breaks down at around 180V p-p, so if using an unregulated transformer back to back, <b>zeners</b> and series <b>current</b> limiting resistors are essential.|$|R
5000|$|Adding an emitter {{follower}} stage {{to the simple}} shunt regulator forms a simple series voltage regulator and substantially improves the regulation of the circuit. Here, the load current IR2 is supplied by the transistor whose base is now connected to the Zener diode. Thus the transistor's base current (IB) forms the load current for the Zener diode and is {{much smaller than the}} current through R2. This regulator is classified as [...] "series" [...] because the regulating element, viz., the transistor, appears in series with the load.R1 sets the <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> (IZ) and is determined as [...] where, VZ is the Zener voltage, IB is the transistor's base current, K = 1.2 to 2 (to ensure that R1 is low enough for adequate IB) and [...] where, IR2 is the required load current and is also the transistor's emitter current (assumed to be equal to the collector current) and hFE(min) is the minimum acceptable DC current gain for the transistor.|$|E
40|$|A general {{framework}} {{to calculate the}} <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> in an indirect semiconductor with an externally applied potential is provided. Assuming a parabolic valence and conduction band dispersion, the semiconductor is in equilibrium {{in the presence of}} the external field as long as the electronphonon interaction is absent. The linear response to the electron-phonon interaction results in a non-equilibrium system. The Zener tunneling current is calculated from the number of electrons making the transition from valence to conduction band per unit time. A convenient expression based on the single particle spectral functions is provided, enabling the numerical calculation of the <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> under any three-dimensional potential profile. For a one dimensional potential profile an analytical expression is obtained for the current in a bulk semiconductor, a semiconductor under uniform field and a semiconductor under a non-uniform field using the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation. The obtained results agree with the Kane result in the low field limit. A numerical example for abrupt p - n diodes with different doping concentrations is given, from which it can be seen that the uniform field model is a better approximation than the WKB model but a direct numerical treatment is required for low bias conditions.

40|$|Abstract. Zener diodes {{are widely}} used in {{electrical}} barriers to protect equipment operating in a potentially explosive atmosphere. Although normally not conducting, the zeners must have a high power rating so that their junction temperature meets safety factors when shunting the maximum fuse current. This often requires two or three lower voltage commercial zeners connected in series. Silicon carbide diodes have much higher thermal conductivity and maximum allowed junction temperature, so {{it should be possible}} to use one SiC zener in the place of two or three commercial diodes and/or allow use of higher fuse ratings. Low voltage SiC Zener diodes were fabricated and tested to evaluate potential benefits of their application as a component of intrinsically safe barriers. The diodes demonstrated mixed avalanche-tunnel breakdown at reverse bias voltages of 23 V with positive temperature coefficients of breakdown voltages of about 0. 4 mV/°C. The diodes with mesa area of 4 × 10 - 4 cm 2 had maximum DC <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> of 1. 2 A and were capable of operating at ambient temperatures up to 500 °C...|$|E
30|$|A <b>Zener</b> diode allows <b>current</b> flow in {{the forward}} {{direction}} like a normal diode, {{but also in the}} reverse direction if the voltage is larger than the breakdown voltage known as a “zener voltage”. So {we usually use ‘so’ in speaking in the beginning, but in academic writing {{it would be better to}} use sentence linkers such as ‘therefore’ or ‘thus’. You may also try to use some of grammatical metaphors: This results in limiting the input voltage … and by doing so you will have the same focus in the sentence and would not need to use ‘by the zener diode’} the input voltage is limited from 10  V to 6.8 by the zener diode.|$|R

40|$|Avalanche photodetectors (APDs) are key {{components}} in optical communication systems {{due to their}} increased photocurrent gain and short response time as compared to conventional photodetectors. A detector design where the multiplication region is implemented in a large band gap material is desired to avoid detrimental <b>Zener</b> tunneling leakage <b>currents,</b> a concern otherwise in smaller band gap materials required for absorption at 1. 3 / 1. 55 μm. Self-assembled III-V semiconductor nanowires offer key advantages such as enhanced absorption due to optical resonance effects, strain-relaxed heterostructures, and compatibility with mainstream silicon technology. Here, we present electrical and optical characteristics of single InP and InP/InAsP nanowire APD structures. Temperature-dependent breakdown characteristics of p+-n-n+ InP nanowire devices were investigated first. A clear trap-induced shift in breakdown voltage was inferred from I-V measurements. An improved contact formation to the p+-InP segment was observed upon annealing, {{and its effect on}} breakdown characteristics was investigated. The band gap in the absorption region was subsequently varied from pure InP to InAsP to realize spatially separate absorption and multiplication APDs in heterostructure nanowires. In contrast to the homojunction APDs, no trap-induced shifts were observed for the heterostructure APDs. A gain of 12 was demonstrated for selective optical excitation of the InAsP segment. Additional electron-beam-induced current measurements were carried out to investigate the effect of local excitation along the nanowire on the I-V characteristics. Simulated band profiles and electric field distributions support our interpretation of the experiments. Our results provide important insight for optimization of avalanche photodetector devices based on III-V nanowires...|$|R
40|$|We present {{experimental}} {{evidence for the}} formation of localized Wannier-Stark states in the depletion region of low band-gap InAs/(GaIn) Sb superlattice (SL) infrared photodiodes. In the photocurrent spectra of reverse-biased photodiodes, maxima are observed, that spectrally shift when the strength of the electric field in the depletion region of the diode is changed. Taking into account the spatially indirect type-II nature of interband transitions in InAs/(GaIn) Sb SL's, the spectral positions of the observed maxima can be explained in the framework of localized Wannier-Stark states. Besides photocurrent spectra, the, current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the diodes were investigated. In the reverse-bias regime dominated by Zener tunneling the differential resistance of the diodes reveals an oscillatory behavior. These oscillations are due to a resonant enhancement of the Zener tunneling current by Wannier-Stark states in the depletion region of the SL diode. A model is presented that quantitatively describes the occurrence of the oscillations in the I-V curves. In addition, the influence of a magnetic field on the Wannier-Stark oscillations in the <b>Zener</b> <b>current</b> was investigated. While the period of the oscillations in the I-V curves is conserved, the resonances are shifted, reflecting the energy shift introduced in the Wannier-Stark states by the magnetic field. This voltage shift exhibits a strong dependence on the magnetic-field orientation...|$|E
40|$|Modeling of {{the effects}} {{occurring}} outside the usual region of application of semiconductor devices is becoming more important with increasing demands set upon electronic systems for simultaneous speed and output power. Analog integrated circuit designers are forced to enter regimes of transistor operation that are close to or within the device breakdown. They use compact models that describe device behavior in {{an efficient way to}} predict a designed circuit performance. Using modern heterojunction bipolar transistors with superb maximum unity current gain and maximum unity power gain frequencies, necessarily brings with it ever lower breakdown voltages. Impact ionization that causes avalanche multiplication has a profound impact on power amplifiers and plays a dominant role in the region of high output voltages, necessary for driving antennas of modern (ultra) wideband wireless systems. On the other hand, digital circuit designs mostly suffer from high transistor leakage current that {{in the state of the}} art digital solutions takes up significant portion of the total power dissipation of a digital system. Therefore, it is of essence for digital integrated circuit designers to posses an accurate prediction of the leakages so that they may continue to grasp benefits of transistor downscaling. In this thesis, starting from impact ionization, firstly, physics behind this phenomenon is studied. Frequency limitations of avalanche models are analytically derived in Chapter 2. A derivation is followed by the description of usual approaches for addressing impact ionization effects in semiconductor devices. Emphasized is the most frequently used, impact ionization rates approximation. The last part of the chapter is reserved for compact modeling of avalanche multiplication in semiconductor devices. This chapter presents a foundation for the two chapters that follow. Chapter 3 focuses on quasidistributed bipolar transistor model reduction techniques. This model type is employed to describe complex multidimensional vertical current pinch-in effects that may occur in transistors biased within the avalanche region. A simplification method for the model is introduced, based on an implementation of bilinear approximation. Excellent matches between the original and reduced model are obtained. The model complexity is reduced from quadratic to linear dependency on size, nevertheless, the speed gain is not that dramatic. Implications of impact ionization on bipolar transistors in terms of working in the small alternating signal environment are explored next. Specifically, in such cases avalanche characterization is important in order to proceed with deeper analysis. Chapter 4 gives a derivation proof that avalanche in the small signal drive conditions may be studied by observing the real parts of admittance parameters when transistor is viewed through its two-port network representation. Addressed are the needs for an accurate modeling of such regimes. Repercussions of avalanche on some important intrinsic active device properties from circuit design prospective are discussed in general. Collapse of unilateral power gain and increase of transistor stability are demonstrated and physically explained through the concept of intrinsic avalanche-induced negative feedback. The frequency above which avalanche effects in small signal conditions can be neglected is identified. A description of a novel model for the band-to-band tunneling current in p-n junctions is shown in Chapter 5. The presented work consists of the model physical foundations, implementation and finally its verification against state of the art industrial and modern in-house device measurements. The developed tunneling breakdown model is fully physics-based and may be used both in bipolar as well as in field-effect compact transistor models. It is smooth in a mathematical sense on a whole real domain, thus escaping any potential solver convergence problems. The derived model features increased efficiency without compromising accuracy since it is not evaluated in the forward bias regime where the <b>Zener</b> tunneling <b>current</b> identically equals zero. Innovative parametrization of the model equation (in a statistical sense) drastically reduces the influence of randomness inevitably present in the measured data on which parameters are estimated, on dispersion of the extracted parameter values. As a consequence scaling over geometry and temperature is greatly improved. Parameter extraction techniques in compact modeling in general have a crucial role. However, if several extraction methodologies for estimation of certain model parameter(s) exist, it is not trivial to select the best, that is, the preferred one. It is even unclear how ``the best'' strategy should be defined. Chapter 6 is devoted to this important topic, namely the analysis of parameter extraction strategies and parameter optimization. Since this thesis concentrates on modeling of breakdown phenomena that are driven by the electric field within the p-n junction's space charge region, accent is drawn to the p-n junction parameters and their estimation methodologies. More precisely, obtaining parameters of the depletion capacitance and ideal diode current compact model parameters is covered in detail. The estimation strategies are compared in statistical terms which provide an insight in how the two, or more, can be assessed and compared, and which one would be more suitable for use in practice. In particular, it is demonstrated that it is much favorable to extract parameters simultaneously with their (temperature) scaling parameter rather than separately. Additionally, an approach to assess statistical properties of an arbitrary parameter extraction strategy and demonstrate the merits of such assessments is presented.
