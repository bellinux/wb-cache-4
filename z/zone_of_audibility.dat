50|$|An {{additional}} effect is also important. As far as returning a wave to the ground, {{the velocity of}} {{the wind in the}} direction of propagation can be added to the velocity relative to the air. Since the temperature maximum is indeed about equal to the ground temperature, a wind in the direction of propagation will encourage return to the ground, while a contrary wind will oppose it. It was, indeed, found that in the winter, when the stratospheric winds were westerly in Europe, there was a zone of anomalous audibility to the east, but none to the west. In the summer, when the winds were reversed, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> was moved to the west. On occasion, a second zone of silence and a second zone of anomalous audibility were observed, the sound making a double skip. Surface winds will have no strong effect, except in the launching of the wave.|$|E
50|$|The present-day {{standard}} atmosphere has a ground temperature of 288K, stratospheric temperature 217K at 12 km, {{with an increase}} beginning at 25 km, and a maximum temperature of 283K at 50 km. It is clear that Whipple's results {{are very close to}} the truth. They were the very first good measurements of temperatures in the upper atmosphere. Whipple carried out further experiments with gunfire. A gun at Shoeburyness could be heard at Grantham, 185 km away to the north. Guns were fired from three points just east of London, and sounds were received at Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Nottingham, Exeter and North Walsham, using hot-wire microphones. An array of three microphones, with accurate time measurements, allowed the determination of the angle of incidence. Experiments were carried out in December, 1932 with four explosions at Oldebroek in Holland, showing the expected <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> to the east, and none to the west.|$|E
50|$|A munitions factory at Silvertown, an {{industrial}} {{area in the}} East London Docks on the north bank of the Thames, exploded in January 1917. It could be heard in an elliptical area with a major axis of about 150 km in the NW-SE direction, and a minor axis of about 50 km, centred {{on the site of}} the explosion. This is the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> normal <b>audibility.</b> Beyond, in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> silence, the explosion was not heard. About 120 km to the northeast, in Lincolnshire and Norfolk, the explosion was again heard, in a similar but somewhat larger elliptical area, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> anomalous <b>audibility.</b> In this region, the report was multiple, consisting of two or more bangs at brief intervals, a consequence of multiple paths.|$|R
50|$|An {{apparently}} different phenomenon {{was first}} noticed in 1666, during an engagement of the English and Dutch fleets in the Channel on 1 June. The {{sounds of the}} guns were heard in London, {{but not on the}} South Downs, Deal or Dover, all points between the battle and London. This was recorded in the diaries of John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys as a remarkable occurrence, that the winds brought to them the noise of the guns, but not to the people in between. In 1904 a large explosion at FÃ¶rde in western Germany was accompanied by similar results. There was a small area in which the sound arrived directly, then a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> silence, and finally the sound was heard again, at a distance of 100 to 200 km from its source. G. von der Borne explained this as the return of an acoustic wave reflected from a hydrogen or helium zone in the upper atmosphere, and he was supported by van Everdingen, who observed large explosions {{in the early stages of}} the World War. It was remarked that the noise of guns firing in Flanders could often be heard in the east of England, especially in the summer, but rarely in winter. When explosions were later made for the explicit purpose of investigating this effect, it was found that the apparent time of propagation showed that the waves reaching the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> abnormal <b>audibility</b> had travelled on a path considerably longer than the direct one. It became clear that the sound was being reflected in the upper atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the sufficient perceptual cues used in the recognition of four voiceless fricative consonants [s, f,, f] followed by the same vowel [i:] in normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adult listeners. Subjects identified the four CV speech tokens in a closed-set response task across a range of presentation levels. Fricative syllables were either produced by a human speaker in the natural stimulus set, or generated by a computer program in the synthetic stimulus set. By comparing conditions in which the subjects were presented with equivalent degrees <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> for individual fricatives, it was possible to isolate the factor <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> from that <b>of</b> loss of suprathreshold discriminability. Results indicate that (a) the frication burst portion may serve as a sufficient cue for correct recognition of voiceless fricatives by normal-hearing subjects, whereas the more intense CV transition portion, though it may not be necessary, can also assist these subjects to distinguish place information, particularly at low presentation levels; (b) hearing-impaired subjects achieved close-to-normal recognition performance when given equivalent degrees <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> <b>of</b> the frication cue, but they obtained poorer-than-normal performance if only given equivalent degrees <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> <b>of</b> the transition cue; (c) the difficulty that hearing-impaired subjects have in perceiving fricatives under normal circumstances may be due to two factors: the lack <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> <b>of</b> the frication cue and the loss of discriminability of the transition cue.

40|$|Sound {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} parameters monitored during the classification of work hygiene. More and more {{attention has been paid to}} the evaluation and management of noise outdoors. Frequent exposure to noise may result in hearing impairment. Exposure to a loud sound results in an acute increase of the threshold <b>of</b> <b>audibility,</b> especially for frequencies similar to those of the given sound. However, the hearing goes back to normal after a certain period of time. Repeated exposure to the high intensity sounds shifts the threshold <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> gradually but permanently upwards. The loss of hearing gradually excludes people from regular life and forces them to compensate their disability. As a preventive measure in the working environment the employers shall provide to their employees hearing protection aids in order to eliminate such cases. The main objective of this thesis was to prove the harmful effect of noise on hearing in the working environment and to propose potential solutions.

This bachelor thesis deals with a survey <b>of</b> thresholds <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> among workers <b>of</b> an engineering factory, depending on various noise conditions in the working environment. Audiometric curves of persons exposed the sound intensity exceeding 85 dB for a prolonged period of time were taken immediately after the exposure (after the working hours).

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate how audibility influences speech recognition and measures of working memory in children with normal hearing. Specifically, audibility limitations related to background noise and limited bandwidth were analyzed, as these factors are characteristic of the listening conditions encountered by children with hearing loss who wear hearing aids. ^ In the first study, speech recognition was measured for 117 children and 18 adults with normal hearing. Stimulus bandwidth {{and the level of}} background noise were varied systematically in order to evaluate predictions <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> based on the Speech Intelligibility Index. Results suggested that children with normal hearing required greater audibility to reach the same level of speech understanding as normal-hearing adults. However, differences in performance between adults and children did not vary across frequency bands as anticipated. ^ In the second study, 18 children with normal hearing completed two tasks of working memory to examine how background noise and limited bandwidth might limit memory processes in children. In a non-word repetition task, significant reductions in speech recognition and increases in response time were observed for both the noise and limited bandwidth conditions. These results suggest that listening effort increased and phoneme recall decreased when the speech signal was degraded. For recall of real words, no differences in recognition were observed for two conditions with the same signal-to-noise ratio but differing bandwidths. However, recall was significantly inhibited in the limited bandwidth condition, supporting the hypothesis that a limited bandwidth may negatively impact working memory performance in children, even when recognition is preserved. ^ Collectively, these studies suggest that methods <b>of</b> calculating <b>audibility</b> based on adults are likely to be inadequate for predicting speech recognition and listening effort for children. Models <b>of</b> <b>audibility</b> that incorporate the linguistic and cognitive dynamics of children are necessary to maximize communication outcomes for children with hearing loss. ...|$|R
