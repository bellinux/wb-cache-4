5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare <b>zones</b> <b>in</b> other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{animal and}} plant life {{correspond}} to the three climatic <b>zones.</b> <b>In</b> the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and acacia trees grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing.

5|$|In the USA, The Smithsonian Institution {{developed}} {{its network}} of observers {{over much of}} the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards.

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the occupation, the Allies {{controlled}} traffic between the zones to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western and Soviet <b>zones</b> <b>in</b> 1946 to stem a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6million Germans left the Soviet zone for the west.|$|E

Three <b>zones</b> were agreed on, each covering roughly a third of Germany's territories: a British <b>zone</b> <b>in</b> the north-west, an American <b>zone</b> <b>in</b> the south and a Soviet <b>zone</b> <b>in</b> the East.

5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian <b>zones</b> <b>in</b> the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
5|$|Results of an mtDNA {{analysis}} of 55 jungle cats from various biogeographic <b>zones</b> <b>in</b> India indicate a high genetic variation and {{a relatively low}} differentiation between populations. It appears that the central Indian F. c. kutas population separates the Thar F. c. prateri populations from the rest and also the south Indian F. c. kelaarti populations from the north Indian F. c. affinis ones. The central Indian populations are genetically closer to the southern than to the northern populations.|$|E
