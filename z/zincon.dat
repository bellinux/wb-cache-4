5000|$|Prell was {{introduced}} by Procter & Gamble in 1947. The original formula was a clear green concentrate packaged in a tube. In 1955 Prell was marketed for women [...] "who want their hair to have that radiantly alive look". A woman held the Prell bottle with her hands on both sides, {{directly in front of}} her face. [...] Prell and Head & Shoulders, also made by Procter & Gamble, were the two best-selling shampoos in the United States in June 1977. Procter & Gamble had the highest advertising budget in the shampoo industry. The firm of Wells, Rich, Greene carried out advertising for Prell. Prior to December 1, 1973, Prell billings was coordinated by Benton & Bowles. In advertisements the quasi-liquid Prell would induce a pearl to sink slowly to the bottom of a container. Procter & Gamble sold the brand to Prestige Brands International in November 1999. Prestige then sold Prell, along with its other two shampoo brands, Denorex and <b>Zincon,</b> to Ultimark Products in October 2009 in order to focus more on their two larger segments: over-the-counter healthcare and household cleaning products. In July 2016, Scott's Liquid Gold-Inc. acquired Prell, along with the Denorex and <b>Zincon</b> brands, from Ultimark products.|$|E

The analytical characteristics of the methodology such as pH of standard/sample solution, nitric acid concentration, the placement of SPE column within the manifold and preconcentration flow rate were studied.

The system consists of a glass column containing 200 mg of Dowex 1 X 8 resin modified with 1 % (w/w) of <b>zincon.</b> The recovery of the metal was quantitative at pH 7. 0 to 8. 0 {{with the use of}} a potassium dihydrogen-phosphate/sodium hydroxide buffer solution. The colored complex was eluted from the column with 10. 0 mL of a 0. 1 mol L(- 1) HNO(3) solution.

40|$|A {{disposable}} sensor {{has been}} developed for the measurement of copper(II) concentration in aqueous solution based on {{a change in the}} fluorescence of porphyrazine 2, 7, 12, 17 -tetra-tert-butyl- 5, 10, 15, 20 -tetraaza- 21 H, 23 H-porphine (TP). The sensor was constructed by spin-coating a polyester support with a PVC solution containing TP, a plasticizer, the chelating agent <b>Zincon</b> and the ion-pairing benzetonium chloride. The measurement principle is based on the radiationless resonance energy transfer (RET) from TP immobilized in membrane, and acting as fluorescence donor, to <b>Zincon</b> acting as an acceptor induced by copper(II). The absorption spectrum of the Zincon–Cu(II) complex presents adequate overlapping with the emission spectrum of TP, producing a useful analytical signal by the RET process. The disposable sensor responds to copper(II) irreversibly over a dynamic range from 0. 039 to 14 �mol L − 1 (2. 5 – 890 �gL − 1) with a sensor-tosensor reproducibility (relative standard deviation RSD) of 1. 9 %, as log a Cu 2 +, at the medium level of the range and a response time of 10 min.

40|$|A {{differential}} decomplexation technic for {{the determination}} of serum zinc in fil-trates was studied. It involved the masking of zinc, copper, and iron {{by the addition of}} cyanide to a buffered aliquot of an acid filtrate, followed first by the destruction of the excess cyanide and then the cyanide attached to zinc. The release of ionic zinc allowed reaction with the color reagent to take place. Quantitation with internal blanking was thereby accomplished before interference by other cations became possible. SCHEMES for the analysis of zinc in serum usually employ the extrac-tion of the zinc-dithizone complex (1 - 5). However, no procedure of this type has achieved status as a readily available clinical tool. A monopha sic dithizone system has been proposed, but it requires a special trapezoidal cuvet with a 50 -mm. light path to produce rela-tively insensitive absorbance data (6). Although <b>zincon</b> (2 -carboxy- 2 ’-hydroxy-S’sulfoformazylbenzene) is a sensitive reagent for the de-termination of zinc, it has seen limited application because many other cations also react with this compound. A technic involving dif-ferential (lecomplexation proposed a determination for zinc in water containing zincon-interfering metals (7). It took advantage of this fact: when the cyanide complexes of the trace metals are formed, the cyanide bound to zinc can he preferentially destroyed by chloral hy-drate (8. 6). The demasking technic enables the liberated zinc to form a reproducibly measurable complex with <b>zincon</b> so that subse-quent spectrophotometry under carefully controlled conditions can be achieved before another metal is liberated to interfere with the reac...|$|E

A key feature is the incorpo-ration of zinc ions, both to fully optimize the assay and to reduce the sensitivity of measured activity to zinc-binding impurities in the buffer, 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol. In addition, a simple technique is described for measuring relative concentrations of zinc-binding impurities in this buffer.

Absorbances can be read directly on the solid phase at 621. 5 mn.

To this end, we compared Zn localization in Noccaea caerulescens growing in its natural environment, a zinc/lead mine tailing, with that in hydroponically grown plants of the same origin. Methods Zinc concentrations in plants and soil were determined by flame AAS and Zn localization in leaf tissues was studied using Zn indicators <b>Zincon</b> and Zinpyr- 1. Results The mean Zn concentration in plants at the mine tailings was around 15, 000 mg/kg DW, which corresponded well with the Zn concentration in the leaves of plants grown at 1600 μM Zn in the nutrient solution. The Zn distribution patterns in leaves of plants sampled from the mine and plants grown in hydroponics were identical. Zn-dependent staining was the most intensive in water-storage epidermal cells, guard cells and vascular bundles, and less intensive in subsidiary and mesophyll cells.

40|$|Passive {{sampling}} is {{a useful}} method for contaminant analysis and monitoring, and of the techniques available the Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films (DGT) technique is particularly applicable for use in transition metal studies. However, analysis of the metal-accumulating DGT 'binding phase' is typically expensive and time consuming, which limits the technique's application. In order to improve on the cost and speed of analysis, and to allow in-field analysis, a colorimetric binding phase was developed. By employing metallochromic reagents adsorbed onto ion-exchange resins a colour change was obtained {{as a result of}} the binding of metal ions, with the degree of change being proportional to the quantity of complexed metal. This reagent-adsorbed resin was immobilised on adhesive paper labels to provide a robust, cheap and effective colorimetric binding phase. Quantification of metal loading on these binding phases was undertaken through use of UV-Vis reflectance or Computer Imaging Densitometry (CID), the latter employing a flat-bed scanner for improved ease of analysis. Analytically robust metal quantification was found to be achievable using these methods, with the CID method equivalent in performance to the reflectance method. The use of a variety of metallochromic reagents was explored, with different reagents noted to provide colorimetric responses for different metal ions. A typical detection limit, provided by Methylthymol Blue adsorbed to Dowex 1 x 8 resin, was 10 ng Cu(II) per cm- 2 of disc area. Linear response was seen up to a stoichiometrically defined metal loading, typically providing a linear response from the detection limit to 2 µg of Cu(II) per cm- 2.

40|$|The human innate {{immune system}} {{responds}} to bacterial and fungal pathogens by releasing the metal-chelating protein calprotectin (CP) at sites of infection and in the upper layers of the epidermis. CP is a Mn(II) - and Zn(ll) -binding protein. The work described in this thesis elucidates the metal-binding properties of CP, and correlates these properties with in vitro growth inhibition of bacteria and fungi. We report that the metal-binding properties of CP are modulated by Ca(ll), and we propose a working model in which CP responds to physiological Ca(Il) -ion gradients to become a potent Zn(ll) - and Mn(Il) -chelating agent in the extracellular space. Individual chapter summaries follow. Chapter 1 : Bioinorganic Chemistry of the Host Pathogen Interaction. Transition metal ions are required for all forms of life. During the course of infection, pathogenic microorganisms must acquire transition metals from the host. Three metals of interest from this standpoint are iron, zinc, and manganese. This chapter describes bacterial metal-ion homeostasis machineries, and metal-requiring processes {{with a focus on}} Zn(II) and Mn(II). This chapter then highlights the S 100 family of Ca(ll) -binding proteins and discuses the Zn(Il) -, Cu(ll) -, and Mn(Il) -binding properties of S 100 B, S 100 A 12, S 100 A 7, S 10 OA 15, and S 100 A 8 /S 100 A 9. Finally, an overview of the scope of this thesis is presented. Chapter 2 : Calcium Ion Gradients Modulate the Zinc(Il) Affinity and Antibacterial Activity of Human Calprotectin. Calprotectin (CP) is a human neutrophil protein that is produced and released by neutrophils at sites of infection, where it prevents the growth of microorganisms by sequestering bioavailable zinc(II) and manganese(II). In this chapter, we present metalbinding studies to elucidate the Zn(ll) -binding properties of CP. We report unique optical absorption and EPR spectroscopic signatures for the interfacial His 3 Asp and His 4 sites of human CP by using Co(II) as a spectroscopic probe. Zinc competition titrations employing colorimetric and fluorimetric Zn(II) sensors establish that CP coordinates two Zn(II) ions / CP heterodimer. The Ca(ll) -insensitive Zn(ll) sensor ZP 4 is used to determine the Kd of CP for Zn(II) in Ca(Il) -deplete and Ca(Il) -replete conditions. These competition titrations afford apparent Kdsitel = 133 58 pM and Kdsite 2 = 185 219 nM in the absence of Ca(II). In the presence of excess Ca(Il) these values decrease to Kd,sitel 5 10 pM and Kd,site 2 : 240 pM. In vitro antibacterial assays indicate that the metal-binding sites and Ca(ll) -replete conditions are required to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. We propose a model in which Ca(II) ion gradients modulate the antibacterial activity and Zn(Il) -binding properties of human CP. Chapter 3 : High-Affinity Manganese Coordination by Human Calprotectin Is Calcium- Dependent and Requires the Histidine-Rich Site at the Dimer Interface. In this chapter, we report that the His 4 motif at the S 10 OA 8 /S 100 A 9 dimer interface of CP is required for high-affinity Mn(II) coordination. We identify a low-temperature EPR spectroscopic signal for this site that is consistent with high-spin Mn(II) in an octahedral coordination sphere. This site could be simulated with zero-field splitting parameters D = 270 MHz and EID = 0. 30 (E = 81 MHz). This analysis, combined with studies of mutant proteins, suggests that (A 8) Hisl 7, (A 8) His 27, (A 9) His 9 l, (A 9) His 95 and two as-yet unidentified ligands coordinate Mn(ll) at site 2. These studies support a model in which CP responds to Ca(ll) ion gradients to become a potent metal-ion chelator in the extracellular space. Chapter 4 : Contributions of the C-terminal Tail of S 100 A 9 to High-Affinity Manganese Binding by Human Calprotectin. This chapter examines the role of the S 100 A 9 C-terminal tail to high-affinity Mn(ll) coordination by human CP. We present a 16 -member mutant family with mutations in the S 100 A 9 C-terminal tail (residues 96 - 114), which houses three histidine and four acidic residues, to evaluate its contribution to Mn(ll) sequestration. These studies confirm that two His residues at positions 103 and 105 complete the octahedral coordination sphere of CP in solution. Appendix 1 : Sequence Alignments of Transition-Metal Binding S 100 Proteins. Sequence alignments of S 100 A 7, S 100 A 8, S 100 A 9, S 100 A 12, S 100 A 15, and S 100 B proteins from multiple organisms are presented. Appendix 2 : Characterization of CP Mutant Proteins by Circular Dichroism and Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography. Additional characterization of CP and mutant proteins employed in Chapters 2 - 4 is presented. Appendix 3 : Structures of Sensors Used In this Work. The structures of <b>Zincon,</b> MagFura- 2, Zinpyr- 1, and Zinpyr- 4 are presented. Appendix 4 : Manganese Binding Properties of Human Calprotectin under Conditions of High and Low Calcium. This appendix represents a collaborative work with the Drennan Lab (MIT) and Britt Lab (UC Davis) to study the Mn(Il) -CP complex in low- and high-Ca(II) conditions. We report a crystal structure of Mn(Il) -, Ca(Il) -, and Na(l) -bound CP with Mn(II) exclusively coordinated to the His 6 motif. Electron spin-echo envelope modulation and electron-nuclear double resonance experiments demonstrate that the six coordinating histidine residues are spectroscopically equivalent. The observed 15 N (= %/h) y perfine couplings (A) arise from two distinct classes of nitrogen atoms: the coordinating E-nitrogen of the imidazole ring of each histidine (A = [3. 45, 3. 71, 5. 91] MHz) and the distal 6 -nitrogen (A = [0. 11, 0. 18, 0. 42] MHz). In the absence of Ca(II), the affinity of CP for Mn(II) drops by two to three orders of magnitude, and Mn(II) coordinates to the His 6 site as well as other sites on the protein. by Megan Brunjes Brophy.
