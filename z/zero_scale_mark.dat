40|$|This study proposes an {{automatic}} reading approach for a pointer gauge based on computer vision. Moreover, the study aims {{to highlight the}} defects of the current automatic-recognition method of the pointer gauge and introduces a method that uses a coarse-to-fine scheme and has superior performance in the accuracy and stability of its reading identification. First, it uses the region growing method to locate the dial region and its center. Second, it uses an improved central projection method to determine the circular scale region under the polar coordinate system and detect the <b>scale</b> <b>marks.</b> Then, the border detection is implemented in the dial image, and the Hough transform method is used to obtain the pointer direction by means of pointer contour fitting. Finally, {{the reading of the}} gauge is obtained by comparing the location of the pointer with the <b>scale</b> <b>marks.</b> The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This approach is applicable for reading gauges whose <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> are either evenly or unevenly distributed...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} written to facilitate and accelerate the process of measurement by use of the apparatus described in "Optoelectronic Tool Adds <b>Scale</b> <b>Marks</b> to Photographic Images" (KSC- 12201). The tool contains four laser diodes that generate parallel beams of light spaced apart at a known distance. The beams of light are used to project bright spots that serve as <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> that become incorporated into photographic images (including film and electronic images). The sizes of objects depicted in the images can readily be measured by reference to the <b>scale</b> <b>marks.</b> The {{computer program}} is applicable to a scene that contains the laser spots {{and that has been}} imaged in a square pixel format that can be imported into a graphical user interface (GUI) generated by the program.

40|$|A simple, easy-to-use {{optoelectronic}} tool projects <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> {{that become}} incorporated into photographic images (including film and electronic images). The sizes of objects {{depicted in the}} images can readily be measured by reference to the <b>scale</b> <b>marks.</b> The {{role played by the}} <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> projected by this tool is {{the same as that of}} the <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> on a ruler placed in a scene for the purpose of establishing a length scale. However, this tool offers the advantage that it can put <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> quickly and safely in any visible location, including a location in which placement of a ruler would be difficult, unsafe, or time-consuming. The tool (see Figure 1) includes an aluminum housing, within which are mounted four laser diodes that operate at a wavelength of 670 nm. The laser diodes are spaced 1 in. (2. 54 cm) apart along a baseline. The laser diodes are mounted with setscrews, which are used to adjust their beams to make them all parallel to each other and perpendicular to the baseline. During the adjustment process, the effect of the adjustments is observed by measuring the positions of the laser-beam spots on a target 80 ft (approx. 24 m) away. Once the adjustments have been completed, the laser beams define three 1 -in. (2. 54 -cm) intervals and the location of each beam is defined to within 1 / 16 in. (approx. 1. 6 mm) at any target distance out to about 80 ft (approx. 24 m). The distance between the laser-beam spots as seen in an image is strictly defined only along an axis parallel to the baseline and perpendicular to the laser beam (also perpendicular to the line of sight of the camera, assuming that the camera-to-target distance is much greater than the distance between the tool and the camera lens). If a flat target surface illuminated by the laser beams is tilted with respect to the aforesaid axis, then the distance along the target surface between <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> is proportional to the secant of the tilt angle. If one knows the tilt angle, one can correct for it. Even if one does not know the tilt angle precisely, it may not matter: For example, at a tilt of 10, the secant is approximately 1. 0154, so that the tilt error is only about 1. 54 percent, which is negligibly small for a typical application in which only approximate measurements are needed...|$|R
