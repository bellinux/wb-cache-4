60|$|TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.--Parties having need {{of three}} {{thousand}} {{two hundred and}} eleven feet of best quality <b>zinc-plated</b> spiral-twist lightning-rod stuff, and sixteen hundred and thirty-one silver-tipped points, all in tolerable repair (and, although much worn by use, still equal to any ordinary emergency), can hear of a bargain by addressing the publisher.|$|E
6000|$|... [Here the lightning-rod man sent {{up another}} call for me. I {{went down in}} a state of mind {{bordering}} on impatience. He said he would rather have died than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do a job, and that job was expected to be done in a clean, workmanlike manner, and when it was finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he stood so much in need of, and he was about to do it, but looked up and saw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out, and if a thunder-storm were to come up, and that house, which he felt a personal interest in, stood there with nothing on earth to protect it but sixteen lightning-rods--"Let us have peace!" [...] I shrieked. [...] "Put up a hundred and fifty! Put some on the kitchen! Put a dozen on the barn! Put a couple on the cow! Put one on the cook!--scatter them all over the persecuted place till it looks like a <b>zinc-plated,</b> spiral-twisted, silver-mounted canebrake! Move! Use up all the material you can get your hands on, and when you run out of lightning-rods put up ramrods, cam-rods, stair-rods, piston-rods--anything that will pander to your dismal appetite for artificial scenery, and bring respite to my raging brain and healing to my lacerated soul!" [...] Wholly unmoved--further than to smile sweetly--this iron being simply turned back his wrist-bands daintily, and said he would now proceed to hump himself. Well, all that was nearly three hours ago. It is questionable whether I am calm enough yet to write on the noble theme of political economy, but I cannot resist the desire to try, for it is the one subject that is nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of all this world's philosophy.] ...|$|E

50|$|The Cronak {{process is}} a {{conventional}} chromate conversion coating process developed in 1933 by The New Jersey Zinc Company. It involves immersing a zinc or <b>zinc-plated</b> article for 5 to 15 seconds in a chromate solution, typically prepared from sodium dichromate and sulfuric acid. The process was patented in the United States on March 24, 1936 with USPTO number 2,035,380.|$|E
50|$|A DIN rail is a metal rail of a {{standard}} type widely used for mounting circuit breakers and industrial control equipment inside equipment racks. These products are typically made from cold rolled carbon steel sheet with a <b>zinc-plated</b> or chromated bright surface finish.

50|$|The Expal C-3-A and C-3-B are round Spanish rubber {{modified}} polystyrene cased anti-tank blast mines. The mines differ only in minor detail. The mine {{is classified}} as a minimum metal mine, the only metal it contains being a 4.5 millimetre diameter <b>zinc-plated</b> steel spring. The mine is found in Angola, the Falkland Islands, and the Western Sahara. The mines are vulnerable to the plastic cases deteriorating in bright sunlight, resulting in a reduction in activation pressure.|$|E
50|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the world's {{galvanized}} steel production went through the Sendzimir process by the early 1980s. Poland, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada purchased his steel mills and technologies over the years. Most notably, Sendzimir was a major financial and personal supporter of the Kościuszko Foundation, the Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences of America and Alliance College in Pennsylvania. Sendzimir died after a massive stroke and was buried by his family in a <b>zinc-plated</b> coffin made according to his design.|$|E
50|$|Because {{electrolytically}} <b>zinc-plated</b> surfaces provide comparatively little corrosion protection, and in {{the case}} of galvanic zinc coatings on high-strength steel (e.g. category 10.9 and 12.9 high-strength bolts) there is a risk of hydrogen embrittlement, the industry needed a better corrosion protection system. High-strength steel parts (such as bolts of strength category > 10.9 and nuts of > 9) and components with tensile strength of > 1000 N/mm2 or > 320 HV are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Galvanic coating processes and pickling with acids have a major influence on the development of hydrogen-induced brittle fractures.|$|E
50|$|Zinc {{coatings}} prevent oxidation of {{the protected}} metal by forming a barrier and by {{acting as a}} sacrificial anode if this barrier is damaged. Zinc oxide is a fine white dust that (in contrast to iron oxide) does not cause {{a breakdown of the}} substrate's surface integrity as it is formed. Indeed, the zinc oxide, if undisturbed, can act as a barrier to further oxidation, in a way similar to the protection afforded to aluminum and stainless steels by their oxide layers. The majority of hardware parts are <b>zinc-plated,</b> rather than cadmium-plated.|$|E

Jiangsu Shagang's product line includes rebar, wire rods, slabs, and hot-rolled coils. In addition to iron and steel, Jiangsu Shagang produces stainless steel and <b>zinc-plated</b> steel sheets. Since 2006, the company has acquired four smaller, rival steel companies, and it now ranks as China's largest private steel producer.|$|E
5000|$|Fender also markets guitar strings {{under the}} Bullet brand. Introduced {{in the early}} 1970s, these strings differ by having {{cylindrical}} bullet-shaped ends instead of the [...] "ball ends" [...] common to other manufacturers. Fender states the bullet ends create a tighter fit in the tremolo block on Stratocaster guitars, leading to greater tuning stability when the tremolo is used. [...] In the early 1990s Fender switched from using <b>zinc-plated</b> steel for the bullet ends to brass, improving sustain. Today nickel is also used. Stainless steel strings with bullet ends are also offered since the late '90s.|$|E
50|$|A single pit in a {{critical}} point can cause {{a great deal of}} damage. One example is the explosion in Guadalajara, Mexico on April 22, 1992, when gasoline fumes accumulated in sewers destroyed kilometres of streets. The vapours originated from a leak of gasoline through a single hole formed by corrosion between a steel gasoline pipe and a <b>zinc-plated</b> water pipe.Firearms can also suffer from pitting, most notably in the bore of the barrel when corrosive ammunition is used and the barrel is not cleaned soon afterwards. Deformities in the bore caused by pitting can greatly reduce the firearm's accuracy. To prevent pitting in firearm bores, most modern firearms have a bore lined with chromium.|$|E
50|$|Wartime <b>zinc-plated</b> steel, 1943. The {{composition}} of the Lincoln cent was changed in 1943.Production of the war-time cent was provided for in an Act of Congress approved on December 18, 1942, which also set as the expiration date of the authority December 31, 1946. Low-grade carbon steel formed the base of these coins, to which a zinc coating 0.0005 in thick was deposited on each side electrolytically as a rust preventive. This coating {{was applied to the}} steel before the blanks were made, leaving the rims of these coins extremely susceptible to rust. The same size was maintained, but the weight was reduced from the standard 48 gr g to 42 gr g, by using a lighter alloy. Production commenced on February 27, 1943, and by December 31 of that year, the three Mint facilities had produced 1,093,838,670 of the one-cent coins. The copper released for the war effort was enough to meet the combined needs of two cruisers, two destroyers, 1,243 Flying Fortresses, 120 field guns and 120 howitzers, or enough for 1,250,000 shells for large field guns.|$|E
40|$|The new annular target {{performed}} well during irradiation. The target is inexpensive and provides good heat transfer during irradiation. Based on these and previous tests, {{we conclude that}} targets with zirconium tubes and either nickel-plated or <b>zinc-plated</b> foils work well. We proved that we could use aluminum target tubes, which are much cheaper and easier to work with than the zirconium tubes. In aluminum target tubes nickel-plated fission-recoil barriers work well and prevent bonding of the foil to the new target tubes during irradiation. Also, <b>zinc-plated</b> and aluminum-foil barriers appear promising in anodized aluminum tubes. Additional tests are anticipated to address such issues as fission-recoil barrier thickness and uranium foil composition. Overall, however, the target was successful and will provide an inexpensive, efficient way to irradiate LEU metal foil {{for the production of}} {sup 99 }Mo...|$|E

40|$|Zinc {{whiskers}} {{are tiny}} conductive filaments of zinc typically {{less than a}} few millimeters (mm) long {{and only a few}} thousandths of a millimeter in diameter. They grow from metal surfaces (e. g., steel) that have been electroplated (galvanized) with zinc for corrosion protection. The growth process consists of an unpredictable incubation period (months or perhaps even years) followed by a period of growth at rates as high as 1 mm/year. Zinc whiskers are conductive and therefore they will cause electrical shorts if they manage to bridge tightly-spaced electrical conductors. Now that zinc whisker-induced shorts have been so convincingly demonstrated, some former “seemingly inexplicable ” shorts are now regarded as explainable as having been caused by zinc whiskers. In recent years many computer equipment failures (servers, routers, switches, etc.) ranging from nuisance glitches to catastrophic system failures have been attributed to zinc whiskers. A search of the web shows that the most often reported source for zinc whiskers is the bottom surface of <b>zinc-plated</b> raised (“access”) floor tiles commonly used in computer room construction. Other sources of zinc whiskers include <b>zinc-plated</b> floor supports/rails, computer equipment racks and hardware such as screws, nuts, washers and bus rails. Zinc whisker sources on the underside of floor tiles are a long distance from electronic equipment in floor racks. However, experience demonstrates that whiskers are broken free during floor-bumping activities including construction and maintenance, and become entrained in the air flow used for cooling, and then deposit into the distant electronic equipment, as well as into people's lungs. Sometimes Zinc Whiskers find their way INSIDE equipment cabinets...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThiswork {{deals with}} zinc {{beneficiation}} of industrial solidwaste by an electrochemical technique combining electroleaching and electrodeposition in a single-cell process. This technique {{is based on}} leaching of the solid waste by the protons generated at the anode and migration of the resulting ions toward the cathode where deposition takes place. A laboratory cell was built for testing the method. It consisted of three compartments, two electrode compartments and a solid waste chamber placed between these. Catholyte and anolyte were sulphuric/sulphate solutions at optimised concentrations. Experiments were first carried out using a zinc solution and an inert matrix in the central compartment, then using a synthetic waste prepared by dispersing zinc oxide in silicon dioxide. Best performance was obtained with treatment duration of 6 h, at 4. 5 Adm− 2 and with catholyte circulation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{phenomenon known as}} Zinc Whiskers, their potential and historic impact in modern computer data centers and the appropriate methods for reducing exposure to this fault vector. Experiential data is described (but not presented) and Compaq’s position with respect to incidents involving Zinc Whiskers is stated. Phenomenon Zinc Whiskers were first discovered in 1948 by Bell Labs in which a whisker on a <b>zinc-plated</b> bracket caused increased losses in quartz filters used in a telephone transmission system (1). The whiskers constitute a very serious anomaly that is causing problems ranging from inconvenience to complete havoc in today’s computer rooms. Zinc Whiskers originate from zinc electroplated products commonly used in computer rooms. Zinc (Zn) is an element used to prevent rusting or oxidation of steel. Steel pieces are coated (passivated) with zinc. This coating can either be zinc Hot Dipped Galvanized (HDG) or electroplated. The HDG coating is not associated with the Zinc Whisker contaminate and can be easily recognized by the irregular triangular (spangled...|$|E
40|$|The Devanathan-Stachurski {{permeation}} technique 13 {{was used}} to investigate the rate of hydrogen permeation through an iron membrane with consecutively electroplated zinc layers. Hydrogen evolution rates and hydrogen perme-ation rates were followed as functions of time at different applied potentials. Hydrogen evolution and permeation decreased with each successive zinc layer until finally reaching an average decrease of 93 and 96 %, respectively, as com-pared with bare iron. Hydrogen surface coverage, exchange current density, absorption-adsorption reaction constant, and hydrogen recombination constant were estimated on bare iron and on <b>zinc-plated</b> iron. It {{was found that the}} decrease in the permeation rate of hydrogen through the iron membrane was due to (i) the decrease of hydrogen discharge rate and (ii) the suppression of hydrogen absorption and adsorption on the deposited zinc layers.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of electrolytic zinc-coating on mild steel in seawater was investigated. Mild steel samples were zinc electroplated at voltage varied (0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 5 V) and for plating time also varied (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 minutes). Focused ion-beam {{scanning electron microscopy}} was used to observe the surface morphology of the plated surface. The visual observation of plated samples revealed that samples plated at 0. 6 V for 20 and 60 minutes; 0. 8 V for 30 minutes and 1. 0 V for 40 minutes showed the best physical properties such as colour, brightness, fineness, streak and strong adhesion. The plated samples were then subjected to seawater environment for 30 days. The electropotentials mV (SCE) was measured daily. Weight loss was determined at intervals of five days {{for the duration of}} the exposure period. Experimental result showed little corrosion attack on the <b>zinc-plated</b> samples on the fifteenth and twenty-fifth day’s exposure. The severity of attack decreases with increasing weight of zinc coated on substrate.

40|$|Umjetnički paviljon sagrađen je u Zagrebu 1898. godine kao centralna građevina s kupolom i bočnim krilima, osvijetljena sa stropa, prema tadašnjim europskim arhitektonskim obrascima za takvu namjenu građevina. U stoljetnom nizu građevnih mijena Paviljon je djelomice izgubio prvotni izgled, najviše 1938. u radikalnoj purifikaciji pročelja. Građevno stanje početkom ovoga stoljeća bilo je loše pa su stručne službe Grada Zagreba pripremile i provele obnovu od 2007. do 2013. U članku se iznosi tijek građevne povijesti Umjetničkog paviljona, od projekata i gradnje za izložbu u Budimpešti, rekonstrukcije u Zagrebu, niza projekata i izvedbi sanacija, do recentne obnove, s obrazloženjem konzervatorskog pristupa i prikaza radova obnove kupole, krovova i pročelja. The Art Pavilion {{was entered}} in the Register of Cultural Goods of the Ministry of Culture of Republic of Croatia due to it being a {{preserved}} free–standing building on a square within the Green Horseshoe. It was built in 1896 for the 1898 Millennial Exhibition in Budapest as a building with a central layout, a dome and side wings, that is lit from above according to the contemporary European standards {{for this type of}} building. The project selected at the competition was that of Hungarian architects Floris Korb and Kalman Giergl. The Tripartite Kingdom decreed that the steel structure manufactured by the Danubius company be transferred to Zagreb to form the core of the Art Pavilion. The location for the City House of the Arts was chosen while anticipating the city’s expansion and it was decided that such a prominent location requires imposing architecture, so the project of reconstruction was entrusted to Viennese architects Fellner and Helmer and the construction work to the Zagreb company Higsberg & Deutsch. Due to the difference in ground levels, the building was constructed in two storeys, with the upper story housing the exhibition space, while the lower story was {{to be used as a}} restaurant and cafe. The Pavilion was opened on December 15 th 1898 with the exhibition of the Croatian Salon of the Arts Society. In the course of one hundred years of building alterations, the Pavilion has lost some of its original appearance, mostly notably in 1938 when a radical purification was carried out due to the building’s poor condition and the contemporary view of historicist architecture, seeing portions of the architectural sculpture removed, such as turrets next to the dome, urns at the roofs’ edges, acroterions, cornices with the coats of arms of the Tripartite Kingdom, masquerons in keystones of the niches, hermae and the bust of Athena above the entrance, etc. The next major renovation in 1986 saw only construction craft work carried out. The recent comprehensive renovation of the Art Pavilion, a symbol of Zagreb, got under way in 2006. The poor condition of the building, the roofs, the dome and the facdes with only a portion of their decorations left, was a pale image of the original imposing architecture. After compiling archival records, projects, and bibliography, as well as historical and the most recent photo documentation, the conservators drew up guidelines and a cost estimate for the renovation to be done by way of restoring the building to its original state, as it was established that there were enough elements to do so. The City of Zagreb, as the Art Pavilion’s owner and as investor, enlisted the renovation in the programme of monument annuity. The sector for communal buildings of the City Office for Construction organized the renovation in several phases: in 2006 the lighting of the exhibition space and the glass roofs over the halls were installed, from 2007 to 2011 the dome and all the fa軋des were renovated, and before 2013 the construction and installation improvement inside the building was completed and architectural sculpture set up. The most complex procedure was the removal of the metal sheets on shorter sides of the octagonal dome transported from Budapest and the installation of glass as designed in the project of Fellner and Helmer. A special attention was put to the conservation work carried out in four sets: the elements restored in situ, those which were dismantled and renovated in the workshop – mostly from <b>zinc–plated</b> metal sheets, the fabrication of new ones after the existing samples in portions where they were missing, and the re–creation of those removed in 1938 after old plans and photographs. The conservation work was concluded with the installation of the reconstructed entrance portal with hermae and the bust of Athena, protectress of arts and crafts. The comprehensive renovation of the Art Pavilion exterior was completed in 2013 according to the concept of restitution of the original 1898 situation. This was opted for as the imposing building occupies a prominent location within the Zagreb Green Horseshoe and the city traffic circulation, and was possible because of the sufficient data available. Given the recent conservation, this article aims to outline the historical phases of the Pavilion and their valorization that served as basis for the presentation proposed. It reveals the so far unknown information and details, providing an architectural analysis of the building, its geometry and structure, based on archival and conservation research and the renovation performed, whereby a model of presentation chosen was that of the last live layer which is also the first, and where the interventions applied entailed conservation of the original object in situ...|$|E
