5000|$|Any {{quantity}} with a <b>zero</b> <b>subscript</b> {{refers to}} a stagnation point where the velocity is zero, {{such as in the}} reservoir. Using several thermodynamic relations equations can be put in the forms: ...|$|E
5000|$|Any {{function}} with a <b>zero</b> <b>subscript</b> denote the function evaluated {{at the present}} time [...] (or equivalently [...] ). The last term can be taken to be [...] including the curvature state equation. It can be proved that the Hubble function is given by ...|$|E
50|$|This usage {{follows from}} design choices {{embedded}} in many influential programming languages, including C, Java, and Lisp. In these three, sequence types (C arrays, Java arrays and lists, and Lisp lists and vectors) are indexed {{beginning with the}} <b>zero</b> <b>subscript.</b> Particularly in C, where arrays are closely tied to pointer arithmetic, this makes for a simpler implementation: the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero.|$|E
50|$|The second {{version of}} BASIC only made minimal changes, adding the {{semicolon}} operator to the PRINT statement and <b>zero</b> <b>subscripts</b> to arrays.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{only one}} data {{structure}} - multi-dimensional sparse arrays (key-value nodes, sub-trees, and associative memory are all equally valid descriptions) with up to 32 subscripts. A scalar {{can be thought of}} as an array element with <b>zero</b> <b>subscripts.</b> Nodes with varying numbers of subscripts (including one node with no subscripts) can freely co-exist in the same array. For example, if one wanted to represent the national capitals of the United States: ...|$|R
5000|$|The M {{database}} is a key-value database engine {{optimized for}} high-throughput transaction processing. As such {{it is in}} the class of [...] "schema-less", [...] "schema-free," [...] or NoSQL databases. Internally, M stores data in multidimensional hierarchical sparse arrays (also known as key-value nodes, sub-trees, or associative memory). Each array may have up to 32 subscripts, or dimensions. A scalar {{can be thought of as}} an array element with <b>zero</b> <b>subscripts.</b> Nodes with varying numbers of subscripts (including one node with no subscripts) can freely co-exist in the same array.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{three models}} {{used to estimate}} the maximum power (P{sub m}) of PV modules when the irradiance and PV cell temperature are known: (1) the power temperature coefficient model, (2) the PVFORM model, and (3) the bilinear interpolation model. A variation of the power temperature coefficient model is also presented that improved model accuracy. For modeling values of P{sub m}, an 'effective' plane-of-array (POA) irradiance (E{sub e}) and the PV cell temperature (T) are used as model inputs. Using E{sub e} essentially removes the effects of variations in solar spectrum and reflectance losses, and permits the influence of irradiance and temperature on model performance for P{sub m} to be more easily studied. Eq. 1 is used to determine E{sub e} from T and the PV module's measured short-circuit current (I{sub sc}). <b>Zero</b> <b>subscripts</b> denote performance at Standard Reporting Conditions (SRC) ...|$|R

It {{can be shown}} {{that the difference between}} the location of the surface of tension and of the equimolar dividing surface proposed by Gibbs yields the value of the Tolman length: ...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, {{subscripts}} {{are also}} used frequently in mathematics to define {{different versions of the}} same variable: for example, in an equation x0 and xf might indicate the initial and final value of x, while vrocket and vobserver would stand for the velocities of a rocket and an observer. Commonly, variables with a <b>zero</b> in the <b>subscript</b> are referred to as the variable name followed by “naught” (e.g. v0 would be read, “v-naught”).|$|R
40|$|Let H be an infinite-dimentional real {{separable}} Hilbert space. Given {{an unknown}} mapping M : H (arrow) H {{that can only}} be observed with noise, we consider two modified Robbins-Monro procedures to estimate the <b>zero</b> point (theta) (<b>subscript</b> 0) ? H of M. These procedures work in appropriate finite dimensional sub-spaces of growing dimension. Almost-sure convergence, functional central limit theorem (hence asymptotic normality), law of iterated logarithm (hence almost-sure loglog rate of convergence), and mean rate of convergence are obtained for Hilbert space-valued mixingale, (theta) -dependent error processes...|$|R
40|$|Available {{published}} {{results are}} surveyed {{for a special}} class of infinite-dimensional control systems whose evolution {{is characterized by a}} semigroup of operators of class C <b>subscript</b> <b>zero.</b> Emphasis is placed on an approach that clarifies the system-theoretic relationship among controllability, stabilizability, stability, and the existence of a solution to an associated operator equation of the Riccati type. Formulation of the optimal control problem is reviewed along with the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a general system of equations and several theorems concerning L 2 stability. Examples are briefly discussed which involve second-order parabolic systems, first-order hyperbolic systems, and distributed boundary control...|$|R
40|$|Recently Donato [1] has {{presented}} a direct derivation of the radiation resistance of a panel, {{based on an}} application of Rayleigh 2 ̆ 7 s radiation formula. He also compared his results to the earlier work of Maidanik [2] and Lyon and Maidanik [3]. Inasmuch as Donato 2 ̆ 7 s derivation seems to be rather ad hoc in its formulation, and rather cumbersome in its application, an alternate derivation is given here. The present analysis begins with a well-known results, and proceeds through straightforward evaluation of classical integrals. Insofar as is possible Donato 2 ̆ 7 s notation will be used here, with the sole exception of dropping the <b>subscript</b> <b>zero</b> from the circumferential angle, ϕ, of the observation point...|$|R
40|$|Beryllium- 7 in Be(OH) 2 gel was {{compressed}} in diamond-anvil pressure cells up to 442 kbar at room temperature. By {{counting the}} activity of 7 Be, the decay rate for the conversion of 7 Be to 7 Li via electron capture was measured. The decay constant of 7 Be, V, was found to increase, but {{the rate of increase}} decreased with increasing pressure. A quadratic regression of the data yields (V 3 V 0) /V 0 = (4. 87 U 1035) P 3 (5. 9 U 1038) P 2, where the <b>subscript</b> <b>zero</b> denotes zero pressure and P stands for pressure in kilobar. Thus, V of 7 Be increases by about 1 % at 400 kbar. The observed data set can be rationalized by an increase in electron density near the nucleus of 7 Be at high pressures. This result may bear some implications for the conversion of 40 K to 40 Ar, which has been widely adopted to date geological events. ß 200...|$|R
