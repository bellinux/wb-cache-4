5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (<b>zinc</b> <b>plated)</b> steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E

50|$|The cell {{was set up}} in a long-necked {{glass bottle}} with a <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> located between two carbon plates. The {{electrolyte}} and depolarizer were mixed. The mixture would dissolve the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> even when the cell was not in use, so there was a mechanism for lifting the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> out of the liquid and storing it in the neck of the bottle.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} and innovation {{of this process}} over lithography {{was the use of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>plates</b> rather than stone ones. <b>Zinc</b> <b>plates</b> were lighter and easier to transport, could produce more prints, and were far less brittle than the stone plates originally used. The use of <b>zinc</b> <b>plates</b> was also the origin of the name photozincography, which Sir Henry James claims to have invented.|$|R
5000|$|Axle {{bolt and nut}}: The {{axle bolt}} locates the wheel into the caster yoke. The nut secures the axle to the yoke. In some {{applications}} the axle bolt and nut may be hardened or <b>zinc</b> <b>plated</b> for corrosion resistance. Stainless steel may occasionally be used.|$|E
50|$|A {{process known}} as the Cronak process is used to create zinc {{chromate}} for use in industry. This process is done by putting zinc or a <b>zinc</b> <b>plated</b> metal in a solution of sodium dichromate and sulfuric acid for a few seconds.Zinc chromate can also be synthesized by using neutral potassium chromate (K2CrO4) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO4), which forms a precipitate.|$|E
50|$|Chromating {{is often}} {{performed}} on galvanized parts {{to make them}} more durable. The chromate coating acts as paint does, protecting the zinc from white corrosion, thus making the part considerably more durable, depending on the chromate layer's thickness. Steel and iron cannot be chromated directly. Chromating <b>zinc</b> <b>plated</b> steel does not enhance zinc's cathodic protection of the underlying steel from rust.|$|E
40|$|Zinc electrodeposits {{are widely}} used to protect iron and steel from corrosion. Zinc {{coatings}} are presently obtained from chloride, sulfate, mixed chloride and sulfate, cyanide and non-cyanide alkaline baths. Atmospheric corrosion {{is associated with the}} use of chloride electrolytes. The use of additives, low cathode efficiency and the costly effluent treatment discourage the use of non-cyanide alkaline <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> baths. Hence, a better quality <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> electrolyte is necessary. In this paper, the authors present a detailed investigation of <b>zinc</b> <b>plating</b> from non-cyanide based acetate electrolytes and the effect of thiamine hydrochloride and gelatin as additives to produce quality bright deposits.

50|$|The {{zinc-bromine battery}} can be {{regarded}} as an electroplating machine. During charging zinc is electroplated onto conductive electrodes, {{while at the same time}} bromine is formed. On discharge the reverse process occurs, the metallic <b>zinc</b> <b>plated</b> on the negative electrodes dissolves in the electrolyte and is available to be plated again at the next charge cycle. It can be left fully discharged indefinitely without damage.|$|E
50|$|Many valves have {{a spring}} for spring-loading, to {{normally}} shift the disc into some position by default but allow control to reposition the disc. Relief valves commonly use a spring {{to keep the}} valve shut, but allow excessive pressure to force the valve open against the spring-loading. Coil springs are normally used. Typical spring materials include <b>zinc</b> <b>plated</b> steel, stainless steel, and for high temperature applications Inconel X750.|$|E

40|$|Zinc electrodeposits {{are widely}} used to protect iron and steel from {{corrosion}} which are relatively inexpensive.

5000|$|The Gleaner {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} in {{self-propelled}} combines. They were often considered the [...] "Cadillac" [...] of the industry because of this feature and because of their sound engineering. Buescher (1991) credited the design principally to one of the brothers, Curt Baldwin, and explained that it focused on the needs of custom cutters like the Baldwin brothers themselves—contractors who move north with the harvest season, selling harvesting services to farmers. It resulted in machines that were extraordinarily reliable and useful, which benefited not only custom cutters but anyone who bought a Gleaner. The short wheelbase and axle track allowed the combine to fit on a truck. The grain header {{did not need to be}} detached for transit, because it fit over the cab of the truck. Buescher said, [...] "Since custom cutters didn't know where their next parts supply source would be, Baldwin designed his combine so that it wouldn't need parts." [...] (Buescher's tongue-in-cheek point is that the machines were designed and built well so that need for repairs would be minimal.) The frame was [...] "like a bridge" [...] in its strength. The bearings were chosen with service in mind—large and good quality (to obviate service) and of common sizes (so that the operator could carry merely a small stock of spares in his truck and yet be certain to have the size he needed when a replacement did become necessary). The Gleaner's exterior sheet metal was galvanized (<b>zinc</b> <b>plated),</b> giving it weather resistance superior to that of typical farm equipment, which was painted but not plated. As Buescher said, [...] "Baldwin reasoned that most of his combines would sit outdoors. Texas and Oklahoma dust storms have a way of peeling paint off of machinery." [...] As a result of the silver color of the zinc plating, the Gleaner brand ended up having a distinctive color (just as Allis had Persian Orange, IH had red, and John Deere had green), despite the sheet metal not even having any paint.|$|E
