We derive MBH from published optical spectra assuming a spherical broad-line region, and Lbul from detailed two-dimensional decomposition of archival optical Hubble Space Telescope images. AGNs follow the MBH −Lbul relation of inactive galaxies, but the zero point is shifted by an average of ∆logMBH ≈ − 0. 3 dex. We show that the magnitude of the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset,</b> which is responsible for the intrinsic scatter in the MBH − Lbul relation, is correlated with several AGN and host galaxy properties, all of which are ultimately related to, or directly impact, the BH mass accretion rate. At a given bulge luminosity, sources with higher Eddington ratios have lower MBH. The <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset</b> can be explained by a change in the normalization of the virial product used to estimate MBH, in conjunction with modest BH growth (∼ 10 %– 40 %) during the AGN phase.

Independent of the physical layout of the resistors, the MILC poly-Si is found to consist of elongated grains with grain lengths comparable to the physical lengths of the resistors. Surface micro-machined micro-channels with integrated pressure sensors using both MILC and conventional low-pressure chemical vapor deposited (LPCVD) poly-Si piezo-resistors have been fabricated and characterized. Compared to the sensors with the LPCVD piezo-resistors, those with the MILC piezo-resistors show 40 % higher pressure sensitivity as well as lower temperature-induced drift in both the zero-pressure offset and the pressure sensitivity.

While the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset</b> of the FP for these high redshift clusters relative to our low redshift sample is consistent with passive evolution with a formation redshift of zform ≈ 3. 2, the FP for the high redshift clusters is not only shifted as expected for a mass-independent zform, but rotated relative to the low redshift sample. Expressed as a relation between the galaxy masses and the mass-to-light ratios the FP is significantly steeper for the high redshift clusters than found at low redshift. We interpret this as a mass dependency of the star formation history, as has been suggested by other recent studies.

Our {{analysis of}} stellar populations and star formation history in the cluster covers 24 members and is based on deep optical spectroscopy from Gemini North and imaging data from HST. Focusing on the 13 bulge-dominated galaxies for which we can determine central velocity dispersions, we find that these show a smaller evolution of sizes and velocity dispersions than reported for field galaxies and galaxies in poorer clusters. The galaxies in RXJ 0848. 6 + 4453 populate the Fundamental Plane similar to that found for lower redshift clusters with a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset</b> corresponding to an epoch of last star formation at z_form= 1. 95 +- 0. 2. The spectra of the galaxies in RXJ 0848. 6 + 4453 are dominated by young stellar populations at all galaxy masses and in many cases show emission indicating low level on-going star formation. The average age of the young stellar populations (estimated from H-zeta) is consistent with a major star formation episode 1 - 2 Gyr prior, which in turn agrees with z_form= 1. 95. Galaxies dominated by young stellar populations are distributed throughout the cluster. We speculate that low level star formation has not yet been fully quenched in the center of this cluster may be because the cluster is significantly poorer than other clusters previously studied at similar redshifts, which appear to have very little on-going star formation in their centers.

40|$|While Norma (ACO 3627) is {{the richest}} cluster in the Great Attractor (GA) region, {{its role in}} the local {{dynamics}} is poorly understood. The Norma cluster has a mean redshift (z_CMB) of 0. 0165 and has been proposed as the "core" of the GA. We have used the Ks-band Fundamental Plane (FP) to measure Norma cluster's distance with respect to the Coma cluster. We report FP photometry parameters (effective radii and surface brightnesses), derived from ESO NTT SOFI images, and velocity dispersions, from AAT 2 dF spectroscopy, for 31 early-type galaxies in the cluster. For the Coma cluster we use 2 MASS images and SDSS velocity dispersion measurements for 121 early-type galaxies to generate the calibrating FP dataset. For the combined Norma-Coma sample we measure FP coefficients of a= 1. 465 +/- 0. 059 and b= 0. 326 +/- 0. 020. We find an rms scatter, in log(central velocity dispersion) of 0. 08 dex which corresponds to a distance uncertainty of 28 % per galaxy. The <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset</b> between Norma's and Coma's FPs is 0. 154 +/- 0. 014 dex. Assuming that the Coma cluster is at rest with respect to the cosmic microwave background frame and z_CMB(Coma) = 0. 0240, we derive a distance to the Norma cluster of 5026 +/- 160 km/s, and the derived peculiar velocity is - 72 +/- 170 km/s, i. e., consistent with zero. This is lower than previously reported positive peculiar velocities for clusters/groups/galaxies in the GA region and hence the Norma cluster may indeed represent the GA's "core".

These data have been previously used to assist the derivation of accurate distances and ages of galactic globular clusters. Magnitudes and colours for the programme stars were obtained combining and standardizing carefully selected literature data available in the Simbad data-base and V and B-V values measured by the Hipparcos/Tycho mission. Comparison of colours for our targets suggests: (i) ground-based and Tycho B-V's agree well for colours bluer than 0. 75 mag, but {{have a lot of}} scatter for redder colours; (ii) the Hipparcos V-I colours have a very large scatter and a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset</b> of + 0. 02 mag compared to the literature values. The programme stars have metal abundances in the range - 2. 5 <[Fe/H]< 0. 2.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an update of our previous scaling relations (Genzel et al. 2015) between galaxy integrated molecular gas masses, stellar masses and star formation rates, {{in the framework}} of the star formation main-sequence (MS), with the main goal to test for possible systematic effects. For this purpose our new study combines three independent methods of determining molecular gas masses from CO line fluxes, far-infrared dust spectral energy distributions, and ~ 1 mm dust photometry, in a large sample of 1444 star forming galaxies (SFGs) between z= 0 and 4. The sample covers the stellar mass range log(M*/M_solar) = 9. 0 - 11. 8, and star formation rates relative to that on the MS, delta_MS=SFR/SFR(MS), from 10 ^{- 1. 3 } to 10 ^{ 2. 2 }. Our most important finding is that all data sets, despite the different techniques and analysis methods used, follow the same scaling trends, once method-to-method <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offsets</b> are minimized and uncertainties are properly taken into account. The molecular gas depletion time t_depl, defined as the ratio of molecular gas mass to star formation rate, scales as (1 +z) ^{- 0. 6 }x(delta_MS) ^{- 0. 44 }, and is only weakly dependent on stellar mass. The ratio of molecular-to-stellar mass mu_gas depends on (1 +z) ^{ 2. 5 }x (delta_MS) ^{ 0. 52 }x(M*) ^{- 0. 36 }, which tracks the evolution of the specific star formation rate. The redshift dependence of mu_gas requires a curvature term, as may the mass-dependences of t_depl and mu_gas. We find no or only weak correlations of t_depl and mu_gas with optical size R or surface density once one removes the above scalings, but we caution that optical sizes may not be appropriate for the high gas and dust columns at high-z.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of brand new observational techniques and theoretical models have greatly advanced the exoplanet research field. Despite significant achievements, which {{have allowed the}} detection of thousands extrasolar systems, a comprehensive understanding of planetary formation and evolution mechanisms is still desired. One relevant limitation is given by the accuracy in the measurements of planet-host star ages. The star GJ 504 {{has been found to}} host a substellar companion whose nature is strongly debated. There has been a recent difference of opinion in the literature owing to the uncertainty on the age of the system: a young age of ∼ 160 Myr would imply a giant planet as a companion, but a recent revision pointing to a solar age (∼ 4 Gyr) instead suggests a brown dwarf. With the aim of shedding light on this debated topic, we have carried out a high-resolution spectroscopic study of GJ 504 to derive stellar parameters, metallicity, and abundances of both light and heavy elements, providing a full chemical characterisation. The main objective is to infer clues on the evolutionary stage (hence the age) of this system. We performed a strictly differential (line-by-line) analysis of GJ 504 with respect to two reference stars, that is the planet-host dwarf ι Hor and the subgiant HIP 84827. The former is crucial in this context because its stellar parameters (hence the evolutionary stage) is well constrained from asteroseismic observations. Regardless of the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offsets,</b> our differential approach allows us to put tight constraints on the age of GJ 504 with respect to ι Hor, thereby minimising the internal uncertainties.

The heart of the system is xcsao, which implements the cross-correlation method, and is a direct descendant of the system built by Tonry and Davis (1979). emsao uses intelligent heuristics to search for emission lines in spectra, then fits them to obtain a redshift. sumspec shifts and sums spectra to build templates for cross-correlation. linespec builds synthetic spectra given a list of spectral lines. bcvcorr corrects velocities for the motion of the earth. We discuss in detail the parameters necessary to run xcsao and emsao properly. We discuss the reliability and error associated with xcsao derived redshifts. We develop an internal error estimator, and we show how large, stable surveys can be used to develop more accurate error estimators. We develop a new methodology for building spectral templates for galaxy redshifts, using the new templates for the FAST spectrograph (Fabricant, et al, 1998) as an example. We show how to obtain correlation velocities using emission line templates. Emission line correlations are substantially more efficient than the previous standard technique, automated emission line fitting. Using this machinery the blunder rate for redshift measurements can be kept near zero; the automation rate for FAST spectra is ∼ 95 %. We use emsao to measure the instrumental <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset</b> and instrumental stability of the Z-Machine and FAST spectrographs. We compare the use of RVSAO with new methods, which use Singular Value Decomposition and χ 2 fitting techniques, and conclude that the methods we use are either equal or superior.

Using Fourier analysis technique we measure stellar R-band surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs) and magnitudes in 29 different {{fields of the}} galaxies. Independent tip of the red giant branch distances for DDO 44, KK 98 _ 77, DDO 71 are used to convert their set of apparent into absolute SBF magnitudes. The results are combined with the local (B-R) colours and compared with the (B-R) -M̅_R relation for mainly old, metal-poor stellar populations as predicted by Worthey's population synthesis models using Padova isochrones. While the colour dependency of the theoretical relation is confirmed by the empirical data, we find a systematic <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>offset</b> between observations and theory {{in the sense that}} models are too faint by 0. 13 +- 0. 02 mag. Based on these findings we establish a new semiempirical calibration of the SBF method as distance indicator for dE galaxies with an estimated uncertainty of 10 percent. Taking first advantage of the improved calibration, we determine SBF distances for the other three early-type dwarfs. Although found in the M 81 group region, previous velocity measurements suggested UGC 4998 is in the background. This picture is confirmed by our SBF distance of 10. 5 +- 0. 9 Mpc. We can further identify DDO 113 as a faint stellar system at the near side of the Canes Venatici I (CVn I) cloud at a distance of 3. 1 +- 0. 3 Mpc.

In this paper we reconstruct these composite grids using simple stellar population models from several groups convolved with exponentially decaying star formation histories. We find that the youngest populations present (t < 2 Gyr) dominate the light, and because of their presence the age-metallicity degeneracy can be partially broken with broad-band colors, unlike older populations. There are several major problems, however. First, since the young populations dominate, it is the (nearly) present-day abundance that is being measured, not the mass-weighted abundance, {{despite the fact that}} the grids are usually labeled by mass-weighted ages. Second, there is large scatter among the various models, with substantial <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> and slope <b>offsets</b> such that knowing the abundance or age to 0. 2 dex precision appears impossible with present models. The dominant uncertainties arise from convective core overshoot assumptions and the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch phase, but helium abundance may play a significant role at higher metallicities. Finally, real spiral galaxies are unlikely to have smooth, exponential star formation histories, and burstiness will cause a partial reversion to the single-burst case, which has even larger model-to-model scatter...|$|R

The result of the interpretation of all observations, even at low light levels, is exactly the same in quantum electrodynamics and in the semi-classical theory.

By the modified method, we can obtain accurate <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> by simple iterations. We also extend this problem to a multivariable case. Applications to the spectral analysis of M/G/ 1 type Markov chains are discussed. Important characteristics of these chains, e. g., the boundary vector and the matrix G, {{can be derived}} from <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of a matrix function and corresponding null vectors. Numerical results are shown. 1...|$|R

It was built by Maqbool Associates at a cost of Pak.Rs 2.33 billion. The construction work was started in 2007, and was completed in December 2010. The <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> interchange was constructed in two phases. Phase 1 included the three major loops of the interchange. In Phase 2, two more loops which will connect Khayaban-e-Suhrawardy and Shakarparian were constructed.|$|R
40|$|In the {{classical}} theory, an electromagnetic field obeying Maxwell's equations cannot be absorbed quickly by matter, {{so that it}} remains a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field. Splitting the total, genuine electromagnetic field into the sum of a conventional field and a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field is physically meaningless until a receiver attenuates the genuine field down to the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field, or studying the amplification of the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field by a source. In classical optics all optical effects must be written using the genuine field, so that at low light levels the nonlinear effects become linear {{in relation to the}} conventional field. The result of the interpretation of all observations, even at low light levels, is exactly the same in quantum electrodynamics and in the semi- classical theory. The <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field is stochastic only far from the sources and the receivers; elsewhere, it is shaped by matter, it may be studied through fields visible before an absorption or after an amplification. A classical study of the reduction of the wave packet extends the domain of equivalence of {{the classical}} and quantum <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field; using both interpretations of this field makes the results more reliable, because the traps are different.

40|$|EO- 3 GIFTS mission (2004). The {{camera is}} {{designed}} to be autonomously self-calibrating, and capable of a rapid/reliable solution of the lost-in-space problem as well as recursive attitude estimation. Two efficient Kalman filter algorithms for attitude, camera principal <b>point</b> <b>offset,</b> and focal length estimation are developed. These algorithms make use of three axis gyros for the rate data and star camera split field-of-view line-of-sight vector measurements. To model the optics of the camera the pinhole model is used, which is found to be sufficiently accurate for most of star cameras. The relative merits of the two algorithms are then studied for estimating the principal <b>point</b> <b>offset,</b> focal length and attitude of a simulated spacecraft motion. Simulation results indicate that both algorithms produce precise attitude estimates by determining the principal <b>point</b> <b>offset,</b> focal length and rate bias; however, reliability and robustness characteristics favor the second algorithm...|$|R
30|$|The {{theory of}} {{monotone}} operators has {{appeared as a}} powerful and effective tool for studying a wide class of problems arising in different branches of social, engineering, and pure sciences in a unified and general framework. There is a notion about monotone operators {{and it is one}} of generalized sums of two monotone operators; see [15, 16] and the references therein. In recent years, monotone operators have received a lot of attention for treating <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of monotone operators and fixed point of mappings which are Lipschitz continuous; see [17 – 22] and the references therein. The first algorithm for approximating the <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the maximal monotone operator was introduced by Martinet [23]. He considered the proximal point algorithm for finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of a maximal monotone operator. Then, Passty [24] introduced a forward-backward algorithm method for finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the sum of two operators. There are various applications of the problem of finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the sum of two operators; see [25 – 29] for example and the references therein.|$|R
