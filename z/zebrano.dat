50|$|Microberlinia brazzavillensis is {{a tree in}} {{the family}} Fabaceae, found in West Africa. It is also called <b>zebrano,</b> zingana, and allen ele, and is {{commonly}} sold in the US as zebrawood. The tree is tall and straight, growing up to 40 m in height with a diameter of up to 1 m. The flower has white petals and, as other legumes do, the tree produces pods.|$|E
50|$|The {{woods of}} the Dolphin also {{has changed over}} the years. Earlier the Dolphins had hand shaped boiré (since 2006 on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) bodies with wenge necks with {{laminated}} <b>zebrano</b> stripes and a wenge fingerboard. Also some were made with maple in the bodies. The bass could be ordered in 4 and 5-string models, a 6 string model wasn't introduced until 2012.|$|E
50|$|Richness, {{comfort and}} attention-to-detail are communicated {{throughout}} the vehicle's interior which features cream and brown-colored leather trim, woven cream leather inserts, satin metal details, and <b>Zebrano</b> wood accents. Both {{front and rear}} passenger compartments are separate and have their own radio, climate controls, luxurious seats, arm rests and center consoles. Speedometer and tachometer gauges are also featured in both compartments which allow rear passengers to monitor vehicle performance at a glance.|$|E
50|$|The wood of Microberlinia (also {{known as}} <b>Zebrano)</b> is {{imported}} from central Africa, (Gabon, Cameroon, and Congo). The heartwood is a pale golden yellow, {{distinct from the}} very pale color of the sapwood and features narrow streaks of dark brown to black. Zebrawood {{can also be a}} pale brown with regular or irregular marks of dark brown in varying widths. It is almost always quartersawn to get the exciting alternating color pattern.|$|E
50|$|LEs were {{equipped}} with extra features {{that had been}} options on the other models and were only available with the 1.8- or 2.0-litre engine. Both the 1.8- and 2.0-litre models were {{equipped with}} a standard electric tilt and slide steel sunroof, four electric windows, electric aerial, 8-hole alloy wheels, Blaupunkt Verona CR43 Radio/cassette and walnut wood trim (as opposed to <b>Zebrano</b> wood). The 2.0-litre-engined version had in addition rear headrests and a front armrest. The LE was nearly £3500 cheaper than a non-LE 1.8 car of identical specification, and £2000 cheaper for a 2.0-litre.|$|E
5000|$|To {{commemorate the}} 100th {{anniversary of the}} Wright Brothers' 1903 flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and the 100th anniversary of Ford Motor Company, Lincoln created a [...] "Kitty Hawk" [...] limited edition of the Aviator; it was the {{official}} vehicle of the 2003 EAA Countdown to Kitty Hawk. Along with special Kitty Hawk badging and trim, the limited-edition vehicles were fitted with special wood trim which is mink <b>zebrano,</b> argent painted and chrome grille, and a rear spoiler, chrome exhaust tip, chrome wheels, xenon (HID) headlamps, black premium leather heated/cooled seats with Kitty Hawk logo embossed on front seat backs, black carpet floor mats with stitched Kitty Hawk logo, available only in black exterior color.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999 at {{the time}} of its {{introduction}} the Yukon Denali's exterior, which it later shared with the 1999 Cadillac Escalade, differed from the standard Yukon in the front fascia and lower side body panels as well as having unique 16" [...] DICKIE polished aluminum wheels and a special exhaust cutout for a right side-exiting cast exhaust tip. The interior of the Denali also featured several upgrades not available on the mainstream Yukon. These standard features included an upgraded Nuance leather interior, driver and passenger 6-way power seats with power lumbar support, front and rear heated seats, a Bose 7 speaker (including subwoofer) audio system, an in-dash cassette, single CD player and an in-console 6-disc CD changer. <b>Zebrano</b> woodgrain accents decorated the front doors and center console. The front and rear doors featured unique [...] "Yukon Denali" [...] stitching in the panels.|$|E
50|$|All of this {{technology}} came {{at a very high}} price. At a time when the most expensive Cadillacs, the mid-sized Seville and full-sized Cadillac Fleetwood Series Seventy-Five limousine each listed for about US$16,000, the 6.9 listed for around $40,000, more than the Big Three but less than most Rolls-Royces. When the car was officially introduced into the North American market for the 1977 model year, the price was well past $40,000 and was $52,995 by the end of production. Though the 6.9 was undeniably a luxury car, the decor was rather austere compared to the sheer opulence available in a Rolls-Royce or full-sized Cadillac. The interior was identical to that in the less expensive models except for the push-pull suspension control knob just under the speedometer, a low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator lights in the instrument cluster, and wood trim finished in burled walnut veneer on the dash and console. The rest of the W116 lineup was trimmed in striated <b>zebrano</b> veneer.|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, for the 1990 model year, North America {{received}} the Coupé quattro and 90 quattro models that all were {{powered by a}} detuned [...] of the 20v 2.3-litre 5-cylinder engine. These cars {{were considered to be}} in the [...] "Grand Tourismo" [...] (GT) style of a comfortable luxury car with sporting tendencies, as opposed to a dedicated lightweight sports car. Weighing between 3042 lb (1990 sedan model) to 3308 lb (1991 Coupé model), these cars were not lightweight, especially in consideration of the 164 hp powerplant (slightly de-tuned from the European version). These models can be recognised by their distinctive roadwheels (Coupé quattros had 15" [...] 6-star [...] "Speedline" [...] wheels, sedan quattros had 14" [...] BBS Mesh wheel or the 15" [...] Speedlines). They differed from regular 80/90 models in several ways. Notable differences include their standard leather interiors with <b>Zebrano</b> wood trim, additional VDO gauges mounted {{in the bottom of the}} centre console, a carbon fibre centre drive shaft, and push-button locking rear differential. The Coupé quattro is visually similar to the European-only S2 model, but does not have the S2's turbocharged engine.|$|E

Measurements were performed on the following three species: <b>zebrano</b> (Microberlinia brazzavillensis), panga panga (Millettia Stuhlmannii) and african padouk (Pterocarpus soyauxii). As surface treatment were used water-based, polyurethane, oil and solvent-based paint. Samples were exposed to simulated UV radiation. The total duration of radiation was 168 hours. After that the colour changes delta E* were measured by using a spectrophotometer. The aim was to compare the different paints used on all woods and their colour change.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the usability of different dynamic moduli of elasticity and wood density for {{the prediction of}} mechanical properties - static modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture - in samples with grain deflection from the longitudinal direction. Five tropical hardwoods (Afzelia bipindensis, Intsia bijuga, Millettia laurentii, Astronium graveolens and Microberlinia brazzavillensis) with different grain characteristics were used for this purpose. The fiber deflection {{was caused by the}} presence of interlocked grain or the working process. The three nondestructive techniques used in this study - longitudinal and flexural resonance method and ultrasound method - provided higher values of modulus of elasticity than the static bending test, but close correlation was observed between these variables. The weakest correlation was found for the ultrasound method which is probably caused by its measuring mechanism. The prediction of the modulus of rupture is less accurate when the dynamic modulus of elasticity is compared with the static modulus of elasticity; on the other hand, it was still good in comparison with the density model, which is inapplicable when grain deflection occurs in wood. In the wood of <b>Zebrano</b> where the interlocked grain was strongly developed, almost all of the correlation coefficients showed the lowest values and the prediction of modulus of rupture by nondestructive techniques was unsatisfactory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a new minimally invasive measurement procedure. With this method implantologist could determine the local mechanical and structural properties of the cellular solids materials (e. g. bones) into which implants are placed. The currently applied methods are based on image measurement procedures (CT, Hounsfield scale etc.). The dentists, with the knowledge of the determined mechanical properties of the bone, can choose the ideal surgical parameters (flap size, diameter of drill, hole-depth, healing time, etc.) and the ideal implant type for the patients. During the development of the measuring procedure, was used bone modeling materials (“bone-like materials”) instead of bone. With these materials it is easier to do tests, than with living tissues. The bone like materials needs to have the same mechanical and structural properties as the given bone. The following bone like materials was used during the measurement: woods (Amaranth, Alnus, Ipe, Iroko, Robinia, Pyrus, <b>Zebrano),</b> and on the market available polyurethane solid foams (Sawbones D 1 and D 2). Among the literatures are summaries, which include the biomechanical assessments for implant stability. These technics are good to determine the implant stability in different bones and bone like materials after the implantation. In this work torsional test were used. This test is based on the determination of the insertion torque as a functio...|$|E
40|$|Unique Bindings {{exhibited}} at Ashiga Museum of Art, Tochigi Province, Japan: 22 April - 4 June 2006 Koriyama City Museum of Art, Fukishima Province, Japan: 10 June - 9 July 2006 Chiba City Museum of Art, Chiba Province, Japan: 22 July - 27 August 2006 Grey {{was one of}} twenty-four Fellows of the internationally recognised Designer Bookbinders Society invited {{to take part in}} the Beautiful British Books touring exhibition to Japan. It examined the development of ‘fine’ books in Britain. ‘Fine’ in this context encompasses rare and limited edition books and/or high-quality bindings. In the context of traditional bookbinding, there is an enduring pre-conception of the use of particular structures and materials, and although there have historically been acknowledged design styles, the concept of ‘fine binding’ has changed little over three hundred years. Grey’s research evidences her instrumental re-definition of the term through the development and invention of structures that use non-traditional techniques and materials, such as wood veneers, and stitch-work with suede. Her use of materials is content led, resulting in each binding being a unique response to the text. The Canterbury Tales was selected because the binding reflects the theme of religious pilgrimage and the <b>zebrano</b> veneer used is an intentional counterpoint to Edna Whyte’s black and white wood block illustrations. The embroidery of Shakespeare’s Sonnets and a Lover's Complaint binding complements the etchings within the text whilst the sombre colour of the background and the lighter energetic marks of the stitches reflect themes of youth, romantic love and ageing. The pieces are part of an ongoing investigation (see output 1), and she has also given invited lectures and master classes at the Folger Library, Washington DC (March 2001), and the Designer Bookbinders and Society of Bookbinders, London (November 2005). Her work has been purchased for public collections including the British Library, the Library of Congress (Washington DC), Winchester Cathedral, and by private collectors such as Edward Bayntun (Bath), world-renowned bindery and booksellers which took over the famous Riviere Bindery established in 1829...|$|E
40|$|During the {{transition}} period between Pleistocene and Holocene, from 20 000 to 8000 BC, river valleys were subject {{to the impact of}} vistulian ice-sheet or to the influence of periglacial climate. Their development was dependent on their width and position in relation {{to the edge of the}} ice-sheet. In the southern part of the Polish Plain three areas where advanced river valley research is carried out can be distinguished (Fig. l). The frrst of these is the middle Vistula valley which was formed by water inflow from the upper montainous part of the basin and by the direct influence of the Scandinavian ice-sheet. The second area where research is the most advanced methodologically encloses the Prosna river valley and the middle Warta river valley. The Prosna valley was situated in a periglacial zone and the Proma base level changed according to the vistulian ice-sheet location. The middle Warta river valley was embraced by the Leszno stage zone and thus is of pradolina origin. The Łódź Upland situated on a watershed is the third area of valley studies. Here the research is concerned with the upper parts of small valleys, where climatic and glacial factors did not mingle with each other. Also investigations of denudational valley infI 1 l are valuable for the valley studies. During {{the transition}}al period three stages of river valley development (Fig. 2) can be recognized: 1. 20000 - 14 500 B. C. - the braided river phase with glacial, periglacial and mixed supplies. Aggradation of valley floors was characteristic of the phase and cut and built terace formation occured rarely. 2. 14 500 - 10 000 B. C. - the complex phase of valley floor cutting with simultaneous change from braided to widely meandering channel patterns. Present results show that the alternation did not occur at the same time in diITerent valleys or even fragments of valleys and was strongly dependent on local conditions. 3. 10000 - 8000 B. C. - the meandering river phase with decreasing meander proportions untill mezo-Holocene. In general the state of knowledge od valley development in non-glaciated regions of the Polish Plain in {{the transition period}} is regarded as advanced. That is, to a considerable extent, the result of various conditions in the areas where the studies are conducted. It is recommended that the research methods should be perfected and standardized. This would enable the distinction and comparision of local and general determinants of valley evolution to be made more precisely. Expansion of model application from the Warta river study area to others would speed the transition from quality to quantity characteristics of the process. <b>Zebrano</b> poglądy na temat ewolucji dolin w okresie przejściowym plejstocen - holocen (20000 - 8000 lat BP) na nizinnych, ekstraglacjalnych obszarach Polski.

40|$|The {{presented}} {{thesis is}} focused on aesthetical and acoustic properties of tropical wood. The discussed tropical species are utilized in Europe mainly for their unusual appearance and colour in joinery and furniture production. The irreplacable acoustic properties like low internal friction predestine specific species for production of musical instruments. The colour of six selected tropical species - jatoba (Hymenea courbaril L.), massaranduba (Manilkara bidentata A. Chev.), muiracatiara (Astronium graveolens Jacq.), angelim amargoso (Vatairea spp.), angelim pedra (Hymenolobium spp.) and angelim vermelho (Dinizia excelsa Ducke) - were analyzed and expressed in CIEL*a*b* colour space. Subsequently the samples were exposed to artificial sunlight and the light-induced discolouration rate and progress was evaluated. The colour change was rapid in zhe first hours of exposure and all species showed a similar trend in lightness (L*) change - initial darkening replaced by gradual fading. The change in chromatic parameters (a* and b*) change was specific for individual species and probably related to the chemical composition of the extractives. The overall discolouration of lighter coloured wood samples is more distinctive. The extractive content of tropical species is usually high and determines wood colour. The wood of African Padauk (Pterocarpus soyauxii Taub) and Jatoba (Hymenaea courbaril L.) was extracted {{in a mixture of}} methanol, water and acetone. The total extractives and total phenolic content was measured. Extractive content was related to colour parameters and above all to lightness in both species. The increase in extractive content leads to a lighter and more yellow colouration of Jatoba wood while African Padauk was darker with a higher amount of extractives. In Jatoba, a positive correlation was found between extractive content and the rate of discolouration. The extractives are responsible for intensive discolouration of tropical woods in contrast to light coloured woods from the temperate zone, where the yellowing is primarily caused by lignin photodegradation. The sound velocity was measured by ultrasound and resonance longitudinal method in heartwood of doussie (Afzelia bipindensis), merbau (Intsia bijuga), wengé (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.), muiracatiara (Astronium graveolens Jacq.) and <b>zebrano</b> (Microberlinia brazzavillensis). The sound velocity was not related to the density in any case. Although anatomical structural characteristics as fiber length or ray ratio positively influenced it. With longer fibers and slender rays the sound velocity increased. Other acoustic properties like dynamic young modulus of elasticity, specific modulus of elasticity, internal friction and acoustic conversion efficiency (ACE) were determined and were related to measured anatomical features. The differences in composition of wood tissue of individual species were the main source of departure between the assessed relationships. The wood with longer fibers and lower frequency of rays reached lower values of internal friction. The stiffness of wood characterized by the dynamic modulus of elasticity was correlated with fiber and ray tissue. A higher volume of fibers influenced the stiffness positively, while ray volume had the opposite effect on stiffness. Positive effects of fiber length and ray ratio were found for dynamic modulus of elasticity and for acoustic conversion efficiency as well. Both values increased with longer fibers and higher ray ratio. The sound velocity is the basis of some nondestructive techniques for determination of wood mechanical properties. The comparison of density and three dynamic moduli of elasticity (longitudinal and flexural resonance method and ultrasound method) in prediction of mechanical properties was carried out. The density was evaluated as a poor predictor when the samples are not straight-grained and defect free. The interlocked grain often occurred in tropical species and its presence influences the mechanical properties of wood but not wood density. The dynamic moduli of elasticity showed strong correlation with the static modulus of elasticity. Among nondestructive techniques, the weakest correlation was found for the ultrasound method, which is probably partially explained by different measuring mechanism. The prediction of the modulus of rupture is less accurate when the dynamic modulus of elasticity is compared with the static modulus of elasticity; however, it was still good in comparison with the density model...|$|E
