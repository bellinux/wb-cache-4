Effects of partial drawdowns, drawdown timing, and tilling on vegetation and seed production for waterfowl were tested in ponds at the Lewisville Aquatic Ecosystem Research Facility in north-central Texas. Vegetation lists, percent cover (PC), and above-ground biomass (AGB) revealed partial drawdowns produced a typical zonation of wetland plants: submergent macrophytes in deep-flooded zones; cattail (7 ypha sp.), black willow (Salix nigra), and sedges in shallow-flooded zones; forbs in moist zones adjacent to water; and, grasses in upper, drier <b>zones.</b> Seed production <b>of</b> grasses, sedges, and forbs generally reflected vegetation present in each soil-moisture <b>zone.</b> Taxon richness <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> was highest in dewatered zones. Drawdown timing did not affect taxon richness <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> within dewatered <b>zones,</b> but forb and sedge PC and AGB, and grass AGB, were highest during 1993 spring drawdown. The majority of grasses and forbs had higher seed production during 1992 late-summer/early-fall drawdown, whereas sedges produced more seeds during spring drawdown. Black willow occurred most frequently and cattail was first recorded during spring drawdown. Most submergent macrophytes were unaffected by drawdown timing. Soil disturbance with rototilling created diversity in ponds by increasing taxon richness <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants,</b> encouraging annuals, and discouraging perennials. PC, AGB, and seed production of forbs and grasses generally increased and decreased, respectively, with tilling, whereas sedges were not affected. Cattail and black willow occurred most frequently in tilled areas. Most submergent macrophytes were not affected by tilling, except southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis), with higher PC in tilled plots. Waterfowl visiting ponds utilized regions according to water depth and plant communities. Gadwall (Anas strepera) and American wigeon (A. americans) were most often observed within deep zones supporting submergent vegetation. Although data were not statistically significant, blue-winged teal (A. discors) and green-winged teal (A. crecca) occurred most often in shallow zones supporting emergent vegetation and seeds. Therefore, partial drawdowns, variations in drawdown timing, and soil disturbance, were effective in providing a variety of vegetation and seeds for a diversity of migrant and wintering waterfowl...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the effect <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plant</b> {{communities}} at Las Vegas Wash (the System) using a system dynamics modeling approach. Understanding the dynamics of nitrogen (N —major polluting nutrient in the Wash) that enters the System is important because it occasionally causes algal blooms, choking Lake Mead through excessive eutrophication. <b>Emergent</b> <b>plant</b> communities are an integral part of wetland ecosystems and they play a crucial role in natural treatment of nutrients. This study is intended to test this hypothesis. The study makes use of Wash data from reliable sources (Las Vegas Valley Water District, Las Vegas Wash Coordination Committee, USGS, Clark County Sanitation District, and literature review) to examine spatial and temporal changes of different nitrogen species; to describe causal relationships between major environmental variables and feedback mechanisms that make up the System; to ascertain major inflows and outflows (rates at which a variable enters or exits a stock), stocks (the accumulation of a variable within the system), sources, and sinks; and to simulate the System 2 ̆ 7 s behavior over time by changing the values of the environmental variables that make up the model. The model will help us identify policy levers hi the System including the effect <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plant</b> communities. The study is important because there is an ongoing restoration of the wetlands at the Las Vegas Wash and it is critical to understand how the nutrients accumulate and flow through the System.

We focused on the short-term responses <b>of</b> multiple co-occurring <b>emergent</b> salt marsh arthropods with differing levels of mobility and dispersal potential. As part of a marsh restoration project, two types <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> marsh structures were created: small circular mounds (0. 5 m diameter) separated by several meters of aquatic habitat, and larger, elongated terraces (. 50 m long). Study plots (0. 25 m 2) were established on both structures; in a subset of plots, we simulated a pulsed grazing disturbance event by clipping the aboveground tissue <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants,</b> primarily Spartina alterniflora.

Predatory spider treatment responses were similar to Ischnodemus responses, suggesting a trophic relationship between those two arthropod groups. Alternatively, spiders may have been directly affected by the loss of shelter in the disturbed plots. Prokelisia (Homoptera: Delphacidae), which are generally more mobile than Ischnodemus, were not affected by disturbance treatment or by patch size, suggesting the potential for rapid recolonization following disturbance.

The objective of our study was to analyze the processes governing patterns of European eel microhabitat distribution of four eel size classes (from, 160 mm to. 360 mm) in a reclaimed marsh (France). Analyses were conducted using artificial neural network (ANN) techniques and ecological profiles. Our ANN results showed that eel densities were significantly related to three major influencing variables: the width of ditch section, the silt depth, and the density <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants.</b> Such ecological profiles were significantly different between small (, 240 mm) and large eels (. 360 mm) : small eels were more widespread than large eels. Large eels were absent or at low densities in shallow ditches with a high aquatic plant cover obstructing the water column and a large quantity of silt. These characteristics seem to define the ditches not directly connected with the main river where dredging operations were rare.

Through perforating each stem above the water surface, pressurized ventilation was inhibited without affecting oxygen diffusion. In controls, 10 - 20 % of the stems were perforated {{to make certain that}} lack of efflux sites would not limit pressurized ventilation. Plants with inhibited pressurized ventilation had lower oxygen concentrations in their stem bases than control plants. Growth was lower in plants with inhibited pressurized ventilation compared to controls except when plants grew in a combination of sand and shallow water. In plants grown in an organic sediment, but not in those grown in sand, inhibition of pressurized ventilation resulted in decreased biomass allocation to soil roots but increased allocation to aquatic roots. Stem perforation affected the tissue concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese and aluminium but not of calcium or iron. We suggest that the lower growth in plants with inhibited pressurized ventilation was caused by decreased mineral uptake, which may have resulted from the decreased proportional allocation to soil root weight, from decreased mineral availability or from impaired root function. In plants grown in sand in shallow water, diffusion seemed to cover the oxygen demand, as pressurized ventilation did not affect growth...|$|R

However, the causes of CH 4 doubling during the last deglaciation are still uncertain and debated. Although the ice-core data consistently suggest a dominant contribution from northern high-latitude wetlands in the early Holocene, identifying the actual sources from the ground-based data has been elusive. Here we present data syntheses and a case study from Alaska to demonstrate the importance of northern wetlands in contributing to high atmospheric CH 4 concentration in the early Holocene. Our data indicate that new peatland formation as well as peat accumulation in northern high-latitude regions increased more than threefold in the early Holocene in response to climate warming {{and the availability of}} new habitat as a result of deglaciation. Furthermore, we show that marshes and wet fens that represent early stages of wetland succession were likely more widespread in the early Holocene.

Fresh greylag geese (Anser anser, n = 191) and purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio, n = 91) feces were collected from three sites (Caracoles, Entremuros and Cerro de los Ánsares) during the 2004 to 2008 wintering seasons. Lead and aluminium (Al; as an indicator of soil ingestion) were analyzed in dried/acid digested samples. The concentration of fecal porphyrins and biliverdin (as biomarkers of Pb effect) and Pb isotope profiles (to discriminate between potential sources of Pb exposure) were determined in a selection of samples. Results showed a decrease in Pb exposure over time in greylag geese wintering in Doñana, and that soil ingestion was the main source of exposure.

40|$|Plant litter is an {{indispensable}} component of constructed wetlands, but how the submergence of plant litter affects their ecosystem functions and services, {{such as water}} purification, is still unclear. Moreover, it is also unclear whether the effects of plant litter submergence depend on other {{factors such as the}} duration of litter submergence, water source or litter species identity. Here we conducted a greenhouse experiment by submerging the litter of 7 wetland plant species into three types of water substrates and monitoring changes in water nutrient concentrations. Litter submergence affected water quality positively via decreasing the concentration of nitrate nitrogen and negatively via increasing the concentrations of total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus. The effects of litter submergence depended on the duration of litter submergence, the water source, the litter species identity, and the plant life form. Different plant species had different effects on the water nutrient concentrations during litter submergence, and the effects of floating plants might be more negative than that <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants.</b> These results are novel evidence of how the submergence of different plant (life form) litter may affect the purification function of constructed wetlands.

Sampling locations were selected to cover a range of salinity (0. 81 to 31. 3 mS/cm) and nitrate concentrations (0. 1 to 303 μM NO 3 -), allowing the evaluation of environmental variables that select for denitrifier communities in the rhizosphere of Phragmites sp., Ruppia sp., and Paspalum sp. Potential nitrate reduction rates {{were found to be}} dependent on the sampling time and plant species and related to the denitrifiercommunity structure, which was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the functional genes nirS, nirK and nosZ.

In Goose Lake Marsh, a natural prairie pothole wetland in central Iowa, transect measurements, continuous monitoring, and synoptic surveys were used to examine patterns light availability, temperature, dissolved O 2 concentrations, dissolved CH 4 concentrations, plant densities, litter densities, and CH 4 flux due to diffusion and ebuliation within and outside emergent vegetation zones. Water column light availability was less than 2 % of ambient light in emergent vegetated areas due to canopy cover, small floating plants (lemnids), and plant litter. Water temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations were significantly lower and varied less diurnally in vegetated areas. Photosynthesis and aerobic respiration rates {{in the water column}} were much greater in open water than emergent vegetation zones. CH 4 concentrations in the water column were lower in open water than in emergent vegetation zones. But CH 4 flux rates differences were not different due to increased plant cover and thicker stagnant boundary layers in the emergent zones which slow gas. Three habitat zones could be identified based on patterns in vegetation and dissolved oxygen: (1) a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> dense <b>emergent</b> macrophytes providing significant submerged structure but with nearly or completely anoxic water, (2) a transition <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> sparse <b>emergent</b> macrophytes providing less structure but with more aerobic water, and (3) an open water zone with consistently aerobic water but with little submerged structure. A summary of the carbon budgets for the different zones indicates that the emergent zone was autotrophic while the open water and transitional zones were heterotrophic. Vegetation patterns are likely to control major aspects of wetland biogeochemistry and trophic dynamics. As a result, wetlands should be viewed as complex mosaics of habitats with distinct structural and functional characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Summary: “Integrated Constructed Wetlands ” (ICWs) are a {{specific}} design approach to water resource management. The concept, design, application and performance are described. The approach incorporates water quality management with “landscape fit ” and biodiversity along with {{social and economic}} considerations that help facilitate the required larger land areas used in ICW design compared with those generally used in other surface flow constructed wetlands. As a surface flow constructed wetland system, the cleansing capacity of the ICW is largely dependent upon the ratio of water inflow to wetland area. Precipitation-derived influent fluxes to the wetland are the primary influence in determining the required wetland area and consequently their cleansing capacity. The composition of the influent is of lower significance, with ammonium concentration having a threshold impact on the survival <b>of</b> the <b>emergent</b> <b>plant</b> species. Results for phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and faecal coliforms are given for 13 individual ICWs...|$|R
40|$|Deepwater {{vegetation}} {{and water quality}} ♦ 45 Floating, <b>emergent</b> and submerged <b>plants,</b> together with algal biomass and water quality parameters were evaluated in the deepwater basins (inflow, middle and outflow) of two experimental wetlands in Columbus Ohio during October 2002. The biomass of floating plants in W 1 was 19 ± 3 g m- 2, 22 ± 11 g m- 2 and 1. 0 ± 0. 6 g m- 2 for the inlet, middle and outflow basins respectively. In the inlet basin also 134 ± 14 g m- 2 <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plant</b> biomass was found. In the outlet basin, 107 ± 41 g m- 2 of submerged plant-algal biomass was also quantified. In the inlet basin of W 2, floating plants biomass was 9. 4 ± 5. 1 g m- 2 and emergent biomass was 92 ± 9 g m- 2. In the middle and outlet basins only submerged plant-algal biomass mat were found (73 ± 56 gm- 2 and 9. 2 ± 4. 7 gm- 2). The amount of each biomass type along the different basins was not statistically different. However significant difference between vegetation in the two wetlands {{was found in the}} middle basins. Temperature, pH and redox potential were not significantly different along the basins nor between two wetlands. In W- 1, a significant diminution of conductivity was observed from the inflow to the outflow (657 ± 31 to 520 ± 41 µmhoms cm- 1). Dissolved oxygen concentrations were higher in the evening than in the morning and the average of dissolved oxygen concentration in the outlet of W 1 (10. 7 mg l- 1) was significant higher. Conductivity decreasing and dissolved oxygen increasing were associated with the high productivity of submerged plant-algal biomass in the outlet basin of W 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} factors regulating {{growth and}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> with focus on effects of oxygen {{supply to the}} roots. Greenhouse experiments revealed that P. australis acclimatizes to specific water depths with phenotypic plasticity. These phenotypic responses act to increase growth at specific water depths but may result in decreased tolerance to changed water depth. Oxygen needed for aerobic respiration and protection from phytotoxins is transported to the roots from aerial plant parts by diffusion and, in some species, by pressurised ventilation. In greenhouse experiments, growth and biomass allocation patterns have been compared between P. australis plants with, and with inhibited, pressurised ventilation. Inhibition of pressurised ventilation resulted in hampered growth in deep water, and also in shallow water when grown in an organic substrate. In shallow water and a minerogenic substrate, diffusion seemed to cover the oxygen demand. Thus, {{the ability to use}} pressurised ventilation is suggested to result in a competitive advantage in deep water and in organic substrates. In contrast to earlier assumptions, this thesis presents evidence for occurrence of pressurised ventilation in seedlings of P. australis. Thus, high performance of species with pressurised ventilation during establishment, as well as in mature clones, is suggested to result in site preemption during establishment as well as long-term competitive advantage in deep water. A field study confirms that plants with pressurised ventilation generally grow in deeper water than plants without the ability to use pressurised ventilation in situ. Pressurised ventilation can however not be regarded as a prerequisite for growth in deep water as species with low or non-detectable flow rates also were found in deep water...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Coastal wetlands, as {{transient}} links from terrestrial to marine environments, {{are important}} for nitrogen removal by denitrification. Denitrification strongly depends on both the presence <b>of</b> <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> and the denitrifier communities selected by different plant species. In this study, the effects of vegetation and habitat heterogeneity on the community of deni-trifying bacteria were investigated in nine coastal wetlands in two preserved areas of Spain. Sampling locations were selected to cover a range of salinity (0. 81 to 31. 3 mS/cm) and nitrate concentrations (0. 1 to 303 μM NO 3 –), allowing the evaluation of environmental variables that select for denitrifier communities in the rhizosphere of Phragmites sp., Ruppia sp., and Paspalum sp. Potential nitrate reduction rates {{were found to be}} dependent on the sampling time and plant species and related to the deni-trifier community structure, which was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the func-tional genes nirS, nirK and nosZ. The results showed that denitrifier community structure was also governed by plant species and salinity, with significant influences of other variables, such as sampling time and location. Ruppia sp. and Phragmites sp. selected for certain communities, whereas {{this was not the case}} for Paspalum sp. The plant species effect was strongest on nirK-type denitrifiers, whereas water carbon content was a significant factor defining the structure of the nosZ-harboring com-munity. The differences recognized using the three functional gene markers indicated that different drivers act on denitrify-ing populations capable of complete denitrification, compared to the overall denitrifier community. This finding may have implications for emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. [Int Microbiol 2012; 15 (2) : 89 - 99...|$|R
40|$|English Abstract: The <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> {{may differ}} in their {{capacity}} to assimilate nutrients from eutrophic water bodies, so the utilization <b>of</b> suitable <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> is the key part for successful restoration of shallow eutrophic lakes. This research applied the depletion method after plants were grown for 4 weeks in 1 / 8 Hoagland nutrient solution to study the kinetics of uptake of nutrient (H 2 PO 4 -, NH 4 +, NO 3 -) by the three <b>emergent</b> aquatic <b>plants</b> Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis and Scirpus triqueter dominated in the littoral <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> Wuliangsuhai Lake (40 ° 36 '- 41 ° 03 'N, 108 ° 43 '- 108 ° 57 'E), a shallow eutrophic lake located in Urat Front Banner of Bayannaoer city, Inner Mongolia. The maximum uptake rate (Imax), Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), and Minimum equilibrium concentration (Cmin) were estimated by the ion consumption dynamics equation. The Imax for H 2 PO 4 - of Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, and Scirpus triqueter are 0. 3895 μmol g- 1 (dry weight, DW) h- 1, 0. 3053 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, and 0. 6330 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, While the Km for H 2 PO 4 - are 0. 0637 mmol/L, 0. 0645 mmol/L, and 0. 0702 mmol/L, respectively. Results indicated that the Scirpus triqueter has a significantly higher uptake rate of H 2 PO 4 - than Phragmites australis and Typha orientalis, but no differences {{have been found in}} the adaptation (tolerance) of the three species to low H 2 PO 4 - concentrations. The Imax for NH 4 + of Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, and Scirpus triqueter are 8. 995 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, 5. 584 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, and 13. 819 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, While the Km for NH 4 + are 1. 882 mmol/L, 1. 787 mmol/L, and 1. 874 mmol/L, respectively. The Imax for NO 3 - of Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, and Scirpus triqueter are 3. 374 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, 2. 544 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, and 10. 146 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, While the Km for NO 3 - are 0. 924 mmol/L, 0. 884 mmol/L, and 0. 847 mmol/L, respectively. Results indicated that Scirpus triqueter had also highest uptake rates of NH 4 + and NO 3 -, was tolerant to low NO 3 - concentrations but did not adapt to (tolerate) low NH 4 + concentrations. By contrast, Typha orientalis dislayed the strongest affinity to NH 4 + and the highest uptake at low NH 4 + concentrations, which the Cmin is 1. 724 mmol/L lower than Phragmites australis (1. 865 mmol/L) and Scirpus triqueter (1. 833 mmol/L). Overall the three <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> showed higher uptake capacity for NH 4 + than for NO 3 -. Nutrient uptake characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>emergent</b> <b>plants</b> are species-specific and influenced by the structure of roots. Outcomes of this research suggest that Scirpus triqueter suits best as pioneering species for ecological restoration of water bodies with high NH 4 + and NO 3 - concentrations, while Typha orientalis suits well for stabilizing improved water quality conditions. 采用常规耗竭法研究了浅水富营养化湖泊——乌梁素海湖滨植被带 3 种挺水植物芦苇、香蒲和藨草对H 2 PO 4 -、NH 4 +、NO 3 -的吸收动力学特征及差异。结果表明： 3 种挺水植物吸收H 2 PO 4 -时，藨草的吸收速率显著大于芦苇和香蒲，但三者对低浓度H 2 PO 4 -的适应能力均无显著差异；藨草对NH 4 +和NO 3 -的吸收速率均显著大于芦苇和香蒲，且在低浓度NO 3 -环境下仍能吸收该离子，但对低浓度NH 4 +环境的适应能力较差；与藨草相比，香蒲对NH 4 +的亲和力最强，吸收低浓度NH 4 +的效果最好。 3 种植物对NH 4 +的吸收能力均大于NO 3 -。挺水植物的养分吸收特征具有物种特异性并受根系结构的影响。利用植物的养分吸收特征，在富营养化湖泊生态修复中适宜用藨草治理含高浓度H 2 PO 4 -，NH 4 +和NO 3 -的水体，修复到一定程度后再种植香蒲来维持水质。张熙灵, 王立新, 刘华民, 清 华, 刘东伟, 王 炜, 梁存柱, Friedrich Recknage...|$|R
