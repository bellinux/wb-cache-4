The concentrations Cp of polymers (chains) and C m of monomers (links) are fixed by two chemical potentials. It is shown that the osmotic pressure obeys a scaling law of the form (P/KTCp) = F(Cp N 3 ν) where N is the mean number of monomers per polymer (N = Cp/C m) and ν the critical index defining the size of a long isolated polymer. The function F(λ) can be expanded in powers of λ and it is given implicitly by the generating functional of the zero-momentum vertex functions derived from the Lagrangian theory.
