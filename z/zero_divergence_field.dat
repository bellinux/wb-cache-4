In "Irreducible Representations of the Lie-Algebra of the Diffeomorphisms of a d-Dimensional Torus," S. Eswara Rao constructs modules for the Lie algebra of polynomial vector fields on a d-dimensional torus, and determines {{the conditions for}} irreducibility. The current paper considers the restriction of these modules to the subalgebra of <b>divergence</b> <b>zero</b> vector <b>fields.</b> It is shown here that Rao's results transfer to similar irreducibility conditions for the Lie algebra of <b>divergence</b> <b>zero</b> vector <b>fields.</b> Comment: 13 page...|$|R

This is the flowsetting counterpart of Newhouse’s Theorem 1. 3 [17]. Our result follows from two theorems, {{the first one is}} the 3 -dimensional continuous-time version of a theorem of Xia [21] and says that if Λ is a hyperbolic invariant set for some class C 1 <b>zero</b> <b>divergence</b> vector <b>field</b> X on M, then either X is Anosov, or else Λ has empty interior. The second one is a version, for our 3 -dimensional class, of Theorem 2 of Saghin-Xia [20] and says that, if X is not Anosov, then for any open set U ⊆ M there exists Y arbitrarily close to X such that Y t has an elliptical closed orbit through U.

40|$|A recent {{approach}} {{to generate a}} <b>zero</b> <b>divergence</b> velocity <b>field</b> by operating directly on the discretized Navier-Stokes equations is used to obtain the decoupling of the pressure from the velocity field. By following the methodology suggested by Amit, Hall, and Porsching the feasibility of treating three dimensional flows and multiply connected domains is analyzed. The present model keeps the main features of the classical vector potential method in that it generates a divergence-free velocity field through an algebraic manipulation of the discrete equations. At {{the same time the}} boundary conditions are still imposed on the discrete values of the primitive variables. The accuracy of the method is tested against the exact solution for a recirculating unsteady flow both in simply and doubly connected domains. Several applications to flow fields in three-dimensional enclosures or in multiply connected domains are presented and discussed in terms of accuracy and efficiency of the method. © 1991...|$|R

40|$|In {{steganography}} (the hiding of {{data into}} innocuous covers for secret communication) {{it is difficult}} to estimate how much data can be hidden while still remaining undetectable. To measure the inherent detectability of steganography, Cachin [1] suggested the c-secure measure, where c is the Kullback Leibler (K-L) divergence between the cover distribution and the distribution after hiding. At <b>zero</b> <b>divergence,</b> an optimal statistical detector can do no better than guessing; the data is undetectable.

Midlatitude SST fronts also significantly modify surface wind direction; the surface wind speed and direction responses to typical SST differences of about 2 °– 4 °C are, on average, about 1 – 2 m s⁻¹ and 4 °– 8 °, respectively, over all four regions. Wind speed perturbations are positively correlated and very nearly collocated spatially with the SST perturbations. Wind direction perturbations, however, are displaced meridionally from the SST perturbations, with cyclonic flow poleward of warm SST and anticyclonic flow poleward of cool SST.
