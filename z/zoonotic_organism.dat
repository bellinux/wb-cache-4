These exposures include radiation, anaesthetic gases, pesticides (particularly insecticides), and <b>zoonotic</b> <b>organisms.</b> This review aims to summarise what is known about the carcinogenic risks in this profession.  METHODS—The levels of exposure to potential carcinogens in the veterinary profession are examined and evidence is reviewed for carcinogenesis of these substances in humans at doses similar to those experienced by veterinarians. The few published studies of cancer in veterinarians are also summarised.  RESULTS—Veterinarians have considerable potential for exposure to several known and potential carcinogens.

Virulence of selected avian A. baumannii isolates was {{comparable to that of}} clinical isolates in the Galleria mellonella infection model. Whole genome sequencing revealed the close relationship of an antibiotic-susceptible chicken isolate from Germany with a multidrug-resistant human clinical isolate from China and additional linkages between livestock isolates and human clinical isolates related to international clonal lineages. Moreover, we identified stork isolates related to human clinical isolates from the United States. Multilocus sequence typing disclosed further kinship between avian and human isolates. Avian isolates do not form a distinct clade within the phylogeny of A. baumannii, instead they diverge into different lineages.

40|$|Schistosomiasis japonica is {{a serious}} {{communicable}} disease and a major disease risk for more than 30 million {{people living in the}} tropical and subtropical zones of China. Infection remains a major public health concern despite 45 years of intensive control efforts. It is estimated that 865, 000 people and 100, 250 bovines are today infected in the provinces where the disease is endemic, and its transmission continues. Unlike the other schistosome species known to infect humans, the oriental schistosome, Schistosoma japonicum, is a true <b>zoonotic</b> <b>organism,</b> with a range of mammalian reservoirs, making control efforts extremely difficult. Clinical features of schistosomiasis range from fever, headache, and lethargy to severe fibro-obstructive pathology leading to portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly, which can cause premature death. Infected children are stunted and have cognitive defects impairing memory and learning ability. Current control programs are heavily based on community chemotherapy with a single dose of the drug praziquantel, but vaccines (for use in bovines and humans) in combination with other control strategies are needed to make elimination of the disease possible.

Because many diarrhoeic pathogens like Cryptosporidium and Giardia are <b>zoonotic,</b> (<b>organisms</b> that can be transmitted between animals and people), monitoring herds for diarrhoeal disease may improve understanding of exposure risks. Animal sentinels have been proposed as practical substitutes for resource-intensive surveillance systems to detect and provide early warning {{of the presence of}} pathogens, changes in the prevalence or incidence of disease/pathogens over time and to trigger disease response and control efforts (Rabinowitz et al. 2009; McCluskey 2003).

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Brucella canis in South Africa is unknown and suspected to be under-detected. The majority of dogs in South Africa are not tested for Brucella canis, {{not only because}} of the level of awareness of Brucella canis in South Africa, but also because of the lack of clinical suspicion. It is not known how the infection entered South Africa. Brucella canis, a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>organism</b> that causes canine brucellosis in dogs, is a significant cause of reproductive failure in dogs worldwide. Canine brucellosis is a chronic infectious zoonotic disease whose main etiological agent, the Brucella canis bacterium, are rough, intracellular proteobacteria in the Brucellaceae family. Clinical signs in bitches are mainly infertility and abortion, while in males, epididymitis and orchitis occur. However, discospondylitis may develop in both sexes. A serological survey was conducted to determine the {{prevalence of}} Brucella canis infection in dogs from the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan (NMBM) Port Elizabeth (PE) area. A total of 400 samples were collected, 350 of which were collected in seven different townships and 50 were collected in the three different welfare organisations in the study area. Of the 400 serum samples collected, 39 (9. 75 %) tested serologically positive by using the Tube Agglutination Test (TAT), the 2 -Mercaptoethanol-TAT (2 ME-TAT) or the Compliment Fixation Test (CFT). The results of the CFT showed that nine of the 39 positive samples had a maximum antibody titre of 784 IU/ml. The prevalence rate varied tremendously between the samples from the townships and those from the welfare organisations. The prevalence rate of seropositive animals in PE ranged between 5 % and 16 % in the study area. No positive cases were found in KwaMagxaki and the Animal Welfare Society of PE, but both were surrounded by areas that had positive cases of Brucella canis infection. The female dogs in the study area had a higher sero-prevalence of only 0. 0169 (95 % CI, 0. 0631 to 0. 1489) differences in proportion, and were thus not significant (p > 0. 05). However, the female spayed dogs had a much higher significant difference of 0. 1898 (95 % iv CI, 0. 1058 to 0. 2738) in proportion to the male neutered dogs and were thus statistically significant (p 0. 05). However, the female spayed dogs had a much higher significant difference of 0. 1898 (95 % iv CI, 0. 1058 to 0. 2738) in proportion to the male neutered dogs and were thus statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Despite those results, out of all the dogs positive for Brucella canis only two were neutered males and five were spayed females, and the rest were all intact. In conclusion, according to the results, Brucella canis antibodies were detected in sera of dogs mostly from the townships surveyed. Preventive measures against this contagion should be taken into consideration to eliminate Brucella canis infection from the entire dog population. Reservoir dogs and actively infected dogs either should be kept in quarantine or should be euthanized, because not only can they spread the disease and end the reproductive life of any breeding animal, but they are also a risk to human health.

30|$|The {{results are}} in {{agreement}} with the findings of Onono et al. (2015) who reported that treatment of cattle in Narok County was done by male pastoralists. The pastoralists’ self-medication of their camel and other livestock poses serious public health risks due to use of the wrong veterinary drugs, over-dosing and under-dosing. The over- or under-dosing of camels is complicated by lack of camel dosage information on most drug packages, hence extrapolation of camel dosages based on cattle or horse dosage, which can lead to over-dosing and under-dosing. The presence of veterinary drug residues in camels and camel milk and meat can lead to development of drug resistant organisms in both the camels and the humans consuming camel products. This can result in development of drug- resistant <b>zoonotic</b> <b>organisms</b> in the camel. When camel products are consumed, the drug- resistant foodborne organisms are then transmitted to human consumers, thus posing a food safety and public health issue.

40|$|Defining {{prospective}} pathways {{by which}} zoonoses evolve and emerge as human pathogens {{is critical for}} anticipating and controlling both natural and deliberate pandemics. However, predicting tenable pathways of animal-to-human movement has been hindered by challenges in identifying reservoir species, cultivating <b>zoonotic</b> <b>organisms</b> in culture, and isolating full-length genomes for cloning and genetic studies. The ability to design and recover pathogens reconstituted from synthesized cDNAs {{has the potential to}} overcome these obstacles by allowing studies of replication and pathogenesis without identification of reservoir species or cultivation of primary isolates.

To test a possible route of emergence from the noncultivable Bat-SCoV to human SARS-CoV, we designed a consensus Bat-SCoV genome and replaced the Bat-SCoV Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) with the SARS-CoV RBD (Bat-SRBD). Bat-SRBD was infectious in cell culture and in mice and was efficiently neutralized by antibodies specific for both bat and human CoV Spike proteins.

Infection of {{domestic}} dogs in Peru by zoonotic Bartonella apecies: a cross-sectional prevalence study of 219 asymptomatic dogs. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases [en línea]. 2013, vol. 7, no. 9, p. 1 - 10. ISSN 1935 - 2727. Bartonella species are emerging infectious organisms transmitted by arthropods capable of causing long-lasting infection in mammalian hosts. Among over 30 species described from four continents to date, 15 {{are known to}} infect humans, with eight of these capable of infecting dogs as well. B. bacilliformis is the only species described infecting humans in Peru; however, several other Bartonella species were detected in small mammals, bats, ticks, and fleas in that country. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the serological and/or molecular prevalence of Bartonella species in asymptomatic dogs in Peru in order to indirectly evaluate the potential for human exposure to zoonotic Bartonella species. A convenient sample of 219 healthy dogs was obtained from five cities and three villages in Peru. EDTA-blood samples were collected from 205 dogs, whereas serum samples were available from 108 dogs. The EDTA-blood samples were screened by PCR followed by nucleotide sequencing for species identification. Antibodies against B. vinsonii berkhoffii and B. rochalimae were detected by IFA (cut-off of 1 : 64). Bartonella DNA was detected in 21 of the 205 dogs (10 %). Fifteen dogs were infected with B. rochalimae, while six dogs were infected with B. v. berkhoffii genotype III. Seropositivity for B. rochalimae was detected in 67 dogs (62 %), and for B. v. berkhoffii in 43 (40 %) of the 108 dogs. Reciprocal titers $ 1 : 256 for B. rochalimae were detected in 19 % of dogs, and for B. v. berkhoffii in 6. 5 % of dogs.

MosierObjective – To {{determine}} the preventive practices concerning zoonotic disease transmission {{between humans and}} animals in interactive exhibits at Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) accredited institutions. Data were also analyzed to determine if annual budget was associated with particular preventive measures among the institutions. Design – Cross-sectional questionnaire. Participants –AZA accredited zoos and aquariums from across the United States and Canada. Procedures – A questionnaire, approved by the AZA’s Animal Health Committee, was distributed electronically to 166 institutions from the 2008 AZA list of accredited institutions. Responses were collected, tallied according to grouping by annual budget, and analyzed using Chi-square analysis to determine independence. Results – Forty-four of 166 (26. 5 %) of questionnaires were returned with data. The data indicated that {{all but one of}} 40 (97. 5 %) institutions with petting zoos provided hand sanitation, either via running water and soap or sanitizing gel at the exhibit exit. However, only half (17 of 34) of walk-through aviaries had some form of hand sanitation available at the exhibit exit. Only 17 of 40 (42. 5 %) petting zoos and 5 of 34 (14. 7 %) walk-through aviary exhibits had signs posted warning of the zoonotic dangers. Minor bite wounds associated with an aviary exhibit were reported from one institution, which was the only associated illness with either the petting zoo or walk-through aviary exhibits in this questionnaire. There were no statistical relationships between budget category and reported preventive measures. Conclusions – Respondents had many practices already in place to minimize the risk of disease transmission to visitors. Institutions should evaluate their current preventive measures with regards to this questionnaire and make modifications as necessary. One area many institutions should add to their current practices is disinfecting interactive exhibit barriers that the public can contact, to remove potential <b>zoonotic</b> <b>organisms.</b> This questionnaire found 4 institutions were not vaccinating mammals in interactive exhibits for rabies. The subsequent risk posed to visitors is one easily avoided. Twenty-three institutions with petting zoos did not have signs warning of the zoonotic dangers, and risky practices (eg, leaving animals on exhibit with loose stool) were reported by 8 petting zoo institutions. Some form of hand sanitation, preferably soap and sinks with running water, and signs educating visitors of the zoonotic potential were missing at many walk-through aviaries in this questionnaire, despite the fact that all 34 institutions with aviaries reported visitors may contact feces in the exhibit.

Owing to lack of specific therapeutic regiment against the disease, we cloned and characterized B. microti lactate dehydrogenase (BmLDH) as a potential molecular drug receptor. The in vitro kinetic properties of BmLDH enzyme was evaluated using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a co-factor and lactate as a substrate. Inhibitory assay was also done using gossypol as BmLDH inhibitor to determine the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50). The result showed that the 0. 99  kbp BmLDH gene codes for a barely soluble 36  kDa protein (332 amino acids) localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the parasite.

Inhibitory assay was also done using gossypol as BmLDH inhibitor to determine the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC 50). The result showed that the 0. 99 kbp BmLDH gene codes for a barely soluble 36 kDa protein (332 amino acids) localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the parasite. In vitro enzyme kinetic studies further revealed that BmLDH is an active enzyme with a high catalytic efficiency at optimal pH of 10. 2. The Km values of NAD + and lactate were 8. 7 ± 0. 57 mM and 99. 9 ± 22. 33 mM, respectively. The IC 50 value for gossypol was 0. 345 &mUM, while at 2. 5 &mUM, gossypol caused 100 % inhibition of BmLDH catalytic activity. These findings, therefore, provide initial evidence that BmLDH could be a potential drug target, although further in vivo {{studies are needed to}} validate the practical application of lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors against B. microti infection...|$|R
30|$|We {{assessed}} Cryptosporidium {{as a model}} pathogen for our {{risk reduction}} concept due to its transmission ecology, zoonotic potential and diarrhoeic effect on susceptible animals. Cryptosporidium was detected at relatively high prevalences at the herd level compared to other studies in the region (Tanzania Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security 2002; Kusiluka et al. 2005), and Cryptosporidium shedding was {{associated with an increased}} risk of diarrhoeal disease in neonatal calves. Because Cryptosporidium shares a similar transmission ecology {{to a wide range of}} <b>zoonotic</b> faecal-oral diarrhoeagenic <b>organisms,</b> it could serve as a proxy for many other diarrhoea-causing pathogens. It should be noted that we are not proposing a calf sentinel system as a solution for the surveillance or detection of diarrhoeagenic zoonotic pathogens, rather that the calf sentinel concept could be explored as practical option for visually identifying potential presence of zoonotic pathogens in order to implement risk reduction measures in areas where professional health and diagnostic services are unavailable.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{established}} zoonoses from dogs, and identifies the potential burden of speculative zoonoses of canine origin in Aboriginal communities in Central Australia. A variety of organisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites including protozoa, ectoparasites and helminths (worms) have possible <b>zoonotic</b> capability; these <b>organisms</b> are discussed. Observational {{research was conducted}} in seven Aboriginal Town Camps of Alice Springs to describe the human and dog interactions and behaviours, and risk factors for transmission. Information was also gathered on the cultural significance of dogs to Aboriginal {{people in the community}} under observation. The relationship between Aboriginal people and their dogs appears to be not only one of companionship, but involves other more complex cultural factors. The contribution dogs make to infections and infestations of Aboriginal people in communities throughout Australia remains unclear. Education and dog health programs have an important role in reducing the risk of canine-related human morbidity in Aboriginal communities.

40|$|This survey {{investigated}} {{the distribution of}} various intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens in stray and free-roaming cats living in four regions of Greece. A total number of {{one hundred and fifty}} cats living in three Islands (Crete, Mykonos and Skopelos) and in Athens municipality was established as a realistic aim to be accomplished in the study areas. All cats were examined with different microscopic, serological and molecular assays aiming at evaluating the occurrence of intestinal parasites, and exposure to or presence of vector-borne infections. A total of 135 cats (90 %) was positive for one or more parasites and/or pathogens transmitted by ectoparasites. Forty-four (29. 3 %) cats were positive for one single infection, while 91 (60. 7 %) for more than one pathogen. A high number of (n. 53) multiple infections caused by feline intestinal and vector-borne agents including at least one zoonotic pathogen was detected. Among them, the most frequently recorded helminths were roundworms (Toxocara cati, 24 %) and Dipylidium caninum (2 %), while a high number of examined animals (58. 8 %) had seroreaction for Bartonella spp., followed by Rickettsia spp. (43. 2 %) and Leishmania infantum (6. 1 %). DNA-based assays revealed the <b>zoonotic</b> arthropod-borne <b>organisms</b> Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae, Rickettsia spp., and L. infantum. These results show that free-ranging cats living in areas of Greece under examination may be exposed to a plethora of internal parasites and vector-borne pathogens, some of them potentially able to infect humans. Therefore, epidemiological vigilance and appropriate control measures are crucial for the prevention and control of these infections and to minimize the risk of infection for people...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunobiology}} of {{enzootic abortion}} of ewes (EAE) is incompletely understood. The causative agent is Chlamydia psittaci, which infects many ruminant species and has <b>zoonotic</b> potential. The <b>organism</b> can {{survive in the}} ovine host for many months without causing clinical symptoms but does not generate a sterile immunity during this time. It has been postulated that the organism persists in the host entering at a latent phase, possibly mediated by host cytokine production. The effects of cytokines on chlamydial multiplication vary between host species, between different cell types within those species and also vary between chlamydial species and strains. The multiplication of the EAE strain of C. psittaci in ovine ST- 6 cells can be restricted by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not with comparable concentrations of IFN-alpha. Altering the nutrient composition of the cultures by addition of tryptophan partially reverses the antichlamydial effects of the IFN-gamma. This offers a potential mechanism by which C. psittaci can persist in sheep. The implications of these observations for the pathogenesis of EAE are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Serologic and {{molecular}} evidence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum {{has been demonstrated}} in white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus), and deer are an important host for the tick vector Ixodes scapularis. In this study, we describe experimental infection of WTD with A. phagocytophilum. We inoculated four WTD with a human isolate of A. phagocytophilum propagated in tick cells. Two additional deer served as negative controls. All inoculated deer developed antibodies (titers, ≥ 64) to A. phagocytophilum, as determined by an indirect fluorescent antibody test, between 14 and 24 days postinfection [p. i. ]), and two deer maintained reciprocal titers of ≥ 64 {{through the end of}} the 66 -day study. Although morulae were not observed in granulocytes and A. phagocytophilum was not reisolated via tick cell culture of blood, 16 S reverse transcriptase nested PCR (RT-nPCR) results indicated that A. phagocytophilum circulated in peripheral blood of three deer through at least 17 days p. i. and was present in two deer at 38 days p. i. Femoral bone marrow from one deer was RT-nPCR positive for A. phagocytophilum at 66 days p. i. There was no indication of clinical disease. These data confirm that WTD are susceptible to infection with a human isolate of A. phagocytophilum and verify that WTD produce detectable antibodies upon exposure to the organism. Because adults are the predominant life stage of I. scapularis found on deer and because adult I. scapularis ticks do not transmit A. phagocytophilum transovarially, it is unlikely that WTD are a significant source of A. phagocytophilum for immature ticks even though deer have a high probability of natural infection. However, the susceptibility and immunologic response of WTD to A. phagocytophilum render them suitable candidates as natural sentinels for this <b>zoonotic</b> tick-borne <b>organism...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{direct and}} {{repeated}} exposure to antimicrobials in domestic {{animals and humans}} {{has been shown to}} produce strong selective pressures for the maintenance of antimicrobial resistance in their enteric bacteria. Though wild animal populations are not directly exposed to antimicrobials, antimicrobial resistance has been reported in some wild animal populations. Proximity to humans has been reported to be associated with a higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in wild animal populations. In this study faecal samples were screened for indicator and <b>zoonotic</b> bacterial <b>organisms</b> from primate populations (baboons and vervet monkeys) located at two primate rehabilitation centres close to the Kruger National Park, South Africa. For comparison purposes, samples were obtained from non-human primates with 3 distinct levels of exposure to humans. The 1 st group had regular human contact and consisted of mostly orphaned juveniles that were fed, bathed and cuddled regularly. The 2 nd group had been weaned from frequent contact with humans, but had occasional contact. The 3 rd group lived in enclosures similar to their natural habitats with almost no human contact. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out on all isolates using the Sensititre GPALL 1 F and GNX 2 F MIC plates (Trekds, UK). The Gram- positive isolates were tested against 22 antimicrobial drugs while the other Gram-negative bacteria were tested against 21 antimicrobial drugs all in dosages used by humans. In all, 300 fresh faecal samples were collected. Sixty enterococci, 64 Klebsiella spp., and 64 Escherichia coli/E. fergusonii strains were isolated from the baboon samples. From the vervet faecal samples 40 enterococci, 64 Klebsiella spp. and 64 E. coli/E. fergusonii strains were isolated. Over eighty percent of the Gram-negative isolates were resistant to polymyxin B and E (colistin) as well as the carbapenems with occasional resistance recorded against aminoglycosides. Eighty percent of the Gram- positives (all enterococci) were resistant to aminoglycosides, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones. More than 90 % of all the Gram-negative isolates were susceptible to penicillins and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations {{with the exception of the}} Salmonella spp. in which about 50 % of the isolates were resistant. The highest level of antimicrobial drug resistance in the non-human primates was observed in group 1. Comparatively speaking, group 1 had 20 % and 23 % higher levels of resistance than group 2 and group 3 respectively. This was observed for all the antimicrobials tested, especially polymyxin B and colistin. It was also observed that antimicrobial resistance levels decreased with age; with isolates from older animals being less resistant. This resistance profile was similar in all 3 groups in both rehabilitation centers. Establishing the presence of microbial exchange between human populations and wildlife (especially primates), even in the absence of immediate disease concerns, may identify points of contact where increased surveillance may be justified because of higher risks of novel disease emergence.

40|$|Transmission of Giardia duodenalis infections {{from animals}} to humans {{has been a}} subject of recent {{research}} interest. Several reports have shown animals harboring strains of G. duodenalis that have also been identified from human samples. Much of the work assessing the <b>organism's</b> <b>zoonotic</b> potential {{has been done on}} livestock and companion animals, given high prevalence rates, high intensity of shedding, and their relationships with humans as domesticated species. The research presented in this dissertation is a compilation of four complementary studies aimed at assessing the zoonotic potential of Giardia duodenalis infections in dairy cattle and dogs. The first study was a longitudinal cohort study in which the incidence of Giardia infections was evaluated in dairy cattle in the New York City Watershed encompassing Delaware, Greene, Schoharie, Ulster, and Sullivan counties in New York. Three cohorts were analyzed based on their prior infection status with Giardia. 10, 672 fecal samples were collected from calves and adult cattle from 40 dairy herds. The cumulative incidence was 25 % {{over the course of the}} two-year study. Risk factors such as age, prior infection status, and season of sampling were shown to be significantly associated with shedding Giardia cysts. The second study was a repeated prevalence study done on the same target population described in the first study. The major goal was to determine the prevalence of assemblages of G. duodenalis in dairy cattle in order to genetically characterize infections. 2, 109 samples were collected of which 504 were positive for Giardia based on fecal flotation for a cumulative incidence of 23. 9 %. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the beta-giardin and triosephosphate isomerase genes with subsequent DNA sequencing revealed livestock-specific and potentially zoonotic genotypes in dairy cattle in the New York City Watershed. The third study was a cross-sectional study with aims to 1) determine the prevalence of G. duodenalis in dairy cattle in Trinidad and Tobago, 2) conduct multi-locus characterization of G. duodenalis infections using PCR, and 3) identify risk factors associated with G. duodenalis infections in this population. One hundred and ninety-six samples were analyzed by PCR of the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu-rRNA) gene as the only diagnostic test. Twenty-five samples were positive for a prevalence of 12. 8 %. Of the ssu-rRNA positive samples, ten were positive by PCR amplification of the beta-giardin gene. Three samples showed heterogeneity of assemblage typing between the two loci, likely indicating mixed infections of assemblages A and E. The final study was a cross-sectional study done on owned, shelter, and free-roaming dogs in Trinidad and Tobago. The major goals were to 1) determine the prevalence of G. duodenalis infections in dogs, 2) assess the risk of G. duodenalis infections to humans through genetic characterization of isolates, 3) compare test agreement between a commercially-available ELISA test kit for Giardia and PCR, and 4) identify risk factors associated with G. duodenalis infections in dogs. 104 samples were analyzed by PCR of the ssu-rRNA gene of which 26 were positive for a prevalence of 25 %. No zoonotic strains were present in the study population. Dogspecific assemblages C and D were found as well as one sample identified as assemblage E. The kappa statistic for agreement between PCR and ELISA was 0. 67 indicating good agreement between the tests. Risk factors for infection in dogs included age, group housing, and ownership status. These findings contribute to greater understanding of the zoonotic potential of G. duodenalis infections in dairy cattle and dogs. The New York Watershed studies highlight growing public health concerns about zoonotic pathogens in the public water supply. The work done in Trinidad and Tobago represents pilot epidemiologic research on G. duodenalis infections from livestock and companion animals and contributes to our knowledge about the global distribution of G. duodenalis. While these studies do not directly link infections in dairy cattle and dogs to humans, they provide information on risk factors that may perpetuate G. duodenalis infections in these populations, other animal populations and humans. Taking significant risk factors into consideration may reduce the occurrence of G. duodenalis infections in dairy cattle and dogs, thereby indirectly reducing the potential for infections in humans...|$|R
