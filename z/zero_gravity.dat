ILM also did minor touchup to the scenes as required, adding {{clothing}} tears where the phaser blasts hit {{the actors and}} adding the hazy Klingon atmosphere to the computer-rendered objects. These <b>zero</b> <b>gravity</b> scenes were the most expensive sequences to complete.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{four stages}} {{take place in}} power plants, flats, {{underwater}} habitats, and space stations in <b>zero</b> <b>gravity,</b> respectively. Every level is an interior space, and consists of multi-storey rooms and corridors divided by interlocking lifts and doors. The player {{is equipped with a}} jet pack to reach higher areas and perform acrobatic manoeuvres such as backflips and rolls. They can also swim and dive underwater. Robots attack the player with shooting flames should they come into contact. Each stage ends with a boss battle, ranging from fire-breathing flowers to robotic fish.|$|E

5|$|Graff and {{the other}} leaders of the school covertly work to isolate Ender from his fellow {{recruits}} and prevent him from growing too comfortable in his environment. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in <b>zero</b> <b>gravity,</b> where Ender quickly masters the game and dominates his opponents. The school continually tries to break Ender down, first promoting him to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitting him against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. The jealous commander of the army with whom Ender first served, Bonzo Madrid, compels him to fight outside the simulation, and Ender unintentionally kills him, once again seeking to preemptively prevent all future struggles with Bonzo.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the <b>zero</b> <b>gravity</b> {{scenes were}} handled by Pacific Data Images, while phaser beams and {{transporter}} effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, {{an offshoot of}} ILM that had contributed to The Wrath of Khan and The Final Frontier. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, {{they would try to}} tell the story with only one. Cheap animatics provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS Enterprise had been destroyed in , all shots of the USS Enterprise-A had to feature the updated ship registry.|$|E
5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built into the front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the <b>zero</b> <b>gravity</b> sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E

We suggest that this unusual nature of the extremal limit could explain the entropy of extremal Kerr black holes. The time-independence of the extremal black hole, the <b>zero</b> surface <b>gravity,</b> the <b>zero</b> entropy {{and the absence of}} a bifurcate Killing horizon are all related properties that define and reduce to one single unique feature of the extremal Kerr spacetime.

5|$|Greg Jein, {{best known}} as the builder of the alien {{mothership}} from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime Star Trek fan who had constructed the props for The Final Frontier, but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from Buck Rogers, while the frong was detailed with a prop from Buckaroo Banzai. Elements from The Final Frontier were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in The Final Frontier became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the <b>zero</b> <b>gravity</b> scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.|$|E

40|$|In this {{numerical}} study, randomly and sinusoidally modulated gravitational fields {{imposed on}} three-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection are investigated {{in an effort}} to understand the effects of vibration (G-Jitter) on fluid systems. The time-dependent, Navier-Stokes equations and the energy equation with Boussinesq approximations are solved by a semi-implicit, pseudospectral procedure. An analysis of energy balances indicates that with increasing modulation amplitude, transition from synchronous to relaxation oscillation goes through the subharmonic response. Random modulations are found to be less stabilizing than sinusoidal and are shown to impose three-dimensionality on the flow for some parameter ranges both at terrestrial and <b>zero</b> base <b>gravity</b> conditions...|$|R

40|$|Black holes arising in {{the context}} of scalar-tensor gravity theories, where the scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the {{curvature}} term, have <b>zero</b> surface <b>gravity.</b> Hence, it is generally stated that their Hawking temperature is zero, irrespectivelly of their gravitational and scalar charges. The proper analysis of the Hawking temperature requires to study the propagation of quantum fields in the space-time determined by these objects. We study scalar fields {{in the vicinity of the}} horizon of these black holes. It is shown that the scalar modes do not form an orthonormal set. Hence, the Hilbert space is ill-definite in this case, and no notion of temperature can be extracted for such objects. Comment: Latex file, 6 pages. To appear in Gravitation&Cosmolog...|$|R
40|$|Nonextreme {{black hole}} in a cavity can achieve the extreme state with a <b>zero</b> surface <b>gravity</b> at a finite {{temperature}} on a boundary, the proper distance between the boundary and the horizon being finite. The classical geometry in this state is found explicitly for four-dimensional spherically-symmetrical and 2 + 1 rotating holes. In the first case the limiting geometry depends only on one scale factor and the whole Euclidean manifold is described by the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. The general structure of a metric in the limit under consideration is also found with quantum corrections taken into account. Its angular part represents two-sphere of a constant radius. In all cases the Lorentzian counterparts of the metrics are free from singularities. Comment: 10 pages, Revtex 3. 0. To be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, by {{presenting}} the potentials of Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in the corresponding Schrödinger equations, we investigate the localization and resonances {{of gravity and}} fermion on the symmetric and asymmetric Bloch branes. We find that the localization properties of <b>zero</b> modes for <b>gravity</b> and fermion in the symmetric brane case are the same, whereas, for the asymmetric brane case, the fermion zero mode is localized {{on one of the}} sub-branes, while the <b>gravity</b> <b>zero</b> mode is localized on another sub-brane. The spectra of the gravity and the left- or right-handed fermion are composed of a bound zero mode and a series of gapless continuous massive KK modes. Among the continuous massive KK modes, we obtain some discrete gravity and fermion resonant (quasilocalized) KK states on the brane, which have a finite probability of escaping into the bulk. The KK states with lower resonant masses have a longer lifetime on the brane. And the number of the resonant KK states increases linearly with the width of the brane and the scalar-fermion coupling constant, but it decreases with the asymmetric factor β. The structure of the resonance spectrum is investigated in detail. Comment: 19 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{electric}} field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges {{in a similar manner}} to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually <b>zero.</b> Thus <b>gravity</b> is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.|$|R
