25|$|Given any pair A, B {{of objects}} in an abelian category, {{there is a special}} zero {{morphism}} from A to B. This can be defined as the <b>zero</b> <b>element</b> of the hom-set Hom(A,B), since this is an abelian group.|$|E
25|$|Let F(U) be {{the set of}} all {{sections}} on U. F(U) always contains at least one element, namely the zero section: the function s that maps every element x of U to the <b>zero</b> <b>element</b> of the vector space π−1({x}). With the pointwise addition and scalar multiplication of sections, F(U) becomes itself a real vector space. The collection of these vector spaces is a sheaf of vector spaces on X.|$|E
50|$|The {{algorithm}} {{described for}} group sparsity without overlaps {{can be applied}} to the case where groups do overlap, in certain situations.

30|$|As noted earlier, {{the regular}} and {{improved}} WSRD methods {{provide the same}} location of zeros in target matrix as in the initial one. Despite it, the eliminating procedure described above seems to be helpful for them also because the operation of excluding <b>zero</b> <b>elements</b> allows decreasing the dimension of solution space for the matrix-updating problem in significant degree. It is to be emphasized that macroeconomic matrices of high dimensions often appear to be very sparse in practice, up to more than 90 % of <b>zero</b> <b>elements.</b> In such cases, the efficiency of computations within the minimization problems (17), (19) and (18), (19) increases rather noticeably.|$|R

40|$|In chemometric {{applications}} of Tucker three-way principal component analysis, core arrays are often constrained {{to have a}} large majority of <b>zero</b> <b>elements.</b> This gives rise to questions of non-triviality (are the constraints active, or can any core of a given format be transformed to satisfy the constraints?) and uniqueness (can we transform the components in one or more directions without losing the given pattern of <b>zero</b> <b>elements</b> in the core?). Rather than deciding such questions on an ad hoc basis, general principles are to be preferred. This paper gives an overview of simplicity transformations on the one hand, and typical rank results on the other, which are suitable {{to determine whether or not}} certain constrained cores are trivial.
