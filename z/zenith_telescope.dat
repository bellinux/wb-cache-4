5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar <b>zenith</b> <b>telescope</b> can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and <b>Zenith</b> <b>telescope</b> {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E
500|$|The Transit Telescope was a [...] {{parabolic}} reflector <b>zenith</b> <b>telescope</b> built at Jodrell Bank in 1947. At the time, {{it was the}} largest radio telescope in the world. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of [...] scaffold poles, which focussed radio signals to a focal point [...] above the ground. The telescope mainly looked directly upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point. The focal mast was originally going to be wood, but this was changed to a steel mast before construction was complete. The telescope was replaced by the fully steerable [...] Lovell Telescope, and the Mark II telescope was subsequently built on the same location.|$|E
5000|$|For these <b>Zenith</b> <b>Telescopes,</b> Prof. Väisälä made {{also one}} of the first {{experiments}} at doing mirrors of liquid mercury. (Such mirror needs extremely smooth rotational speeds which were achieved in the late 1990s.) ...|$|R
50|$|Fixed {{telescope}} mounts {{are entirely}} fixed in one position, such as <b>Zenith</b> <b>telescopes</b> that point only {{straight up and}} the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Green Bank fixed radio 'horn' built to observe Cygnus X-1.|$|R
50|$|Prof. Väisälä also {{developed}} excellent tools to measure earth rotational axis position by building so called <b>zenith</b> <b>telescopes,</b> {{and in the}} 1960s Tuorla Observatory was in the top rank of North Pole position tracking measurements.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>zenith</b> <b>{{telescope}}</b> {{is a type}} of telescope that {{is designed}} to point straight up at or near the zenith. They are used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the mercury}} {{mirror of the}} Large <b>Zenith</b> <b>Telescope</b> in Canada is the largest liquid metal mirror in operation. It has a {{diameter}} of six meters, and rotates {{at a rate of}} about 8.5 revolutions per minute.|$|E
50|$|In astronomy, the {{altitude}} in the horizontal coordinate {{system and the}} zenith angle are complementary angles, with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith. The astronomical meridian is also determined by the zenith, and {{is defined as a}} circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith, nadir, and the celestial poles. A <b>zenith</b> <b>telescope</b> is a type of telescope designed to point straight up at or near the zenith, and used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory and the Large <b>Zenith</b> <b>Telescope</b> are both zenith telescopes since the use of liquid mirrors meant these telescopes could only point straight up.|$|E
50|$|Some telescopes {{designed}} to measure star transits are <b>zenith</b> <b>telescopes</b> {{designed to}} point straight up {{at or near the}} zenith for extreme precision measurement of star positions. They use an altazimuth mount, instead of a meridian circle, fitted with leveling screws. Extremely sensitive levels are attached to the telescope mount to make angle measurements and the telescope has an eyepiece fitted with a micrometer.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, the {{observatory}} was built with a classroom, transit room (with a clamshell roof), and an office. A large backlit display case containing numerous astronomical slides was featured (and remains today) {{in the lobby}} of the building. Many civil engineering instruments were housed in Fuertes, including <b>zenith</b> <b>telescopes,</b> theodolites, sextants, transit instruments, and a chronograph. The transit room has since been converted into a museum to display many of the historic instruments.|$|R
50|$|Another {{difficulty}} is that a liquid metal mirror can only be used in <b>zenith</b> <b>telescopes,</b> i.e., that look straight up, {{so it is not}} suitable for investigations where the telescope must remain pointing at the same location of inertial space (a possible exception to this rule may exist for a mercury mirror space telescope, where the effect of Earth's gravity is replaced by artificial gravity, perhaps by rotating the telescope on a very long tether, or propelling it gently forward with rockets). Only a telescope located at the North Pole or South Pole would offer a relatively static view of the sky, although the freezing point of mercury and the remoteness of the location would need to be considered. A very large telescope already exists at the South Pole, but the North Pole is located in the Arctic Ocean.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{types of}} zenith telescopes include the Monument to the Great Fire of London, which {{includes}} a central shaft meant {{for use as a}} <b>zenith</b> <b>telescope.</b> High-precision (and fixed building) zenith telescopes were also used until the early 1980s to track Earth's north pole position e.g. Earth's rotation axis position. Since then radio astronomical quasar measurements have also measured Earth's rotation axis several orders of magnitude more accurately than optical tracking. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory, which used a 3 m diameter aperture liquid mirror, and the Large <b>Zenith</b> <b>Telescope,</b> which uses a 6 m diameter aperture liquid mirror, are both zenith telescopes, as the use of liquid mirror meant these telescopes could only point straight up.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{portion of}} the {{observatory}} was constructed to house the Photographic Zenith Tube. The observers used the Photographic Zenith Tube to capture picture data using the <b>Zenith</b> <b>telescope</b> as a guide of alignment and star track. [...] However, nothing now remains of this addition to the Gaithersburg Latitude Observatory.|$|E
5000|$|The NASA-LMT was 3 m {{aperture}} {{liquid mirror}} telescope located in NODO's main dome. It {{consisted of a}} 3 m diameter parabolic dish that held 4 gal L of a highly reflective liquid metal, mercury, spinning {{at a rate of}} 10 rpm, with sensors mounted above on a fixed structure. Due to the primary mirror's material, the NASA-LMT was configured as a <b>zenith</b> <b>telescope.</b> Using 20 narrowband filters, it cataloged space debris in Earth's orbit. The telescope was initially completed in 1994 at NASA's Johnson Space Center, and moved to Cloudcroft the following year, where it operated routinely until June 2002. The LMT was also used for the UBC-NASA Multi-Narrowband survey, which examined galaxies at moderate redshifts. When it was retired, some of the components were used in the 6 m Large <b>Zenith</b> <b>Telescope</b> in British Columbia.|$|E
50|$|The {{observatory}} {{also contains}} several transit <b>telescopes,</b> <b>zenith</b> scopes, and other antique astronomical instruments used by Civil Engineers {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries for geodesy and timekeeping. These instruments are on display in a museum that occupies the east wing of the building.|$|R
5|$|The {{telescope}} moved for {{the first}} time on 3 February 1957: by an inch. It was first moved azimuthally under power on 12 June 1957; the bowl was tilted under power {{for the first}} time on 20 June 1957. By the end of July the dish surface was completed, and first light was on 2 August 1957; the telescope did a drift scan across the Milky Way at 160MHz, with the bowl at the <b>zenith.</b> The <b>telescope</b> was first controlled from the control room on 9 October 1957, by a purpose-built analogue computer.|$|R
40|$|Liquid mirror telescopes are of {{interest}} to Astronomy because of their very low capital and operating costs. Low cost has a potentially revolutionary impact since it allows one to dedicate a large telescope to a narrowly focused project that needs a large quantity of observations. The technology is now well proven in the laboratory {{as well as in}} observatory settings and is stepping into the mainstream of astronomical research. This paper has two main purposes. a) To acquaint the astronomical community with LMT zenith observing and to illustrate the LMT advantage with specific examples of research topics of current interest that could be carried out only with LMTs because of their low costs. I argue that LMTs are more versatile than generally thought and that the challenge is to use LMTs in such ways as to maximize their advantages and minimize their disadvantages. I briefly review specific issues regarding <b>zenith</b> <b>telescopes.</b> I then illustrate the LMT advantage with specific examples of astronomical research. b) I show that the large number of objects observed with a surveying LMT allows one to carry out cosmological projects at low redshifts. I show that a variability survey would obtain light curves for several thousands of type Ia supernovae per year up to z= 1 and easily discriminate among competing cosmological models. The same survey would find large numbers of MACHOs in clusters of galaxies and in background faint galaxies. Finally, I discuss a spectrophotometric survey carried out with interference filters, showing its power to discriminate among cosmological models and to study the large-scale distribution of galaxies in the Universe.

40|$|There are {{nowadays}} numerous astrometric ground{based {{observations of}} some stars referred to Hipparcos Catalogue, made at many observatories {{during the last}} century. We used the data on latitude variations, covering the period 1899. 7 - 1979. 0, of visual <b>Zenith</b> <b>Telescopes</b> (ZT) of International Latitude Service (ILS), to improve the Hipparcos proper motions in declination for stars observed at seven ILS stations: Carloforte, Cincinnati, Gaithersburg Kitab, Mizusawa, Tschardjui and Ukiah. About 15 years elapsed since the HIPPARCOS ESA mission (ESA 1997) observations (1991. 25 is the epoch of this catalogue), and with the errors of the Hipparcos proper motions close to 1 mas/yr, the error of apparent places of stars is now more than 15 mas; so that it exceeds the error of the Hipparcos positions by one order of magnitude (which is about 1 mas). Also, for some Hipparcos stars, the errors of proper motions are {{much larger than the}} averaged value itself, even not realistic at all (Vondrák et al. 1998); the Hipparcos astronomical satellite mission lasted less than four years, not enough to get a sufficient accuracy of the proper motions. To improve the accuracy of the proper motions for some Hipparcos stars, the ground-based data were used and some new catalogues were published (such as ARIHIP, EOC- 2, etc) during the last decade. Our investigations are in accordance with the Earth Orientation Catalogue - EOC (Vondrák and Ron 2003) one, based on the Earth rotation programmes ground{based data, but we used different method here. Our results yield better proper motions in declination for stars common to ILS and HIPPARCOS and a good agreement with those from EOC- 2...|$|R
40|$|By 1872 Britain, the United States, and the Dominion of Canada {{had many}} reasons to map officially the {{international}} boundary along the 49 th parallel, a line that Native Americans would come to associate with 2 ̆ 2 medicine 2 ̆ 2 for its power to halt the pursuit of law. Britain and the U. S. both desired to resolve lingering issues as Canada embraced independence. The northern survey party was officially the British North American Boundary Commission. While the U.

With the line they drew astronomically, these surveyors, according to Tony Rees, would help 2 ̆ 2 draw the long course of empire in North America to a close. 2 ̆ 2 Rees narrates {{the work of the}} dual independent boundary commissions season by season through the exploits of their surveyors.

40|$|During {{the last}} century, {{there were many}} {{so-called}} independent latitude (IL) stations with the observations which were included into data of a few international organizations (like Bureau International de l'Heure - BIH, International Polar Motion Service - IPMS) and the Earth rotation programmes for determining the Earth Orientation Parameters - EOP. Because of this, nowadays, there are numerous astrometric ground-based observations (made over many decades) of some stars included in the Hipparcos Catalogue (ESA 1997). We used these latitude data for the inverse investigations - to improve the proper motions in declination μβ of the mentioned Hipparcos stars. We determined the corrections Δμβ and investigated agreement of our μβ and those from the catalogues Hipparcos and new Hipparcos (van Leeuwen 2007). To do this we used the latitude variations of 7 stations (Belgrade, Blagoveschtschensk, Irkutsk, Poltava, Pulkovo, Warsaw and Mizusawa), covering different intervals in the period 1904. 7 - 1992. 0, obtained with 6 visual and 1 floating <b>zenith</b> <b>telescopes</b> (Mizusawa). On the other hand, with regard that about two decades have elapsed since the Hipparcos ESA mission observations (the epoch of Hipparcos catalogue is 1991. 25), the error of apparent places of Hipparcos stars has increased by nearly 20 mas because of proper motion errors. Also, the mission lasted less than four years which was not enough for a sufficient accuracy of proper motions of some stars (such as double or multiple ones). Our method of calculation, and the calculated μβ for the common IL/Hipparcos stars are presented here. We constructed an IL catalogue of 1200 stars: there are 707 stars {{in the first part}} (with at least 20 years of IL observations) and 493 stars in the second one (less than 20 years). In the case of μβ of IL stars observed at some stations (Blagoveschtschensk, Irkutsk, Mizusawa, Poltava and Pulkovo) we find the formal errors less than the corresponding Hipparcos ones and for some of them (stations Blagoveschtschensk and Irkutsk) even less than the new Hipparcos ones...|$|R
