40|$|This paper aims at {{studying}} the binding chemistry and leaching mechanisms of cement-based solidification of industrial Zn-bearing sludge. Two cement-based solidification systems were considered: one with cement alone {{and the other}} with cement and ny ash. Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), dynamic leaching test (DLT), and sequential chemical extraction (SCE) were employed in this study. TCLP and DLT results show that the sample with cement alone has lower leaching of zinc and calcium compared to the sample with cement and fly ash. SCE results show that zinc has the highest leaching in the oxide phase. Microstructures and crystalline phases of the solidified samples were examined by scanned electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. SEM images of solidified samples suggest that the presence of zinc might retard the hydration of cement and fly ash because identifiable hydration products of cement were no longer observed. For the solidified samples with the presence of <b>zinc</b> <b>sludge,</b> only calcium silicate (CS) was detected by XRD while calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) and calcium hydroxide crystal (CH) were not found. Moreover, zincite (ZnO) was found in those solidified samples by XRD. It is believed that zinc may have replaced calcium from calcium hydroxide to form zincite. The high leaching in the oxide phase from SCE, and the high leaching of calcium from TCLP also supported this finding. For the sludge sample solidified by OPC alone, the results from SEM and XRD indicate that zinc might react with calcium hydroxide and is likely to be trapped in the solidified cement matrix. This leads to low leaching of zinc from both TCLP and DLT. Although zincite was also observed in the sample with both OPC and PFA, the high leaching of zinc from this sample implies that OPC alone is more effective than a mixture of OPC and PFA in the solidification/stabilization process...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{the success}} of a solidification/stabilization (S/S) process is {{determined}} by physical and leach tests. These tests might not provide sufficient information for determining the actual performance of the S/S waste in a long run since they do not provide information on the physical and chemical changes between the waste and the additives. This research project utilizes a combined approach to investigate the leaching behaviors and binding chemistry of a solidified/stabilized industrial waste. The combined approach includes physical test, leach tests and microstructural analysis. Two cement-based solidification systems were considered: one with cement alone (OPC system) and the other with cement and fly ash (OPC/PFA system). The OPC system shows satisfactory results in unconfined compressive strength (UCS), toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP), and dynamic leach test (DLT). For the OPC/PFA system, the use of the coarse type PFA fails the UCS, and this system has higher zinc leaching than the OPC system. Sequential chemical extraction (SCE) shows that zinc has the highest leaching in the oxide phase. Microstructural analyses of the solidified samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) associated with an energy dispersive spectrometry (EDAX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). SEM images of solidified samples suggest that the presence of zinc might retard the hydration of OPC and PFA because identifiable hydration products are no longer observed. Moreover, zincite (ZnO) and calcium zincate [CaZn 2 (OH) 6 H 2 O] are found in the OPC system but only ZnO is found in the OPC/PFA system. It is believed that the addition of cement in the <b>zinc</b> <b>sludge</b> might alter zinc from its amorphous form to a crystalline form. The addition of PFA fails to help in the fixation of zinc since EDAX shows it has no interaction with the sludge. Also, a certain amount of zinc is believed to be on the surface. In summary, the OPC system is more effective than the OPC/PFA system in this S/S process. The use of microstructural analysis has been proved to be useful and essential in providing information on the physical and chemical changes within the cement matrix...|$|E

40|$|In Chile, the {{increasing}} number of plants for the treatment of wastewater has brought about an increase in the generation of sludge. One way of sludge disposal is its application on land; this, however involves some problems, some of them being heavy metal accumulation and the increase in organic matter and other components from sewage sludge which may change the distribution and mobility of heavy metals. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the effect of sewage sludge application on the distribution of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb in agricultural soils in Chile. Three different soils, two Mollisols and one Alfisol, were sampled from an agricultural area in Central Chile. The soils were treated with sewage sludge at the rates of 0 and 30 ton ha(- 1), and were incubated at 25 degreesC for 45 days. Before and after incubation, the soils were sequentially extracted to obtain labile (exchangeable and sodium acetate-soluble), potentially labile (soluble in moderately reducing conditions, K 4 P 2 O 7 -soluble and soluble in reducing conditions) and inert (soluble in strong acid oxidizing conditions) fractions. A two-level factored design was used to assess the effect of sludge application rate, incubation time and their interaction on the mobility of the elements under study. Among the metals determined in the <b>sludge,</b> <b>zinc</b> has the highest concentration. However, with the exception of Ni, the total content of metals was lower than the recommended limit values in sewage sludge as stated by Chilean regulations. Although 23 % of <b>zinc</b> in <b>sludge</b> was in more mobile forms, the residual fraction of all metals was the predominant form in soils and sludge. The content of zinc only was significantly increased in two of the soils by sewage sludge application. On the other hand, with the exception of copper, the metals were redistributed in the first four fractions of amended soils. The effect of sludge application rate, incubation time and their interaction depended on the metal or soil type.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrative approach, using toxicological and chemical analyses, to screen toxic and illegal substances {{that could be}} added to the septic sludge transported by a tanker truck to the wastewater treatment plant of the Montreal Urban Community (MUC). Microtox, lettuce root elongation, and a bacterial respiration test were used to establish the toxicity range of a normal sludge and the determination of threshold limit criteria. Septic sludge samples were spiked with different types and amounts of contaminants (copper, <b>zinc,</b> phenol, industrial <b>sludge).</b> Conservative criteria were applied to detect abnormal toxicity with great reliability while avoiding false positives (i. e., detecting abnormal toxicity in nonspiked sludge). Taken individually, toxicity tests using Microtox were revealed to be the least discriminating toxicological method (efficiency of 45 % when the ratio of the IC 50 values is considered), whereas lettuce root elongation was relatively the most efficient (80 % of spiked samples). As a whole, the battery of toxicity tests detected at least 93 % of the spiked sludge samples. This procedure is also very efficient, i. e., easy to apply, cost effective, and rapid.

40|$|Various {{types of}} waste {{materials}} containing zinc (e. g. dusts and sludges from gas dedusting process) are obtained in steel industry. The contents of Zn in these materials may vary considerably. Even a low concentration of zinc in recirculated products precludes their recycling in ferrous metallurgy aggregates. Long storage {{of this type}} of material can lead to contamination of soil and water by zinc compounds which can be leached out by acid rain, for example. This paper focuses on research involving alkaline leaching tests of low zinc content iron-bearing materials. These tests were preceded by the analysis of the elemental, phase and grain size composition, and analysis of the thermodynamic conditions of the leaching process. The main aim of research was to decrease the content of the <b>zinc</b> in the <b>sludge</b> to the level where it is suitable as an iron-bearing material for iron production (~ 1 % Zn). Leaching at elevated temperatures (368 K, 60 min) has led to a decrease in the zinc content in the sludge of about 66 %.

Recently, it is gaining more attention due to wide occurrence in water, soil, milk, dietary products, medicinal plants and herbal products. The major sources leading to accumulation of cadmium in soil and plants are phosphate fertilizers, non-ferrous smelters, lead and <b>zinc</b> mines, sewage <b>sludge</b> application and combustion of fossil fuels. All the samples analyzed in this study had Cd concentration within the acceptable range of 0.3 ppm recommended by WHO (2007) for raw herbal material. Maximum amount of Cd was found in W. somnifera (0.04 ppm in both stem and leaf samples) collected from Bahadurgarh region, whereas, it remained undetected in stem samples of A. nilotica (Jhunjhunu), C. wightii (Mahendergarh) and S. oleoides (Churu). Cd concentration was comparable in stem and leaf samples of other plants except T. bellirica and H. indicus wherein Cd concentration was 5 – 7 fold more in leaf samples. Nickel (Ni) and Cobalt (Co) are trace elements required {{for a variety of}} biological processes. Ni is directly coordinated by proteins, whereas, Co is mainly used as a component of vitamin B 12 (Zhang et al., 2009). Nickel was recognized as an allergen of the year in 2008 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society and its minimal risk level was set to 0.2 μg/m 3 for inhalation during 15 – 364 days, however, no limit has been set for food stuffs (Bhat et al., 2010).

Použitý kal byl získán goethitovým srážením z roztoku chloridů z odpadních odzinkovacích lázní. Tento kal, obsahující zbytky ZnO, byl loužen v HCl a následně byl separován ZnCl 2 danou metodou. Pro zjištění průběhu separačních metod, byly použity matematické modely, pomocí nichž bylo možné zjistit koncentraci Zn 2 + ve výstupním roztoku v jednotlivých cyklech. Pro {{experiment}} bylo použito 10 g kalu 24 ml 0, 75 M HCl a 50 ml/ 25 ml promývací vody u filtrace/dekantace. Po provedení experimentů bylo zjištěno, že účinnost dekantace je oproti modelu (77 %) nižší (66 %) a koncentrace Zn 2 + ve výstupním roztoku je 49, 9 g. dm- 3. Naopak účinnost filtrace byla téměř shodná s účinností vypočteného modelu, její hodnota je 99 % a koncentrace Zn 2 + ve výstupním roztoku byla 44, 7 g. dm- 3. Výstupní koncentrace Zn 2 + závisí na objemu promývací vody, proto je u dekantace vyšší než u filtrace. This thesis {{deals with}} comparing two different methods of counter-current leaching of <b>zinc</b> from iron <b>sludge</b> (decantation and filtration). This sludge has been precipitated by chloride-goethite method from the waste de-zinc baths. Sludge containing residues of ZnO has been leached in HCl and straight after ZnCl 2 has been separated by this method. In order to accurately follow separation method processes we used mathematical models, which {{allowed us to}} detect a concentration of Zn 2 + in the final (output) solution in each cycle. For this experiment 10 g of sludge, 24 ml of 0, 75 M HCl and 50 ml/ 25 ml of wash water were used during filtration/decantation. This experiment showed that the decantation efficiency was lower (66 %) than the math. model one (77 %) and that the Zn 2 + concentration in the final (output) solution was 49. 9 g. dm- 3.

40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) In {{this study}} the {{stability}} {{as well as}} the fate and behavior of ZnO engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in municipal wastewater systems were investigated. The first part of the study examined the influence of pH and ionic strength on the stability of ZnO ENPs in domestic wastewater to elucidate the dynamic changes on the ENPs physicochemical characteristics (e. g. aggregation or dissolution). The ZnO ENPs obtained commercially were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), BET surface area determination, and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Results derived from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) for zinc analysis indicated a decrease on the released zinc concentration from wastewater as the pH and ionic strength increased. Conversely, an increase on zinc concentration from the sludge was observed. The findings suggest the removal of ZnO ENPs from the influent wastewater as the sludge settled out, and the removal efficiency was directly proportional to ionic strength and pH. In addition, the ZnO ENPs suspension in the wastewater was used to monitor the particle size distribution using the dynamic light scattering analysis (DLS). The formation of agglomerates was observed which the TEM and EDS analysis confirmed to be ZnO aggregates. The distribution of <b>zinc</b> in the <b>sludge</b> was investigated using XRD analysis and the findings indicated partial sedimentation of ZnO ENPs as the sludge settled out. The second part of the study assessed the fate and behavior of ZnO ENPs in wastewater treatment systems. This study was carried out in a simulated activated sludge wastewater treatment plant (AS WWTP), constructed in accordance to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 303 A) guidelines. Results from the ICP-OES analysis for zinc indicated 50 – 200 μgL- 1 and about 3 000 mgkg- 1 were released into the effluent and sludge, respectively, after spiking the influent wastewater with 5 mgL- 1 ZnO ENPs. Moreover, we noted that increasing the ZnO ENPs concentration up to 20 mgL- 1 resulted in a linear increase in the zinc releases into effluent wastewater. However, the increase was insignificant in comparison to the zinc found in the control unit. Therefore, the findings indicated that ZnO ENPs had stronger affinity for the suspended bio-solids during wastewater treatment, and postulated that the ENPs removal from the influent wastewater was due to bio-sorption, and bio-solid settling mechanisms. These were confirmed by results from XRD and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analysis of the sludge as they showed the presence of ZnO in the sludge. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were concurrently monitored during the ENPs exposure studies to indirectly assess the ZnO ENPs impact to the bacterial degradation of the organic matter. An average of 43 and 91 % for DOC and COD removal efficiencies, respectively, were observed throughout the study. Overall, from results obtained indicated the suitability of the OECD 303 A method to assess the fate and behavior of ZnO ENPs in WWTPs. Secondly, in light of low concentrations of ZnO ENPs found in the treated effluent due to their removal with the waste activated sludge (WAS), suggest low likelihood of ZnO ENPs release and dispersion into the aquatic systems from WWTPs as point sources. Finally, the elevated concentrations of ZnO ENPs in the sludge therefore necessitates additional treatment steps to ensure mitigation of possible dispersion of ENPs from various disposal mechanisms such as landfilling, incineration, and agricultural applications...|$|R
