25|$|Windows Photo Gallery is a {{photo and}} video library {{management}} application. It can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual pictures including custom metadata {{based on the}} Extensible Metadata Platform. It also allows basic editing of images, such as adjusting color and exposure, resizing, cropping, red-eye reduction and printing. Slideshows, with pan, fade and other effects, can also be created, and burnt to DVD. It allows custom metadata {{to be added to}} images and videos, and enables searching by the attributes. It also supports raw image format natively and can open and organize any image format for which image codecs are installed in the Windows Imaging Component. Images and videos may be viewed in the Windows Photo Gallery Viewer with options to <b>zoom,</b> <b>pan</b> and losslessly rotate images, pause or play videos, and bring up the Info pane to view and edit metadata about a photo or video. ICC V4 color profiles embedded in images are also supported. The Photo Print Wizard has been improved to offer a lot of customizability. An upgraded version of this, Windows Live Photo Gallery allows you to upload and share photos and videos online as part of Windows Live services.|$|E

40|$|We present Jiku Live, a {{client-server}} {{system that}} supports <b>zoom</b> and <b>pan</b> operations in live video streaming from network cameras. The client is an Android mobile application that plays back live video from a selected camera and supports multi-touch <b>zoom</b> and <b>pan</b> interaction. The server acquires video streams from network cameras and transcodes the video feeds into one-second video segments at multiple resolutions. The transcoded video supports random access into any region-of-interest (RoI) within the video. Upon receiving <b>zoom</b> or <b>pan</b> requests, the server transmits the RoIs from the corresponding video segments to the client...|$|R
50|$|The Fuel {{ships with}} two {{alternative}} VPro graphics options, the V10 and V12. V10 has 32 MB combined memory, V12 has 128 MB combined memory. In both cases, memory {{that is not}} being used for display is available for use as texture memory. The V12 supports high quality 48-bit RGBA imaging and both options support hardware-accelerated 2D imaging using the OpenGL ARB extensions (real-time rotation, <b>zoom,</b> <b>pan,</b> feature adjustments). The mplayer application uses the 3D graphics hardware to accelerate movie playback, giving good support for DivX, MPEG4 and other formats.|$|E

50|$|A {{virtual studio}} is a {{television}} studio {{that allows the}} real-time combination of people or other real objects and computer generated environments and objects in a seamless manner. A key point of a virtual studio is that the real camera can move in 3D space, while {{the image of the}} virtual camera is being rendered in real-time from the same perspective, therefore, this virtual scene has to adapt at any time to the camera settings (<b>zoom,</b> <b>pan,</b> angle, traveling, etc.). This is what differentiates a virtual studio from the traditional technique of chromakey. It also differs from techniques used in film, in which scenes are edited later. A virtual studio does not need any post production because it is in real-time. However a 3-D graphic artist and 3D computer graphics software are needed to create the virtual background, and any graphics that appear in front.|$|E

Over a hundred widgets are distributed with the application and developers can easily create their own widget for any specific task.|$|R
30|$|Each time a {{participant}} <b>zoomed,</b> <b>panned,</b> rotated, or tilted the map, the system recorded {{the type of}} interaction in a log file. FigureÂ  7 shows all the interactions with the navigation system, aggregated across the four navigation system groups. Generally, some participants interacted a great deal with the map display, while others hardly ever interacted with the map. None of the participants used the tilt function.|$|R
50|$|Virtua Fighter {{dispensed}} with sprite-based graphics, {{replacing them with}} flat-shaded quads rendered in real-time, by the Model 1's 3D-rendering hardware, allowing for effects and technologies that were impossible in sprite-based fighters, such as characters that could move in three dimensions, and a dynamic camera that could <b>zoom,</b> <b>pan,</b> and swoop dramatically around the arena. It has been credited with both introducing and popularizing the use of polygon-based graphics in fighting games. 1UP listed {{it as one of}} the 50 most important games of all time. They credited Virtua Fighter for creating the 3D fighting game genre, and more generally, demonstrating the potential of 3D polygon human characters (as the first to implement them in a useful way), showing the potential of realistic gameplay (introducing a character physics system and realistic character animations), and introducing fighting game concepts such as the ring-out and the block button.|$|E

We introduce a spatial augmented reality map, {{in which a}} virtual map is projected on a physical piece of paper. In a preliminary study we compared interaction techniques based on multi-touch, tangible and spatial modalities for three common map functions: <b>zooming,</b> <b>panning,</b> and changing the basemap.

We developed a low-cost tangible tabletop interface that enables visually impaired users to dynamically construct maps. To do so, we designed a novel type of physical icons, called Tangible Reels. In this paper, we discuss how actuated Tangible Reels {{could be used}} to provide visually impaired users with an access to dynamic tangible maps and advanced functionalities (<b>zoom,</b> <b>pan</b> and exploration of geostatistical data). The three design ideas that we propose open new avenues for shape-changing interfaces for visually impaired user...|$|E
40|$|Camera motion {{detection}} {{is essential}} for automated video analysis. We propose a new probabilistic model for detecting zoom-in/zoom-out operations. The model uses EM to estimate {{the probability of a}} zoom versus a nonzoom operation from standard MPEG motion vectors. Traditional methods usually set an empirical threshold after deriving parameters proportional to <b>zoom,</b> <b>pan,</b> rotate and tilt. In contrast, our probabilistic model has a solid probabilistic foundation and a clear, simple probability threshold. Experiments show that this probabilistic model significantly out-performs a baseline parametric method for zoom detection in both precision and recall. 1...|$|E

40|$|Indexing {{and editing}} digital video {{directly}} in the compressed domain offer many advantages in terms of storage efficiency and processing speed. We have designed automatic tools in the compressed domain for extracting key visual features such as scene cut, dissolve, camera operations (<b>zoom,</b> <b>pan),</b> and moving object detection and tracking. In addition, we have developed algorithms to solve the decoder buffer control problems and allow users to âcut, copy and paste â arbitrary compressed video segments {{directly in the}} compressed domain. The compressed-domain approach does not require full decoding. Thus fast software implementations can be achieved. Our compressed video editing techniques will enhance the reusability of existing compressed videos...|$|E

However, participants could rotate, <b>zoom,</b> <b>pan,</b> and tilt the map according to their needs to provide a map use experience very similar to that on their personal devices. In contrast to the original Google Maps available on mobile devices, the test map would remain in north-up orientation and at the initial zoom level if participants chose not to interact manually with it.|$|E
