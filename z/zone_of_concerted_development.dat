40|$|Meiotic {{recombination}} is {{a critical}} step in gametogenesis for many organisms, enabling the creation of genetically diverse haploid gametes. In each meiotic cell, recombination is initiated by numerous DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) created by Spo 11, the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein, but how these DSBs are distributed relatively uniformly across the four chromatids that make up each chromosome pair is poorly understood. Here we employ Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate distance-dependent DSB interference in cis (in which the occurrence of a DSB suppresses adjacent DSB formation) -a process that is mediated by the conserved DNA damage response kinase, Tel 1 (ATM). The inhibitory function of Tel 1 acts on a relatively local scale, while over large distances DSBs {{have a tendency to}} form independently of one another even in the presence of Tel 1. Notably, over very short distances, loss of Tel 1 activity causes DSBs to cluster within discrete <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> DSB activity. Our observations support a hierarchical view of recombination initiation where Tel 1 (ATM) prevents clusters of DSBs, and further suppresses DSBs within the surrounding chromosomal region. Such collective negative regulation will help to ensure that recombination events are dispersed evenly and arranged optimally for genetic exchange and efficient chromosome segregation...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{formation}} is a pivotal process in plant reproduction and dispersal. It begins with megagametophyte {{development in the}} ovule, followed by fertilization and subsequently coordinated development of embryo, endosperm, and maternal seed coat. Two closely related MADS-box genes, SHATTERPROOF 1 and 2 (SHP 1 and SHP 2) are involved in specifying ovule integument identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The MADS box gene ARABIDOPSIS BSISTER (ABS or TT 16) is required, together with SEEDSTICK (STK) {{for the formation of}} endothelium, part of the seed coat and innermost tissue layer formed by the maternal plant. Little is known about the genetic interaction of SHP 1 and SHP 2 with ABS and the coordination of endosperm and seed coat development. In this work, mutant and expression analysis shed light on this aspect <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> <b>development.</b> Triple tt 16 shp 1 shp 2 mutants produce malformed seedlings, seed coat formation defects, fewer seeds, and mucilage reduction. While shp 1 shp 2 mutants fail to coordinate the timely development of ovules, tt 16 mutants show less peripheral endosperm after fertilization. Failure in coordinated division of the innermost integument layer in early ovule stages leads to inner seed coat defects in tt 16 and tt 16 shp 1 shp 2 triple mutant seeds. An antagonistic action of ABS and SHP 1 /SHP 2 is observed in inner seed coat layer formation. Expression analysis also indicates that ABS represses SHP 1, SHP 2, and FRUITFUL expression. Our work shows that the evolutionary conserved Bsister genes are required not only for endothelium but also for endosperm development and genetically interact with SHP 1 and SHP 2 in a partially antagonistic manner...|$|R

40|$|Antitrust law {{has long}} {{condemned}} tying arrangements {{when they are}} imposed by a single dominant firm. However, tying jurisprudence does not recognize that tie-ins can also occur {{as the result of}} a conspiracy among competitors. Consequently, antitrust doctrine fails to appreciate the unique anticompetitive dangers <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> tying arrangements. After providing real-world examples of tying conspiracies, Professor Leslie explains how concerted tying arrangements present a far greater threat to competitive markets than traditional, unilaterally imposed tying arrangements. Because tying jurisprudence evolved without considering the existence or effects <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> tie-ins, the current test for evaluating the legality of tying arrangements is inappropriately lenient to tying conspiracies. This is completely inconsistent with one fundamental principle of American antitrust law: concerted action should be treated more harshly than unilateral conduct. Finally, the Article advocates per se illegality for tying conspiracies and argues that greater appreciation <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> tie-ins can inform the ongoing academic debate about tying arrangements more generally...|$|R

Our results suggest that eroded footprints of gene duplication histories may mimic birth-death evolution and that in the avian MHC the presence of the two lineages may have been masked by elevated rates <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> evolution in several taxa. Through the presence of a range of intermediate evolutionary stages along the homogenizing process <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> evolution, the avian MHCIIB provides a remarkable illustration of the erosion of multigene family duplication history...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —The {{reliability}} of phylogenies reconstructed from data on multigene families is investigated via simulation. The evolutionary scenario used is a character-based {{model of a}} two-gene family in four species in which clocklike divergence is postulated but neither convergence nor reversal is allowed except {{as a result of}} recombination and gene conversion. Thus, any homoplasy emerging from parsimony reconstructions from the simulated data matrices can be attributed to concerted evolution. The probabilities of correctly reconstructing two standard trees are estimated by replicate runs of the simulation. One standard tree (the OP or "orthology/ paralogy " tree) reflects the true gene genealogy in the absence <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> evolution; the other (the CE or "concerted evolution " tree) depicts gene relationships under complete homogeni-zation of the gene family. The probability of correct reconstruction of the OP tree declines quickly as concerted evolution increases, but above an intermediate level <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> evolution the probability of correctly inferring the CE tree increases rapidly. Trees similar but not identical to the correct trees can be reconstructed above or below the critical intermediate level <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> evolution. Levels <b>of</b> homoplasy and numbers of equally parsimonious minimal trees are maxi-mized, and bootstrap confidence levels are minimized, near this intermediate level of concerte...|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{offer an}} {{approach}} to concerted action that builds on traditional Chicago School analyses of the issue, but adds {{a focus on the}} role of communication. Chicago scholars uniformly identify cartels as the primary target of antitrust enforcement. They have also established much of the framework within which courts and economists analyze concerted action. George Stigler’s seminal theory of oligopoly, which sought to identify the determinants of effective collusion, has spawned an enormous literature in game theory that models the pricing behavior of oligopolists. Richard Posner’s early analysis of tacit collusion - rivals’ coordination of noncompetitive pricing without express communication - extended Stigler’s analysis to the domain of law and policy. His approach to oligopoly pricing drew on economic theory and evidence both to define tacit collusion as concerted action and to identify structural and behavioral characteristics of markets that suggested its presence. I argue that Posner’s approach, refocused on the role of communication, provides the most promising way forward in the analysis <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> action. After recounting the history of the Chicago School’s analysis <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> action, I propose a modified definition <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> action and suggest how the change might affect the search for instances <b>of</b> <b>concerted</b> action. I argue that Section 1 does not reach tacit collusion, but neither does it require a verbal agreement; instead, actions are concerted if rivals coordinate them in part by communicating their intentions. I argue that this focus on communicative concerted action, despite its departure from Posner’s legal position, is consistent with the Chicago tradition, particularly error cost analysis. Its neo-Chicago character lies in its reliance on the most recent economic literature on the role of communication in collusion. In {{the last part of the}} article, I examine a small but important subset of that literature: studies of how real-world cartels use communication and facilitating practices to achieve their aims. Based on these studies, I suggest how plaintiffs and enforcement agencies might discover concerted action by examining changing patterns in the use of facilitating practices...|$|R
