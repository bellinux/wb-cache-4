25|$|Channel-switching (not to be {{confused}} with <b>zapping</b> or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing environment (or distribution channel) to purchase goods, such as switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues, or the internet. A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal/ statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.|$|E

In this study, we {{asked whether the}} tyrosine kinase <b>Zap</b> 70 is required to transmit survival signals in naive CD 8 T cells.

Using a tetracycline-inducible <b>Zap</b> 70 transgene (TetZap 70), thymic development of <b>Zap</b> 70 -deficient TCR transgenic F 5 mice was restored. Feeding mice doxycycline to induce <b>Zap</b> 70 expression resulted in repopulation of the peripheral naive compartment. <b>Zap</b> 70 transgene expression was then ablated by withdrawal of doxycycline. Survival of <b>Zap</b> 70 -deficient naive CD 8 T cells depended on host environment.

40|$|The <b>Zap</b> 1 {{transcriptional}} activator of Saccharomyces cerevisiae controls zinc homeostasis. <b>Zap</b> 1 induces {{target gene}} expression in zinc-limited cells and is repressed by high zinc.

First, {{we show that}} transcriptional autoregulation of <b>Zap</b> 1 is a minor component of zinc responsiveness; most regulation of <b>Zap</b> 1 activity occurs post-translationally. Secondly, nuclear localization of <b>Zap</b> 1 does not change in response to zinc, suggesting that zinc regulates DNA binding and/or activation domain function. To understand how <b>Zap</b> 1 responds to zinc, we performed a functional dissection of the protein. <b>Zap</b> 1 contains two activation domains.

40|$|Zinc finger {{antiviral}} protein (<b>ZAP)</b> is an interferon-inducible host antiviral {{factor that}} specifically inhibits the replication of cer-tain viruses, including HIV- 1 and Ebola virus. <b>ZAP</b> {{functions as a}} dimer formed through intermolecular interactions of its N-ter-minal tails. <b>ZAP</b> binds directly to specific viral mRNAs and inhibits their expression by repressing translation and/or promoting degradation of the target mRNA. <b>ZAP</b> is not a universal antiviral factor, since some viruses grow normally in ZAP-expressing cells. It is not fully understood what determines whether a virus is susceptible to <b>ZAP.</b> We explored the interaction between <b>ZAP</b> andmurine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV- 68), whose life cycle has latent and lytic phases. We previously reported that <b>ZAP</b> in-hibits the expression of M 2, which is expressed mainly in the latent phase, and regulates MHV- 68 latency in cultured cells. Here, we report that <b>ZAP</b> inhibits the expression of ORF 64, a tegument protein that is expressed in the lytic phase and is essential for lytic replication. MHV- 68 infection induced <b>ZAP</b> expression. However, <b>ZAP</b> did not inhibit lytic replication of MHV- 68. We pro-vide evidence showing that the antiviral activity of <b>ZAP</b> is antagonized byMHV- 68 RTA, a critical viral transactivator expressed in the lytic phase. We further show that RTA inhibits the antiviral activity of <b>ZAP</b> by disrupting the N-terminal intermolecular interaction of <b>ZAP.</b> Our results provide {{an example of how}} a virus can escape ZAP-mediated immunity.

Overexpressed <b>ZAP</b> did not inhibit virion production or SINV-induced cell death in BHK cells deficient in IFN production (and thus IFN signaling), suggesting a role for an IFN-induced factor in <b>ZAP's</b> activity.

In wild-type MEFs with an intact Stat 1 gene, IFN pretreatment synergized with <b>ZAP</b> to generate a potent antiviral response. Despite failing to inhibit SINV virion production and virus-induced cell death in BHK cells, <b>ZAP</b> inhibited translation of the incoming viral RNA.

At the transcriptional level, <b>Zap</b> 1 controls its own expression via positive autoregulation. In addition, <b>Zap</b> 1 ’s two activation domains are regulated independently of each other by zinc binding directly to those regions and repressing activation function.

40|$|Background: The zinc-finger {{antiviral}} protein (<b>ZAP)</b> is a host {{factor that}} specifically inhibits the replication of certain viruses, including Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} (MoMLV), HIV- 1, and certain alphaviruses and filoviruses. <b>ZAP</b> binds to specific viral mRNAs and recruits cellular mRNA degradation machinery to degrade the target RNA. The common features of ZAP-responsive RNA sequences remain elusive and thus whether a virus is susceptible to <b>ZAP</b> can only be determined experimentally. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is a recently identified c-retrovirus that was originally thought {{to be involved in}} prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome but recently proved to be a laboratory artefact. Nonetheless, XMRV as a new retrovirus has been extensively studied. Since XMRV and MoMLV share only 67. 9 % sequence identity in the 39 UTRs, which is the target sequence of <b>ZAP</b> in MoMLV, whether XMRV is susceptible to <b>ZAP</b> remains to be determined. Findings: We constructed an XMRV-luc vector, in which the coding sequences of Gag-Pol and part of Env were replaced with luciferase-coding sequence. Overexpression of <b>ZAP</b> potently inhibited the expression of XMRV-luc in a <b>ZAP</b> expression-level-dependent manner, while downregulation of endogenous <b>ZAP</b> rendered cells more sensitive to infection.

40|$|The {{zinc finger}} {{antiviral}} protein (<b>ZAP)</b> is an interferon-stimulated gene that restricts the replication of retroviruses, alphaviruses, and filoviruses. Relatively little is known, however, regarding the detailed mechanism of <b>ZAP</b> induction during viral infections. We show that, although being inducible by either interferon or virus, expression of <b>ZAP</b> is more efficiently activated by virus than are several other classical interferon-stimulated genes and that viral induction of <b>ZAP</b> occurs under the direct control of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF 3) independent of interferon paracrine/autocrine signaling. <b>ZAP</b> was up-regulated in cells unresponsive to type I and III interferons upon engagement of TLR 3, retinoic inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 pathways, or ectopic {{expression of a}} constitutively active IRF 3 mutant. Conversely, induction of <b>ZAP</b> by virus or dsRNA was severely impaired in cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant IRF 3 and completely abrogated in cells lacking IRF 3. In contrast to IRF 3, <b>ZAP</b> induction was independent of NF-κB activity. Mutational analysis of the human <b>ZAP</b> promoter revealed that multiple interferon-stimulated response elements far distal to the transcription start site serve redundantly to control IRF 3 -dependent induction of <b>ZAP</b> transcription.
