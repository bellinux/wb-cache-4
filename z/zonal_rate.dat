40|$|One of the {{significant}} strengths of the tracking of satellites with satellite laser ranging (SLR) is the long time base of data available. This has been exploited {{to provide us with}} monthly snapshots of the variations of the low-degree field from approximately 1980 to the present. The analysis of these data by Cox and Chao [2002] revealed an anomaly in the <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> for J 2. Cox and Chao [2002] clearly indicated that the contributions to this <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> from the cryosphere and surface hydrology, such as glacier melt and ground water storage, are just as important as post-glacial rebound. In this paper, we extend the time series of low degree variations through 2006, describing the satellite data incorporated into the solutions, the method of analysis, and the satellite performance. We compare the SLR/DORIS recovered low-degree variations with those derived from GRACE from 2003 to 2005, through degree four, and investigate the climatological and geophysical connections revealed by the new time series...|$|E

At least eight viral polypeptides are synthesized, including the precursors to virion polypeptides VI and VII. Separation of polyribosomes by <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> centrifugation followed by translation in a cell-free system reveals a correlation between the sizes of the polyribosomes and the polypeptides synthesized. The cell-free extracts incorporate amino acid linearly for only 10 min and show little or no capacity to reinitiate protein synthesis. The elongation efficiency measured as the number of amino acids incorporated per ribosome in 20 min is low, ranging from 10 to 100. The maximum chain elongation rate is estimated to be 10 to 20 amino acids per min. The limited elongation has been used to assess the relative concentration of mRNA's engaged in translation...|$|E

It was {{shown that the}} optimal proportion of hyaluronic acid for proteoglycan aggregate formation was about 1 % of proteoglycan dry weight. The reaggregation of dissociated proteoglycan aggregate A 1 fraction was markedly concentration-dependent and even at 9 mg/ml only about 90 % of the aggregates were reformed. The lowest proportion of link protein required for maximal formation of link-stabilized proteoglycan aggregates was 1. 5 % of proteoglycan dry weight. It was separately shown that link protein co-sedimented with the proteoglycan monomer. By competition with isolated hyaluronic acid-binding-region fragments, a proportion of the link proteins {{was removed from the}} proteoglycan monomers, indicating that the link protein binds to the hyaluronic acid-binding region of the proteoglycan monomer...|$|E

40|$|When {{purified}} hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) {{was treated}} with trypsin, two major surface antigens were released from the virus. The “hemagglutinin” subunits obtained by this method were reactive with homologous hemagglutination-inhibition antibody and could be detected by an antibody-blocking test. They adsorbed to but did not agglutinate red cells and thus appeared to be “monovalent. ” The neuraminidase subunits were obtained in fully active form and did not adsorb to red cells. This finding suggests that these two activities of HVJ are associated with different subunits of the virus particle. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subunits could be partially separated by <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> centrifugation or gel filtration on Sephadex G- 200. The molecular weights estimated for these subunits were approximately 124, 000 and 114, 000, respectively. After treatment with trypsin, virus-associated hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities were both reduced significantly. The electron micrographs of such trypsinized virus particles showed complete or partial loss of surface projections. These results suggested that the subunits obtained by this method seemed to be those projections liberated from the virus {{by the action of}} trypsin...|$|E
40|$|Proteoglycans were {{isolated}} from cartilage by extraction with 4 M-guanidinium chloride followed by direct centrifugation in 4 M-guanidinium chloride/CsCl {{at a low}} starting density, 1. 34 g/ml. N-Ethylmaleimide {{was included in the}} extraction solvent as a precaution against contamination of proteoglycans with unrelated proteins mediated by disulphide exchange. A novel, discrete, low-buoyant-density proteoglycan (1. 40 [...] 1. 35 g/ml) was demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Its proteoglycan nature was revealed by the shift in the molecular size observed on gel electrophoresis after treatment with chondroitinase ABC. The core protein was monodisperse. The proteoglycan was further purified by gel chromatography with and without addition of hyaluronate. The proteoglycan constitutes less than 2 % (by weight) of the total extracted proteoglycans and is not capable of interacting with hyaluronate. The same proteoglycan was purified in larger quantities by sequential associative and dissociative CsCl-density-gradient centrifugation, <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> sedimentation in a sucrose gradient and gel chromatography on Sepharose CL- 4 B. The pure proteoglycan had a molecular weight of 76 300 determined by sedimentation-equilibrium centrifugation and an apparent partial specific volume of 0. 59 ml/g.

The proteoglycan contained two to three large chondroitin sulphate chains and some oligosaccharides...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{models of}} both {{packed-bed}} and stacked-membrane chromatography typically attribute elution band broadening to non-idealities within the column. However, when the column length to diameter ratio is greatly reduced, as in stacked-membrane chromatography, variations in solute residence times within the feed-distribution (inlet) and eluent-collection (outlet) manifolds can {{also contribute to}} band broadening. We report on a new <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> model (ZRM) for stacked-membrane chromatography that improves on existing hold-up volume models that rely on one plug-flow reactor and one stirred-tank reactor in series to describe dispersion of solute during transport {{into and out of}} the column. The ZRM radially partitions the membrane stack and the hold-up volumes within the inlet and outlet manifolds into zones to better capture non-uniform flow distribution effects associated with the large column diameter to height ratio. Breakthrough curves from a scaled-down anion-exchange membrane chromatography module using ovalbumin as a model protein were collected at flow rates ranging from 1. 5 to 20 mL min(- 1) under non-binding conditions and used to evaluate the ZRM as well as previous models. The ZRM was shown to be significantly more accurate in describing protein dispersion and breakthrough. The model was then used to decompose breakthrough data, where it was found that variations in solute residence time distributions within the inlet and outlet manifolds make the dominant contribution to solute dispersion over the recommended range of feed flow rates. The ZRM therefore identifies manifold design as a critical contributor to separation quality within stacked-membrane chromatography units...|$|E

40|$|The {{upcoming}} GRACE mission {{promises to}} open a window on details of the global mass budget that will have remarkable clarity, {{but it will not}} directly answer the question of what the state of the Earth's mass budget is over the critical last quarter of the 20 th century. To address that problem we must draw upon existing technologies such as SLR, DORIS, and GPS, and climate modeling runs in order to improve our understanding. Analysis of long-period geopotential changes based on SLR and DORIS tracking has shown that addition of post 1996 satellite tracking data has {{a significant impact on the}} recovered <b>zonal</b> <b>rates</b> and long-period tides. Interannual effects such as those causing the post 1996 anomalies must be better characterized before refined estimates of the decadal period changes in the geopotential can be derived from the historical database of satellite tracking. A possible cause of this anomaly is variations in ocean mass distribution, perhaps associated with the recent large El Nino/La Nina. In this study, a low-degree spherical harmonic gravity time series derived from satellite tracking is compared with a TOPEX/POSEIDON-derived sea surface height time series. Corrections for atmospheric mass effects, continental hydrology, snowfall accumulation, and ocean steric model predictions will be considered...|$|R

Objective: We aimed to introduce and evaluate three new parameters to determine polyps and adenomas segmental localization and their distribution in association with different bowel preparation levels during colonoscopy. We introduce the multiple adenoma detection rate (the percentage of patients with > 2 adenomas diagnosed during colonoscopy), the <b>zonal</b> adenoma detection <b>rate</b> (the percentage of patients with > 2 adenomas diagnosed during colonoscopy in different colon areas (rectum, sigmoid, descending, transverse, ascending and cecum colon)), and multi-zone adenoma detection rate (the percentage of patients with > 2 adenomas diagnosed during colonoscopy in different colon areas with at least a segment between them with or without lesions (i. e. rectum and descending colon with or without lesions in the sigmoid)). Methods: We prospectively enrolled outpatients who underwent colonoscopy from January 2013 to October 2014.

The two types of aggregating proteoglycans were purified by density-gradient centrifugation in 3. 5 M-CsCl/ 4 M-guanidinium chloride and separated by <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> centrifugation in sucrose gradients. The higher-buoyant-density faster-sedimenting proteoglycan represented 43 % of the proteoglycans in the extract. It had a weight-average Mr of 3. 5 X 10 (6), did not contain a well-defined keratan sulphate-rich region, had a quantitatively dominant chondroitin sulphate-rich region and contained 5. 9 % protein and 23 % hexosamine. The lower-buoyant-density, more slowly sedimenting, proteoglycan represented 15 % of the proteoglycans in the extract. It had a weight-average Mr of 1. 3 X 10 (6), contained both the keratan sulphate-rich and the chondroitin sulphate-rich regions and contained 7. 3 % protein and 23 % hexosamine. Each of the proteoglycan preparations showed only one band on agarose/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The larger proteoglycan had a lower mobility than the smaller. The distribution of chondroitin sulphate chains along the chondroitin sulphate-rich region was similar for the two types of proteoglycans. The somewhat larger chondroitin sulphate chains of the larger proteoglycan could not alone account for the larger size of the proteoglycan. Peptide patterns after trypsin digestion of the proteoglycans showed great similarities, although the presence of a few peptides not shared by both populations indicates that the core proteins are partially different...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Zonal</b> <b>Rate</b> Model (ZRM) has {{previously}} been shown to accurately account for contributions to elution band broadening, including external flow nonidealities and radial concentration gradients, in ion-exchange membrane (IEXM) chromatography systems operated under nonbinding conditions. Here, we extend the ZRM to analyze and model the behavior of retained proteins by introducing terms for intra-column mass transfer resistances and intrinsic binding kinetics. Breakthrough curve (BTC) data from a scaled-down anion-exchange membrane chromatography module using ovalbumin as a model protein were collected at flow rates ranging from 1. 5 to 20 mL min(- 1). Through its careful accounting of transport nonidealities within and external to the membrane stack, the ZRM is shown to provide a useful framework for characterizing putative protein binding mechanisms and models, for predicting BTCs and complex elution behavior, including the common observation that the dynamic binding capacity can increase with linear velocity in IEXM systems, and for simulating and scaling separations using IEXM chromatography. Global fitting of model parameters is {{used to evaluate the}} performance of the Langmuir, bi-Langmuir, steric mass action (SMA), and spreading-type protein binding models in either correlating or fundamentally describing BTC data. When combined with the ZRM, the bi-Langmuir, and SMA models match the chromatography data, but require physically unrealistic regressed model parameters to do so. In contrast, for this system a spreading-type model is shown to accurately predict column performance while also providing a realistic fundamental explanation for observed trends, including an observed increase in dynamic binding capacity with flow rate...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{chromatography}} (MC) {{systems are}} finding increasing use in downstream processing trains for therapeutic proteins {{due to the}} unique mass-transfer characteristics they provide. As a result, there is increased need for model-based methods to scale-up MC units using data collected on a scaled-down unit. Here, a strategy is presented for MC unit scale-up using the <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> model (ZRM). The ZRM partitions an MC unit into virtual flow zones to account for deviations from ideal plug-flow behavior. To permit scale-up, it is first configured for the specific device geometry and flow profiles within the scaled-down unit so as to achieve decoupling of flow and binding related non-idealities. The ZRM is then configured for the preparative-scale unit, which typically utilizes markedly different flow manifolds and membrane architecture. Breakthrough is first analyzed in both units under non-binding conditions using an inexpensive tracer to independently determine unit geometry related parameters of the ZRM. Binding related parameters are then determined from breakthrough data on the scaled-down MC capsule to minimize sample requirements. Model-based scale-up may then be performed to predict band broadening and breakthrough curves on the preparative-scale unit. Here, the approach is shown to be valid when the Pall XT 140 and XT 5 capsules serve as the preparative and scaled-down units, respectively. In this case, scale-up is facilitated by our finding that the distribution of linear velocities through the membrane in the XT 140 capsule is independent of the feed flow rate {{and the type of}} protein transmitted. Introduction of this finding into the ZRM permits quantitative predictions of breakthrough over a range of industrially relevant operating condition...|$|E

40|$|The {{localization}} of the gene(s) mediating methicillin (mecr) in Staphylococcus aureus {{was determined}} by transformation with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a natural mecr strain (DU 4916) and transformation obtained with DNA from this strain. Streptomycin resistance genes (strr) and novobiocin resistance genes (novr) were used concurrently as representatives for chromosomal genes; penicillinase (PI 254) and tetracycline plasmids were used as examples of medium- and small-size extrachromosomal genes, respectively. Superinfection of the lysogenic recipients with the competence-inducing phage phi 11 or 83 A enhanced transformation for all markers. Phenotypic expression of cadmium (cadr), tetracycline (tetr), or methicillin resistance (mecr) {{did not appear to}} require a host recombination system since a recA 1 mutant could serve as the recipient provided it was superinfected with a competence-inducing phage. There was, furthermore, no requirement for preexisting plasmids for phenotypic expression. Ultraviolet irradiation of transforming DNA enhanced at low doses the transformation frequency for chromosomal genes strr and novr but not for mecr, cadr, or tetr. The gene(s) for mecr was transformed with chromosomal DNA after sodium dodecyl sulfate-sodium chloride extraction and after neutral sucrose gradient centrifugation of bulk DNA from wild-type strain DU 4916 and the transformats. No cavalently closed circular DNA or open circular DNA carrying the methicillin resistance gene(s) could be detected in the wild type or the transformants either by ethidium bromide-cesium chloride gradient centrifugation or by <b>zonal</b> <b>rate</b> centrifugation of cells directly lysed on top of the gradients. The mecr gene(s) is thus probably of chromosomal nature but possibly under recombinational control of phage genes, since transfer of mecr is independent of the recA 1 gene(s) but can be accomplished in this strain after superinfection with a competence-inducing phage. Ultraviolet light inactivation of transforming DNA shows first-order kinetics for mecr transformability similar to that observed for both transfecting and plasmid DNA...|$|E

40|$|The {{value added}} by {{intelligent}} wells (I-wells) derives from real-time, reservoir and production performance monitoring together with zonal, downhole flow control. Unfortunately, downhole sensors that can directly measure the <b>zonal</b> flow <b>rates</b> and phase cuts required for optimal {{control of the}} well’s producing zones are not normally installed. Instead, the <b>zonal,</b> Multi-phase Flow <b>Rates</b> (MPFRs) are calculated from indirect measurements (e. g. from zonal pressures, temperatures and the total well flow rate), an approach known as soft-sensing. To-date all published techniques for <b>zonal</b> flow <b>rate</b> allocation in multi-zone I-wells are “passive” in that they calculate the required parameters to estimate MPFRs for a fixed given configuration of the completion. These techniques are subject to model error, but also to errors stemming from measurement noise when there is insufficient data duplication for accurate parameter estimation. This thesis describes an “active” soft-sensing technique consisting of two sequential optimisation steps. First step calculates MPFRs while the second one uses a direct search method based on Deformed Configurations to optimise the sequence of Interval Control Valve positions during a routine multi-rate test in an I-well. This novel approach maximises {{the accuracy of the}} calculated reservoir properties and MPFRs. Four “active monitoring” levels are discussed. Each one uses a particular combination of available indirect measurements from well performance monitoring systems. Level one is the simplest, requiring a minimal amount of well data. The higher levels require more data; but provide, in return, a greater understanding of produced fluids volumes and the reservoir’s properties at both a well and a zonal level. Such estimation of the reservoir parameters and MPFRs in I-wells is essential for effective well control strategies to optimise the production volumes. An integrated, control and monitoring (ICM) workflow is proposed which employs the active soft-sensing algorithm modified to maximise I-well oil production via real-time zonal production control based on estimates of zonal reservoir properties and their updates. Analysis of convergence rate of ICM workflow to optimise different objective functions shows that very accurate zonal properties are not required to optimise the oil production. The proposed reservoir monitoring and MPFR allocation workflow may also be used for designing in-well monitoring systems i. e. to predict which combination of sensors along with their measurement quality is required for effective well and reservoir monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Cells which {{synthesize}} {{the fourth}} component of complement have been isolated from guinea-pig liver through <b>rate</b> <b>zonal</b> {{density gradient centrifugation}} of suspensions of liver cells on continuous density gradients (2 to 15 per cent) of Ficoll. This procedure separates non-parenchymal cells from parenchymal cells {{on the basis of}} size. Cells which synthesized C 4 were identified as low density, non-parenchymal cells which comprised only a small proportion of the cells added to the gradient. Phagocytic cells were restricted to the same portion of the gradient as cells which synthesized C 4, and there is evidence that cells which synthesize C 4 are also phagocytic...|$|R
40|$|Golgi dictyosomal {{membranes}} {{isolated from}} pea (Pisum sativum) stem tissue, {{using a combination}} of <b>rate</b> <b>zonal</b> and isopycnic sucrose density centrifugation, were shown to bear cytidine diphosphate-choline:diglyceride phosphorylcholinetransferase, CDP-ethanolamine:diglyceride phosphorylethanolaminetransferase, and CTP:phosphorylcholine cytidyltransferase activities. Although the majority of the activity of the phospholipid-synthesizing enzymes was associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, the activity found in the Golgi system was about 25 % of the total activity. These results suggest that Golgi dictyosomes probably synthesize {{at least part of the}} membrane phospholipids that they may need for their secretory function and for dictyosomal proliferation during cell growth, rather than importing this material entirely from the endoplasmic reticulum...|$|R

Bacteriol. 92 : 102 – 106. 1966. —Cesium chloride {{density gradient centrifugation}} of rabies virus revealed a heterogeneous population of infectious virus particles, the majority of which showed a density of 1. 20 g/ml. From results obtained by <b>rate</b> <b>zonal</b> centrifugation in preformed sucrose gradients, {{it was possible to}} calculate a sedimentation coefficient of about 600 S for rabies virus. Sedimentation coefficients of about 23 S and 10 S were calculated for two soluble rabies antigens present in infected tissue-culture fluids, and they showed a density of 1. 26 g/ml in cesium chloride solutions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{interest}} in the putative protective role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its subtractions against ath-erosclerosis has highlighted {{the need for a}} rapid, simple subfractionation procedure. Here we compare HDL sub-fractionation by two recently developed polyanionic-pre-cipitation methods with the values obtained by <b>rate</b> <b>zonal</b> ultracentrifugation. A similar result for total HOL cholesterol was obtained by all three methods. However, HDL 2 cho-lesterol as measured by the precipitation procedures was significantly higher than the zonal value, and HDL 3 was lower. This reflects the different underlying principles in-volved in the separations and highlights the need for a clearer understanding of the functional roles of the HDL fractions. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) 2 consist of a continuu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{found that}} urea {{extraction}} of turkey erythrocyte nuclear envelopes abolished {{their ability to}} bind exogenous ~ 25 I-vimentin, while, at the same time, it removed the nuclear lamins from the membranes. After purification of the lamins from such urea extracts, a specific binding between isolated vimentin and lamin B, or a lamin A+B hetero-oligomer, was detected by affinity chromatography. Similar analysis revealed that the 6. 6 -kD vimentin tail piece {{was involved in this}} interaction. By other approaches (quantitative immunoprecipitation, <b>rate</b> <b>zonal</b> sedimentation, turbidometric assays) a substoichiometric lamin B-vi-mentin binding was determined under in vitro conditions. It was also observed that anti-lamin B antibodies but not other sera (anti-lamin A, anti-ankyrin...|$|R
