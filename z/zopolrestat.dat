50|$|The {{treatment}} for galactosemic cataract {{is no different}} from general galactosemia treatment. In fact, galactosemic cataract {{is one of the few}} symptoms that is actually reversible. Infants should be immediately removed from a galactose diet when symptoms present, and the cataract should disappear and visibility should return to normal. Aldose reductase inhibitors, such as sorbinil, have also proven promising in preventing and reversing galactosemic cataracts. AR inhibitors hinder aldose reductase from synthesizing galactitol in the lens, and thus restricts the osmotic swelling of the lens fibers. Other AR inhibitors include the acetic acid compounds <b>zopolrestat,</b> tolrestat, alrestatin, and epalrestat. Many of these compounds have not been successful in clinical trials due to adverse pharmokinetic properties, inadequate efficacy and efficiency, and toxic side effects. Testing on such drug-treatments continues in order to determine potential long-term complications, and for a more detailed mechanism of how AR inhibitors prevent and reverse the galactosemic cataract.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Peritoneal {{dialysis}} with glucose- and lactate-containing {{dialysis solutions}} stimulates peritoneal angiogenesis and fibrosis. These {{serious side effects}} can also be induced by chronic peritoneal exposure to dialysis solutions in nonuremic rats. The high glucose concentrations of the dialysis solutions may saturate physiological glucose metabolism pathways and stimulate the polyol pathway that has been described to damage nerves and vessels in diabetes mellitus. To investigate {{the role of the}} polyol pathway in the development of fibrosis and angiogenesis during chronic peritoneal exposure, the rate-limiting aldose reductase activity in the polyol pathway was inhibited in a chronic peritoneal exposure model in the rat, in which different administration routes were compared. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES: Three groups of rats received daily intraperitoneal infusion with lactate/glucose (3. 86 %) [...] containing dialysate via a peritoneal catheter with a subcutaneous puncture device, for 14 weeks: group 1 received only the dialysis solution, groups 2 and 3 received, in addition, <b>zopolrestat,</b> administered either orally (group 2) or intraperitoneally (group 3). After sacrifice, omental tissue was examined by histology for the presence of fibrosis (Picro Sirius Red) and the number of blood vessels (CD 31). RESULTS: Histology revealed significantly less Picro Sirius Red-positive tissue in perivascular areas of both experimental groups and submesothelial areas of the oral group in comparison to the control group. There were significantly fewer CD 31 -positive vessels perfield in both groups treated with <b>zopolrestat</b> compared to the infusion-only group: group 2, 9 (7 - 12); group 3, 17 (13 - 38), compared to group 1, 37 (32 - 39), p < 0. 05. CONCLUSION: The combination of peritoneal exposure to dialysis fluids and administration of <b>zopolrestat,</b> a newly developed inhibitor of aldose reductase activity, resulted in less fibrosis and fewer peritoneal vessels than exposure to dialysis fluids only, in a long-term exposure model in the rat. Inhibition of the polyol pathway may thus offer an important contribution to allow long-term continuation of peritoneal dialysi...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Both {{activation}} of the polyol pathway and enhanced non-enzymatic glycation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic glomerulopathy. We investigated the interaction between these two pathways using normal mesangial cells (MCs) and transgenic (TG) MCs with elevated aldose reductase (AR) activity. Methods: TG mice with expression of the human AR (hAR) gene in kidney MCs were established. Mouse glomeruli and primary cultures of MCs from hAR TG and wild-type (WT) mice were studied regarding the changes in AR activity, transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) and type IV collagen mRNA and protein levels, in response to BSA modified by advanced glycation endproducts (AGE-BSA). Results: Ex vivo addition of AGE-BSA increased AR activity, TGF-β 1 and type IV collagen mRNA levels in both WT and TG glomeruli, with greater rise in TG glomeruli. These increments were attenuated by <b>zopolrestat,</b> an AR inhibitor. In cultured MCs, AGE-BSA enhanced AR activity, TGF-β 1 and type IV collagen mRNA and protein levels both in WT and TG MCs, again with greater increases in TG MCs. The AGE-induced enhancement in TGF-β 1 and type IV collagen expression were suppressed by either <b>zopolrestat</b> or transfection with an AR antisense oligonucleotide.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Aldose reductase (AR) is an NADPH-dependent enzyme {{implicated in}} {{long-term}} diabetic complications. Buried {{at the bottom}} of a deep hydrophobic cleft, the NADPH coenzyme is surrounded by the conserved hydrophilic residues of the AR active site. The existence of an anionic binding site near the NADP+ has been determined from the structures of the complexes of AR with citrate, cacodylate and glucose- 6 -phosphate. The inhibitor <b>zopolrestat</b> binds to this anionic site, and in the hydrophobic cleft, after a change of conformation which opens a ‘specificity’ pocket. Results: The crystal structures of the porcine AR holoenzyme and its complexes with the inhibitors tolrestat and sorbinil have been solved; these structures are important as tolrestat and sorbinil are, pharmaceutically, the most well-studied AR inhibitors. The active site of the holoenzyme was analyzed, and binding of the inhibitors was found to involve two contact zones in the active site: first, a recognition region for hydrogen-bond acceptors near the coenzyme, with three centers, including the anionic site; and second, a hydrophobic contact zone in the active-site cleft, which in the case of tolrestat includes the specificity pocket. The conformational change leading to the opening of the specificity pocket upon tolrestat binding is different to the one seen upon <b>zopolrestat</b> binding; this pocket binds inhibitors that are more effective against AR than against aldehyde reductase. Conclusions: The active site of AR adapts itself to bind tightly to different inhibitors; this happens both upon binding to the inhibitor's hydrophilic heads, and at the hydrophobic and specificity pockets of AR, which can change their shape through different conformational changes of the same residues. This flexibility could explain the large variety of possible substrates of AR...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} for {{the interaction between}} the polyol pathway and enhanced non-enzymatic glycation, both implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic atherosclerosis, in the activation of aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) function. Mouse aortas and primary cultures of SMCs from wildtype (WT) mice and transgenic (TG) mice expressing human aldose reductase (AR) were studied regarding changes in AR activity, and SMC gene activation, migration and monocyte adhesion, in response to advanced glycation end-product modified BSA (AGE-BSA). Results showed that AGE-BSA increased AR activity in both WT and TG aortas, with greater increments (p < 0. 05) in TG aortas which, basally, had elevated AR activity (2. 8 fold of WT). These increments were attenuated by <b>zopolrestat,</b> an AR inhibitor. Similar AGE-induced increments in AR activity were observed in primary cultures of aortic SMCs from WT and TG mice (60 % and 100 %, respectively, P < 0. 01). Such increments were accompanied by increases in intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) mRNA levels (both P < 0. 05), activation of membrane-associated PKC-β 1 (P < 0. 05) as well as increased SMC migration and Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) - 1 monocyte adhesion to SMCs (both p < 0. 01), with all changes being significantly greater in TG SMCs (P < 0. 05) and suppressible by either <b>zopolrestat</b> or transfection with an AR antisense oligonucleotide. Our findings suggest that the effects of AGEs on SMC activation, migration and monocyte adhesion are mediated partly through the polyol pathway and, possibly, PKC activation. The greater AGE-induced changes in the TG SMCs have provided further support for the dependency of such changes on polyol pathway hyperactivity. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Compound 3, (10 -benzyl[1, 2, 4]triazino[4, 3 -a]benzimidazol- 3, 4 (10 H) -dion- 2 -yl) acetic acid, displayed the highest inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 0. 36 μM) {{and was found}} to be effective in preventing cataract development in severely galactosemic rats when administered as an eyedrop solution. All the compounds investigated were selective for ALR 2, since none of them inhibited appreciably aldehyde reductase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, or glutathione reductase. The activity of 3 was lowered by inserting various substituents on the pendant phenyl ring, by shifting the acetic acid moiety from the 2 to the 3 position of the TBI nucleus, or by cleaving the TBI system to yield benzimidazolylidenehydrazines as open-chain analogues. A three-dimensional model of human ALR 2 was built, taking into account the conformational changes induced by the binding of inhibitors such as <b>zopolrestat,</b> to simulate the docking of 3 into the enzyme active site.

40|$|Cells {{adapt to}} hyperosmotic {{conditions}} by several mechanisms, including accumulation of sorbitol via induction of the polyol pathway. Failure {{to adapt to}} osmotic stress can result in apoptotic cell death. In the present study, we assessed the role of aldose reductase, the key enzyme of the polyol pathway, in cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Hyperosmotic stress, elicited by exposure of cultured rat cardiac myocytes to the nonpermeant solutes sorbitol and mannitol, caused identical cell shrinkage and adaptive hexose uptake stimulation. In contrast, only sorbitol induced the polyol pathway and triggered stress pathways as well as apoptosis-related signaling events. Sorbitol resulted in activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p 54 c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and protein kinase B. Furthermore, sorbitol treatment resulting in induction and activation of aldose reductase, decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, increased DNA fragmentation, and glutathione depletion. Apoptosis was attenuated by aldose reductase inhibition with <b>zopolrestat</b> and also by glutathione replenishment with N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, our data show that hypertonic shrinkage of cardiac myocytes alone {{is not sufficient to}} induce cardiac myocyte apoptosis. Hyperosmolarity-induced cell death is sensitive {{to the nature of the}} osmolyte and requires induction of aldose reductase as well as a decrease in intracellular glutathione levels...|$|E
40|$|Aldose reductase is inactivated by {{physiological}} disulfides such as GSSG and cystine. To {{study the}} mechanism of disulfide-induced enzyme inactivation, we examined the rate and extent of enzyme inactivation using wild-type human aldose reductase and mutants containing cysteine-to-serine substitutions at positions 80 (C 80 S), 298 (C 298 S), and 303 (C 303 S). The mild-type, C 80 S, and C 303 S enzymes lost > 80 % activity following incubation with GSSG, whereas the C 298 S mutant was not affected. Loss of activity correlated with enzyme thiolation. The binary enzyme-NADP(+) complex was less susceptible to enzyme thiolation than the apoenzyme. These results suggest that thiolation of human aldose reductase occurs predominantly at Cys- 298. Energy minimization of a hypothetical enzyme complex modified by glutathione at Cys- 298 revealed that the glycyl carboxylate of glutathione may participate in a charged interaction with His- 110 in a manner strikingly similar to that involving the carboxylate group of the potent aldose reductase inhibitor <b>Zopolrestat.</b> In contrast to what was observed with GSSG and cystine, cystamine inactivated the wild-type enzyme {{as well as all}} three cysteine mutants.

Inflammatory infiltrates in the arterial wall induce luminal occlusion with subsequent ischemia and {{degradation of the}} elastic membranes, allowing aneurysm formation. To identify pathways relevant to the disease process, differential display–PCR was used. The enzyme aldose reductase (AR), which is implicated in the regulation of tissue osmolarity, {{was found to be}} upregulated in the arteritic lesions. Upregulated AR expression was limited to areas of tissue destruction in inflamed arteries, where it was detected in T cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells. The production of AR was highly correlated with the presence of 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE), a toxic aldehyde and downstream product of lipid peroxidation. In vitro exposure of mononuclear cells to HNE was sufficient to induce AR production. The in vivo relationship of AR and HNE was explored by treating human GCA temporal artery–severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse chimeras with the AR inhibitors Sorbinil and <b>Zopolrestat.</b> Inhibition of AR increased HNE adducts twofold and the number of apoptotic cells in the arterial wall threefold.

40|$|International audienceInhibition {{of human}} aldose reductase (ALR 2) evolved as a {{promising}} therapeutic concept to prevent late complications of diabetes.

We investigated the selectivity-determining features by gradually mapping the residues deviating between the binding pockets of ALR 1 and ALR 2 into the ALR 2 binding pocket. The resulting mutational constructs of ALR 2 (eight point mutations and one double mutant) were probed for their influence towards ligand selectivity by X-ray structure analysis of the corresponding complexes and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

Interestingly, binding site mutations not involved in any direct interaction to the ligands in various cases show significant effects towards their binding thermodynamics.

40|$|Aldose reductase (AR) is {{implicated in}} the {{development}} of a number of diabetic complications, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. We performed this study to determine whether and how AR might influence hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) activity and lipid metabolism. Our results in mouse hepatocyte AML 12 cells show that AR overexpression caused strong suppression of PPAR alpha/delta activity (74 %, p < 0. 001) together with significant down-regulation of mRNA expression for acetyl-CoA oxidase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase- 1. These suppressive effects were attenuated by the selective AR inhibitor <b>zopolrestat.</b> Furthermore, AR overexpression greatly increased the levels of phosphorylated PPAR alpha and ERK 1 / 2. Moreover, AR-induced suppression of PPAR alpha activity was attenuated by treatment with an inhibitor for ERK 1 / 2 but not that for phosphoinositide 3 -kinase, p 38, or JNK. Importantly, similar effects were observed for cells exposed to 25 mM glucose. In streptozotocin-diabetic mice, AR inhibitor treatment or genetic deficiency of AR resulted in significant dephosphorylation of both PPAR alpha and ERK 1 / 2. With the dephosphorylation of PPAR alpha, hepatic acetyl-CoA oxidase and apolipoprotein C-III mRNA expression was greatly affected and that was associated with substantial reductions in blood triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acid levels.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{studies have shown that the}} polyol pathway, {{consisting}} of aldose reductase (AR) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), contributes to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) -induced myocardial infarction due to depletion of ATP. In this report we show that the polyol pathway in I/R heart also contributes to the impairment of sacro/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) and ryanodine receptor (RyR), two key players in Ca 2 + signaling that regulate cardiac contraction. Rat hearts were isolated and retrogradely perfused with either Krebs' buffer containing 1 ?M AR inhibitor, <b>zopolrestat,</b> or 200 nM SDH inhibitor, CP- 170, 711, and challenged by 30 min of regional ischemia and 45 min of reperfusion. We found that post-ischemic contractile function of the isolated perfused hearts was improved by pharmacological inhibition of the polyol pathway. I/R-induced contractile dysfunction is most likely due to impairment in Ca 2 + signaling and the activities of SERCA and RyR. All these abnormalities were significantly ameliorated by treatment with ARI or SDI. We showed that the polyol pathway activities increase the level of peroxynitrite, which enhances the tyrosine nitration of SERCA and irreversibly modifies it to form SERCAC 674 -SO 3 H. This leads to reduced level of S-glutathiolated SERCA, contributing to its inactivation. The polyol pathway activities also deplete the level of GSH, leading to decreased active RyR, the S-glutathiolated RyR. Thus, in I/R heart, inhibition of polyol pathway improved the function of SERCA and RyR by protecting them from irreversible oxidation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Hyperglycemia {{increases}} {{glucose metabolism}} via the polyol pathway, {{which results in}} elevations of intracellular sorbitol concentration. Thus we hypothesized that elevated level of sorbitol contributes {{to the development of}} hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction of microvessels. In isolated, pressurized (80 mmHg) rat gracilis muscle arterioles (approximately 150 microm), high glucose treatment (25 mM) induced reduction in flow-dependent dilation (from maximum of 39 +/- 2 % to 15 +/- 1 %), which was significantly mitigated by an aldose reductase inhibitor, <b>zopolrestat</b> (maximum 27 +/- 2 %). Increasing doses of sorbitol (10 (- 10) - 10 (- 4) M) elicited dose-dependent constrictions (maximum 22 +/- 3 %), which were abolished by endothelium removal, a prostaglandin H(2) /thromboxane A(2) (PGH(2) /TXA(2)) receptor (TP) antagonist SQ- 29548, or superoxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase (CAT). Incubation of arterioles with sorbitol (10 (- 7) M) reduced flow-dependent dilations (from maximum of 39 +/- 2 % to 20 +/- 1. 5 %), which was not further affected by inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by N(omega) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester but was prevented by SOD plus CAT and mitigated by SQ- 29548. Nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside-induced (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 6) M) dilations were also decreased in a SQ- 29548 and SOD plus CAT-reversible manner, whereas adenosine dilations were not affected by sorbitol exposure. Sorbitol significantly increased arterial superoxide production detected by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, which was inhibited by SOD plus CAT. Sorbitol treatment also increased arterial formation of 3 -nitrotyrosine. We suggest that hyperglycemia by elevating intracellular sorbitol induces oxidative stress, which interferes with nitric oxide bioavailability and promotes PGH(2) /TXA(2) release, both of which affect regulation of vasomotor responses of arterioles.

40|$|Rational drug {{design for}} {{flexible}} proteins like human aldose reductase comprises special challenges to find novel lead compounds or to improve known inhibitors. In this thesis, diverse {{aspects of the}} complexity of such a task were investigated to find promising new lead scaffolds and enhance the affinity of known aldose reductase inhibitors. Within different design cycles, the prediction of ligand binding modes in a binding pocket capable to adapt to a bound ligand is such a challenging task. A benzothiazole scaffold originating from a virtual screening run was kinetically and structurally evaluated. An unexpected binding mode in complex with wild-type aldose reductase and a new protein conformer provided the basis for a further drug design cycle to optimize the scaffold. The benzothiazole core was expanded to explicitly address an additional subpocket of the protein to enhance both affinity and selectivity over a closely related protein. Flexibility is a common feature of many proteins. For human aldose reductase, a variety of conformers are adopted with different inhibitors. In Chapter 3, the known inhibitors <b>zopolrestat</b> and IDD 393 each in complex with a threonine 113 mutant and a benzothiazole inhibitor in complex with the wild type of aldose reductase were investigated with respect to the impact of inhibitor binding on protein conformation. Though the interaction to the mutated residue does not directly alter the binding mode of <b>zopolrestat,</b> a shift of its basic scaffold is induced and subsequently affects the interaction to a flexible loop and introduces disorder. With IDD 393, two distinct binding site conformations resulting in different crystal forms can be directly compared. Improvements of the computational methods for affinity prediction from the structure of protein-ligand complexes requires {{a better understanding of the}} nature of molecular interactions and biomolecular recognition principles. In Chapter 4, the binding of two chemically closely related human aldose reductase inhibitors have been studied by high resolution X-ray analysis (0. 92 A- 1. 35 A) and isothermal titration calorimetry against a series of single-site mutants of the wild-type protein. A crucial active site threonine, thought to be involved in a short bromine-to-oxygen halogen bond to the inhibitors in the wild type has been mutated to the structurally similar residues alanine, cysteine, serine, and valine. Overall, structurally the binding mode of the inhibitors is conserved; however, small but significant geometrical adaptations are observed as a consequence of the spatial and electronic changes at the mutation site. They involve the opening of a central bond angle and shifts in consequence of the lost or gained halogen bonds. Remarkably, the tiny structural changes are responded by partly strong modulation of the thermodynamic profiles. Even though the free energy of binding is maximally perturbed by only 7 kJ/mol, much stronger modulations and shifts in the enthalpy and entropy signature are revealed which indicate a pronounced enthalpy/entropy compensation. However, facing these perturbances against the small structural changes, an explanatory correlation can be detected. This also provides deeper insights how single-site mutations can alter the selectivity profile of closely related ligands against a target protein. High resolution structural data of protein inhibitor complexes is the key to rational drug design. Synchrotron radiation allows for atomic resolution but is frequently accompanied by radiation damage to protein complexes. In Chapter 5, a human aldose reductase mutant complexed with a bromine substituted inhibitor was determined to atomic resolution. Though the radiation dose was moderate, a selective disruption of a bromine-inhibitor bond during the experiment was observed while the protein appears unaffected. A covalent bond to bromine is cleaved and the displaced atom is not scattered throughout the crystal but can most likely be assigned as a bromide ion to an additional difference electron density peak observed in the structure: The bromide relocates to an adjacent unoccupied site where promising interactions to protein residues stabilize its position. These findings were verified by a second similar structure determined with considerably higher radiation dose...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetic {{nephropathy}} is {{a leading}} cause of end-stage renal disease. The aldose reductase (AR) gene, which codes for the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the polyol pathway, has been implicated in the etiology of diabetic nephropathy, based on genetic association studies and findings from animals treated with AR inhibitors. However, the exact role of AR in the development of diabetic nephropathy and its interaction with other pathogenetic pathways, such as non-enzymatic glycation, remain controversial. In this study, we investigated the effects of increased AR gene expression on pathogenetic changes that could lead to diabetic nephropathy, in a transgenic murine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transgenic mouse lines expressing the human AR (hAR) gene in kidney mesangial cells were established, using a construct that contained the type A scavenger receptor promoter. The interaction between AR and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) was examined in primary cultures of mesangial cells derived from hAR transgenic and wild type mice, with regard to changes in AR activity, transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) and type IV collagen gene expression, in response to incubation with AGE modified BSA (AGEBSA). RESULTS: hAR mRNA expression could be detected by Northern blot analysis in the kidney glomeruli of transgenic mice. hAR mRNA and protein expression were also found in primary cultures of transgenic mesangial cells, as assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Enhanced AR activity was seen in both transgenic and wild type mesangial cells when treated with AGE-BSA. This increase was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in the transgenic mesangial cells. The rise in AR activity in the presence of AGE-BSA was accompanied by increases in TGF-β 1 and type IV collagen transcripts in mesangial cells, which reached statistical significance only in transgenic mesangial cells (p< 0. 01) and was abolished by the addition of an AR inhibitor <b>zopolrestat</b> (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the AR gene was involved in the increased expression of TGF-β 1 and type IV collagen observed in the transgenic mesangial cells in vitro. Increased AR gene expression might contribute to the mesangial cell proliferation and matrix protein production in diabetic nephropathy, in part through an interaction with AGEs.

40|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to diabetes mellitus {{is associated with}} metabolic abnormalities such as chronic hyperglycemia and redox imbalance. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia and genetic factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular diseases. Genetic mutation through the genes coding for enzymes involved in glucose metabolism and immuno-regulatory mechanisms {{may contribute to the}} susceptibility to type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM) and its chronic microvascular diseases. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa 8 (NFκB) and heat shock proteins (HSPs) are two redox-sensitive cellular responses of most immune and inflammatory diseases including diabetes and its late vascular complications. NFκB promotes the transcription of a wide array of proinflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules. HSPs are proposed to have a cytoprotective effect; in contrast they have the capacity to promote pathogenic processes. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based microsatellite analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis were used to genotype the genes coding for NFκB, HSP 70 -A 2, sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD) and protein kinase C- β(PKC-β). The A 10 allele of the NFκB gene and H 3 and H 7 alleles of the HSP 70 -A 2 gene were identified as risk markers of TIDM (P< 0. 01). These alleles were not associated with microvascular complications. No evidence of associations was obtained between either PKC-β or SORD genes with TIDM and its late complications. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia may alter the transcription mechanism of many genes, which control vascular homeostasis. The electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to assess the transcription factor, heat shock factor- 1 (HSF- 1) and NFκB-DNA binding activity in response to a concentration of 31 mM D- glucose in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with TIDM with and without microvascular complications. Hyperglycaemia induced significant increases in both NFκB and HSF- 1 -DNA binding activities in PBMCs from patients (p= 0. 003 and 0. 017 respectively). The protein activity was more pronounced in PBMCs from patients with microvascular complications. Hyperglycaemia-induced NFκB-DNA binding activity was correlated to that of HSF- 1 (p< 0. 0 I). Patients with TIDM with microvascular complications demonstrated a significant increase in NFκB-DNA binding activity compared to patients with a short duration of diabetes (SD) or diabetic controls (DC) (p= 0. 003 and p = 0. 047 respectively). A significant positive correlation was found between the duration of diabetes and hyperglycaemia-induced NFκB-DNA binding activity (p= 0. 035). These results suggest that hyperactive flux through the polyol pathway is relevant to hyperglycaemia-induced protein activity since the aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) <b>zopolrestat</b> and sorbinil reduced HSF- 1 and NFκB-DNA binding activity in PBMCs. In conclusion, these results suggest that NFκB and HSP 70 -A 2 genes may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to TIDM. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia in diabetes may alter the transcription mechanism and magnify the proinflammatory responses, which accelerate the development of diabetic microvascular complications.
