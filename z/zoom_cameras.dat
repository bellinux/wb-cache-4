The design draws heavily on that of the Mastcam camera used on the Mars Curiosity Rover with some upgrades. It uses the same size, detectors, electronics interface, firmware, and operations protocols. It has improvement in lens assembly which gives it 3.6:1 zoom capability, whereas the zoom feature {{was removed from the}} final design in Curiosity (originally planned to have 15:1 zoom). Each of the <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras</b> have broadband red/green/blue (RGB) imaging and narrow-band visible/near-infrared (VNIR) color imaging. The sensor consists of a ON Semiconductor KAI-2020CM CCD with an array size of 1600 x 1200 pixels. It will be able to image with fields of view (FOV) from ~ 5° to ~ 15°.|$|E

TZ1's successors use a {{traditional}} design without folded optics, hence the barrel extends further out during operation. The TZ series stands out against other compact digital cameras by achieving a 30x optical zoom with a 24 mm wide angle lens (equivalent to 35 mm camera) in a small, compact body.|$|E
5000|$|Closed-circuit {{television}} (CCTV) generally uses pan tilt <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras</b> (PTZ), for security, surveillance, and/or monitoring purposes. Such {{cameras are}} designed to be small, easily hidden, and able to operate unattended; those used in industrial or scientific settings are often meant for use in environments that are normally inaccessible or uncomfortable for humans, and are therefore hardened for such hostile environments (e.g. radiation, high heat, or toxic chemical exposure).|$|E
50|$|The optical <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras</b> {{can be set}} {{first before}} its maximum and then {{followed}} by its digital zoom in video mode only, but most cameras use digital zoom after the optical zoom reaches the maximum for photo and video. Digital zoom use the center area of the optical image to enlarge the image. By reducing the MP image size, using digital zoom can be done without image deterioration and some cameras has Undeteriorated image mode or at least has Image deterioration indicator.|$|E

5000|$|One {{key feature}} that is {{described}} in the name is the optical zoom technique used in this camera. Most compact <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras</b> use the zoom functionality for telephoto work where one details in on a remote subject. This camera allows one {{to set up the}} lens to work as a wide-angle lens which comes in handy for group or landscape photography. It has a high resolution lens with 5x zoom (7.1 - 35.6 mm) - equals (28 - 140 mm) in 35 mm film format - and an aperture of 2.4 for wide angle and 3.5 for telephoto. Focus range: normal 0.8 - inf.; macro 20 - 80 cm super-macro up to 5 cm.|$|E
5000|$|Autonomous {{cameras are}} cameras that can direct {{themselves}} in their environment. There has been some recent work using this approach. In work from Denzler et al., the motion of a tracked object is modeled using a Kalman filter while the focal length that minimizes the uncertainty in the state estimations {{is the one that}} is used. A stereo set-up with two <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras</b> was used. A handful of papers have been written for zoom control and do not deal with total object-camera position estimation. An attempt to join estimation and control in the same framework {{can be found in the}} work of Bagdanov et al., where a Pan-Tilt-Zoom camera is used to track faces. [...] Both the estimation and control models used are ad hoc, and the estimation approach is based on image features rather than 3D properties of the target being tracked.|$|E

5000|$|The Olympus SP-510UZ (Ultra Zoom) is a 7.1-megapixel bridge {{digital camera}} {{introduced}} by Olympus Corporation in 2006. It replaced the 6 megapixel SP-500UZ model that {{was launched in}} 2005. It was the last model of the SP-series (Special Performance) that used a 10x optical zoom lens. It was also {{the last of the}} larger-sized 10x optical ultra <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras</b> to be made by Olympus, which {{had been part of the}} C-series before the SP-series was produced. The SP-510UZ model can be traced back to the C-2100 Ultra Zoom, which was launched back in 2000. [...] The successor model to the SP-510UZ was the SP-550UZ. It used a longer 18x optical zoom lens. Today, the newest model in the Ultra Zoom camera line, the SP-590UZ, features a 26x optical zoom lens. In 2009, Olympus released a compact camera with a 10x optical zoom lens. However, it does not use the Ultra Zoom name nor is it a part of the SP-series line of cameras.|$|E
50|$|For over 20 years, {{telepresence}} robots, {{also sometimes}} referred to as remote-presence devices have been a vision of the tech industry. Until recently, engineers did not have the processors, the miniature microphones, cameras and sensors, or the cheap, fast broadband necessary to support them. But in the last five years, a number of companies have been introducing functional devices. As the value of skilled labor rises, these companies are beginning to see a way to eliminate the barrier of geography between offices. Traditional videoconferencing systems and telepresence rooms generally offer Pan / Tilt / <b>Zoom</b> <b>cameras</b> with far end control. The ability for the remote user to turn the device’s head and look around naturally during a meeting is often seen as the strongest feature of a telepresence robot. For this reason, the developers have emerged in the new category of desktop telepresence robots that concentrate on this strongest feature to create a much lower cost robot. The desktop telepresence robots, also called head and neck Robots allow users to look around during a meeting and are small enough to be carried from location to location, eliminating the need for remote navigation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method for {{actively}} calibrating a multi-camera system consisting of pan-tilt <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras.</b> After a coarse initial cali-bration, we determine the probability of each relative pose using a prob-ability distribution based on the camera images. The relative poses are optimized by rotating and zooming each camera pair {{in a way that}} sig-nificantly simplifies the problem of extracting correct point correspon-dences. In a final step we use active camera control, the optimized rela-tive poses, and their probabilities to calibrate the complete multi-camera system with a minimal number of relative poses. During this process we estimate the translation scales in a camera triangle using only two of the three relative poses and no point correspondences. Quantitative experi-ments on real data outline the robustness and accuracy of our approach. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes new algorithms {{to recover}} the calibration parameters and 3 D structure of a scene, using 2 D images taken by uncalibrated stationary <b>zooming</b> <b>cameras.</b> This is a common configuration, usually encountered in surveillance camera networks, stereo camera systems, and event monitoring vision systems. This problem is known as camera auto-calibration (also called self-calibration) and the motivation behind this work is to obtain the Euclidean three-dimensional reconstruction and metric measurements of the scene, using only the captured images. Under this configuration, the problem of auto-calibrating <b>zooming</b> <b>cameras</b> differs from the classical auto-calibration problem of a moving camera in two major aspects. First, the camera intrinsic parameters are changing due to <b>zooming.</b> Second, because <b>cameras</b> are stationary in our case, using classical motion constraints, such as a pure translation for example, is not possible. In order to simplify the non-linear complexity of this problem, i. e., auto-calibration of <b>zooming</b> <b>cameras,</b> we have followed a geometric stratification approach. In particular, we {{have taken advantage of}} the movement of the camera center, that results from the zooming process, to locate the plane at infinity and, consequently to obtain an affine reconstruction. Then, using the assumption that typical cameras have rectangular or square pixels, the calculation of the camera intrinsic parameters have become possible, leading to the recovery of the Euclidean 3 D structure. Being linear, the proposed algorithms were easily extended to the case of an arbitrary number of images and cameras. Furthermore, we have devised a sufficient constraint for detecting scene parallel planes, a useful information for solving other computer vision problems...|$|R
