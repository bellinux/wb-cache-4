40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to present a simple and quick method for obtaining approximate solutions to large scale zero-one programming problems. The method does not use enumeration. Instead, it assigns measures of preferability to <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables</b> that change {{the values of the}} variables from zero to one. The method yields very good approximate solutions to zero-one programming problems in dramatically short computation time. Even for problems involving more than a thousand <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables</b> the computation time is of little concern. The method is applicable not only to those problems associated with obtaining the optimal package of variables with the value one but also to a great variety of binary choice ("Yes-No") problems. ...|$|R

In practice, optimal solutions can only be guaranteed for very small problems. Here an estimate is made of the size of problem which could be tackled by an 'ordinary user', particularly when using a formulation with reduced numbers of <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables.</b> Strategies for extending the scope of ILP are outlined. Changing the mode of data presentation to road networks can be useful but may introduce other difficulties. Overall, it is clear that considerable progress is still needed before ILP can be used for tackling real problems. ...|$|R

A systematic approach is proposed {{to obtain an}} approximately globally optimal solution via piecewise-linear approximation. By means of the new approach a minimum point of the original problem confined {{in a region where}} more than one linear piece is needed for satisfactory approximation can be found by solving only one linear programming problem. Hence, the number of linear programming problems to be solved for finding the approximately globally optimal solution may be much less than that of the regions partitioned. In addition, <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables</b> are not introduced in this approach. These features are desirable for efficient computation.

This {{is the problem of}} maximising a quadratic objective by suitable choice of binary (<b>zero-one)</b> <b>variables.</b> We present two heuristic algorithms based upon tabu search and simulated annealing for this problem. Computational results are presented for a number of publically available data sets involving up to 2500 variables. An interesting feature of our results is that whilst for most problems tabu search dominates simulated annealing for the very largest problems {{we consider the}} converse is true. This paper typifies a "multiple solution technique, single paper" approach, i. e. an approach that within the same paper presents results for a number of different heuristics applied to the same problem.

40|$|In this paper, a {{flexible}} yet efficient algorithm for solving engineering design optimization problems is presented. The algorithm is developed based on both binary-coded and realcoded genetic algorithms (GAs). Since both GAs are used, the variables involving discrete, continuous, and <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables</b> are handled quite efficiently. The algorithm restricts its search {{only to the}} permissible values of the variables, thereby reducing the search effort in converging to the optimum solution. The efficiency and ease of application of the proposed method is demonstrated by solving three different mechanical component design problems borrowed from the optimization literature. The proposed technique is compared with binarycoded genetic algorithms, Augmented Lagrange multiplier method, Branch and Bound method and Hooke and Jeeves pattern search method. In all cases, the solutions obtained using the proposed technique are superior than those obtained with other methods. These results are encour [...] ...|$|R

In order to produce the Logit flows from this problem, Damberg et al. algorithm is modified. Then, the level of certainty is maximized and perceived travel delays are minimized. For a fixed certainty degree, the obtained solution, which is named the fuzzy equilibrium flow, satisfies a quasi-Logit formula similar to ordinary expression of the Logit route choice model. Eventually, we examine the quality of different path enumeration techniques in the proposed model. Traffic Transportation Fuzzy level of demand Logit Path enumeration...|$|R

40|$|A zero-one linear {{program is}} a global {{discrete}} optimization problem. Namely, it is a linear programming problem with <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables.</b> The real relaxation of a zero-one {{program is a}}gain a continuous linear programming problem. Simply, the <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables</b> are replaced by continuous variables varying between zero and one independently of each other. If the real relaxation, as a continuous problem, solved with the simplex method happens to have a zero-one optimal solution, then this particular solution is also an optimal solution of the original zero-one programming problem. Suppose that x 1,…,x n are all the variables of a given zero-one linear programming problem. For convenience we introduce further variables y 1,…,y n defined by y 1 = 1 −x 1,…, y n = 1 −x n respectively. For a unified notation the variables x 1,…,x n and y 1,…, y n together will be denoted by z 1,…,z 2 n. These variables will play the roles the nodes of the conflict graph Г associated with the given zero-one linear programming problem. Fixing the variables z i and z j both to be equal to one simultaneously reduces the number of variables in the problem. If the new smaller optimization problem {{does not have any}} feasible solution, then the nodes z i and z j will be connected by an edge in the graph Γ. The graph Γ simply records that there is a conflict between the assignments z i = 1 and z j = 1 which explains the name conflict graph. In other words the non-directed edge between the nodes z i and z j codes the fact that the inequality z i +z j ≤ 1 holds. The conflict graph was designed to generate additional constraints the so-called valid inequalities or cuts in order to expedite the solution of the zero-one linear program via its real relaxation. This particular solution strategy is aptly named the branch and cut method. It will be shown that the conflict graph besides its intended use can also be applied in another solution technique the method of implicit enumeration. We will illustrate by examples that the conflict graph provides us with rules to prune the search tree that are not offered by the commonly applied pruning rules. In addition the computations involved can easily be organized into a highly parallel computational scheme...|$|R

Their one great contribution in that area has been to help analysts develop integer linear programming models for solution by general-purpose branch-and-bound procedures. Although this approach has been applied successfully in many cases, formulations as integer programs often lack the intuitive connection to the modeler’s original concept of the problem that was the motivation for modeling languages to begin with.

40|$|Today {{there is}} a {{substantial}} controversy about the role of capital controls. Prior to the Asian Crises in 1997, the predominant view among economists was that controls on capital flows were generally bad. After the crises, there has been more disagreement about the role of capital controls. Many blamed capital mobility rather than national policies for the crises. During the 1997 crises, India and China were largely left untouched and some argued this was because they had substantial controls. Scholars such as Leblang (2001), and Glick and Hutchison (2000) have done statistical studies where they found that countries with capital controls are more prone to currency attacks. Other studies that have use capital controls are Quinn (1997) and Rodrik (1998) who look at the relationship between capital controls and its effect on economic growth and find quite different conclusions. All of these studies other than Quinn (1997) have used capital controls measures that are simple <b>zero-one</b> <b>variables.</b> These are very blunt instruments for trying to capture the effects of controls.
