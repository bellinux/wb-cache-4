5|$|The old bronze penny was {{slated for}} {{elimination}} as decimal currency was planned in the 1960s. It {{continued to be}} struck after 1967, still bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent <b>zinc</b> <b>alloy</b> was used again for the 1960s pennies. Finally, there was an issue of proof quality coins dated 1970 for collectors, to bid farewell to a denomination which had served the country well for 1200 years. The longstanding depiction of Britannia on the penny was translated by sculptor Christopher Ironside to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin.|$|E

40|$|More than 13 {{million tons}} of zinc were {{produced}} in 2013 worldwide. According to the IZA (International Zinc Association) 60 % of this is used for galvanizing to protect steel from corrosion thus prolonging the service life of steel products significantly. About 15 % of world zinc consumption goes into the production of <b>zinc</b> base <b>alloys,</b> mainly to supply the die casting industry, 14 % goes into the production of brass and bronze and 8 % into the production of compounds including zinc oxide and zinc sulfate. The remainder is used for <b>zinc</b> <b>alloys,</b> mainly rolled, utilized in semi-manufactured applications including coinage and architectural applications. <b>Zinc</b> die casting <b>alloys</b> have been used since the early 1920 ies and {{are part of the}} stable world zinc consumption.

During the last decades two alloys became known as the general purpose alloys, named Zamak® 3 and Zamak® 5 (ZL 0400 & ZL 0410 according to ISO EN 301 /EN 1774). This led to a misunderstanding in the market that there are no new alloy developments. On the contrary the needs of specific markets, as for instance car industry, are driving the research to the development of new <b>zinc</b> <b>alloys,</b> competitive with Cu or Al alloys as well as with polymers.

40|$|High {{pressure}} die casting is a well known and cost effective technology for producing cheap and accurate parts in <b>zinc</b> <b>alloys.</b> The advantage of this fine accuracy is, however, often lost due to the bad creep performance of the hexagonal structure of the <b>zinc</b> <b>alloys.</b> <b>Zinc</b> components obtained by high {{pressure die}}-casting also suffer from the variation of their mechanical performances with time because of natural ageing effect that induces a redistribution of metastable phases. Concerning creep behaviour of Zamak 5 alloy, {{it was observed that}} the total strain during primary creep is influenced by ageing times; particularly it decreases continuously down to an asymptotic value for the longest ageing times. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess whether, during creep tests, concurrent artificial ageing may occur that interferes with the creep behaviour of the alloy. For this reason, different artificial ageing times and temperatures were investigated in order to reach steady state microstructure and mechanical properties and subsequently to compare them with the standard parameters used during <b>zinc</b> <b>alloys</b> creep test. The artificial ageing temperatures able to influence creep behaviour were found to be higher than those normally prescribed for mechanical purposes...|$|R

2500|$|The T. Rex album Bolan's Zip Gun (1975) was self-produced by Bolan who, in {{addition}} to writing the songs, gave his music a harder, more futuristic sheen.

Always a fantasist with an alleged Napoleon complex, during this time Bolan became increasingly isolated, while high tax rates in the UK drove him into exile in Monte Carlo and the US.

2500|$|Tanx was {{released}} on 28 January 1973 by record label EMI in the UK and Reprise in the US.

Curiously, the popular single [...] "20th Century Boy" [...] recorded during a stay in Japan and not in France, was not included on the album, which may have affected sales, as the album (unlike its two predecessors) {{did not include a}} hit single. The album is also widely known to be the last of T. Rex's string of successes since Electric Warrior; their next album <b>Zinc</b> <b>Alloy</b> and the Hidden Riders of Tomorrow would prove to be a financial failure and put Bolan's musical career in jeopardy until 1976. It's also T. Rex's last album released under Reprise Records in the US, as Light of Love, released under Casablanca Records (like Reprise, distributed through Warner Bros.
