5|$|For the In Rainbows {{download}} release, Radiohead {{employed the}} network provider PacketExchange to bypass public internet servers, using a less-trafficked private network. The download was packaged as a <b>ZIP</b> <b>file</b> containing the album's ten tracks encoded in 160 kbit/s DRM-free MP3 format. The staggered online release began at about 5:30am GMT on 10 October 2007. On 10 December, the download was removed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ZIP</b> <b>file</b> {{format is}} a data {{compression}} and file archiver. A <b>ZIP</b> <b>file</b> contains {{one or more}} files that have been compressed to reduce file size, or stored as-is. The <b>zip</b> <b>file</b> format was originally invented in 1989 by Phil Katz for PKZIP, and evolved from the previous ARC compression format by Thom Henderson.|$|E
25|$|Office Open XML {{is based}} on XML and uses the <b>ZIP</b> <b>file</b> container. According to Microsoft, {{documents}} created in this format are up to 75% smaller than the same documents saved with previous Microsoft Office file formats, owing to the ZIP data compression.|$|E
50|$|OpenDocument {{packages}} are ordinary <b>zip</b> <b>files.</b> There is an OpenDocument format {{which is just}} a single XML file, but most applications use the package format. Thus, any of the vast number of tools for handling <b>zip</b> <b>files</b> and XML data can be used to handle OpenDocument. Nearly all programming languages have libraries (built-in or available) for processing XML <b>files</b> and <b>zip</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R

25|$|Shannon's theorem also {{implies that}} no {{lossless}} compression scheme can shorten all messages. If some messages come out shorter, {{at least one}} must come out longer due to the pigeonhole principle. In practical use, this is generally not a problem, because we are usually only interested in compressing certain types of messages, for example English documents as opposed to gibberish text, or digital photographs rather than noise, and it is unimportant if a compression algorithm makes some unlikely or uninteresting sequences larger. However, the problem can still arise even in everyday use when applying a compression algorithm to already compressed data: for example, making a <b>ZIP</b> <b>file</b> of music, pictures or videos that are already in a compressed format such as FLAC, MP3, WebM, AAC, PNG or JPEG will generally result in a <b>ZIP</b> <b>file</b> that is slightly larger than the source file(s).|$|E
25|$|The {{mobile app}} enables groups to collect audio, video, {{photographs}} and other geo-referenced structured and unstructured data.

When the hierarchy is encrypted, users {{are required to}} supply a password to see the filenames contained within the archive.
