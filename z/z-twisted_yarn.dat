50|$|A single {{spun yarn}} may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another. In plying, {{two or more}} yarns are spun together, almost always in the {{opposite}} sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two <b>Z-twist</b> <b>yarns</b> are usually plied with an S-twist. The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|R

Too much yarn hairiness is undesirable for many end uses {{as well as the}} spinning and post spinning processes. The main aims of this project are to examine the hairiness features of various yarns and to reduce yarn hairiness. The thesis covers five related areas – hairiness assessment, factors affecting yarn hairiness, the hairiness of newly developed yarns, yarn hairiness reduction, and effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning. The worsted cashmere, pure wool and wool/cashmere blend yarns were employed to investigate the effect of some fibre parameters on the yarn hairiness. A single exponential distribution of the hair-length was confirmed first, using the data from the Zweigle G 565 Hairiness Meter. A linear relationship was observed between the blend ratio and the hairiness indexes. In particular, the effect of fibre crimp or curvature on yarn hairiness is examined. The theory of yarn hairiness composition was also developed further. The effect of draft ratio and spindle speed on the hairiness of worsted wool yarn was examined next with a factorial experiment design. Several new hairiness indexes, namely the relative hairiness indexes, have been used to explain the results obtained. In the investigation of the hairiness of newly developed yarns, the hairiness of the Compact Spun and Roller-Jet-Spun yarns was examined first. The composition of the yarn hairiness, the hair-length distribution, and the effect of test speed on yarn hairiness were then studied. An important finding is that for both yarns, the predominant hairiness feature is the looped hairs. A comparison of the hairiness of Solospun yarns and the equivalent ring spun wool yarns was undertaken. The hair-length distribution of the Solospun yarn was examined first. The Solospun yarns used had fewer hairs in most hair-length groups and lower variations in hairiness. In addition, the effect of twist level and spindle speed on the hairiness of Solospun and conventional ring spun yarns has also been discussed. A novel approach of reducing yarn hairiness – spinning with a ‘Diagonal’ yarn path was examined next. Both ‘Left Diagonal’ and ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn arrangements were studied. A new finding is that the ‘Right Diagonal’ yarn path leads to reduced hairiness for the <b>Z-twist</b> <b>yarn,</b> while yarn evenness and tenacity are not as sensitive to the modified yarn path. The mechanism of hairiness reduction with the ‘Diagonal’ yarn path has been discussed. The spinning performance of “Right Diagonal” yarn arrangement has also been evaluated. Finally, the effect of yarn hairiness on the energy consumption in ring spinning has been investigated theoretically and experimentally. A theoretical model has been developed, which represents the first attempt at theoretically investigating the influence of yarn hairiness on energy consumption during the winding stage of ring spinning. The experimental results have generally confirmed predictions of this model. Recommendations for further research in this area have also been made in the concluding chapter of this thesis...|$|R
50|$|Although {{knitting}} may be {{done with}} ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a <b>Z-twist</b> or S-twist <b>yarn.</b> If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, {{or they may be}} staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.|$|R
