5|$|After {{being dropped}} from the senior state team, Karthik was {{overlooked}} for the selection in the <b>zonal</b> Duleep Trophy, and played in the Under-19s for South Zone. He had a more productive time in his second <b>zonal</b> season, scoring 180 runs at 60.00 with three half-centuries. He was rewarded with selection in the national Under-19 team, and played in three youth one day internationals (ODIs) against Nepal. He made only 51 runs at 17.00 without taking a catch, but India won all their matches with ease.|$|E
5|$|Law {{and order}} are {{enforced}} by the Tamil Nadu police, which for administrative purposes has constituted Tiruchirappalli city as a separate district, divided into 18 <b>zonal</b> offices and units, {{with a total of}} 38 police stations.|$|E
5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! <b>Zonal</b> border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! <b>Zonal</b> border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Regular Lothian Bus {{services}} running within Edinburgh and {{the west}} of East Lothian operate a flat fare, but from Longniddry, Macmerry and Ormiston there is a <b>zonal</b> system with East Coast Buses having six zones.|$|E
5|$|When {{the general}} flow pattern buckles from a <b>zonal</b> pattern to the meridional pattern, a slower {{movement}} in a north or southward direction is more likely. Meridional flow patterns feature strong, amplified troughs and ridges, generally with more northerly and southerly flow.|$|E
5|$|At the Paralympics {{teams in}} the sport of {{wheelchair}} rugby {{are made up of}} mixed classification tetraplegic athletes of both sexes. Great Britain qualified via the Europe <b>Zonal</b> Championship and went on to finish fourth out of eight teams, losing the bronze medal playoff to Canada.|$|E
5|$|In five matches for his {{new team}} during the 1994–95, he took 24 wickets at 14.58 {{including}} a haul of 5/28 against Vidarbha. He was rewarded with selection in the Under-19 Central Zone team for the <b>zonal</b> one-day tournament, taking five wickets at 25.00 in four matches. He had little success with the bat, scoring 47 on one occasion during the season, but otherwise only aggregating nine runs in six innings.|$|E
5|$|The Fairy Queen {{spent the}} next 34 years on a {{pedestal}} outside Howrah station. In 1943, the locomotive {{was moved to the}} Railway <b>Zonal</b> Training School at Chandausi, in Uttar Pradesh, where it served as a curiosity object for many of the students based there.|$|E
5|$|He {{was rewarded}} with {{selection}} for Central Zone and after taking 4/133 against North Zone, claimed 5/73 and 2/22 in the final to help them defeat West Zone by 112 runs in Aurangabad to claim the Duleep Trophy, and was the leading wicket-taker during the tournament. He scored a total of 183 runs at 18.30 for the entire Indian first-class season. He took five wickets at 26.60 in four <b>zonal</b> one-dayers, and tasted victory in all four fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in <b>zonal</b> jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{regained his}} {{position}} in the Under-19 team {{at the start of}} the following season, which he opened with 150 against Goa. After scoring 314 runs at 46.42 in eight matches, he was promoted to the Under-22 team and made 78 runs at 39.00 in five matches. Karthik was rewarded with selection for South Zone, which represents the country’s south, in the Under-19 <b>zonal</b> competition. He was not a success with the bat, scoring 0, 1 and 2 in his 3 innings. In April 2002, Karthik was selected to play against the touring Australian Cricket Academy, and scored 125 in the second of two matches.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{was called}} into the Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, but in the warm-up match he bowled one only over, {{in which he was}} {{hammered}} for 23 runs. He then watched from the sidelines as India only fielded one spin bowler—Harbhajan—in the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the <b>zonal</b> one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him left out of the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.|$|E
5|$|The Interzonal tournament {{was held}} in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, in November and December 1970. The top six players of the interzonal (shown in bold in the table below) {{qualified}} for the Candidates Tournament. Bobby Fischer had not qualified {{to play in this}} event, as he had not participated in the 1969 US Championship (<b>Zonal).</b> However, Benko (and the reserve Lombardy) gave up his spot, and FIDE President Max Euwe controversially allowed Fischer to participate instead. A compensation of US$1,500 was paid to Benko for this to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{clubs and}} {{societies}} of Nan Chiau High School allowed for more varieties of exposure to skills and interests of the students, and have achieved outstanding achievements. The NCHS Robotics Club is the retaining <b>zonal</b> champion of the DSTA-DSO East Zone Robotics Challenge since 2014, and have been organising annual competition for primary and secondary school students since 2009. The Multimedia Club attained the Best School Award for consecutive years 2014 and 2015 in the Canon Photo Marathon.|$|E
5|$|The first {{border between}} Wales and England was <b>zonal,</b> apart {{from around the}} River Wye, {{which was the first}} {{accepted}} boundary. Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching {{from the mouth of the}} Dee to the mouth of the Wye. Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.|$|E
5|$|In January 2005, {{a series}} of one-day {{domestic}} tournaments were held, and Karthik {{had a chance to}} press his claims for selection in that format, having never played more than three List A matches in a sequence. In five matches for Tamil Nadu, he only had three innings, but scored 72 and 80 in two of them. He was then called into South Zone’s senior team for the first time, to play in the <b>zonal</b> one-day competition. He scored 106 runs at 26.50 in four outings for the southerners. In the Challenger Trophy, Karthik played for India A against India B and India Seniors, and made little impact, scoring 17 and 3. He then played for South Zone in the first-class Duleep Trophy, but continued to have modest returns with the bat, scoring 101 runs at 25.25 in two outings, although he was run out in one innings after making a start and reaching 59.|$|E
5|$|The Indian team is {{selected}} {{by a panel}} of former cricketers who have played at least 25 games at the first-class level or higher. The panel consists of five retired women cricketers, the chairperson and four other members, one member from each of the five <b>zonal</b> divisions in domestic cricket. More than 20% of India's women cricketers represent Mumbai (formerly Bombay) in the domestic league. India have played 173 ODIs under 12 captains, starting with their first ODI in 1978 and including their most recent one in March 2009. The team first won an ODI in McLean Park, Napier, New Zealand against the International XI Women, their seventh game, played in 1982. Since then, India have won another 89 games. The team's first series win was against New Zealand, in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The International Zone {{served as}} {{the hub of the}} Games Village, {{offering}} retail and entertainment services as well as a rendezvous location for visitors and Games participants. Key facilities such as a bank, post office and general store were hosted there, alongside retail shops and entertainment facilities including a cinema and an Internet café. Live craft demonstrations, band performances and cultural programmes were also held at the Village. The Training Area, a <b>zonal</b> area by itself with an area of , provided training facilities entirely within the Games Village, in what {{has been described as a}} first in the history of the Commonwealth Games. There were facilities for four sports, including a track and field, wrestling and weightlifting training halls and an Olympic-size pool. A fully equipped gymnasium and fitness centre, steam and sauna facilities, physiotherapy rooms, as well as a leisure pool complemented the sport-specific facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} ticket {{vending machines}} {{were designed by}} Thorn EMI. In 2005 GMPTE announced that rail passengers travelling from within Greater Manchester into Manchester city centre can use the Metrolink service between the nine City Zone stops for free. Passengers must present a valid rail ticket, correctly dated with Manchester Ctlz as the destination. In 2007 TfGM rolled out new ticket vending machines, designed to accept credit/debit card payments and permit the purchase of multiple tickets in a single transaction. These were replaced in 2009 with touchscreen machines, designed with the Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress system. In October 2012, TfGM announced it was devising a simpler <b>zonal</b> fare system, comparable to London fare zones, and preparing to introduce get me there, the region's new contactless smartcard system, for use on all public transport modes in Greater Manchester, including Metrolink.|$|E
5|$|This {{all changed}} {{when a new}} regime, chaired by David Holmes, took control of Rangers in 1986. Graeme Souness was {{appointed}} player–manager, while several English stars, including Terry Butcher and Chris Woods, were signed. Season ticket sales rose from 7,000 in 1986 to over 30,000 in the 1990s, while commercial income increased from £239,000 in 1986 to over £2 million in 1989. The introduction of computerised ticketing, <b>zonal</b> public address systems and closed-circuit television for monitoring turnstile areas meant that Ibrox was {{at the forefront of}} stadium management. Rangers also adopted the American technique of analysing the types of fans in each area of the stadium and adjusted their food stalls accordingly. Greater success on the pitch meant that Ibrox demonstrated that seated stadiums would be welcomed by most fans, if designed and fitted well.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to India, Pathan was selected in a senior <b>zonal</b> {{team for the}} first time. He was selected for West Zone for the Duleep Trophy, {{even though he had}} not played a single match for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy season. He immediately repaid the selectors' faith by taking 4/74 and 6/72, his first ten-wicket match haul, in the first fixture against Central Zone, setting up a 161-run win. In the next match, he took 4/72 and 3/85 as West defeated North by 178 runs. He only took 1/55 in the next match against South but West were through to the final, where he took 4/43 to help cut down East Zone for 162 in the first innings, sealing the title. In all Pathan, had taken 22 wickets at 18.22 for the tournament, and scored 46 runs at 11.50.|$|E
5|$|Continuous <b>zonal</b> {{patterns}} {{can take}} the form of whitish subsutural bands (A. similis), heavy subperipheral pigmentation (A. perversus var. infraviridis), subsutural color lines (A. columellaris), broad spiral color bands (A. metabletus, A. webbi), or narrow spiral bands (A. laevus). Interrupted zonation can consist of the interruption of bands into spots in (A. maculatus); highly irregular splitting of zones (A. perversus vars. sultanus and interruptus); formation of oblique radial streaks which run parallel to (in A. inversus) or cross (in A. latestrigatus) the incremental growth lines; or almost every conceivable combination and variation of these factors. Often the pattern will change radically from the apex to the body whorl (in A. quadrasi vars.). The aperture, parietal callus, columella, lip, and umbilical region are variously marked with pink, brown, purple, white, or black. Haniel (1921) includes several color plates which clearly demonstrate the extent of color variation within two species of the Syndromus type. A. perversus and A. maculiferus of the subgenus Amphidromus are equally variable, whereas species such as A. inversus and A. similis are almost uniform in coloration.|$|E
5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, <b>zonal,</b> storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which diverts frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|During {{his career}} Alimuddin played 140 {{first-class}} matches and scored 7,275 runs, {{with the average}} of 32.77, including 14 centuries and 38 fifties; he also took 40 wickets. Critics considered him to be an excellent fielder. He made his debut for Rajasthan aged only 12 years 73 days, becoming the youngest player to have played first-class cricket. In 1942–43, he played his maiden match in the Ranji Trophy, scoring 13 and 27 runs in his two innings. His highest score in first-class cricket was 142, against Worcestershire in 1954. Domestically, Alimuddin represented Sindh, Rajasthan, Karachi, Bahawalpur and Gujarat, {{and became the first}} Pakistani batsman to face a ball bowled by an international bowler on Pakistani soil, in a match between the Sindh and West Indians in 1948. During Pakistan's 1954 tour of England, Alimuddin scored more than 700 runs, including two centuries in the first two matches. He was most successful during 1961–62, scoring 1,020 runs in 12 matches at an average of 51.00. In the same season he captained Karachi, leading the team to victories in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy and Ayub <b>Zonal</b> Trophy. His final season in first-class cricket was 1967–68.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1995–96, Kartik {{had a more}} successful season for Railways Under-19s. He started with 5/73 and 5/55 against Madhya Pradesh and made it three five-wicket hauls in a row with 5/42 against Vidarbha. He took another five-wicket haul {{later in the season}} against Rajasthan and ended the competition with 38 wickets at 18.94 in seven matches. Railways made the final, where they faced Punjab. Kartik was Railways' most effective bowler, taking 4/57 in Punjab's first innings of 310. He then made 14 not out as Railways ceded a first innings lead, which was enough to give Punjab the title as the match ended in a draw. Kartik took 3/138 in the second innings. After the final, newly crowned champions took on the Rest of India, and Kartik took 2/25 and 4/89 to help his team to a six-wicket victory. Kartik had a less successful time in the <b>zonal</b> one-dayers for Central, taking only one wicket in three matches. He also improved his batting marginally, scoring 57 and three other double-digit scores.|$|E
