5|$|A {{course of}} antiretrovirals {{administered}} within 48 to 72hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions {{is referred to}} as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The use of the single agent <b>zidovudine</b> reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury. As of 2013, the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may reduce the risk further.|$|E
5|$|PEP {{treatment}} is recommended after {{a sexual assault}} when the perpetrator {{is known to be}} HIV positive, but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown. The duration of {{treatment is}} usually four weeks and is frequently associated with adverse effects—where <b>zidovudine</b> is used, about 70% of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea (24%), fatigue (22%), emotional distress (13%) and headaches (9%).|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an intravenous drug user. He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as {{this is the only way}} they can determine if the drug is working.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses: These have ssRNA (Retroviridae, Metaviridae, Pseudoviridae) or dsDNA (Caulimoviridae, and Hepadnaviridae) {{in their}} particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA {{intermediate}} to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a reverse transcriptase, or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, {{to carry out}} the nucleic acid conversion. Retroviruses integrate the DNA produced by reverse transcription into the host genome as a provirus {{as a part of the}} replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus. They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. <b>zidovudine</b> and lamivudine. An example of the first type is HIV, which is a retrovirus. Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae, which includes Hepatitis B virus.|$|E
25|$|Zidovudine: may {{increase}} <b>zidovudine</b> serum concentration {{and lead to}} toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Ribavirin {{should not}} be given with <b>zidovudine</b> because of the {{increased}} risk of anemia; concurrent use with didanosine should likewise be avoided because of {{an increased risk of}} mitochondrial toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The first {{successful}} antiviral, aciclovir, is a nucleoside analogue, and is effective against herpesvirus infections. The first antiviral drug {{to be approved}} for treating HIV, <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT), is also a nucleoside analogue.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Peter Duesberg {{questioned}} {{the link between}} HIV and AIDS in the journal Cancer Research. Duesberg's publication coincided with the start of major public health campaigns {{and the development of}} <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT) as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of people with AIDS have never received antiretroviral drugs, including those in developed countries prior to the licensure of AZT (<b>zidovudine)</b> in 1987, and people in developing countries today where very few individuals have access to these medications.|$|E
25|$|When {{antiretroviral}} {{drugs are}} used improperly, multi-drug resistant strains {{can become the}} dominant genotypes very rapidly. In the era before multiple drug classes were available (pre-1997), the reverse transcriptase inhibitors <b>zidovudine,</b> didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, and lamivudine were used serially or in combination leading {{to the development of}} multi-drug resistant mutations.|$|E
25|$|Levels of quinolinic acid in the CSF of AIDS {{patients}} {{suffering from}} AIDS- dementia can {{be up to}} twenty times higher than normal. Similar to HIV patients, this increased quinolinic acid concentration correlates with cognitive and motor dysfunction. When patients were treated with <b>zidovudine</b> to decrease quinolinic acid levels, the amount of neurological improvement {{was related to the}} amount of quinolinic acid decreased.|$|E
25|$|As HIV uses reverse {{transcriptase}} to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs {{have been designed}} to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues <b>zidovudine</b> (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and tenofovir (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).|$|E
25|$|<b>Zidovudine</b> (ZDV), {{also known}} as {{azidothymidine}} (AZT), is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It {{may be used to}} prevent mother-to-child spread during birth or after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It is sold both by itself and together as lamivudine/zidovudine and abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine. It can be used by mouth or by slow injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zidovudine</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1964. It was approved in the United States in 1986 {{and was the}} first treatment for HIV. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is 5.10 to 25.60 USD per month. As of 2015, the cost for a typical month of medication in the United States was more than 200 USD.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is not {{necessary}} since the lesion is benign, however the person may have esthetic concerns about the appearance. The condition often resolves rapidly with high dose acyclovir or desiclovir but recurs once this therapy is stopped, or as the underlying immunocompromise worsens. Topical use of podophyllum resin or retinoids has also been reported to produce temporary remission. Antiretroviral drugs such as <b>zidovudine</b> may be effective in producing a significant regression of OHL. Recurrence of the lesion may also signify that {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) is becoming ineffective.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 and 2002, {{the number}} of {{patients}} living with HIV/AIDS being identified through treatment services began to increase. As many as 69,000 of these people were the rural poor who had been infected when they sold their blood and plasma in the mid-1990s and who were unable to access or afford much-needed antiretroviral treatment. On the basis of the successes of programmes in other nations, such as Brazil, a free antiretroviral therapy programme was piloted in late 2002 in Shangcai county, Henan province, one of the most severely affected areas. Patients were provided with a combination of <b>zidovudine</b> or didanosine plus lamivudine and nevirapine. On the basis of the improved health status and survival of the initial cohort, the programme was scaled up in early 2003, mainly through the China CARES programme.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} classes of drugs directed against thymidine metabolism and thereby involving thymidine kinase {{that are used}} to control cancer associated cell division. Chain terminators are thymidine analogues that are included in the growing DNA chain, but modified so that the chain cannot be further elongated. As analogs of thymidine, this type of drugs are readily phosphorylated to 5'-monophosphates. The monophosphate is further phosphorylated to the corresponding triphosphate and incorporated in the growing DNA chain. The analog has been modified so that it does not have the hydroxyl group in the 3'-position that is required for continued chain growth. In <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT; ATC:J05AF01) the 3'-hydroxyl group has been replaced by an azido group, in stavudine (ATC: J05AF04) it has been removed without replacement. AZT is used as substrate in one of the methods for determination of thymidine kinase in serum. This implies that AZT interferes with this method and may be a limitation: AZT is a standard component of HAART therapy in HIV infection. One common consequence of AIDS is lymphoma and the most important diagnostic application of thymidine kinase determination is for monitoring of lymphoma.|$|E
500|$|Current HAART {{options are}} {{combinations}} (or [...] "cocktails") consisting {{of at least}} three medications belonging to at least two types, or [...] "classes," [...] of antiretroviral agents. Initially treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Typical NRTIs include: <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC). Combinations of agents which include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.|$|E
2500|$|A {{single dose}} of {{nevirapine}} given to {{both mother and}} child reduced the rate of HIV transmission by almost 50% compared with a very short course of <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT) prophylaxis, in a clinical trial in Uganda. A subsequent study in Thailand showed that prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine in addition to <b>zidovudine</b> {{is more effective than}} <b>zidovudine</b> alone. These and other trials have led the World Health Organization to endorse the use of single-dose nevirapine prophylaxis in many developing world settings as a cost-effective way of reducing mother-to-child transmission. However, in the United States the Ugandan study was deemed flawed [...] and as of 2006 the FDA has not approved of such nevirapine prophylaxis. However, supporters of HIVNET 012 experiment argued that the flaws in this experiment were largely due to bureaucratic incompetence, while the findings regarding the safety and efficacy of single-dose nevirapine from this study were scientifically solid and too important to discard. Moreover, it was argued that holding African researchers who operated under resource-poor situations to the same moral and procedural standards to their Western counterparts was unrealistic, and would further marginalize African researchers' role in the science community and impede the progress of African science. Another clinical trial, Using Nevirapine to Prevent Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission During Breastfeeding is scheduled for completion in March 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Wayne State University School of Medicine is the {{academic}} affiliate of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, one of 26 NCI-designated Cancer Centers in the United States. [...] WSUSOM researchers, {{in conjunction with}} Karmanos Cancer Institute, oversee more than 400 clinical trials, participate in a national program to collect and study cancer data for future research and provide {{about half of all}} national statistics on cancer in African Americans. The first drug approved for the treatment of AIDS and HIV infection, <b>Zidovudine</b> was synthesized here. [...] WSUSOM and Karmanos furthered their partnership in 2009, signing an agreement to establish a new academic department at the school for Karmanos researchers and expand their already successful research and teaching partnership.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, in {{addition}} to recreational drugs, Duesberg argues that anti-HIV drugs such as <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT) can cause AIDS. Duesberg's claim that antiviral medication causes AIDS is regarded as disproven by the scientific community. Placebo-controlled {{studies have found that}} AZT as a single agent produces modest and short-lived improvements in survival and delays the development of opportunistic infections; it certainly did not cause AIDS, which develops in both treated and untreated study patients. With the subsequent development of protease inhibitors and highly active antiretroviral therapy, numerous studies have documented the fact that anti-HIV drugs prevent the development of AIDS and substantially prolong survival, further disproving the claim that these drugs [...] "cause" [...] AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{effective}} therapy against HIV was the nucleoside {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor (NRTI), <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT). It {{was approved by}} the US FDA in 1987. Subsequently, several more NRTIs were developed but even in combination were unable to suppress the virus {{for long periods of time}} and patients still inevitably died. To distinguish from this early antiretroviral therapy (ART), the term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced. [...] In 1996 by sequential publications in The New England Journal of Medicine by Hammer and colleagues and Gulick and coinvestigators illustrating the substantial benefit of combining 2 NRTIs with a new class of antiretrovirals, protease inhibitors, namely indinavir. This concept of 3-drug therapy was quickly incorporated into clinical practice and rapidly showed impressive benefit with a 60% to 80% decline in rates of AIDS, death, and hospitalization.|$|E
2500|$|Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTI) and nucleotide {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors (NtRTI) are nucleoside and nucleotide analogues which inhibit reverse transcription. [...] HIV is an RNA virus and hence unable to become {{integrated into the}} DNA in {{the nucleus of the}} human cell; it must be [...] "reverse" [...] transcribed into DNA. Since the conversion of RNA to DNA is not done in the mammalian cell it is performed by a viral protein which makes it a selective target for inhibition. NRTIs are chain terminators such that once incorporated, work by preventing other nucleosides from also being incorporated into the DNA chain because of the absence of a 3' OH group. Both act as competitive substrate inhibitors. [...] Examples of currently used NRTIs include <b>zidovudine,</b> abacavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, and tenofovir.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil's {{response}} has been characterized by reaching out to groups which account for {{a high percentage of}} AIDS transmission, including relationships with non-governmental organizations. For example, in contrast to many parts of the world, condoms were prioritized early and aggressively. Condom use in first sexual intercourse increased from 4% in 1986 to 48% in 1999 and to 55% in 2003, spurred by government programs to increase awareness, decrease the price, and increase the availability of condoms. Prostitute groups were involved in the distribution of information materials and condoms. Similarly, needle exchange programs were implemented. [...] The prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users (IDUs) fell from 52% in 1999 to 41.5% in 2001. [...] 12 needle exchange programs were implemented between 1994 and 1998; 40 had been implemented by 2000, distributing 1,500,000 syringes in just a year. HIV prevalence among IDU decreased even more dramatically in some cities. In 1988 comprehensive screening tests were implemented nationwide in blood banks, following a similar program in São Paulo in 1986; however, the results of these programs were not realized fully until 2000 {{as a result of the}} incubation period of the virus, but new cases from blood transfusion became virtually non-existent at that time and new and more effective nucleic acid testing is being considered. Mother-to-child transmission was similarly practically eradicated, falling to a transmission rate of 3%, a level comparable to most developed countries, with the implementation of <b>zidovudine</b> treatment regimes to mother and child and recommendations against breastfeeding.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zidovudine,</b> {{also called}} AZT, ZDV, and azidothymidine, has the trade name Retrovir. <b>Zidovudine</b> {{was the first}} {{antiretroviral}} drug approved by the FDA {{for the treatment of}} HIV.|$|E

50|$|Lamivudine and <b>zidovudine</b> are not {{extensively}} metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zidovudine</b> is {{also well}} {{absorbed in the}} body and penetrates into the {{cerebrospinal}} fluid. Oral bioavailability is 75% and primarily metabolized by the liver by glucuronidation. The primary metabolite is GZDV, an inactive metabolite produced after first pass metabolism. The half-life of <b>zidovudine</b> is 0.5 to 3 hours and binds poorly to plasma proteins.|$|E
5000|$|Generic: {{lamivudine}} 150 mg and <b>zidovudine</b> 300 mg. 60 tablets cost $749.|$|E
50|$|Further {{modification}} of the dideoxy framework {{led to the development}} of 2´,3´-didehydro-3´-deoxythymidine (stavudine, d4T). Activity of stavudine was shown to be similar to that of <b>zidovudine,</b> although their phosphorylation patterns differ; theaffinity for <b>zidovudine</b> to thymidine kinase (the enzyme responsible for the first phosphorylation) is similar to that of thymidine, whereas the affinity for stavudine is 700-fold weaker.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, while {{conducting}} {{research for the}} Karmanos Institute, Horwitz synthesized a compound that was to become known as <b>zidovudine</b> (AZT) - an antiviral drug used to treat HIV patients; <b>Zidovudine</b> was initially developed {{as a treatment for}} cancer. Horwitz was also first to synthesize stavudine (d4T) and zalcitabine (ddC) - two other reverse transcriptase inhibitors used in the treatment of HIV patients.|$|E
50|$|Stavudine, <b>zidovudine</b> and {{indinavir}} (IDV) cause {{a decrease}} in mitochondrial respiration {{and an increase in}} mitochondrial mass in fat cells. Stavudine also causes severe mitochondrial DNA depletion. Combining <b>zidovudine</b> with stavudine does not increase the mitochondrial toxicity compared to stavudine alone. Both of these drugs must be phosphorylated by host enzymes before they become active. <b>Zidovudine</b> inhibits the phosphorylation of stavudine. This might reduce the toxicity of the combination. Using indinavir in combination with the other two drugs did not increase the toxicity of the combination. Indinavir is a protease inhibitor and works by a different mechanism than the other antiviral drugs. (d4T+AZT+IDV = d4T+AZT = d4T+IDV > AZT+IDV = AZT = IDV). All three of these drugs inhibit the expression of respiratory chain subunits (cytochrome c oxidase CytOx2 and CytOx4) in white fat cells but not brown fat cells. Since stavudine and <b>zidovudine</b> are OAT1 substrates, they may have similar effects on proximal renal tubule cells as they do on fat cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of lamivudine and <b>zidovudine</b> {{is composed of}} two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).|$|E
