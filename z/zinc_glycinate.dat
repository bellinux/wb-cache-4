40|$|Metal glycinate chelates {{are formed}} by glycine and metal {{compounds}} through chemical reactions. Calcium glycinate, magnesium glycinate and <b>zinc</b> <b>glycinate</b> are kinds of new-type and ideal nutrient supplements, which have satisfactory physico-chemical properties and bioactivities. They {{are important for}} prophylaxis and treat metal deficiency. The structural characterization shows that the metal ion is bonded to the amino and carboxyl group to form two five-membered rings. This paper mainly studies the structure characterization of the metal chelated glycinates by their solubility, infrared spectrum, thermal analysis, mass spectrometry, polycrystal diffraction, the metal contents and glycine contents of calcium glycinate, magnesium glycinate and <b>zinc</b> <b>glycinate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Zinc from aqueous <b>zinc</b> <b>glycinate</b> binds to {{hair and}} skin at pH 7. The binding {{increases}} with Zn concen-tration, becoming appreciable when Zn exceeds about 1 millimole/liter. In the presence of soap or synthetic detergents, Zn binding still occurs, but at a lower level. Zinc bound to hair acts as an effective inhibitor of two bacterial exoenzymes, aryl sulfatase and beta-glucuronidase, which are implicated {{in the production of}} steroidal axillary malodor (1). Clinical testing of the deodorant activity of this material has shown that a 4. 5 % solution of Zn-GLY is as effective as 5 % aluminum chlorhydrate in controlling axillary odor. Although <b>zinc</b> <b>glycinate</b> is slightly bactericidal, enzyme inhibition seems to be the principal mechanism of deodorancy. The potential for a new underarm deodorant is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe <b>zinc</b> {{complex of}} <b>glycinate</b> [Gly-H + Zn]+ has been formed by {{electrospray}} of a glycine/ZnCl 2 {{mixture in a}} 50 : 50 vol. water/methanol solution. In this article, the precursors and the fragments of [Gly-H + Zn]+ ions are studied by means of collisional induced decomposition (CID) experiments including H/D exchanges and accurate ab initio calculations. Two precursors were identified: [Gly + CH 3 OH-H + Zn]+ (A) and [Gly + Gly-H + Zn]+ (B), A being much more abundant than B. The three main fragmentations of [Gly-H + Zn]+ are loss of carbon dioxyde, loss of carbon monoxyde, and successive losses of water and carbon monoxyde. To interpret these fragmentations four structures were chosen to describe [Gly-H + Zn]+. These structures are complexes between Zn(II) and glycine deprotonated either on the carboxylic group [NH 2 CH 2 COOZn]+ (1) or on the amine function [ZnNHCH 2 COOH]+ (2) or isomeric forms involving ZnH+ i. e. either [NH 2 CHCOOZnH]+ (3) or [HZn *** NH=CHCOOH]+ (4) respectively. None of the fragmentations is interpretable directly from structures 1 and 2. Loss of carbon dioxyde occurs from 3, loss of carbon monoxyde from a complex CX where HOZn+ interacts with CO and NH=CH 2, a rearranged form of 2. Successive losses of water and carbon monoxyde can take place from 4. The non occurrence of structures 1 and 2 during the fragmentation of [Gly-H + Zn]+ ions is interpreted by isomerizations within A before evaporation of the last molecule of solvent. These isomerizations are energetically easier than the last step of desolvation. Â© 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
