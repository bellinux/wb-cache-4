40|$|This paper {{studies the}} incentive-compatibility of distributing fish quotas {{on the basis}} of <b>zonal</b> <b>attachment</b> of stocks. Two {{countries}} sharing two fish stocks are studied, with the <b>zonal</b> <b>attachment</b> of both stocks varying randomly. The base case is one of symmetric stocks, where one country is the dominant player for one stock. While each country has weak or no incentive to cooperative on the stock in which it holds only a minor share, both countries would have incentives to cooperate on both stocks if they are jointly managed. If one country is the major player with respect to both stocks, the minor player has weak or no incentive to cooperate. The incentive to cooperate is not any stronger if the variations in the <b>zonal</b> <b>attachment</b> of the two stocks are negatively correlated...|$|E
40|$|A {{study by}} K. R. Patterson of the Marine Lab, Aberdeen, Scottland, {{presented}} to the EU comission in June 1997, investigated the distribution of Herring in the North Sea, i. e. the <b>zonal</b> <b>attachment</b> of the stock to EU and Norwegian waters, respectively. Evaluation of data from the ICES International Bottom Trawl Surveys and Herring Acoustic Surveys conducted in the last 10 years showed a wide variation in biomass and <b>zonal</b> <b>attachment,</b> {{depending on the type}} of survey used and the season sampled. However, a mean share of 16...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the strategic options of Norway {{and other countries}} for which the stock of Norwegian spring spawning herring may be accessible. A cooperative solution would make all parties better off. In a cooperative solution Norway must obtain a relatively large share of the total catch quota, because of her strategic advantage. The critical share to be offered to Norway does {{not have anything to}} do with the <b>zonal</b> <b>attachment</b> of the stock, interpreted as the share of the stock within the Norwegian economic zone. A rise in the temperature in the Northeast Atlantic could mean a larger carrying capacity for the stock and more extensive migration. This in turn would mean a less strong attachment of the stock to the Norwegian economic zone, strengthening the bargaining position of other parties than Norway...|$|E
40|$|Shared {{fish stocks}} are such as migrate across borders between {{different}} countries’ exclusive economic zones. This paper discusses the incentive compatibility of fish-sharing agreements {{based on the}} <b>zonal</b> <b>attachment</b> of such stocks. Three types of migrations are considered: (i) a common stock that grows and reproduces and is then distributed in given proportions between two countries’ zones {{at the beginning of}} each fishing season; (ii) sub-stocks that breed and grow independently in their separate zones but spill over between zones according to relative abundance; (iii) a stock that grows and breeds in one country’s zone but migrates into the zone of another if it exceeds a certain size. It is shown that in all these cases the minor partner in a fish-sharing agreement may not have an incentive to cooperate unless he gets a larger share of the cooperative profits than corresponds to his share of the stock. This is particularly likely to happen when the unit cost of fish does not depend on the stock. An exception could occur if stock migration depends on the stock level; the major partner could then keep the entire stock by fishing it down to a critical level...|$|E
