Though the PCDD/F levels were higher in workers of <b>zinc</b> <b>recovery</b> plant than those of secondary copper smelting plant, no significant difference was found for serum PCDD/F levels between the two kinds of plants.

The erythrocyte SOD activity in workers from the <b>zinc</b> <b>recovery</b> plant was marginally higher than that from the secondary copper plant (196 vs. 146 units/ml, p < 0. 06).

Zinc is required for normal thymic endocrine activity (i. e. thymulin) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production. Because in vivo data is still controversial, exogenous MEL treatment (22 days in drinking water) in both intact and pinealectomized (px) mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma leads to significant decrements of metastasis volume, restoration of the negative crude <b>zinc</b> balance, <b>recovery</b> of thymulin activity and increment of IL- 2 exclusively in intact and px tumor bearing mice subjected to RS.

Zinc supplementation did not hasten anthropometrical recovery but significantly reduced the time for immunological <b>recovery.</b> <b>Zinc</b> supplementation acted as an immune-stimulating factor so that immune and anthropometric <b>recoveries</b> coincided. <b>Zinc</b> supplement allowed the discharge of "anthropometrically and immunologically healthy" children after only one month of treatment. Hospitalization time could be shortened and the cost reduced by half. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Pneumonia {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{mortality}} causes in young children. Some studies have shown beneficial effect of zinc supplements on treatment of pneumonia. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of short courses of <b>zinc</b> administration on <b>recovery</b> from this disease in hospitalized children. Methods. In a parallel Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial at Ayatollah Golpaygani Hospital in Qom, 120 children aged 3 – 60 months with pneumonia were randomly assigned 1 [*]:[*] 1 to receive zinc or placebo (5 [*]mL every 12 hours) along with the common antibiotic treatments until discharge. Primary outcome was recovery from pneumonia which included the incidence and resolving clinical symptoms and duration of hospitalization. Results. The difference between two groups in all clinical symptoms at admittance and the variables affecting the disease such as age and sex were not statistically significant (P< 0. 05) at baseline. Compared to the placebo group, the treatment group showed a statistically significant decrease in duration of clinical symptoms (P= 0. 044) and hospitalization (P= 0. 004). Conclusions. Supplemental administration of zinc can expedite the healing process and results in faster resolution of clinical symptoms in children with pneumonia. In general, zinc administration, along with common antibiotic treatments, is recommended in this group of children. It can also reduce the drug resistance caused by multiple antibiotic therapies.

40|$|There is an {{abundant}} availability of zinc sulphide (sphalerite) ore (160 million tons at 7. 40 % Zn) at Gamsberg, Northern Cape in South Africa. The ore body is South Africa’s greatest unexploited base metal resource. Regardless of its size, the low zinc and high manganese {{content of the}} sphalerite combined with the low zinc price prohibits {{the development of the}} deposit. Sphalerite is the most common zinc mineral, hence 95 % of the world’s zinc production is from this mineral. Sphalerite is currently processed by crushing-milling-flotation, followed by the roast-leach-electrowinning (RLE) process. This route has major detrimental impacts on the environment, it produces SO 2, and cannot treat ores of low grade or higher complexity. Therefore, alternative processes are being sought in order to circumvent the RLE process. This study compares three different process routes in the context of processing ore from the Gamsberg deposit for refining 3. 4 million tpa ore in order to produce special high grade (SHG) zinc (> 99. 995 % Zn). These routes include heap leaching and refining locally (route 1), preparing a flotation concentrate and refining it locally (route 2) and lastly, preparing a flotation concentrate and shipping it for toll refining in Europe (route 3). Zinc heap leaching has not yet been commercialised due to the absence of solvent extraction reagents which can selectively extract zinc from a low tenor acidic pregnant leach solution without incorporating the neutralization stage. Therefore, route 1 has higher risk as compared to the other routes. A desktop model which provides a comparison of capital cost, operating cost, NPV, IRR and PVR has been developed. Parameters such as average <b>zinc</b> grade, process <b>recovery</b> and <b>zinc</b> price are provided as inputs. The effects of fluctuations in important parameters such as working capital, and zinc price on NPV are assessed using Matlab...|$|R
