In 2005 GMPTE announced that rail passengers travelling from within Greater Manchester into Manchester city centre can use the Metrolink service between the nine City Zone stops for free. Passengers must present a valid rail ticket, correctly dated with Manchester Ctlz as the destination. In 2007 TfGM rolled out new ticket vending machines, designed to accept credit/debit card payments and permit the purchase of multiple tickets in a single transaction. These were replaced in 2009 with touchscreen machines, designed with the Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress system. In October 2012, TfGM announced it was devising a simpler <b>zonal</b> <b>fare</b> system, comparable to London fare zones, and preparing to introduce get me there, the region's new contactless smartcard system, for use on all public transport modes in Greater Manchester, including Metrolink.|$|E

40|$|After a {{brief summary}} of the {{relevant}} behavioural theory and of findings from earlier work on consumers' responses to complexity and on drivers' responses to highly differentiated road user charges, we describe new work seeking to establish the likely behavioural response to simplified bus fares, and discuss {{the implications of the}} findings in the wider context of traveller behaviour. Ticket sales data suggests that the introduction of simplified fare structures has usually been associated with increases in demand but it has not been easy to distinguish the contribution of simplification per se, from that of the changes in individual fare levels, and of the marketing and service changes which usually accompany any change in fare structure. This new study sought to isolate the effect of simplification by collecting data on attitudes and stated choices via a questionnaire. Attitudinal questions probed the respondents' decision-making style, their knowledge of existing fare structures and their perceived need to know the exact fare before travelling. Other questions asked whether, and to what extent, the number of bus trips they currently make might change if bus fares were simplified in specified ways. Stated Preference (SP) questions sought to disentangle the effect of price changes and of simplification. It was not possible, in the SP exercise, to specify the existing, un-simplified, fare level (if respondents had been told what the un-simplified fare was the value of the simplification would thereby have been negated) and so respondents were asked to make their own estimate of the existing, un-simplified, fare. Three hundred interviews were conducted in Autumn 2008 in three areas of the UK where the bus fares have not yet been simplified, among people who did not rule out the possibility of making additional journeys by bus. Analysis of the resulting data suggests that people have poor knowledge of the exiting fares and that some, but by no means all, of them (particularly low income infrequent travellers) claim to be reluctant to travel without knowing the fares in advance. Modelling work revealed that a significant proportion of respondents misunderstood the concept of <b>zonal</b> <b>fares</b> but that, when this was allowed for by using a random coefficient with a discrete distribution, it becomes apparent that travellers would be prepared to pay a significant premium for having fixed or <b>zonal</b> <b>fares.</b> Interestingly, willingness to pay this premium is very unevenly spread among the population; some people apparently put a very high value on being able to estimate the fare with ease while others seem not to care. This distribution reflects expressed attitudes to uncertainty. Our findings have implications for public policy (raising issues such as the equity implications of imposing a simplified fare structure across the whole population) and for optimal commercial pricing. They also have implications for the wider understanding of travel choice; they add to the growing body of evidence that some travellers profess to take little account of price when making travel decisions and that only a minority claim to be unwilling to choose travel options whose key attributes they do not know...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a method to}} automate journey fare calculation for Transport for London. Today, fares for every possible origin-destination station pair within the London Underground are prepared manually based on the <b>zonal</b> <b>fare</b> structure. Multiple feasible paths often exist within the network for a given origin-destination pair, each of which may produce a different journey fare. Thus, manually adjusting journey fares after any alteration of the network or fare structure is a time consuming task for staff and restricts Transport for London's ability to implement changes in fare policy. This approach also lacks transparency from the passenger's perspective. Automating Transport for London's fare calculation requires automating the selection of travel paths. This thesis adapts a label-correcting shortest path algorithm to produce journey paths and fares based on four different selection rules: minimum fare, minimum number of transfers, minimum travel time, and minimum distance. The algorithm operates on a directed graph model of the network. This thesis {{develops a}} method to structure the directed graph to capture the network's intricacies...|$|E
40|$|Transit {{providers}} {{around the}} world are progressively migrating from automatic fare collection systems to state-of-the-art contactless smartcard systems. The introduction of this new technology provides a unique opportunity for transit agencies to review fares and ticketing policy and leverage the full functionality of these new ticketing systems. Research being undertaken at the University of Queensland seeks to develop recommendations on potential fares and ticketing policy reform using contactless smartcard technologies. Recent experience indicates that introduction of many of the new ticketing systems have been technology- rather than policy-driven. The fare structure is basically a relationship between fare levels and distance travelled, including flat, distance based, time-based and <b>zonal</b> <b>fare</b> structures. Transit fares policy results from trade-offs between competing objectives, such as economic, social or political, but examples of actual policies are extremely hard to find. The availability of new smartcard technology provides the opportunity to provide a 2 ̆ 7 closed 2 ̆ 7 fare collection system, without physical barriers, allowing more differentiated fare structures based on distance travelled. In addition, there are significant opportunities for integrated ticketing and product innovation...|$|E
