40|$|Pulse {{generators}} in magnetron sputter {{systems have}} to generate an electromagnetic field between the magnetrons under different operating conditions. Most {{of the electric}} parameters like output power, pulse width and the switching frequency have to be adjustable in a wide range. Another changing parameter is the load behaviour which varies from high impedance to <b>Zener</b> <b>characteristic</b> during every switching period. Starting from a comparison of current topologies this paper presents a novel pulse generator for Pulsed Plasma Surface Technologies (PPST). It is demonstrated {{that the combination of}} different basic topologies results in an improved efficiency of the sputter process...|$|E

Partially overlapping p(+) and n(+) regions with a salicide block layer are employed in this device to constitute a heavily doped p(+) -n(+) junction which has soft "knee" <b>Zener</b> breakdown <b>characteristics,</b> thus its working voltage can be reduced preferably below 5 V, {{and at the same}} time the power efficiency is improved. The spectra of this device are spread over 500 nm to 1000 nm with the main peak at about 722 nm and an obvious red shift of the spectra peak is observed with the increasing current through the device. During the emission process, {{field emission}} rather than avalanche process plays a major role. Differences between low-voltage Zener breakdown emission and high-voltage avalanche breakdown emission performance are observed and compared...|$|R
50|$|The first {{evidence}} for CDW transport in inorganic linear chain compounds, such as transition metal trichalcogenides, {{was reported in}} 1976 by Monceau et al., who observed enhanced electrical conduction at increased electric fields in NbSe3. The nonlinear contribution to the electrical conductivity Ïƒ vs. field E was fit to a Landau-Zener tunneling characteristic ~ exp-E0/E (see Landau-Zener formula), but it was soon realized that the <b>characteristic</b> <b>Zener</b> field E0 was far too small to represent Zener tunneling of normal electrons across the Peierls gap. Subsequent experiments showed a sharp threshold electric field, as well as peaks in the noise spectrum (narrow band noise) whose fundamental frequency scales with the CDW current. These and other experiments (e.g.,) confirm that the CDW collectively carries an electric current in a jerky fashion above the threshold field.|$|R
