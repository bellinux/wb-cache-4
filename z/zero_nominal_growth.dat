40|$|The {{welfare gains}} from {{adopting}} a <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> interest policy {{depend on the}} implementation details. Here I argue that implementing the Friedman rule by a government loan program may be better than implementing it by collecting taxes, even when lump sum taxes are possible. The government loan program will crowd out lending and borrowing and other money substitutes. Since money can be costlessly created the resources spent on creating money substitutes are a "social waste". Moving from an economy with strictly positive nominal interest rate to an economy with <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> interest rate will increase consumption {{by the amount of}} resources spent on lending and borrowing. But in general welfare will increase by more than that because consumption smoothing is better under <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> interest rate.

40|$|An {{economy is}} in a {{liquidity}} trap when monetary policy cannot influence either real or nominal variables of interest. A necessary condition {{for this is that}} the short nominal interest rate is constrained by its lower bound, typically zero. The paper develops a small analytical model to show how an economy can get into a liquidity trap, how it can avoid getting into one and how it can get out. The empirical likelihood of the UK economy hitting the <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> rate bound is considered by investigating the relationship between the level of the short nominal interest rate and its volatility. The empirical evidence on this issue is mixed. To reduce the risk of falling into a liquidity trap, the authorities have two options. The first is to raise the inflation target. The second is to lower the <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> interest rate floor. This second option involves paying negative interest on government 'bearer bonds' - coin and currency - ie 'taxing money', as advocated by Gesell. Once in a liquidity trap, there are two means of escape. The first is to use expansionary fiscal policy. The second is, again, to lower the <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> interest rate floor. There are likely to be significant shoe leather costs associated with any scheme to tax currency. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} the growth of fiscal and {{monetary}} policy variables on <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth</b> is examined. Two measures on the fiscal policy side, government expenditure and total tax revenue, and on the monetary policy side, monetary aggregate measures M 1 and M 2, are selected as explanatory variables. Growth rate of M 1 is found to have a statistically significant impact on <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth.</b> On the fiscal policy side, the growth rate of the tax revenue is found to have some lagged effect on nominal income. Government expenditure and M 2 growth do not have any statistically significant impact on <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth.</b> With respect to the cumulative effect, M 1 is found to be a statistically significant variable affecting <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth.</b> Co-integration analysis shows that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between M 1 and <b>nominal</b> GDP <b>growth.</b> The findings of the study support the monetarists’ claim that growth in money supply has a statistically significant impact on <b>nominal</b> income <b>growth.</b> fiscal policy, monetary policy, cointegration analysis...|$|R

50|$|Another issue {{arising from}} {{monetary}} policies is the liquidity trap. This happens when inflation rate declines too much {{leading to a}} threat of deflation.

50|$|The {{root cause}} of the ZLB is the {{issuance}} of paper currency by governments, effectively guaranteeing a <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> interest rate and acting as an interest rate floor.

40|$|We provide in {{this paper}} three {{indeterminacy}} results concerning competitive equilibrium in an open economy monetary model.

5000|$|When {{the central}} bank has lowered nominal {{interest}} rates to zero, {{it can no longer}} further stimulate demand by lowering interest rates. This is the famous liquidity trap. When deflation takes hold, it requires [...] "special arrangements" [...] to lend money at a <b>zero</b> <b>nominal</b> rate of interest (which could still be a very high real rate of interest, due to the negative inflation rate) in order to artificially increase the money supply.|$|R

This paper shows that the central bank can still implement the Friedman rule if its actions are appropriately constrained in the short run. ...|$|R
