25|$|Before a disk can be accessed, {{the drive}} needs to {{synchronize}} its head {{position with the}} disk tracks. In some drives, this is accomplished with a Track Zero Sensor, while for others it involves the drive head striking an immobile reference surface. In either case, the head is moved {{so that it is}} approaching track <b>zero</b> <b>position</b> of the disk. When a drive with the sensor has reached track zero, the head stops moving immediately and is correctly aligned. For a drive without the sensor, the mechanism attempts to move the head the maximum possible number of positions needed to reach track zero, knowing that once this motion is complete, the head will be positioned over track zero.|$|E

They also fabricated the control rods, which were cadmium sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the scram line, a Manila rope that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction.

2500|$|In his Essay {{towards a}} Real Character and a Philosophical Language, {{published}} in 1668, John Wilkins proposed {{a system of}} measurement that was very similar in concept to today's metric system.

[...] This length, for which he proposed the name [...] "standard", would have been 994mm. [...] His base unit of mass, which he proposed calling a [...] "hundred", would have been the mass of a cubic standard of distilled rainwater. [...] The names that he proposed for decimal multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.|$|E
