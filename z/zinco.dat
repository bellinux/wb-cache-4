50|$|Von Klempt's {{old friend}} and colleague, Kroenen, had placed himself in {{suspended}} animation with Ilsa Haupstein and Leopold Kurtz, two {{other members of the}} Ragna Rok Project. Asleep in a Norwegian castle, they were awoken in 1994 by Roderick <b>Zinco,</b> with the intent of carrying out the deceased Rasputin's agenda. Secretly, Kroenen sent <b>Zinco</b> to Brazil to retrieve von Klempt's head.|$|E
5000|$|Kroenen, Haupstein, and Kurtz {{were frozen}} inside a secret Nazi base, {{until they were}} resuscitated by {{industrialist}} Roderick <b>Zinco,</b> acting on Rasputin's orders. Kroenen resumed work on several of his former projects, including making an [...] "Apocalypse Army" [...] by combining corpses with robotics. He also convinced <b>Zinco</b> to retrieve {{the head of his}} colleague, Herman von Klempt, from South America. Kroenen retained an affection for his colleague, though Rasputin had rejected Klempt as unsuitable for Ragna Rok. When Klempt's head was re-animated, he tried to convince Kroenen to abandon Rasputin's plan to awaken the Ogdru Jahad - and instead to use the Army to retrieve Klempt's work in South America. Overhearing, Kurtz became furious and attacked Klempt's head, screaming, [...] "Rasputin is master!" [...] In a panic, Kroenen seized a knife and killed Kurtz. When their plan failed, an enraged Rasputin struck <b>Zinco,</b> who was blinded. Wandering around, <b>Zinco</b> accidentally pressed a self-destruct button in the base, destroying it completely and taking Kroenen with it.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Zinco</b> or {{photozincography}} {{developed at}} the Ordnance Survey out of a need to reduce large-scale maps more effectively. The original method using a pantograph, was overcomplicated, time consuming and, due {{to the number of}} moving parts, inaccurate. While there was some concern that photography would distort the image, Sir Henry set out to explore the possibility of using photography, setting up a photography department at the Ordnance Survey in 1855 and also securing funds to build the [...] "glasshouse", a photography building with an all glass roof to allow as much natural light in as possible for photography. The development and discovery of photozincography or <b>zinco</b> came about four years later, being first mentioned in Sir Henry's report to Parliament in 1859.|$|E
