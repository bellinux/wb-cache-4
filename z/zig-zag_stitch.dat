Plain seams may also be pressed open, with each seam allowance separately secured with an overlock stitch. Traditional home sewing techniques for finishing plain seams include trimming with pinking shears, oversewing with a <b>zig-zag</b> <b>stitch,</b> and hand or machine overcasting.|$|E
50|$|This {{invention}} {{created a}} way to form a button-hole stitch, or a <b>zig-zag</b> <b>stitch,</b> that when used to close a seam gave strength to the piece. The stitch could be varied in several different ways, such as varying {{the depth of the}} needle. The original sewing machine with this adaptation is currently housed in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.|$|E
50|$|Conventional sail {{panels are}} sewn together. Sails are tensile structures, so {{the role of}} a seam is to {{transmit}} a tensile load from panel to panel. For a sewn textile sail this is done through thread and is limited by the strength of the thread and the strength of the hole in the textile through which it passes. Sail seams are often overlapped between panels and sewn with <b>zig-zag</b> <b>stitches</b> that create many connections per unit of seam length.|$|R

50|$|Kasuti work {{involves}} embroidering very intricate patterns like gopura, chariot, palanquin, {{lamps and}} conch shells. Locally available materials {{are used for}} Kasuti. The pattern to be embroidered is first marked with charcoal or pencil and then proper needles and thread are selected. The work is laborious and involves counting of each thread on the cloth. The patterns are stitched without using knots to ensure that {{both sides of the}} cloth look alike. Different varieties of stitches are employed to obtain the desired pattern. Some of the stitches employed are Ganti, Murgi, Neyge and Menthe. Ganti is a double running stitch used for marking vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines, Murgi is a <b>zig-zag</b> <b>stitch,</b> Neyge is a running stitch and Menthe is a cross stitch resembling fenugreek seeds.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. With the rapid growth and use of wearable devices over the last decade, the advantages of using portable wearable devices are now been utilised {{for day to day}} activities. These wearable devices are designed to be flexible, low profile, light-weight and smoothly integrated into daily life. Wearable transmission lines are required to transport RF signals between various pieces of wearable communication equipment and to connect fabric based antennas to transmitters and receivers; the stitched transmission line is one of the hardware solutions developed to enhance the connectivity between these wearable devices. Textile manufacturing techniques that employ the use of sewing machines alongside conductive textile materials can be used to fabricate the stitched transmission line. In this thesis the feasibility of using a sewing machine in fabrication of a novel stitched transmission line for wearable devices using the idea of a braided coaxial cable have been examined. The sewing machine used is capable of a <b>zig-zag</b> <b>stitch</b> with approximate width and length within the range of 0 - 6 mm and 0 - 4 mm respectively. The inner conductor and the tubular insulated layer of the stitched transmission lines were selected as RG 174, while the stitched shields were made up of copper wires and conductive threads from Light Stiches®. For shielding purpose, the structure is stitched onto a denim material with a conductive thread {{with the aid of a}} novel manufacturing technique using a standard hardware. The Scattering Parameters of the stitched transmission line were investigated with three different stitch angles 85 °, 65 ° and 31 ° through simulation and experiments, with the results demonstrating that the stitched transmission line can work usefully and consistently from 0. 04 1 ̆d 4611 ̆d 45 c 41 ̆d 43 a 1 ̆d 43 b 1 ̆d 467. The extracted Scattering parameters indicated a decrease in DC loss with increased stitch angle and an increase in radiation loses, which tends to increase with increase in frequency. The proposed stitched transmission line makes a viable transmission line but a short stitch length is associated with larger losses through resistance. The DC losses observed are mainly influenced by the resistance of the conductive threads at lower frequencies while the radiation losses are influenced by the wider apertures related to the stitch angles and increase in frequency along the line. The performances of the stitched transmission line with different stitch patterns, when subjected to washing cycles and when bent through curved angles 90 ° and 180 ° were also investigated and results presented. ii Also, the sensitivity of the design to manufacturing tolerances was also considered. First the behaviour of the stitched transmission line with two different substrates Denim and Felt were investigated with the results indicating an insignificant increase in losses with the Denim material. Secondly, the sensitivity of the design with variations in cross section dimensions was investigated using numerical modelling techniques and the results showed that the impedance of the stitched transmission line increases when the cross sectional dimensions are decreased by 0. 401 ̆d 45 a 1 ̆d 45 a and decreases when the cross sectional dimensions are increased by 0. 401 ̆d 45 a 1 ̆d 45 a. Equally, repeatability of the stitched transmission line with three different stitch angles 85 °, 65 ° and 31 ° were carried out. The results were seen to be consistent up to 2. 51 ̆d 43 a 1 ̆d 43 b 1 ̆d 467, with slight deviations above that, which are mainly as a result of multiple reflections along the line resulting in loss ripples. The DC resistance of the stitched transmission line with three different stitch angles 85 °, 65 ° and 31 ° corresponding to the number of stitches 60, 90 and 162 were computed and a mathematical relationship was derived for computing the DC resistance of the stitch transmission line for any given number of stitches. The DC resistance computed results of 25. 6 Ω, 17. 3 Ω and 13. 1 Ω, for 31 °, 65 ° and 85 ° stitch angles, indicated an increase in DC resistance of the stitch with decrease in stitch angle which gives rise to an increase in number of stitches. The transfer impedance of the stitched transmission line was also computed at low frequency (< 11 ̆d 43 a 1 ̆d 43 b 1 ̆d 467) to be 1 ̆d 44 d 1 ̆d 447 =(0. 24 + 1 ̆d 4571. 09) Ω, with the result showing the effectiveness of the shield of the stitched transmission line at low frequency (< 11 ̆d 43 a 1 ̆d 43 b 1 ̆d 467...|$|E
