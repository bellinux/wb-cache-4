2500|$|The pterygopalatine ganglia are ganglia (one on each side) of {{the soft}} palate. The greater petrosal, lesser palatine [...] and <b>{{zygomatic}}</b> <b>nerves</b> all synapse here. The greater petrosal, carries soft palate taste signals to the facial nerve. The lesser palatine sends signals to the nasal cavity; which is why spicy foods cause nasal drip. The zygomatic sends signals to the lacrimal nerve that activate the lacrimal gland; which {{is the reason that}} spicy foods can cause tears. Both the lesser palatine and the <b>zygomatic</b> are maxillary <b>nerves</b> (from the trigeminal nerve).|$|R
50|$|As for {{innervation}} of this structure, {{the associated}} nerve branches were all found to originate from the facial (CN VII of XII) nerve which initiates at the medulla and passes into the facial canal via the stylomastoid foramen. The primary aforementioned muscle, the masseter, is supplied by two large neural branches {{known as the}} temporalis and <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerves.</b> The buccal divisions of this nerve supply much of the masseter muscle, which ultimately facilitates the voluntary retention of food within the cheek pouch.|$|R
40|$|The {{communication}} between the auriculotemporal and the facial nerves, i. e. the communicating auriculotemporal nerves (CATN), was studied in 55 facial sides from Thai cadavers. CATN only joined the temporofacial (upper) division of the facial nerve. CATN patterns were classified as follows: (1) the facial nerve was joined by 1 CATN (20. 7 %), (2) by 2 separate CATN branches (60. 4 %), (3) by 3 separate CATNs (15. 1 %); (4) several CATNs ran parallel to the <b>zygomatic</b> and buccal <b>nerves</b> to the muscles of facial expression (3. 8 %). The 4 types of CATN pattern showed further variations according {{to the site of}} union with the facial nerve. The superficial temporal artery was crossed by CATN branches anteriorly in 47. 1 %, posteriorly in 18. 9 %, and anteriorly and posteriorly in 34. 0 % of the cases. The facial nerve branches that were joined by CATNs were observed to supply the upper muscles of facial expression, i. e. frontalis, orbicularis oculi and zygomaticus major. Some offshoots from CATNs were seen to innervate orbicularis oculi. On the basis of our results we suggest that CATNs may convey proprioceptive impulses from orbicularis oculi...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the orbit}} it {{runs along the}} upper border of the lateral rectus, with the {{lacrimal}} artery, and communicates with the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve,</b> {{a branch of the}} maxillary nerve.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>{{zygomatic}}</b> <b>nerve</b> (temporomalar nerve; orbital nerve) is {{a branch}} of the maxillary nerve (CN V2, itself {{a branch of}} the trigeminal nerve) that enters the orbit and helps to supply the skin over the zygomatic and temporal bones.|$|E
50|$|The orbital surface {{forms the}} lateral part {{and some of}} the {{inferior}} part of the bony orbit. The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> passes through the zygomatic-orbital foramen on this surface. The lateral palpebral ligament attaches to a small protuberance called the orbital tubercle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> carries sensory fibers {{from the}} skin and mucous membranes. It also carries post-synaptic {{parasympathetic}} fibers (originating in the pterygopalatine ganglion) to the lacrimal nerve via a communication. These fibers will eventually provide innervation to the lacrimal gland.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> {{arises in}} the pterygopalatine fossa. It enters the orbit by the {{inferior}} orbital fissure, and divides {{at the back}} of that cavity into two branches, the zygomaticotemporal nerve and zygomaticofacial nerve, which exit the orbit using identically named foramen.|$|E
50|$|The {{zygomatic}}ofacial nerve or zygomaticofacial {{branch of}} <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> (malar branch) passes along the infero-lateral {{angle of the}} orbit, emerges upon the face through the zygomaticofacial foramen in the zygomatic bone, and, perforating the orbicularis oculi to reach {{the skin of the}} malar area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> carries sensory fibers {{from the}} skin. It also carries post-synaptic {{parasympathetic}} fibers (originating in the pterygopalatine ganglion) to the lacrimal nerve via a communication. These fibers will eventually provide innervation to the lacrimal gland. These parasympathetic preganglionic fibers {{come from the}} facial nerve (CN VII).|$|E
50|$|The {{zygomatic}}otemporal nerve or zygomaticotemporal branch (temporal branch) {{is a small}} {{nerve in}} the face. It {{is derived from the}} <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve,</b> a branch of the maxillary nerve. It runs along the lateral wall of the orbit in a groove in the zygomatic bone, receives a branch of communication from the lacrimal nerve, and passes through the zygomaticotemporal foramen in the zygomatic bone to enter the temporal fossa.|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} salivatory nucleus {{contains the}} cell bodies of parasympathetic axons within the intermediate nerve. These fibers reach the geniculate ganglion {{but do not}} synapse. Some of these preganglionic parasympathetic fibers persist within the greater petrosal nerve as they exit the geniculate ganglion and subsequently synapse with neurons in the pterygopalatine ganglion. These postganglionic neurons send axons that provide parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland via a communicating branch from <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> to lacrimal nerve of CN V.|$|E
50|$|In the pterygopalatine ganglion, the preganglionic {{parasympathetic}} fibers {{from the}} greater petrosal {{branch of the}} facial nerve synapse with neurons whose postganglionic axons, vasodilator, and secretory fibers are distributed with the deep branches of the trigeminal nerve to the mucous membrane of the nose, soft palate, tonsils, uvula, roof of the mouth, upper lip and gums, and upper part of the pharynx. It also sends postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal nerve (a branch of the Ophthalmic nerve, also part of the trigeminal nerve) via the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve,</b> a branch of the maxillary nerve (from the trigeminal nerve), which then arrives at the lacrimal gland.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasympathetic}} nerve supply originates {{from the}} lacrimatory {{nucleus of the}} facial nerve in the pons. From the pons nucleus preganglionic parasympathetic fibres run in the nervus intermedius (small sensory root of facial nerve) to the geniculate ganglion but they do not synapse there. Then, from the geniculate ganglion, the preganglionic fibres run in the greater petrosal nerve (a branch {{of the facial nerve}}) which carries the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers through the foramen lacerum, where it joins the deep petrosal nerve (which contains postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal (vidian nerve) which then traverses through the pterygoid canal to the pterygopalatine ganglion. Here, the fibers synapse and postganglionic fibers join the fibers of the maxillary nerve. In the pterygopalatine fossa itself, the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers branch off with the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> and then branch off again, joining with the lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic division of CN V, which supplies sensory innervation to the lacrimal gland along with the eyelid and conjunctiva.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To obtain {{anatomical}} data of maxillary-zygomatic complex {{based on}} simulating the zygomatic implantation using cadaver heads and three-dimensional computerized tomography (3 D-CT). Methods. Simulating zygomatic implantation was performed using seven cadaver heads and 3 D-CT images from forty-eight adults. After measuring the maxillary-zygomatic complex, we analyzed the position between the implantation path and the maxillary sinus cavity {{as well as}} the distance between the implantation path and the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve.</b> Results. The distance from the starting point to the endpoint of the implant was 56. 85 ± 5. 35 [*]mm in cadaver heads and 58. 15 ± 7. 37 [*]mm in 3 D-CT images. For the most common implantation path (80. 20 %), the implant went through the maxillary sinus cavity completely. The projecting points of the implant axis (IA) on the surface of zygoma were mainly located in the region of frontal process of zygomatic bone close to the lateral orbital wall. The distances between IA and <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> in 53 sides were shorter than 2 [*]mm. Conclusion. The simulating zygomatic implantation on cadaver skulls and 3 D-CT imaging provided useful anatomical data of the maxillary-zygomatic complex. It is necessary to take care to avoid the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> injury during implantation, because it frequently appears on the route of implantation...|$|E
40|$|The human orbit {{communicates}} {{with the}} middle cranial fossa through several canals and openings. Some of them (optic canal, superior orbital fissure) are constant, others (meningo-orbital foramen, Warwick's foramen, metoptic canal) are less frequent. Here we report a rare variation of the foramen rotundum which, opening into the orbit with a branching canal, represented a further connecting pathway between the orbit and the middle cranial fossa. Such variation was detected in about 1. 06 % of individuals {{and it was almost}} always located on the right side. Only in one cases it could be found left-sided and in another skull it was spotted bilaterally. The vari- ation consisted of the branching of a 5 mm long canal from the lateral wall of the foramen rotun- dum that opened into the orbit. In general the diameter of the canal was comprised between 0. 5 and 0. 6 mm but it could be as large as 1 mm or as thin as 0. 2 mm. The canal, straight and directed slightly superolaterally, likely transmitted the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>nerve</b> and/or part of the infraorbital nerve. To our knowledge, an independent entrance through a dedicated canal of such nerves has never been reported. The surgeons operating in this region, either neurosurgeons or ophthalmologists, {{should be aware of the}} possible variation in the course of these nerves...|$|E
