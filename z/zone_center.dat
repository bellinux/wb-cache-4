It's located at about 290 kilometers away from Belo Horizonte, the state's capital. According to the map of urban hierarchy produced by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, Três Pontas is classified as a B <b>zone</b> <b>center,</b> that means the city has a restricted influence, only over the smaller cities around it. The city is under influence of Varginha that, on the other hand, is under influence of Belo Horizonte.|$|E
25|$|Optical phonons have a non-zero {{frequency}} at the Brillouin <b>zone</b> <b>center</b> {{and show}} no dispersion near that long wavelength limit. This {{is because they}} correspond to a mode of vibration where positive and negative ions at adjacent lattice sites swing against each other, creating a time-varying electrical dipole moment. Optical phonons that interact in this way with light are called infrared active. Optical phonons that are Raman active can also interact indirectly with light, through Raman scattering. Optical phonons are often abbreviated as LO and TO phonons, for the longitudinal and transverse modes respectively; the splitting between LO and TO frequencies is often described accurately by the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation.|$|E

25|$|Astronomers use stellar flux and the inverse-square law to {{extrapolate}} circumstellar habitable zone models {{created for the}} Solar System to other stars. For example, although the Solar System has a circumstellar habitable <b>zone</b> <b>centered</b> at 1.34 AU from the Sun, a star with 0.25 times the luminosity of the Sun would have a habitable <b>zone</b> <b>centered</b> at , or 0.5, {{the distance from the}} star, corresponding to a distance of 0.67 AU. Various complicating factors, though, including the individual characteristics of stars themselves, mean that extrasolar extrapolation of the CHZ concept is more complex.|$|R
