40|$|Multipulse {{rectifiers}} are recently used in {{ac-dc converter}} to minimize line current distortion due to harmonics. Analysis of the {{input and output}} ac-dc converter has been done with the tendency {{that the number of}} pulse rectifier most will have a value THD (total harmonic distortion) line current is the smallest and has the greatest power factor. In this study the authors will design and transformers 3 -phase make with primary in delta connection and secondary in <b>zigzag</b> <b>connection</b> to produce 12 phases voltage wave, each phase of phase 150. The next phase will output 12 is connected as the input of a 24 -pulse rectifier, which consists of 4 units of 3 -phase rectifier bridge connection that are arranged in series. Calculation of results rectifier current THD, indicates THD 24 -pulse rectifier is lower than the 6 -pulse rectifier, THD 24 -pulse rectifier currents of 1. 41 % while the 6 -pulse rectifier amounted to 3. 61 %...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFour {{full-scale}} (3 m× 3 m) confined {{masonry wall}} specimens that represented simple house wall panels in Indonesia {{were subjected to}} cyclic in-plane lateral load. The construction of the specimens, including reinforcement assemblies, concreting, and brick-laying, followed the common construction practice in Indonesia. A specimen with no anchorage between {{the wall and the}} reinforced concrete frame was chosen as a benchmark model. The other specimens were varied in the details of wall-frame connection, i. e. zigzag (toothing) connection, short anchor between column and wall, and continuous anchorage from column to column. The models were then subjected to cyclic in-plane lateral loads, which represents earthquake loads, with increasing amplitude until collapsed. The behavior of these specimens was then evaluated and compared. The parameters evaluated were crack patterns and failure mechanism of the wall panel, loading capacity, and energy dissipation. The study revealed that <b>zigzag</b> <b>connection</b> and short anchor did not improve the performance of the confined masonry wall; instead {{they were more likely to}} reduce the performance of the wall. Cracks and failures of the two specimens were initiated by vertical crack on the face of the wall-frame connection, which then reduced the confinement of the wall. Therefore, the final failure mode followed sliding shear patterns on the bed joint of brick-mortar, which produced more brittle failure. Conversely, continuous anchorage strengthened the confinement, thus the diagonal crack patterns were observed on the wall and the strut and tie mechanism between the wall and the confining column was developed. Therefore, this specimen shows more ductile behavior as well as higher lateral load capacity. In conclusion, the study shows that installing proper wall-frame connection strategies is crucial in improving the structural performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{striated muscle}} Z-band connects actin filaments of opposite polarity from adjacent sarcomeres and allows tension to be transmitted along a myofibril during contraction. Z-bands in different muscles have a modular structure formed by layers of a-actinin molecules cross-linking actin filaments. Successive layers occur at 19 nm intervals and have 908 rotations between them. 3 D reconstruction from electron micrographs show a two-layer “simple ” Z-band in fish body fast muscle, a three-layer Z-band in fish fin fast muscle, and a six-layer Z-band in mammalian slow muscle. Related {{to the number}} of these layers, longitudinal sections of the Z-band show a number of <b>zigzag</b> <b>connections</b> between the oppositely oriented actin filaments. The number of layers also determines the axial width of the Z-band, which is a useful indicator of fibre type; fast fibres have narrow (, 30 – 50 nm) Z-bands; slow and cardiac fibres have wide (, 100 – 140 nm) Z-bands. Here, we report the first observation of two different Z-band widths within a single sarcomere. By comparison with previous studies, the narrower Z-band comprises three layers. Since the increase in width of the wider Z-band is about 19 nm, we conclude that it comprises four layers. This finding is consistent with a Z-band assembly model involving molecular control mechanisms that can add additional layers of 19 nm periodicity. These multiple Z-band structures suggest that different isoforms of nebulin and titin with a variable number of Z-repeats could be present within a single sarcomere...|$|R
5000|$|A zigzag {{transformer}} is a special-purpose transformer with a zigzag or [...] "interconnected star" [...] winding connection, {{such that}} each output is the vector sum of two (2) phases offset by 120°. Its applications {{are for the}} creation of a missing neutral connection from an ungrounded 3-phase system to permit the grounding of that neutral to an earth reference point and also harmonic mitigation, as it can suppress triplet (3rd, 9th, 15th, 21st, etc.) harmonic currents, to supply 3-phase power as an autotransformer (serving as the primary and secondary with no isolated circuits), and to supply non-standard, phase-shifted, 3-phase power.Nine-winding, three-phase transformers typically have 3 primaries and 6 identical secondary windings, which can be used in <b>zigzag</b> winding <b>connection</b> as pictured. As with the conventional delta or wye winding configuration three-phase transformer, a standard, stand-alone transformer containing only six windings on three cores can also be used in <b>zigzag</b> winding <b>connection,</b> such transformer sometimes being referred to as a zigzag bank. In all cases, six or nine winding, the first coil on each zigzag winding core is connected contrariwise to the second coil on the next core. The second coils are then all tied together to form the neutral, and the phases are connected to the primary coils. Each phase, therefore, couples with each other phase, and the voltages cancel out. As such, there would be negligible current through the neutral point, which can be tied to ground.|$|R
