Voor het lokaliseren van tumoren, verborgen aders en venen, of de kwaliteitscontrole van een steek, baseren de chirurgen zich voornamelijk op de stijfheid van het w eefsel. Dit werk integreert de karakteristieken van de menselijke perceptie van stijfheid in het ontwerpproces van de teleoperatiecontrole. Bij gebruik van traditionele controleschemas limiteert de wrijving in de medische r obot de kwaliteit van de krachtterugkoppeling. Een combinatie van het online schatten van de omgevingsstijfheid met een directe weergave van deze stijfheid in de haptische interface is ontwik keld. Deze techniek ontkoppelt de controle voor het uitvoeren van de taa k van de terugkoppeling van de informatie. De regelaars van de medische robot en de haptische interface kunnen onafhankelijk van elkaar worden o ntwikkeld, wat resulteert in verhoogde stabiliteit en positienauwkeurigh eid. De wrijving in de medische robot heeft bij gebruik van deze technie k geen invloed meer op de teruggekoppelde stijfheid. Dit werk introduceert verder het concept van verhoogde gevoeligheid voor het discrimineren van stijfheidsverschillen. Met het telechirurgisch sy steem kan de chirurg zo kleinere stijfheidsverschillen detecteren dan me t de blote hand. Deze techniek verhoogt de nauwkeurigheid en biedt een h oger zekerheidsniveau bij palpatie. Een experiment met directe weergave van de stijfheid in de haptische interface, gecombineerd met het online vormen van het gewenste gevoel, toont de technische haalbaarheid aan.

40|$|Image {{registration}} {{is a process}} of matching images, which are taken at different times, from different sensors or from different view points. It is an important step for a great variety of applications such as computer vision, stereo navigation, medical image analysis, pattern recognition and watermarking applications. In this paper an improved feature point selection and matching technique for image {{registration is}} proposed. This technique is based on the ability of Nonsubsampled Contourlet Transform (NSCT) to extract significant features irrespective of feature orientation. Then the correspondence between the extracted feature points of reference image and sensed image is achieved using Zernike moments. Feature point pairs are used for estimating the transformation parameters mapping the sensed image to the reference image. Experimental results illustrate the registration accuracy over a wide range for panning and <b>zooming</b> <b>movement</b> and also the robustness of the proposed algorithm to noise.

40|$|AbstractÐIn this paper, a new {{variable}} resolution technique±Foveate Wavelet Transform (FWT) {{is proposed}} to represent digital images {{in an effort}} to efficiently represent visual data. Compared to existing variable resolution techniques, the strength of the proposed scheme encompasses its linearity preservation, orientation selectivity, and flexibility while supporting interesting behaviors resembling the animate vision system. The linearity preservation of the FWT {{is due to the fact}} that only low and/or high-pass filterings are carried out in different regions of an image in the transform. The orientation selectivity indicates the fact that details along the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions are readily available in the FWT representation. The flexibility of this new representation technique is witnessed by the readiness of its extensions to represent foveae of different number, shape, and locations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the FWT, two applications are presented. First, an FWT-based active camera control scheme is developed, where the computer can move a camera to track the moving object in the scene. Second, an FWT-based method purporting to recover pan/tilt/ <b>zoom</b> camera <b>movements</b> from video clips is developed. Experiments of these two applications have shown encouraging performances.

40|$|A small {{camera system}} is {{described}} for remote viewing applications that employs fisheye optics and electronics processing for providing pan, tilt, <b>zoom,</b> and rotational <b>movements.</b> The fisheye lens {{is designed to}} give a complete hemispherical FOV with significant peripheral distortion that is corrected with high-speed electronic circuitry. Flexible control of the viewing requirements is provided by a programmable transformation processor so that pan/tilt/rotation/zoom functions can be accomplished without mechanical movements. Images are presented that were taken with a prototype system using a CCD camera, and 5 frames/sec can be acquired from a 180 -deg FOV. The image-tranformation device can provide multiple images with different magnifications and pan/tilt/rotation sequences at frame rates compatible with conventional video devices.

40|$|AbstractA {{robotic system}} was {{designed}} and developed to perform the camera handling task during laparoscopic surgery. The system employs an effective low cost mechanism, with a minimum number of actuated DOFs, enabling spherical movement around a remote centre of motion positioned at the the insertion point of the laparoscopic stem. Kinematic analysis showed a high manipulability measure for the system, with the left/right movements directly governed by rotation of the first rotary actuator, and <b>zoom</b> and up/down <b>movements</b> by the simultaneous motions of the linear and second rotary actuators. A prototype of the robot was developed for practical use in an operating room environment. Hands-free operator interfaces were implemented for user control, including a voice command recognition system and a smart 6 -button foot pedal. The technical and operational features of the system were evaluated using experimental examinations and then during clinical trials of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on human subjects. Results indicated a high trajectory following accuracy, low response time, sufficiently large workspace for surgeon and assistants, and a stable and properly oriented image. The system {{was found to be}} easy to set up and use, and contributed to a faster and more accurate surgical operation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{advances}} {{in information technology}} have allowed {{the development of a}} telepathology system involving high-speed transfer of high-volume histological figures via fiber optic landlines. However, at present there are geographical limits to landlines. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has developed the "Kizuna" ultra-high speed internet satellite and has pursued its various applications. In this study we experimented with telepathology in collaboration with JAXA using Kizuna. To measure the functionality of the Wideband InterNet working engineering test and Demonstration Satellite (WINDS) ultra-high speed internet satellite in remote pathological diagnosis and consultation, we examined the adequate data transfer speed and stability to conduct telepathology (both diagnosis and conferencing) with functionality, and ease similar or equal to telepathology using fiber-optic landlines. Materials and Methods: We performed experiments for 2 years. In year 1, we tested the usability of the WINDS for telepathology with real-time video and virtual slide systems. These are state-of-the-art technologies requiring massive volumes of data transfer. In year 2, we tested the usability of the WINDS for three-way teleconferencing with virtual slides. Facilities in Iwate (northern Japan), Tokyo, and Okinawa were connected via the WINDS and voice conferenced while remotely examining and manipulating virtual slides. Results: Network function parameters measured using ping and Iperf were within acceptable limits. However; stage <b>movement,</b> <b>zoom,</b> and conversation suffered a lag of approximately 0. 8 s when using real-time video, and a delay of 60 - 90 s was experienced when accessing the first virtual slide in a session. No significant lag or inconvenience was experienced during diagnosis and conferencing, and the results were satisfactory. Our hypothesis was confirmed for both remote diagnosis using real-time video and virtual slide systems, and also for teleconferencing using virtual slide systems with voice functionality. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of ultra-high-speed internet satellite networks for use in telepathology. Because communications satellites have less geographical and infrastructural requirements than landlines, ultra-high-speed internet satellite telepathology represents a major step toward alleviating regional disparity in the quality of medical care...|$|R
