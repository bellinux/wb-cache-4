40|$|The {{differential}} {{behavior of}} five different quaternary mono- and diammonium salts, among the 18 investigated, in modulating the electroendoosmotic flow (EOF) and analyte separations in capillary zone electrophoresis is evaluated. It is found that quaternary diammonium salts with positive charges separated {{by more than}} four carbon atoms, while exhibiting a very strong affinity for chromatographic silica beads, {{to the point of}} exhibiting Rf values close to <b>zero,</b> <b>display,</b> on the contrary, a very poor affinity for the silica wall of capillaries. Compounds separated only by a C 2 unit (i. e., 1, 4 -dialkyl- 1, 4 -diazoniabicyclo[2, 2, 2,]octane, salts 17 and 18) show high Rf values due to strong ion pair association. The unique behavior of quaternary monoammonium salts possessing an iodinated alkyl (butyl or octyl) tail (i. e., 1, 6, and 7) is attributed to their ability to be covalently affixed to the silica wall via alkylation of ionized silanols at alkaline pH values. They thus strongly modulate and typically invert the EOF, even when not present in the background electrolyte. On the contrary, all diammonium salts, devoid of such alkyl tails, are unable to modulate the EOF and to prevent analyte binding to the silica wall, since they are rapidly removed from the wall by the voltage gradient. However, if added in small amount to the background electrolyte, they offer excellent separations of mixtures of very similar organic acids and prevent any interaction with the capillary wal...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a tensiometric method {{for determining the}} adsorption isotherm of an oil on a surfactant monolayer adsorbed at the air-water surface. The method involves measuring the surface pressure of oil, π(oil), {{as a function of}} its activity, a(oil), varied by changing the relative vapour pressure. We compare the isotherm of dodecane adsorption onto a C 12 E 5 monolayer determined in this way with that measured directly using neutron reflectivity. The agreement between the two allows us to conclude that, at least for this system, addition of oil does not result in a change in the chemical potential of the surfactant. Structural analysis of the dodecane + C 12 E 5 mixed film has been performed with neutron reflectivity using two contrasts. In one, only the surfactant chain region is highlighted, whilst in the other only the oil film is visible. We document, for the first time, changes in thickness and packing density of both the oil and surfactant chains in the mixed surfactant + oil layer upon increasing oil content. For a diverse range of other oil + surfactant systems, we have determined the initial (S(i)) and equilibrium (S(e)) spreading coefficients of oil by measuring π(oil) following addition of liquid oil (at unit activity) to surfactant solution surfaces. Those systems in which S(e) is close to <b>zero</b> <b>display</b> a repulsive van der Waals component of the disjoining pressure-oil film thickness isotherm, whilst with toluene as oil the calculated isotherm is attractive, consistent with non-spreading observed for this oil...|$|E
40|$|The first Chapter is an {{introduction}} to neurotraumatology. The incidence of severe head injury, and its financial burden to society is described. General information is provided on the currently used monitoring modalities in patients with severe head injury. Finally a description is given of the polarographic monitoring method for measuring oxygen tension in brain tissue (PbrO 2) used in our studies. The study questions are specified focussing on clinical applicability of PbrO 2 measurements in TBI and interpretation of findings. In Chapter 2 preliminary experience with brain tissue PO 2 (PbrO 2) monitoring {{in a group of}} 22 patients with a severe head injury is described. PbrO 2 was measured with a polarographic microcatheter. For introduction of the catheter a specially devised intracranial bolt was used. Measurements started as soon as possible after the injury and the study protocol specified an observation period of a maximum of 120 hours post trauma. The rationale for this time period was that during the initial period after trauma low Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) values have been reported with Xe CT studies, and that vasospasm mostly occurs before day 5 after injury. Both potential ischemic phenomena are covered by the observation period chosen. During the observation period two provocation tests were included in the study protocol performed on a dayly basis. Firstly, an O 2 provocation test, by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen stepwise to 1. 0, and secondly a carbon dioxide reactivity test performed by increasing the respiratory minute volume of the patient by 20 %. The observation period was preliminary terminated by early death or if clinical improvement of the patient occurred to an extent that ICP monitoring was no longer considered necessary. PbrO 2 monitoring was started on average 7. 0 hours after trauma with a mean duration of 74. 3 hours. The chapter provides an extensive description of all phenomena observed. No complications were seen related to the PbrO 2 catheter. The catheters showed a <b>zero</b> <b>display</b> error of 1. 2 ± 0. 8 mmHg and a sensitivity drift of 9. 7 ± 5. 3 % after the measurement period. The first approach to analyse the PbrO 2 value was to average all PO 2 values according to the time after injury. Using this method of analysis we observed low average values during the initial 24 hours after injury, increasing toward a peak value during the second 24 hours reaching a plateau value after 36 - 48 hours after injury. Beyond this time period mean PbrO 2 showed no further changes...|$|E

Phase drifts {{between the}} transmitters 12 klystrons of greater than 0. 5 degree or any amplitude drifts compromise beam delivery {{and are a}} common occurrence. Machine operators in years previous to the Phase and Amplitude Monitoring system "PAM" were unable to tell which klystron was affecting beam and resorted to shifting the phases of each klystron experimentally. The PAM system has proven itself as a viable monitor, easing phase re-adjustment. PAM is comprised of off-the-shelf RF amplitude and phase detectors, phase shifters, splitters, and VME hardware under EPICS. The detected signals are amplified and matrixed to the control room via an EPICS driven custom video switch, are sample/held, then digitized by a VME 12 bit ADC.
