40|$|Alpha <b>zearalenol</b> is a derivative of the {{mycotoxin}} zearalenone, {{which is}} {{commonly found in}} agricultural crops and commercial feed. It is a secondary metabolite of filamentous fungi of the genus Fusarium. The alpha <b>zearalenol</b> {{is the result of}} a biotransformation of zearalenone in the liver and intestinal tissue. When the zearalenone is metobolised this way, it is able to compete for the binding sites of estrogen receptors because the structure is very similar to 17 beta estradiol. Toxicity of alpha <b>zearalenol</b> therefore lies in an estrogenic stimulation, which induces morphological and functional changes in the reproductive organs and gametes. Toxicity is manifested on the male gamete by reducing viability, motility and the portion of sperms capable of undergoing acrosome reaction. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of alpha <b>zearalenol</b> on the hyperactivation and acrosome reaction of boar sperm depending on the concentration and duration of exposure to mycotoxins. For the purposes of this study we used two methodologies and the short term chilled commercial insemination doses which were kept in a box with the temperature of 17 degrees of Celsius. The two methodologies had a different count of used concentrations of alpha <b>zearalenol</b> and exposure time. Acrosome reaction of sperms was assessed in both methodologies, while the share of hyperactive sperm was assessed only in the second methodology.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that low doses (somewhat above the No Observed Adverse Effect Level, NOAEL) of the mycoestrogen zearalenone (ZEN) and its metabolites display multispecificity towards various biological targets in gilts. The observed responses in gilts were surprising. The presence of ZEN and <b>zearalenols</b> (ZELs) did not evoke a {{response in the}} porcine gastrointestinal tract, which was attributed to dietary tolerance. Lymphocyte proliferation was intensified in jejunal mesenteric lymph nodes, and lymphocyte counts increased in the jejunal epithelium with time of exposure. In the distal digestive tract, fecal bacterial counts decreased, the activity of fecal bacterial enzymes and lactic acid bacteria increased, and cecal water was characterized by higher genotoxicity. The accompanying hyperestrogenism led to changes in mRNA activity of selected enzymes (cytochrome P 450, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, nitric oxide synthases) and receptors (estrogen and progesterone receptors), and it stimulated post-translational modifications which {{play an important role}} in non-genomic mechanisms of signal transmission. Hyperestrogenism influences the regulation of the host’s steroid hormones (estron, estradiol and progesteron), it affects the virulence of bacterial genes encoding bacterial hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs), and it participates in detoxification processes by slowing down intestinal activity, provoking energy deficits and promoting antiporter activity at the level of enterocytes. In most cases, hyperestrogenism fulfils all of the above roles. The results of this study indicate that low doses of ZEN alleviate inflammatory processes in the digestive system, in particular in the proximal and distal intestinal tract, and increase body weight gains in gilts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the in vitro effects of the Fusarium fungus-derived mycotoxin, zearalenone and its derivatives alpha-zearalenol and beta-zearalenol on motility parameters and the acrosome reaction of stallion sperm. Since the toxic effects of zearalenone and its derivatives are thought to result from their structural similarity to 17 beta-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol was used as a positive control for 'estrogen-like' effects. Methods Stallion spermatozoa were exposed in vitro to zearalenone, alpha-zearalenol, beta-zearalenol or 17 beta-estradiol at concentrations ranging from 1 pM - 0. 1 mM. After 2 hours exposure, motility parameters were evaluated by computer-assisted analysis, and acrosome integrity was examined by flow cytometry after staining with fluoroscein-conjugated peanut agglutinin. Results Mycotoxins affected sperm parameters only at the highest concentration tested (0. 1 mM) after 2 hours exposure. In this respect, all of the compounds reduced the average path velocity, but only alpha-zearalenol reduced percentages of motile and progressively motile sperm. Induction of motility patterns consistent with hyperactivation was stimulated according to the following rank of potency: alpha-zearalenol > 17 beta-estradiol > zearalenone = beta-zearalenol. The hyperactivity-associated changes observed included reductions in straight-line velocity and linearity of movement, and an increase in the amplitude of lateral head displacement, while curvilinear velocity was unchanged. In addition, whereas alpha- and beta- <b>zearalenol</b> increased the percentages of live acrosome-reacted sperm, zearalenone and 17 beta-estradiol had no apparent effect on acrosome status. In short, alpha-zearalenol inhibited normal sperm motility, but stimulated hyperactive motility in the remaining motile cells and simultaneously induced the acrosome reaction. Beta-zearalenol induced the acrosome reaction without altering motility. Conversely, zearalenone and 17 beta-estradiol did not induce the acrosome reaction but induced hyperactive motility albeit to a different extent. Conclusions Apparently, the mycotoxin zearalenone has 17 beta-estradiol-like estrogenic activity that enables it to induce hyperactivated motility of equine sperm cells, whereas the <b>zearalenol</b> derivatives induce premature completion of the acrosome reaction and thereby adversely affect stallion sperm physiology. The alpha form of <b>zearalenol</b> still possessed the estrogenic ability to induce hyperactivated motility, whereas its beta stereo-isomere had lost this property. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{describe}} a new method for modeling protein and ligand main-chain flexibility, and show {{its ability to}} model flexible molecular recognition. The goal is to sample the full conformational space, including large-scale motions that typically cannot be reached in molecular dynamics simulations due to the computational intensity, as well as conformations {{that have not been}} observed yet by crystallography or NMR. A secondary goal is to assess the degree of flexibility consistent with protein–ligand recognition. Flexibility analysis of the target protein is performed using the graph-theoretic algorithm FIRST, which also identifies coupled networks of covalent and noncovalent bonds within the protein. The available conformations of the flexible regions are then explored with ROCK by random-walk sampling of the rotatable bonds. ROCK explores correlated motions by only sampling dihedral angles that preserve the coupled bond networks in the protein and generates conformers with good stereochemistry, without using a computationally expensive potential function. A representative set of the conformational ensemble generated this way can be used as targets for docking with SLIDE, which handles the flexibility of protein and ligand side-chains. The realism of this protein main-chain conformational sampling is assessed by comparison with time-resolved NMR studies of cyclophilin A motions. ROCK is also effective for modeling the flexibility of large cyclic and polycyclic ligands, as demonstrated for cyclosporin and <b>zearalenol.</b> The use of this combined approach to perform docking with main-chain flexibility is illustrated for the cyclophilin A–cyclosporin complex and the estrogen receptor in complex with <b>zearalenol,</b> while addressing the question of how much flexibility is allowed without hindering molecular recognition...|$|E

The approach presented here can be used for the elucidation of the metabolism of other endocrine disrupting compounds and xenobiotics to get clear pictures of the total effects of these compounds and their metabolites. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of mycotoxins in brewing materials and beer. Attention was devoted mainly to the selected fusarium mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol, <b>zearalenol,</b> T- 2 toxin, and HT- 2 toxin) ochratoxin A and aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2. The aim of the thesis was to optimize and validate analytical methods for the determination of the above mentioned mycotoxins in the brewing materials and beer. Analytes were separated using high-performance liquid chromatography with mass – spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (UPLC/FLR). These analytical methods were then applied for mapping the occurrence of fusarium mycotoxins in malting barley crops in the Czech Republic and monitoring the level of contamination with mycotoxins in malting and brewing industries. In addition, experiments studying over-foaming of beer were conducted as primary gushing – over-foaming of beer – is connected, similarly as mycotoxins, with the presence of microscopic filamentous fungi in the raw materials for beer production. Studies describing in detail these methods are part of this thesis (Annex I – V). From all published results, it is evident that the occurrence of mycotoxins in cereals including barley is natural and cannot be completely prevented, not even if all conditions of correct agricultural practice are observed. It is known that some mycotoxins present in contaminated malting barley pass to the final product – beer due to their chemical and physical properties. However, the mycotoxin concentrations found do not mean any significant health risk for consumers...|$|E
40|$|Zearalenone (ZEA), a fungal mycotoxin, and its {{metabolite}} zeranol (ZAL) {{are known}} estrogen agonists in mammals, and are found as contaminants in food. Zeranol, {{which is more}} potent than ZEA and comparable in potency to estradiol, is also added as a growth additive in beef in the US and Canada. This article presents the development and application of a Physiologically-Based Toxicokinetic (PBTK) model for ZEA and ZAL and their primary metabolites, <b>zearalenol,</b> zearalanone, and their conjugated glucuronides, for rats and for human subjects. The PBTK modeling study explicitly simulates critical metabolic pathways in the gastrointestinal and hepatic systems. Metabolic events such as dehydrogenation and glucuronidation of the chemicals, which have direct effects on the accumulation and elimination of the toxic compounds, have been quantified. The PBTK model considers urinary and fecal excretion and biliary recirculation and compares the predicted biomarkers of blood, urinary and fecal concentrations with published in vivo measurements in rats and human subjects. Additionally, the toxicokinetic model has been coupled with a novel probabilistic dietary exposure model and applied to the Jersey Girl Study (JGS), which involved measurement of mycoestrogens as urinary biomarkers, in a cohort of young girls in New Jersey, USA. A probabilistic exposure characterization for the study population has been conducted and the predicted urinary concentrations have been compared to measurements considering inter-individual physiological and dietary variability. The in vivo measurements from the JGS fall within {{the high and low}} predicted distributions of biomarker values corresponding to dietary exposure estimates calculated by the probabilistic modeling system. The work described here is {{the first of its kind}} to present a comprehensive framework developing estimates of potential exposures to mycotoxins and linking them with biologically relevant doses and biomarker measurements, including a systematic characterization of uncertainties in exposure and dose estimation for a vulnerable population...|$|E
40|$|DISTRIBUTION: Grows on {{different}} grains, e. g. maize and sorghum. Maize is produced {{mainly in the}} North-West, north-western, northern and eastern Free State, the Mpumalanga Highveld and the Kwazulu-Natal Midlands. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: • A phytopathogen of especially maize which infests the cobs during the silking stage. • If the weather is rainy and the ears of corn are maturing in late summer and early autumn, F. graminearum may infect only a few {{to a third of}} the kernels. • Whatever amount of the ear is infected, all the kernels in that portion becomes heavily infected and decayed by the fungus. It manifests as a pink cob rot progressing from the tip {{to the base of the}} cob. • Alternating moderate to low temperatures favour growth and toxin production. • There are many types of cob rot and identification is not straightforward. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Zearalenone metabolised to <b>zearalenol.</b> Relatively heat stable. MECHANISM OF ACTION: Binds to intracellular oestrogen receptor. SYNDROMES: Hyperoestrogenism. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Urogenital system. CLINICAL SIGNS: • Latent period 5 - 8 days. • Recovery about 7 days after withdrawal of contaminated food. • Frank oestrogenism. • Only pigs affected in S. A. Female: • Seen especially in prepubertal gilts • Swollen vulva, slight turbid discharge • Development of mammary glands • Prolapse of vagina and rectum • Sterility of sows, smaller litter size, agalactia. Male: • Development of mammary glands • Swollen prepuce • Atrophy of testicles • Decreased libido. NECROPSY: Usually not fatal. DIAGNOSIS: Characeristic syndrome in large number of pigs. Send feed specimen to laboratory for chemical determination of zearalenone content. TREATMENT: Withdraw contaminated feed. Avoid storage of high moisture grain on cob in open cribs. Colour photos.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{multicomponent}} analytical method for the determination of deoxynivalenol (DON), ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEN), nivalenol (NIV), 3 -acetyl-DON (3 -acDON), 15 -acetyl-DON (15 -acDON), <b>zearalenol</b> (ZOL) and citrinin (CIT) in wheat. It also aimed to survey the presence and amounts of DON, OTA and ZEN in Belgian conventionally and organically produced wheat grain and in wholemeal wheat flours. After solvent extraction, an anion-exchange column (SAX) was used to fix the acidic mycotoxins (OTA, CIT), whilst the neutral mycotoxins flowing through the SAX column were further purified by filtration on a MycoSep cartridge. OTA and CIT were then analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an isocratic flow and fluorescence detection, while the neutral mycotoxins were separated by a linear gradient and detected by double-mode (ultraviolet light fluorescence) detection. The average DON, ZEN and OTA recovery rates from spiked blank wheat flour were 92, 83 and 73 % (RSDR 12, 10 and 9 %), respectively. Moreover, this method offered the respective detection limits of 50, 1. 5 and 0. 05 mg kg(- 1) and good agreement with reference methods and inter-laboratory comparison exercises. Organic and conventional wheat samples harvested in 2002 and 2003 in Belgium were analysed for DON, OTA and ZEN, while wholemeal wheat flour samples were taken from Belgian retail shops and analysed for OTA and DON. Conventional wheat tended to be more frequently contaminated with DON and ZEN than organic samples, the difference being more significant for ZEN in samples harvested in 2002. The mean OTA, DON and ZEA concentrations were 0. 067, 675 and 75 mg kg(- 1) in conventional samples against 0. 063, 285 and 19 mg kg(- 1) in organically produced wheat in 2002, respectively. Wheat samples collected in 2003 were less affected by DON and ZEN than the 2002 harvest. Organic wholemeal wheat flours were more frequently contaminated by OTA than conventional samples (p < 0. 10). The opposite pattern was shown for DON, organic samples being more frequently contaminated than conventional flours (p < 0. 10) ...|$|E

And F. subglutinans (Wollenw. & Reinking) Nelson, Toussoun & Marasas comb. Nov. Highest occurrence of Fusairum spp. Was enxountered in capsicum, corn, pearlmillet and sunflower seeds. F. anthophilum on corn and pearlmillet; F. chlamydosporum on capsicum and mustard; F. equiseti on sunflower; F. proliferatum and F. subglutinans on linseed and mustard were newly recorded species from Pakistan. Seed transmission studies revealed that F. anthophilum, F. moniliforme, F. oxysporum, F. solani and F. subglutinans that eaused wilting and rotting were systemic pathogens of sunflower. During pathogenicity experiments, Fusarium spp. Produced symptoms of root-, collarstem and seedling rots, damping-off, stunting, wilting, yellowing, tip burn and reduction in growth. Wilting {{was the most}} prominent symptom followed by seedling rot. Highest wilting was produced by F. chlamydosporum and F. subglutinans, whereas, highest seedling rot was caused by F. solani and F. sporotrichioides. In dual culture plate assays between fusairum spp. And killer yeasts, Y 21 -Bullera pseudoalba appeared as the most successful antagonist as compared to Y 16 -Pichia anomala and Y 20 -Sporidiobolus ruineniae. These killer yeast strains promoted vigor of sunflower plants when applied alone in soil. During bio-control experiments by soil amendment method, they significantly reduced infection and colonization of roots by Fusarium spp. As compared to seed treatment. Prkofiles of secondary metabolites of fusarium spp. Produced consistent chromatographic patterns on TLC in which bostrycoidin, cis-dihydrofusarubin, vomitoxin (deoxynivaleonol), isomarticin, nectriafurone, zearalenone, <b>zearalenol</b> and other derivatives were identified. Using column chromatography 3 scondary metabolites of F. chlamydosporum, 1 of F. euiseti and 2 of F. pallidoroseum were detected. Secondary metabolites of F. chlamydosporum were identified as Bis(2 -methylpropyl) ester of (Diisobutyl phthalate). Cyanidin 3 -(xylosylarabinoside) and Lotusin E.

40|$|Background: The mycotoxins {{deoxynivalenol}} and <b>zearalenol</b> {{are considered}} to be responsible for poor nutrient intake, growth depression and reproduction disturbances. The present study, titled “The effect of mycotoxins on the amount of retinol, retinyl esters and selective parameters in liver and serum of prepubertal female piglets“ was conducted to study the effects of these mycotoxins on the metabolism of the fat soluble vitamins A and E and therewith underlining the relationship between toxin concentration and effect as well as showing the impact of a detoxifying agent. Material and methods: The piglets were from the “Institut für Tierernährung der Bundesforschungsanstalt für Landwirtschaft”, Braunschweig, Germany, where extensive studies on detoxification of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenon took place. In order to examine the concentration dependence of mycotoxins, the amount of retinol and retinyl esters in serum was determined by rpHPLC. The effect of the detoxifying agent was shown the same way in serum and liver of 40 animals. Additionally the concentration of vitamin E was also measured by rpHPLC. The concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerids and proteins in serum were analysed enzymatically. Results and discussion: The amounts of retinol and -tocopherol in the control group were in accordance with previous studies described in the literature whilst retinyl esters in liver of prepubertal female piglets were determined for the first time. The distribution of hepatic retinyl esters in the control group was as follows: 23 % retinyloleate, 61 % retinylpalmitate and 16 % retinylstearate. This pattern was neither affected by the admission of mycotoxins, nor by the adsorbens. Furthermore the content of retinol in the plasma as with that of retinyl esters in liver remained unaffected. Besides the decreased protein concentration in serum, which {{may be due to the}} decreased food intake in combination with impaired protein synthesis, the amount of vitamin E in serum was also negativly influenced by mycotoxins and aluminiumsilicate. This could be caused by an impaired bioavailability or a disorded absorption. The amount of retinol-binding protein in serum of mycotoxin fed piglets was significantly higher compaired to the controls. The higher amount may be caused by an estrogen induced synthesis of retinol-binding protein in the kidneys. The amount of cholestrerol and trigylcerids in serum was influenced by the detoxifying agent. This could be due to an interaction between aluminiumsilicate and the metabolism of cholesterol or a direct interference with the digestion of fat in the intestine. The mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenon do not have any effect on the metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerids...|$|E
