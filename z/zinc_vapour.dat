A relatively narrow diffuse band at 200. 22 nm (in a vacuum) is observed and its profile is carefully determined for several temperatures. It is found that the band maximum slightly decreases with a temperature increase. This indicates that the band is generated by transitions occurring {{within the range of}} negative energy values of the ground state potential. The experimental results are utilized for deriving some information concerning the upper state potential and the oscillator strength function via semiclassical calculations of the band profile and its comparison with the experimental one. It is shown that theoretical potentials for the lowest Rydberg states available cannot be responsible for the band formation and some part of the previously unknown excited state potential near its minimum as well as the f(R) function reproducing the experimental band profile are found. The equilibrium position, R e, and the energy minimum, E(R e), for this state are established to be 3. 94 ± 0. 15 ? and 49660 ± 50 cm - 1, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} optical metrology systems using laser and position-sensitive detectors (PSDs). In this area, a new diffraction strain {{measurement technique}} is developed, implemented, analyzed and characterized. Related research {{work on the}} optical metrology components is also included, dealing with position-sensitive detectors analysis and laser-beam applications. The research in optical metrology systems using lasers and PSDs comprises development of a novel whole-field strain measurement technique and its implementation as Multipoint Diffraction Strain and Tilt Sensor using Moire Interferometer and Multichannel PSD. All the different variations of diffraction strain sensors as developed by different researchers up to date, measure single point strain on the sample only. Concurrently, the whole- field strain measurement techniques like Moire Inteiferometry and ESPI have their own shortcomings like lengthy fringe processing and image subtraction algorithms. Additionally, they face obvious degradation in their spatial resolution at lower strain values owing to the sparse fringes. On the contrary, the developed system has the unique feature of direct and near-real-time diffraction-based strain and tilt measurement at a large array of points on the sample surface. The system uses simultaneous position tracking of smaller beamlets diffracted differently from {{different regions of the}} component surface under test. Using this setup, whole-field strain and tilt distribution patterns over the component body can be obtained immediately without the need for fringe processing. Furthermore, the system also has capability of measuring rotation and shear strain, making it a truly versatile whole-field strain sensing system. Simultaneous strain and tilt measurement at more than one thousand points is being reported in this research. Complete microcomputer-based implementation of this system is described. Detailed characterization and analysis of the developed system is presented along with some important development decisions. The system offers a promising combination of features like direct and fast calculation of whole-field strain with a fine spatial resolution and good sensitivity. These make this technique suitable for precision applications in structures, mechanics and micro-mechanics, while offering a considerable saving in time and equipment cost. Work on Optical Metrology components starts with a unique analysis of position-sensitive detectors used in noisy industrial environment, where several other light sources also coexist and thus produce unpredicted effects on PSD output. Many researchers of other photo-sensors have analyzed their performance in presence of these stray noises, while this problem has many times been outlined in context of PSDs too. Nonetheless, detailed performance analysis of PSDs with stray optical noises is very much needed. For this purpose, these stray noises are described and modeled with respect to the operation of PSDs. Then the response of the detectors is analyzed in the presence of these spurious signals. The experimental results are compared with the results from the proposed mathematical model and it is observed that the measured performance is within a fraction of a percent of the calculated one. The analysis of systematic errors encountered during data collection is also presented. The study is expected to be very useful for the accurate and precise use of PSDs based sensors in the industrial units like production lines, workshops and others. Following this, the work on laser beams analyzes their use in a novel material processing technique. Laser welding of galvanized steel sheets in lap configuration is the challenging problem being investigated for more than two decades, originating due to the difference in the melting points of steel and zinc. Earlier solutions are either insufficient for desired results or too cumbersome to be realized in practice. For this purpose, dual laser beams method is being discussed modld and analyzed, involving a precursor beam and a higher-power welding beam. The first beam cuts a slot, thus making an exit path for the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapours,</b> while the second beam performs the needed welding. The work also presents some experiments performed on the shop floor using this method, along with the metallurgical analysis from laboratory showing successful absence of zinc in the weld area. Owing to its simpler approach and lesser time consumption, this technique is expected to be very attractive in terms of workshop implementation and welding throughput...|$|R

5000|$|Although some zinc {{artifacts}} {{appear to}} have been made during classical antiquity in Europe, the first production of zinc in quantity seems to have been in India starting from 12th century and later in China from 16th century. [...] In India, zinc was produced at Zawar from the 12th to the 18th centuries. The sphalerite ore found here was presumably converted to zinc oxide via roasting, although no archaeological evidence of this has been found. Smelting is thought to have been done in sealed cylindrical clay retorts which were packed with a mixture of roasted ore, dolomite, and an organic material, perhaps cow dung, and then placed vertically in a furnace and heated to around 1100 °C. Carbon monoxide produced by the charring of the organic material would have reduced the zinc oxide to <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour,</b> which then liquefied in a conical clay condenser {{at the bottom of the}} retort, dripping down into a collection vessel.

50|$|During the Roman {{period a}} new process of {{metalworking}} started, cementation, {{used in the}} production of brass. This process involves the combination of a metal and a gas to produce an alloy (Zwicker et al. 1985: p107). Brass is made by mixing solid copper metal with zinc oxide or carbonate which {{comes in the form of}} calamine or smithsonite (Rehren 2003: p209). This is heated to about 900 °C and the zinc oxide vaporises into a gas and the zinc gas bonds with the solid copper (Rehren 1999: p1085). This reaction has to take place in a part-closed or closed container otherwise the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> would escape before it can react with the copper. Cementation crucibles therefore have a lid or cap which limits the amount of gas loss from the crucible. The crucible design is similar to the smelting and melting crucibles of the period utilizing the same material as the smelting and melting crucibles. The conical shape and small mouth allowed the lid to be added. These small crucibles are seen in Colonia Ulpia Trajana (modern-day Xanten), Germany, where the crucibles are around 4 cm in size, however these are small examples. There are examples of larger vessels such as cooking pots and amphorae being used for cementation to process larger amounts of brass; since the reaction takes place at low temperatures lower fired ceramics could be used. The ceramic vessels which are used are important as the vessel must be able to lose gas through the walls otherwise the pressure would break the vessel. Cementation vessels are mass-produced due to crucibles having to be broken open to remove the brass once the reaction has finished as in most cases the lid would have baked hard to the vessel or the brass might have adhered to the vessel walls.|$|E

An important {{difference in the}} processing of Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si coated steel when compared with galvanised steel is the higher temperature of the molten alloy bath – 600 ºC for Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si coatings versus 450 ºC for galvanised. This increase in temperature leads to an accelerated rate of evaporation of zinc into the pretreatment furnace, leading in turn to various processing difficulties. <b>Zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> in the pre-treatment furnace has long been implicated with defects known within the industry as pinholes and bare patches - uncoated areas where wetting does not occur between the strip and the molten alloy. Despite the association with <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour,</b> the exact mechanisms of pinhole and bare patch formation have not been clearly established. One possible mechanism of pinhole and bare patch formation is the direct reaction of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> with the strip surface. It has been suggested by industry experts that <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> could condense on the strip, leaving a deposit that prevents wetting by molten Zn- 55 %Al- 1. 5 %Si alloy. It remains that little is understood of the fundamental nature {{of the interaction between}} <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> and a steel substrate. The purpose of this research was to examine the rates and mechanisms of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> condensation on clean and oxidised steel substrates.

The experimental work conducted in this study was centred on condensing <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> onto substrates under specific gaseous atmospheres at atmospheric pressure.

Preliminary studies were undertaken to define the design criteria for an apparatus in which the rate of condensation of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> could be measured accurately and the interaction between <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> and clean and oxidised steel substrates could be examined. In this probing exercise, modifications were made to a proven design of an apparatus designed to measure evaporation rates of metals in inert gas atmospheres was used. The preliminary experiments provided a wealth of essential knowledge required to design an experimental facility in which it was possible to accurately measure the rate of condensation of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> and to study the interaction between <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> and the steel substrate, as well as their potential chemical reactions. This new apparatus was specifically developed for a quantitative assessment of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> deposition, and allowed the substrate and <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> to be heated in independent, but interconnecting chambers. The exposure of the substrate to the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> could be controlled with precision, and it was possible to not only measure the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> condensation rates, but also to assess the effect of using oxidising and reducing gasses during preheating of the substrate. Under conditions of high undercooling, <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> deposited by the island plus continuous thin film mode, while at higher substrate temperatures, close to that expected in the industrial process, the zinc deposited more slowly, and zinc islands did not form on the substrate within the first 60 seconds of exposure. Deposition of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> on an oxidised substrate occurred at a much higher rate than on a clean steel substrate. This increase in deposition rate has been attributed to a direct reaction occurring between the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> and the iron oxide without the formation of any liquid condensate. The reaction is: Fe 3 O 4 (s) + 4 Zn(v) ↔ 4 ZnO(s) + 3 Fe(s) This reaction will proceed to the right under sufficiently high partial pressures of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour,</b> and at substrate temperatures both above and below the saturation temperature of the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour.</b> It was observed that under sufficiently low partial pressures of <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour,</b> the above reaction is driven to the left.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Physics)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Third {{harmonic}} generation (THG) {{in a metal}} vapour is a nonlinear optical interaction that facilitates the generation {{of light in the}} vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The requirement of the metal vapour medium is that it has a suitably large third order nonlinear susceptibility. The third order susceptibility is further enhanced by a two photon resonance. Zinc and magnesium vapours are such nonlinear media. The THG process can be phase matched by mixing the metal vapour with a noble gas in a speci c pressure ratio. The metal vapour noble gas mixture needs to be homogeneous and its temperature needs to be constant to within less than a degree Celsius over a path length of 7 cm. These requirements are satis ed by a crossed heat pipe oven. The heat pipe oven makes use of a dynamic liquid-vapour phase equilibrium in sodium in order to maintain a constant temperature of around 800 degrees Celsius, thus facilitating the generation of a stable homogeneous medium of metal vapour and noble gas {{that can be used for}} e cient generation of VUV radiation.

Manganese in the dust {{is in the form}} of MnO, Mn 3 O 4 and MnCO 3; zinc is mainly in the form of ZnO and ZnSO 4. Analysis of the zinc balance with dust recycling showed that to keep zinc intake at the acceptable level, it should be partly removed from the dust. In the reduction laboratory experiments, zinc oxide was reduced to <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> by tar of the dust. Reduction of zinc oxide started at 800 oC and zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature; removal of zinc was close to completion at 1100 oC. Optimal conditions for removing zinc from the dust include temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust frac-tion in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. In the sintering of manganese ore with addition of manganese dust in the sintering pot, zinc was reoxidised and deposited in the sinter bed. Removal of zinc in the sintering pot tests was in the range 4 - 17 %. Up to 30 % zinc removal was achieved from the bottom layer of the sinter bed. It can be concluded that zinc removal will be low during the processing of manganese fur-nace dust in the sinter plant. The zinc removal rate will be the highest when pelletised manganese furnace dust is added to the bottom layer of the sintering bed...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{laser welding}} {{technology}} offers opportunities for high production throughput {{at a competitive}} cost. However, the remote laser welding process of zinc-coated sheet metal parts in lap joint configuration poses a challenge due {{to the difference between}} the melting temperature of the steel (∼ 1500 C) and the vaporizing temperature of the zinc (~ 907 C). In fact, the zinc layer at the faying surface is vaporized and the vapour might be trapped within the melting pool leading to weld defects. Various solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem over the years. Among them, laser dimpling has been adopted by manufacturers because of its flexibility and effectiveness along with its cost advantages. In essence, the dimple works as a spacer between the two sheets in lap joint and allows the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> escape during welding process, thereby preventing weld defects. However, {{there is a lack of}} comprehensive characterization of dimpling process for effective implementation in real manufacturing system taking into consideration inherent changes in variability of process parameters. This paper introduces a methodology to develop (i) surrogate model for dimpling process characterization considering multiple–inputs (i. e. key control characteristics) and multiple–outputs (i. e. key performance indicators) system by conducting physical experimentation and using multivariate adaptive regression splines; (ii) process capability space (Cp–Space) based on the developed surrogate model that allows the estimation of a desired process fallout rate in the case of violation of process requirements in the presence of stochastic variation; and, (iii) selection and optimization of the process parameters based on the process capability space. The proposed methodology provides a unique capability to: (i) simulate the effect of process variation as generated by manufacturing process; (ii) model quality requirements with multiple and coupled quality requirements; and (iii) optimize process parameters under competing quality requirements such as maximizing the dimple height while minimizing the dimple lower surface area...|$|E
40|$|A major {{industrial}} use of pyrotechnic compositions is as delay fuses in electric detonators. Suitable delay times may {{be achieved through}} (i) choice of chemical components (ii) adjustment of composition of the system chosen and, finally, (iii) adjustment {{of the length of}} fuse used. This study forms part of a survey of binary fuel/oxidant combinations in an attempt to provide some fundamental information on the first step above: (i) choice of chemical components. The complete survey has included studies of a single fuel in combination with one of a variety of oxidants, and studies of the oxidation of one of several different fuels separately by barium peroxide and strontium peroxide. This study is part of this second approach and the fuels chosen were iron and zinc powders, mainly for chemical reasons (including the potential for use of thermomagnetometry on the iron systems), but also for possible environmental advantages. The mixed oxide products of pyrotechnic combustion could also have some scientific and/or commercial value. The techniques used included thermal analyses of mixtures and their individual components, and measurements of temperature-time profiles during combustion. Thermodynamic and kinetic information was obtained under a variety of conditions and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction and microprobe analyses provided additional information. Possible mechanisms of reactions are discussed in detail. The practical conclusions were that any potential use which the Fe/peroxide systems may have as delay compositions, with burning-rates of from 3 - 30 mm s⁻¹, is offset by the susceptibility of the oxidants to reaction with water and CO₂ in the atmosphere. The Zn/BaO₂ and Zn/SrO₂ systems did not burn under compaction, and combustion of uncompacted powders was erratic. Zinc liquid (and probably <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour)</b> take part in the reaction and the gaseous nature of the combustion makes zinc-fuelled pyrotechnic systems unsuitable for delay applications. All the techniques used showed the heterogeneity of the solid residues of combustion. If these residues were to be of any value, they would need further conventional treatment involving grinding of the residue, possible adjustment of compositions, and calcining to produce uniform materials. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of reliable, high powered plasma generators {{has resulted in}} many plasma processes being proposed as alternatives to existing pyrometallurgical technologies. This work evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of plasma systems by reviewing plasma generators, their integration with reactors and the process economics. Many plasma systems were shown to be technically and economically superior to existing technologies, but some of the plasma system advantages quoted in the literature were found to be impractical because of other system constraints. Process applications were limited by the power inputs available from plasma generators compared to AC electric furnaces. A series of trials were conducted where chromite and steelplant baghouse dusts were smelted in the Tetronics' 2. 0 MW transferred arc/open bath reactor to confirm the operating characteristics of the plasma system and its economics. Chromite smelting was technical superior to submerged arc furnace technology, but the economics were unfavourable because of the limited power available from the water-cooled plasma torch and the high electrical energy consumption. A DC graphite electrode plasma furnace using preheated and prereduced chromite concentrates will compete economically with the submerged arc furnace. Ni, Cr and Mo were economically recovered from high alloy content steelplant dusts for recycling. Five Electric Arc Furnace dusts were smelted to produce a non-toxic residue and recover the contained zinc to an enriched zinc oxide product for recycling. It should be possible to condense the <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> directly in a zinc splash condenser to increase the value of the product. Because of the limited power available from plasma generators, plasma processes will be most suitable for treating high and medium value materials such as Au, Pt, Mo, Ni, Ti, V, Cr etc at small production rates, heating metals in tundishes and ladles and remelting superalloy scrap. The treatment of environmentally hazardous waste materials is a particularly interesting application because of the additional financial incentives. Non-transferred arc plasma generators will be used for air and gas preheating in blast furnaces to reduce metallurgical coke consumptions...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{research}} reported in this thesis {{was to investigate the}} behaviour of zinc selenide crystals doped with group III impurities such as indium and gallium, with the aim of understanding the processess of self-compensation involved which prevent them from being converted to p-type. The crystals which were grown from the vapour phase, were doped by adding the group III impurity directly to the charge in metallic form or as ZnSe:In or ZnSesGa. Measurements of the photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence revealed that the crystals behaved very similarly to copper doped ZnSe, emitting an orange-red band at 295 K and in the yellow-green and orange-red at 85 K. Measurements of the electrical conductivity and Hall coefficient were made on as-grown samples and samples heated in <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour,</b> which had been cut from ten crystal boules containing indium or gallium in concentrations between 5 and 1000 ppm. The measurements showed that the crystals obeyed the Meyer-Neldel rule and that their resistivity increased with the dopant concentration. It was also revealed, from the exponential behaviour and low values of the electron Hall mobilities, that the conduction of the lightly doped samples was via impurity centres at 295 K. The heavily doped samples also showed low values of Hall mobility limited by a combination of polar mode and ionized and neutral impurity scattering. The free electron concentration decreased while the activation energies increased with in - creasing dopant concentration. Activation energies ranged from 0. 05 to 0, 95 eV. The reduction of the free electron concentration with increasing indium or gallium content in the crystals, is attributed to indium (or gallium) substituting on selenium sites and forming acceptors. When the heavily doped crystals were heated in zinc the indium or gallium is precipitated. The precipitates have been examined in the optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopesv and are found tohave particular shapes and to decorate defects such as stacking faults. The mechanism of precipitation is discussed in same detail...|$|E
40|$|Manganese furnace dust {{is made up}} of {{volatiles}} {{and fine}} particles of the raw materials collected from the off-gas during smelting of manganese alloys. Impediments to the recycling of the manganese furnace dust back to the ferroalloy furnaces are handling due to the presence of tar, and the potential accumulation of zinc in the furnaces, which can cause irregularities in their operation. The aim of the thesis was to establish conditions for zinc removal from the dust and assess the feasibility of the dust recycling in the Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company sinter plant. Major findings are: - Manganese furnace dust taken from the settling ponds contained water, carbonaceous materials (tar), and metal oxides. The carbon content of the dried furnace dust was about 20 % and the average manganese and zinc contents were 33. 4 and 1. 29 %, respectively. Moisture content was 30 - 60 %. - The tar components were aliphatic hydrocarbons and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, their derivatives, and sulphur- and oxygen-containing compounds {{with a wide range of}} carbon number (15 - 28) and boiling point (230 - 530 oC). Light hydrocarbons were not detected. - If manganese furnace dust was recycled to ferroalloy furnaces through the sintering plant, the overall zinc input had increased by 51 - 143 %. Sustainable utilisation of manganese furnace dust should include enhanced zinc removal. - Reduction of zinc oxide from manganese furnace dust pellets started at 800 oC. Zinc oxide was reduced to <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> by tar in the dust. Temperature and gas atmosphere were key parameters affecting the zinc removal from the dust. The zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature and was close to completion at 1100 oC. - Optimal conditions for removal of zinc from the furnace dust include: temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust fraction in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. - Zinc removal in the processing of manganese furnace dust in the sinter plant was low because of zinc reoxidation in the sinter bed. This makes the sinter plant unsuitable for recycling of the dust. More suitable conditions for utilisation of manganese furnace dust exist in the rotary hearth furnace, which development is recommended for further study...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} ordered ZnO {{nanostructures}} {{is very important}} for many application fields, as optoelectronics, photovoltaics, piezo-electric power generation, etc. In particular, vertically aligned ZnO nanorods can be employed as 3 D electron-harvesting TCO, capable of inducing multiple absorptions by light scattering phenomena in hybrid third generation solar cells. However, for photovoltaic application it is necessary to produce large area substrates uniformly covered by nanorods with controlled dimensions. Aligned ZnO nanorods can be obtained in highly ordered arrays over different substrates both by wet chemical methods and by vapour-phase processes. Not-catalyzed vapour growth processes are those that can supply nanostructures with the lowest concentration of undesired impurities. This aspect is fundamental for photovoltaic application in order to prevent negative effects on electron transport properties. In this work, we report the preparation of a large area (few square centimetres) nanostructured TCO on commercial glass substrate, constituted by a highly conducting ZnO:Al layer (by Pulsed Electron Deposition) and vertically aligned ZnO nanorods homogeneous in length and diameter over the whole substrate. The latter have been obtained by a vapour-phase process, starting from metallic Zn where only argon and oxygen flows are used, with a maximum temperature lower than 500 ?C (which is compatible with low-cost and application-oriented glass substrates). This goal has been achieved after an in-depth study of the nucleation and growth mechanisms of ZnO nanorods. The influence of substrate material and its crystallographic properties, as well as the results obtained with different growth parameters (temperature, flows, time) are discussed. Above all, it has been observed that the condensation of small Zn clusters on the polar surface of a ZnO film can reproducibly nucleate the growth of ZnO well-aligned rods, perpendicularly to the substrate face. These clusters can be formed by a proper control of temperature gradients in order to obtain locally a <b>zinc</b> <b>vapour</b> pressure larger than the equilibrium one of liquid phase. Once nucleation has occurred, the growth of the nanorods follows until zinc and oxygen are supplied. Diameter of nanorods can thus be intentionally modified in the 20 - 200 nm range, and length up to 3 - 4 microns. Moreover, it has been evidenced that during the growth process a ZnO wetting layer of controllable thickness can be deposited between the ZnO:Al layer and nanorods...|$|E
