40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} method to prefigure responsive models by investigating the form’s spatial movement in the step from one configuration to another. Folded surfaces have been chosen for investigation. Contemporary architecture proposes buildings that are no longer simply juxtaposed volumes marked by light, i. e., surfaces drawn by shadows that change with {{the position of the}} Sun throughout the day. Today, buildings interact with the surrounding environment, changing the morphological characteristics of their exteriors in relation to various environmental parameters. Buildings change in relation to external conditions, but they also communicate via the possibilities expressed by a skin that shimmers in relation to the message to externalize. We are faced with responsive forms that the designer should control through design. The design of forms in movement is seen widely in the study of objects called “folded surfaces”. This area addresses the different means of prefigurement offered by the design used to initially investigate the layout, which is drawn according to canonical rules of symmetry, balance, and the ability to tessellate flat space. The next step is to translate the signs into mountain and valley folds, studying the different spatial conformations assumed by tiles of the folded surface rotating around the pattern lines. Spatial control of the model is ensured by geometrically controlling the basic entities that compose the folded surfaces: the surface/face of the pattern, the <b>zipper</b> <b>lines</b> between the faces, the point/vertex where the <b>zipper</b> <b>lines</b> meet. By applying the basic rules of descriptive geometry, an algorithm that controls the entire form can be constructed. This is the fundamental contribution of nodal programming tools for modelling support. Today almost all design programs include nodal networks, which allow the geometric algorithms used in the research to be specified and some variable dimensions to be extrapolated from the definition. Acting on the variables, it is possible to control the step from the folded surface of one conformation to another. In this way, the “fourth dimension”, the form’s movement, can be anticipated and designe...|$|R

30|$|Nylon is a polymer {{classified}} as polyamide that {{was discovered by}} Wallace Hume Carothers in 1934; it is produced as fiber and plastic depending on the processing conditions [1]. Commercially, there are different kinds of nylon, nylon 6, nylon 66, nylon 6, 10, etc., having in common the amide functional group (–CO-NH-) [2]. This polymer is used to produce blown films and monofilaments through spinning processes, {{and it can be}} copolymerized. Such is the case of nylon 6 / 66 which is produced to lower melting temperature compared to nylon 6.

5000|$|Product dyeing, {{also known}} as garment dyeing, {{is the process of}} dyeing {{products}} such as hosiery, sweaters, and carpet after they have been produced. This stage of dyeing is suitable when all components dye the same shade (including threads). This method is used to dye sheer hosiery since it is knitted using tubular knitting machines and then stitched prior to dyeing. Tufted carpets, with the exception of carpets produced using solution dyed fibers, are often dyed after they have been tufted. This method is not suitable for apparel with many components such as <b>lining,</b> <b>zippers,</b> and sewing thread, as each component may dye differently. The exception is tinting jeans with pigments for a “vintage” look. In tinting, color is used, whereas in other treatments such as acid-wash and stone-wash, chemical or mechanical processes are used. After garment construction, these products are given the [...] "faded" [...] or [...] "used" [...] look by finishing methods as opposed to dyeing.|$|R

40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{calculation}} of height correlations in the two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model {{by taking advantage of}} a technique developed recently by Kenyon and Wilson. The formalism requires to equip the usual graph Laplacian, ubiquitous in the context of cycle-rooted spanning forests, with a complex connection. In the case at hand, the connection is constant and localized along a semi-infinite defect <b>line</b> (<b>zipper).</b> In the appropriate limit of a trivial connection, it allows one to count spanning forests whose components contain prescribed sites, which are of direct relevance for height correlations in the sandpile model. Using this technique, we first rederive known 1 - and 2 -site lattice correlators on the plane and upper half-plane, more efficiently than what has been done so far. We also compute explicitly the (new) next-to-leading order in the distances ($r^{- 4 }$ for 1 -site on the upper half-plane, $r^{- 6 }$ for 2 -site on the plane). We extend these results by computing new correlators involving one arbitrary height and a few heights 1 on the plane and upper half-plane, for the open and closed boundary conditions. We examine our lattice results from the conformal point of view, and confirm the full consistency with the specific features currently conjectured to be present in the associated logarithmic conformal field theory.

Process: When I first started to design my garment, I {{did a lot of}} research on Pinterest for inspiration. Japanese fashion is a particular interest of mine and I was inspired by many of the up-and-coming street styles that are currently being reported on along with designs by Atsusi Nakshime. Going through many sketches, I finally decided on this garment which features a corset, which was a challenge to construct properly. Techniques: Draping was used to create this garment. From the draping, a pattern was made and, from the pattern, a sample was constructed. The sample was put on my model and final changes were made from the fitting to the paper pattern. Once this was done, I was able to cut my final fabric and carefully make my final garment. Contribution to Fashion: It contributes to fashion by revering the beauty of female deity.

40|$|AbstractAfter {{several years}} of {{exploration}} practices in the Changning-Weiyuan national shale gas pilot zone, the industrial production has been achieved {{in a number of}} vertical and horizontal wells completed by SRV fracturing, and a series of independent shale gas reservoir stimulation technologies have come into being. Next, it is necessary to consider how to enhance the efficiency of fracturing by a factory-mode operation. This paper presents the deployment of Changning Well Pad A, the first cluster horizontal shale gas well group, and proposes the optimal design for the factory operation mode of this Pad according to the requirements of wellpad fracturing stimulation technologies and the mountainous landform in the Sichuan Basin. Accordingly, a zipper-fracturing mode was firstly adopted in the factory fracturing on wellpad. With the application of standardized field process, <b>zipper</b> operation, assembly <b>line</b> work, staggered placement of downhole fractures, and microseismic monitoring in real time, the speed of fracturing reached 3. 16 stages a day on average, and the stimulated reservoir volume was maximized, which has fully revealed how the factory operation mode contributes to the large-scale SRV fracturing of horizontal shale gas cluster wells on wellpads in the aspect of speed and efficiency. Moreover, the fracturing process, operation mode, surface facilities and post-fracturing preliminary evaluation of the zipper-fracturing in the well group were examined comprehensively. It is concluded from the practice that the zipper-fracturing in the two wells enhanced the efficiency by 78 % and stimulated reservoir volume by 50 % compared with the single-well fracturing at the preliminary stage in this area...|$|R
