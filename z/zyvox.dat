40|$|Linezolid (<b>Zyvox),</b> an oxazolidinone {{antibiotic}} that {{is widely}} used for gram-positive infections, is increasingly being used for highly drug-resistant tuberculosis, {{although it is not}} ap-proved for this use by any regulatory body. In case reports and series, linezolid seems to be useful for the treatment of both multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. These reports have revealed that certain side effects are common with the long-term use of linezolid, especially optic and peripheral neurologic and hematologic toxicities [1]. To better understand the clinical usefulness and toxicity of linezolid treatment for patients with tuberculosis, we are performing a prospective, institutional review board– approved study, entitled “A Phase IIa, Randomized, Two...|$|E

Materials and methods: The drugs linezolid (<b>Zyvox),</b> vancomycin (Voncon), and daptomycin (Cubicin) were tested with three jet nebulizers with seven different residual cups and different loadings. Moreover, three ultrasound nebulizers were again tested with these drugs, with different loadings and mouthpiece attachments. Results: When drugs are combined with particular cup designs, they significantly lower the droplet size to 1. 60 and 1. 80 µm, which represents the best combination of <b>Zyvox</b> and cup G and Cubicin and cup D, respectively. Cup design D is suggested as the most effective cup for lowering the droplet size (2. 30 µm) when considering a higher loading level (8 mL). Conclusion: Modification of current drugs from dry powder to solution is possible, and the residual cup design plays the most important role in droplet size production when the nebulization systems have the same properties.

30|$|Although {{the overall}} {{prevalence}} of drug-susceptible tuberculosis has reduced, the worldwide incidences of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis {{during the past}} decade threaten tuberculosis control since treatment is less effective, more complex, and far more costly than that for drug-susceptible disease (Frieden et al. 1993; Shah et al. 2007; Raviglione 2007). Linezolid (<b>Zyvox,</b> Pfizer) was approved in 2000 for drug-resistant, gram-positive bacterial infections (Leach et al. 2011). Linezolid {{has been shown to be}} effective in the treatment of MDR-tuberculosis (TB) and XDR-TB (Anger et al. 2010; Singla et al. 2012; Condos et al. 2008). However, several studies have reported side effects and toxicities, primarily bone marrow suppression and peripheral and optic neuropathy, to be limiting factors in the use of linezolid (Di Paolo et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2003). Determination of disease activity must be based on the results of sputum cultures. Although performing sputum culture is much faster nowaday, determination of drug resistance still takes several weeks. In such situation, chest CT may help in the early assessment of linezolid treatment efficacy because of its rapid availability.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{synthesis}} of a novel enantiopure bicyclic triazolium salt and its application as an efficient chiral catalyst {{in the form of}} the corresponding Wanzlick carbene in the asymmetric variant of the benzoin condensation is described. The chiral bicyclic triazolium salt is currently the most efficient precatalyst for the asymmetric benzoin condensation. The substituted acyloins are obtained in moderate to good yields (8 - 83 %) and with very good enantiomeric excesses (80 - 95 %) from the corresponding aldehydes. The high asymmetric induction is presumably based on the conformational rigidity of the bicyclic nucleophilic carbene catalyst and on the steric hindrance in the Breslow intermediate. The asymmetric synthesis of cis- 4, 5 -disubstituted oxazolidin- 2 -ones is described. Following a four step reaction sequence of alpha-alkylation, 1, 2 -addition with subsequent carbamate protection, cyclization and concluding with cleavage of the auxiliary the title compounds are obtained in moderate yields and in excellent diastereo- and enantiomeric excesses (de = 88 - > 96 %, ee = > 96 %). The oxazolidinone structure is often found in natural and synthetic pharmacologically active molecules like <b>Zyvox</b> (Linezolid) or Streptazolin. In addition, application of oxazolidinones in asymmetric synthesis are well known, especially the widely used auxiliaries of Evans et al...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Zyvox</b> (R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program has {{completed}} its fifth year of monitoring for emerging resistance to linezolid and other Gram-positive active agents on the continents of Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. in 2006, 4216 Gram-positive isolates from 16 nations were submitted for analysis from 6 organism groups including Staphylococcus aureus (54. 0 %), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (14. 6 %), enterococci (10. 0 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9. 4 %), viridans group streptococci (5. 0 %), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (7. 0 %). Linezolid retained potent activity against S. aureus MIC 50 and MIC 90, 2 mu g/mL; 39. 8 % methicillin resistant) and CoNS (MIC 50 and MIC 90, I mu g/mL; 74. 3 % methicillin resistant). Despite endemicity of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (up to 30. 0 %) in several nations, linezolid inhibited > 99 % of strains at <= 2 mu g/mL (modal MIC, 1 mu g/mL). Among streptococci, all linezolid MIC values were <= 2 mu g/mL. Rare instances of linezolid-resistance were detected in enterococci (2 isolates, China and Germany) and CoNS (3 isolates, Italy and Brazil); 2 CoNS and 1 Enterococcusfiaecium had documented G 2576 T mutations. Overall, linezolid remained active against 99. 88 % of tested strains from this global collection. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Linezolid was {{the first}} {{clinically}} applied {{member of the new}} antimicrobial class called the "oxazolidinones". These agents have a powerful spectrum of activity focussed against Gram-positive organisms including strains with documented resistances to other antimicrobial classes. We conducted a multicenter surveillance (<b>Zyvox</b> Antimicrobial Potency Study; ZAPS) trial of qualifying Gram-positive isolates from 24 medical centers in eight countries in Latin America. The activity and spectrum of linezolid was compared to numerous agents including glycopeptides, quinupristin/dalfopristin, b-lactams and fluoroquinolones when testing 2, 640 strains by the standardized disk diffusion method or Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). The linezolid spectrum was complete against staphylococci (median zone diameter, 29 - 32 mm), as was the spectrum of vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Among the enterococci, no linezolid resistance was detected, and the susceptibility rate was 93. 1 - 96. 4 %. Only the vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains remained susceptible (92. 8 %) to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Marked differences in the glycopeptide resistance patterns (van A versus van B) were noted for the 22 isolates of VRE, thus requiring local susceptibility testing to direct therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and other species were very susceptible (100. 0 %) to linezolid, MIC 90 at 0. 75 mug/ml. Penicillin non-susceptible rate was 27. 7 % and erythromycin resistance was at 17. 4 %. Other streptococci were also completely susceptible to linezolid (MIC 90, 1 mug/ml). These results provide the initial benchmark of potency and spectrum for linezolid in Latin American medical centers. Future comparisons should recognize that the oxazolidinones possess essentially a complete spectrum coverage of the monitored staphylococci, enterococci and streptococcal isolates in 2000 - 2001. This positions linezolid as the widest spectrum empiric choice against multi-resistant Gram-positive cocci, a spectrum of activity greater than available glycopeptides and the streptogramin combination...|$|E
