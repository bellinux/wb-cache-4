50|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump is {{a medical}} device used to deliver medications directly into {{the space between the}} spinal cord and the protective sheath surrounding the spinal cord.

50|$|Delivery of an opioid such as morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, sufentanyl or {{meperidine}} {{directly into}} the subarachnoid cavity (the space between the spinal cord's inner, waterproof sheath and its outer protective sheaths) provides enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects, and has reduced the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. The anxiolytic clonidine, or the nonopioid analgesic <b>ziconotide,</b> and local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, ropivacaine or tetracaine may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
50|$|However, {{this must}} be weighed against {{the high level of}} pain management, both in terms of degree and length, and the {{apparent}} lack of tolerance and other signs of dependence even after extended treatment along with the need for alternatives to other therapies that have not worked for the patient. <b>Ziconotide</b> is also contraindicated for patients with certain preexisting mental disorders (e.g. psychosis) due to evidence that they are more susceptible to certain severe side effects.|$|E
5000|$|Marine environments are {{potential}} sources for new bioactive agents.

Several other marine-derived agents are now in clinical trials for indications such as cancer, anti-inflammatory use and pain.

In the United States, the road has been long for the first FDA approval of a drug directly from the sea, but in 2004, the approval of <b>ziconotide</b> isolated from a marine cone snail has paved the way for other marine-derived compounds moving through clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effects are dizziness, nausea, confusion, {{nystagmus}} and headache.

Other side effects which are less frequent but still clinically significant include auditory and visual hallucinations, thoughts of suicide, acute kidney failure, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular accident, sepsis, new or worsening depression, paranoia, disorientation, meningitis and seizures. Therefore, it is contraindicated {{in people with}} a history of psychosis, schizophrenia, clinical depression, and bipolar disorder. Recent incidents suggesting a link between intrathecal <b>ziconotide</b> treatment and increased risk of suicide have led to calls for strict and ongoing psychiatric monitoring of patients to avoid suicide occurring in vulnerable individuals.

5000|$|N-type calcium {{channels}} {{have been}} {{connected to a}} variety of different clinical diagnoses. They are most commonly linked to therapeutic treatment of chronic pain. Studies have shown that the intrathecal injection of calcium channel inhibitors such as <b>Ziconotide,</b> to block the N-type calcium channels, have produced alleviation of intractable pain. The use of blockers to inhibit the N-type calcium channels have produced alleviation of chronic pain from a variety of different diseases. For example, blockade of the N-type calcium channel is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of alcoholism. Studies have also shown that N-type peptide blockers have been used to relieve pain that results from osteoarthritis, hypertension, diabetic neuropathy, and cancer. The use of intrathecally injected N-type channel blockers has proven to be more beneficial than common opioid remedies since there are less negative side effects associated. The alteration of N-type calcium channels in therapeutic processes occurs in four major ways; through the blockage of N-type calcium channel peptides, interference of the flow of ions through the channel itself, activation of G-protein coupled signaling, and interference of the G-protein pathways. N-type calcium channels have also been associated with several known diseases as well. For example, mutations in the CACNA1B gene have been associated with Myoclonus-Dystonia syndrome [...] Duplication of the CACNA1B gene has also been linked to cases of the Autism Spectrum Disorder.|$|E

No stability data are available, however, for <b>ziconotide</b> given in low concentrations and/or with other analgesics as usually occurs in clinical oncology practice. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the in vitro stability of <b>ziconotide</b> alone and combined with other analgesics in intrathecal pumps at 37 °C, as well as in syringes at 5 °C, to evaluate conditions for storing and transporting preparations. Materials and Methods Various <b>ziconotide</b> concentrations (0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5, and 0. 75 [*]μg/mL) were combined with an admixture of ropivacaine (7. 5 [*]mg/mL), morphine (7. 5 [*]mg/mL), and clonidine (15 [*]μg/mL) in 20 -mL intrathecal pumps at 37 °C and in syringes at 5 °C. Solutions of <b>ziconotide</b> alone in concentrations of 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1 [*]μg/mL were introduced into pumps at 37 °C and syringes at 5 °C. Assays were performed using ultra high pressure liquid chromatography. Results In admixtures, mean <b>ziconotide</b> concentrations decreased linearly to 53. 4 % (± 3. 33 %) of baseline after 35 days. When <b>ziconotide</b> was introduced alone in pumps at 37 °C, the residual concentration on day 31 was 35. 54 % (± 0. 04 %) with 0. 25 [*]μg/mL, 39. 37 % (± 0. 15 %) with 0. 5 [*]μg/mL, and 44. 49 % (± 0. 18 %) with 1 [*]μg/mL. <b>Ziconotide</b> alone or combined with the other analgesics was stable in syringes stored at 5 °C. The preparations complied with the prescriptions, with a mean error of less than 10 %, except with the lowest <b>ziconotide</b> concentration (0. 1 [*]μg/mL). Conclusions At the low <b>ziconotide</b> concentrations studied, the degradation of <b>ziconotide</b> admixed with other drugs was linear and only weakly influenced by the baseline concentration. Linear regression with intrapolation to 30 days showed that the degradation of <b>ziconotide</b> admixed with other drugs was consistent with previously published data...|$|E
