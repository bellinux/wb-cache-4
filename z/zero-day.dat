25|$|Stuxnet {{attacked}} Windows systems {{using an}} unprecedented four <b>zero-day</b> attacks (plus the CPLINK vulnerability and a vulnerability {{used by the}} Conficker worm). It is initially spread using infected removable drives such as USB flash drives, which contain Windows shortcut files to initiate executable code. The worm then uses other exploits and techniques such as peer-to-peer RPC to infect and update other computers inside private networks that are not directly connected to the Internet. The number of <b>zero-day</b> exploits used is unusual, as they are highly valued and malware creators do not typically make use of (and thus simultaneously make visible) four different <b>zero-day</b> exploits in the same worm. Amongst these exploits were remote code execution on a computer with Printer Sharing enabled, and the LNK/PIF vulnerability, in which file execution is accomplished when an icon is viewed in Windows Explorer; negating the need for user interaction. Stuxnet is unusually large at half a megabyte in size, and written in several different programming languages (including C and C++) which is also irregular for malware. The Windows component of the malware is promiscuous in that it spreads relatively quickly and indiscriminately.|$|E
40|$|<b>Zero-days</b> {{attacks are}} one of the most {{dangerous}} threats against computer networks. These, by definition, are attacks never seen before. Thus, defense tools based on a database of rules (usually referred as “signatures”) that describe known attacks cannot do anything against them. Recently, defense tools based on machine learning algorithms have gained an increasing popularity as they offer the possibility to fight off also <b>zero-days</b> attacks. In this paper we propose HMMPayl, an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System for the protection of a web server and of the applications the server hosts. HMMPayl analyzes the network traffic toward the web server and it is based on Hidden Markov Models. With this paper we provide for several contributions. First, the algorithm implemented by HMMPayl allows to carefully model the payload increasing the classification accuracy with respect to previously proposed solutions. Second, we show that an approach based on multiple classifiers leads to an increased classification accuracy with respect to the case where a single classifier is used. Third, exploiting the redundancy within the information extracted from the payload we propose a solution to reduce the computational cost of the algorithm...|$|R

Security seesaws between informational advantage and vulnerability and America, as all other cyber-powers, must consistently tip the seesaw towards the former. Optimally managing the short term vulnerabilities of a cyber advantage will best produce a long-term net gain in security for the US. The Internet’s lax architecture favours offensive over defensive information seeking. Finding and buying <b>zero-days</b> supplements America’s security innovations to maintain a deployable cyber arsenal. Cyber deterrence is problematic so America relies on resilience to manage cyber attacks. Defence through attack absorption offers a better strategy than deterrence per se.

Exploiting four <b>zero-day</b> flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software. Stuxnet reportedly compromised Iranian PLCs, collecting information on industrial systems and causing the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart. Stuxnet’s design and architecture are not domain-specific {{and it could be}} tailored as a platform for attacking modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and PLC systems (e.g., in factory assembly lines or power plants), the majority of which reside in Europe, Japan and the US. Stuxnet reportedly ruined almost one fifth of Iran's nuclear centrifuges. Targeting industrial control systems, the worm infected over 200,000 computers and caused 1,000 machines to physically degrade.|$|E

The NSA has denied this claim, as has Richard A. Clarke, a member of the National Intelligence Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies that reviewed the United States' electronic surveillance policy; he told Reuters on April 11, 2014 that the NSA had not known of Heartbleed. The allegation prompted the American government to make, for the first time, a public statement on its <b>zero-day</b> vulnerabilities policy, accepting the recommendation of the review group's 2013 report that had asserted [...] "in almost all instances, for widely used code, it is in the national interest to eliminate software vulnerabilities rather than to use them for US intelligence collection", and saying that the decision to withhold should move from the NSA to the White House.|$|E

A further complication was the location of German artillery, hidden as it was behind the ridges. In response, specialist artillery units were created to attack German artillery. Their targets were provided by 1st Field Survey Company, Royal Engineers, who collated data obtained from flash spotting and sound ranging. (Flash spotting required Royal Flying Corps observers to record the location of tell-tale flashes made by guns whilst firing.) On <b>Zero-Day,</b> 9 April, over 80 percent of German heavy guns in the sector were neutralised (that is, [...] "unable to bring effective fire to bear, the crews being disabled or driven off") by counter-battery fire.

5000|$|<b>Zero-days,</b> on {{the other}} hand, are virtual {{products}} and can be easily sold without intermediaries over the internet as available technologies {{are strong enough to}} provide anonymity at a very low cost. Even if {{there is a need for}} intermediaries, [...] "unwitting data mules" [...] can be used to avoid any evidence of wrongdoing. This is why the black market is so lucrative compared to gray markets. Gray markets, which involve transactions with public institutions in charge of national security, usually require the use of third parties to hide the traces of their transactions. The Hacking Team archive, for example, contains alleged contracts with the Ecuadorian National Secretariat of Intelligence where they used two intermediaries: Robotec and Theola. In the same archive, it is said that third-party companies Cicom and Robotec negotiated the contracts on behalf of the FBI and DEA respectively. It is less likely that white markets face the same problem as it is not in their interest to hide the transaction, it is quite the opposite because companies actively promote the use of their new patches.|$|R
500|$|Zero-Hour had {{originally}} been planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed 24 hours {{at the request of}} the French, despite reasonably good weather in the assault sector. <b>Zero-Day</b> was rescheduled for 9 April with Zero-Hour at 05:30. The assault was preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting five minutes, following a relatively quiet night. When the time came, it was snowing heavily; Allied troops advancing across no man's land were hindered by large drifts. It was still dark and visibility on the battlefield was very poor. A westerly wind was at the Allied soldiers' backs blowing [...] "a squall of sleet and snow into the faces of the Germans". The combination of the unusual bombardment and poor visibility meant many German troops were caught unawares and taken prisoner, still half-dressed, clambering out of the deep dug-outs of the first two lines of trenches. Others were captured without their boots, trying to escape but stuck in the knee-deep mud of the communication trenches.|$|E

According to Gartner, it is expected the rise of new entrants, such Carbon Black, Cylance and Crowdstrike will force EPP incumbents into a new phase of innovation and acquisition. One method from Bromium involves micro-virtualization to protect desktops from malicious code execution initiated by the end user. Another approach from SentinelOne and Carbon Black focuses on behavioral detection by building a full context around every process execution path in real time, while Cylance leverages an artificial intelligence model based on [...] machine learning. Increasingly, these signature-less approaches have been defined {{by the media and}} analyst firms as [...] "next-generation" [...] antivirus and are seeing rapid market adoption as certified antivirus replacement technologies by firms such as Coalfire and DirectDefense. In response, traditional antivirus vendors such as Trend Micro, Symantec and Sophos have responded by incorporating [...] "next-gen" [...] offerings into their portfolios as analyst firms such as Forrester and Gartner have called traditional signature-based antivirus [...] "ineffective" [...] and [...] "outdated".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zero-day</b> {{protection}} {{is the ability}} to provide protection against <b>zero-day</b> exploits.
