50|$|Cr(VI)-free {{coatings}} {{are more}} environmentally friendly than surfaces with a Cr(VI) content. No <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings {{used in the}} automotive industry nowadays contain this substance.Various manufactures, such as car companies and their suppliers, have produced their own specifications and supply rules in order to define the requirements for these coating systems.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, the use {{of these}} coating systems spread, e.g. within the {{automotive}} industry. This industry needs coating systems offering a high level of corrosion resistance. As <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings do not create any hydrogen in the process, they were used for critical applications as an alternative to electroplating.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to paints where {{the risk of}} sub-surface corrosion creep exists, this phenomenon is avoided through the sacrificial effect of the zinc. In salt spray test&shy;s <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings demonstrate better protection against corrosion than a typical galvanic zinc coating, which in the tests (generally run in accordance with ISO 9227) often achieve only 96 to 200 hours.|$|R
50|$|The coated parts have to {{be cured}} inside an oven at a {{controlled}} temperature for a set period. This temperature/time configuration {{is dependent on the}} coating material and the product manufacturer, as each manufacturer of <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> products has its patented formula.

50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> {{coatings}} {{are used}} as cathodic protective layers against corrosion {{all over the world}} in the automotive and construction industries. Combined with cured, thin, organic or inorganic coatings, these can also provide colour (black, silver, green, blue, etc.), chemical resistance, low electrical conductivity (due to the influence of the organic layer) and assembly properties. If required, re-lubrication or a thread lock (patch) is also possible.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of wind {{turbines}} these coatings are frequently used for threaded fastening elements. Good systems are certified by, among others, the GL Group with the certificate “Germanischer Lloyd”. <b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings are particularly well suited to high-strength bolts (strength category 10.9 and above), high-strength nuts (strength category 10 and above) and structural parts with tensile strength of > 1000 N/mm2 or > 320 HV because hydrogen embrittlement is avoided.|$|R
50|$|A {{basecoat}} {{determines the}} corrosion protection {{properties of the}} system and is responsible for cathodic protection. The inorganic basecoats are made of <b>zinc</b> <b>flakes</b> and protect parts with very thin - usually between 8-12 µm. The less noble zinc scarifies itself, and this is called cathodic protection. Due to this phenomenon the more noble steel is protected from for many parts and components, specially designed for fasteners in the automotive-, wind-, electrical-, construction- and aviation industry.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> {{coatings}} containing Cr(VI) (hexavalent chromium): surfaces containing Cr(VI) provide greater anti-corrosion protection with a thinner coating, but Cr(VI) is carcinogenic and poses {{a potential}} {{risk to the}} environment.

These include the Vehicle End-of-Life Directive EC 2000/53 as of 1 July 2007 and directive EC 2002/95 on {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (the RoHS Directive). For applications outside of the automotive and electrical industries these coatings are still valid.|$|R

The dielectric constant in the parallel direction was obviously higher than that of the perpendicular direction.

Keywords: pearlescence; flow visualisation; integral turbulent scales 1 Introduction Pearlescent dye is a suspension of fine, reflective, plate-like particles. Natural pearlescence is derived from fish scales, but pearlescence may also be made artificially using mica <b>flakes</b> <b>coated</b> with titanium dioxide or ferric oxide [1].

25|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that the cause of the crash was a failure of the hydraulic flight control system, caused by <b>coating</b> <b>flaking</b> off from servo pistons. The loosened plasma <b>coating</b> <b>flakes</b> blocked the return valves of the servos, causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverability. Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open these components. However, in the final report, Copterline was criticized for omitting a periodic leak test of the hydraulic flight control system that could have revealed the problem. The Finnish authorities were also criticized for insufficient supervision.|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS), d. c. conductivity {{measurements and}} the scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) {{are used to}} study through-film electronic percolation and sacrificial protection in zinc-rich organic coatings. Two types of zinc powder, exhibiting spherical and flake particle morphologies, are dispersed in an ethanolic solution of polyvinyl butyral. The resulting dispersions are cast onto glass to produce self-supporting zinc-rich organic films. The same dispersions are cast onto an iron substrate to form strongly adherent zinc-rich organic coatings. Through-film d. c. electrica conductance is found to increase sharply near the critical percolation volume fraction of zinc; that is the lowest zinc volume fraction at which long range electronic conduction becomes possible {{as a result of}} particle-particle contact. The critical percolation volume fraction is the same for both flake and powder particles. However, at any given zinc concentration near the critical percolation volume fraction, through-film conductivity is significantly higher {{in the case of the}} <b>zinc</b> <b>flake.</b> EIS is used to measure the through-film electrical impedance of self-supporting zinc-rich films. EIS data is not readily related to electronic charge percolation arising from zinc particle-particle contact but provides additional information on through-pore electrolytic conductivity and interfacial charge transfer-diffusion phenomena.

40|$|ABSTR^Cr: Black coated {{fracture}} {{surfaces are}} common in the saprolites of the Southeast United States. Many of the surfaces are polished and striated indicating movement has occurred; others show no evidence of movement. The black zone is commonly 1 - 2 mm thick. The surface skin of the black zone, less than 1 ttm thick, commonly consists of well oriented thin clay and biotite <b>flakes</b> <b>coated</b> with amorphous hydrous Mn-Fe oxides. The underlying material is not oriented parallel to the fracture surface. The clay is an iron-rich tabular halloysite which formed from biotite. The Mn occurs as 0. 1 ~m ovoids thin coatings and micro-nodules. Some black surfaces contain {{a high concentration of}} rare earth elements, particularly cerium. Both the Mn and Fe were released from the biotite during acid weathering (saprolite pH- 5). Much of the Fe was precipitated {{in the vicinity of the}} biotite. The more mobile Mn migrated to pre-existing fractures and voids where the pH of circulating round waters was sufficiently high (pH 7) to cause precipitation.

40|$|Abstract: Montmorillonite was {{introduced}} into the multicomponent epoxy resin by using the intercalation polymerization. Intercalation effect of epoxy/montmorillonite composite system {{and the influence of}} the addition of montmorillonite on the glass transition temperature (Tg), mechanical properties and barrier of H 2 S to coating under high temperature and pressure conditions were investigated. The results showed that it was easy to intercalate epoxy resin into the organic montmorillonite layers, and the interlayer spacing of Montmorillonite was further swelled. In addition, the epoxy/montmorillonite nanocomposite coating with intercalated / exfoliated structures were prepared. Compared to pure epoxy coating, the heat resistance and mechanical properties of epoxy/montmorillonite nanocomposite coating were slightly improved, and the barrier efficiency to H 2 S was substantially increased under high temperature and pressure oil-gas environment. Epoxy coating {{is one of the most}} widely used anti-corrosive coatings. Due to the deficiency of both the heat resistance and toughness of the epoxy matrix, epoxy coating can be only used for a long time under the corrosive environment with low temperature and non-mechanical stress[1, 2]. At present, the epoxy/glass <b>flakes</b> <b>coating</b> plays a good anti-corrosive properties when it is widely used in the heavy anti-corrosion fields such as petroleum and chemical industry and so on.
