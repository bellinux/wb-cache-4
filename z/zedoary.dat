Envenomation symptoms may manifest between 15 minutes and 2 hours following the bite. In mice, the SC [...] range for this species is 0.45 mg/kg - 0.75 mg/kg. The average venom yield per bite is between 169 and 250 mg. Though it is responsible for many bites, only a small percentage are fatal if proper medical treatment and anti-venom are given. Mortality rate for untreated bite victims can vary from case to case, depending upon the quantity of venom delivered by the individual involved.

Baofukang suppository is a type of traditional Chinese medicine that consists primarily of two Chinese Medicinal Herbs: (1) <b>zedoary</b> turmeric oil; and (2) borneol. <b>Zedoary</b> turmeric oil is a volatile oil steam-distilled from Curcuma phaeocaulis which contains a variety of effective components, including beta-elemene, curcumin, curzerenone, and Zimmer ketones currently in clinical use. These components may provide potent pharmacological activities, such as antitumor or antiviral effects, enhancing the immune response, particularly by promoting the regeneration and repair of damaged or inflamed mucosa (Kamazeri et al. 2012). Due to its potent pharmacological action, this plant extract has begun to attract some significant attention. Borneol is extracted from the essential oil of various subtropical and evergreen broad-leaved such as Cinnamomum and Lauraceae, and a bicyclic monoterpenoid alcohol commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine as the adjuvant for more than 1500  years (Jiang et al. 2008).

40|$|As {{the cost}} of drug {{development}} is always many times more than that of drug discovery, predictive methods aiding in the screening of bioavailable drug candidates are of profound significance. In this paper, a novel method for screening bioactive compounds from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) was developed by using living cell extract and gas chromatography (GC) -mass spectrometer (MS). The method was validated by using elemene emulsion injection (EEI), a typical TCM with known active compound, to interact with murine ascites hepatocarcinoma cell strain with high metastatic potential (HCa-F). Finally, the method was applied to screen the bioactive compounds from multi-component <b>zedoary</b> turmeric oil and glucose injection (ZTOGI). After HCa-F cells was incubated in ZTOGI, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) was used to extract the compounds in the cells for GC-MS analysis. Fourteen compounds were detected in the desorption eluate of HCa-F cell extract of ZTOGI, and further identified by MS. Curzerene and beta-elemene {{were found to be}} two major bioactive compounds in ZTOGI. These results show that the method developed may be applied to quickly screen the potential bioactive components in TCMs interacting with the target cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Curcumol, {{isolated}} from the traditional medical plant Rhizoma Curcumae, is the bioactive component of <b>Zedoary</b> oil, whose potential anti-tumor effect has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Though many researchers have reported curcumol and its bioactivity, the potential molecular mechanism for its anti-cancer effect in colorectal cancer LoVo cells still remains unclear. In the present study, we found that curcumol showed growth inhibition and induced apoptosis of LoVo cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The occurrence of its proliferation inhibition and apoptosis came with suppression of IGF- 1 R expression, and then increased the phosphorylation of p 38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), which might result in a cascade response by inhibiting the CREB survival pathway and finally triggered Bax/Bcl- 2 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP- 1) apoptosis signals. Moreover, curcumol inhibited colorectal cancer in xenograft models of nude mice. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis revealed that curcumol could decrease the expression of ki- 67, Bcl- 2 as well as CREB 1, and increase the expression of Bax and the phosphorylation of p 38, which were consistent with our in vitro study. Overall, our in vitro and in vivo data confirmed the anti-cancer activity of curcumol, which was related to a significant inhibition of IGF- 1 R and activation of p 38 MAPKs, indicating that curcumol may be a potential anti-tumor agent for colorectal carcinoma therapy...|$|E
40|$|Hyperplasia of {{synovial}} membrane in {{rheumatoid arthritis}} (RA) {{is a critical}} pathological foundation for inducing articular injury. The janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak-STAT) pathway plays {{a critical role in}} synovial membrane proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). To explore the anti-cell proliferation mechanism of curcumol, a pure monomer extracted from Chinese medical plant <b>zedoary</b> rhizome, the changes of Jak 2 -STAT 1 / 3 signal pathway-related molecules in synoviocytes were observed in vitro. In this study, the fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in patients with RA were collected and cultured. The following parameters were measured: cell proliferation (WST- 1 assay), cell cycles (fluorescence-activated cell sorting, FACS), STAT 1 and STAT 3 activities (electrophoretic mobility shift assay, EMSA), and the protein expressions of phosphorylated Jak 2, STAT 1, and STAT 3 (Western blot). It was shown that curcumol could inhibit the RA-FLS proliferation and DNA synthesis induced by PDGF-BB in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. The transcription factors activities of STAT 1 and STAT 3 were obviously elevated after PDGF-BB stimulation (P < 0. 05). Super-shift experiments identified the STAT 1 or STAT 3 proteins in the complex. Furthermore, the different concentration curcumol could downregulate the DNA binding activities of STAT 1 and STAT 3 (P < 0. 05) and inhibit the phosphorylation of Jak 2 while it had no effect on the protein expressions of STAT 1 and STAT 3. Positive correlations were found between changes of cell proliferation and DNA-binding activities of STAT 1 and STAT 3, respectively (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, curcumol might suppress the FLS proliferation and DNA synthesis induced by PDGF-BB through attenuating Jak 2 phosphorylation, downregulating STAT 1 and STAT 3 DNA-binding activities, which could provide theoretical foundation for clinical treatment of RA...|$|E
