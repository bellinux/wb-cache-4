5|$|Unlike early models, {{the current}} {{structures}} {{are made up}} of six sections attached together by <b>zippers</b> and Velcro to allow quick replacement if damaged by a plane. Prior to May 2008, the races had used more than eight tons of fabric for the various pylons, and the average life of each pylon was 15 races. Thirty-five pylons are transported to each race, and at each race's completion, the pylons are sent to Innsbruck, Austria to be repaired.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zippers</b> are {{lines of}} paler hairs running {{vertically}} {{along the back}} of the animal's leg, usually from the hoof to the knee. Because they consist of paler hairs and are found where horses often have feathering, <b>zippers</b> are considered by some to be guard hairs.|$|E

40|$|We have {{observed}} a common sequence motif in membrane proteins, {{which we call}} a glycine <b>zipper.</b> Glycine <b>zipper</b> motifs are strongly overrepresented and conserved in membrane protein sequences, and mutations in glycine <b>zipper</b> motifs are deleterious to function in many cases. The glycine <b>zipper</b> has a significant structural impact, engendering a strong driving force for right-handed packing against a neighboring helix. Thus, {{the presence of a}} glycine <b>zipper</b> motif leads directly to testable structural hypotheses, particularly for a subclass of glycine <b>zipper</b> proteins that form channels. For example, we suggest that the membrane pores formed by the amyloid-β peptide in vitro are constructed by glycine <b>zipper</b> packing and find that mutations in the glycine <b>zipper</b> motif block channel formation. Our findings highlight an important structural motif {{in a wide variety of}} normal and pathological processes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the seismic performance of <b>zipper</b> frames, three 10 -storey structure models, including a <b>zipper</b> frame with tension <b>zipper</b> columns, a <b>zipper</b> frame with weak <b>zipper</b> columns and a chevron braced frame, were designed. Some indexes, including the natural periods, steel consumption and dynamic response under frequent and rare earthquakes, were analyzed and compared. The results show that, the dynamic responses of the three structures are similar {{to each other and}} all of them can meet the requirement of “no-damage under frequent earthquakes ” and “no-collapse under rare earthquakes ” provided by the GB 50011 code, but the steel consumption for the <b>zipper</b> frames is less than that of the chevron braced frames, indicating the comprehensive seismic performance of the <b>zipper</b> frame is better than the chevron braced frame. However, it is also found that the design method of the <b>zipper</b> columns is conservative and a more reasonable design method of the <b>zipper</b> columns is needed to be provided...|$|R
25|$|Back zipper : Although back closings using buttons {{were common}} on {{sleepers}} {{made before the}} 1950s, <b>zippers</b> in the back are uncommon in regular children's sleepers. A back zipper may {{make it difficult for}} the wearer to remove the sleeper for bathroom use. Most examples in regular sleepers date from the 1950-1970s as back <b>zippers</b> became less prevalent in the 1980s. Today, back <b>zippers</b> can most commonly be found on sleepers for wearers where it is advantageous to prevent the wearer removing their sleeper, especially those who wear diapers and have a tendency to remove them.|$|E
25|$|Schiaparelli {{is one of}} the {{designers}} credited with offering the first clothes with visible <b>zippers</b> in 1930. Rather than being concealed, <b>zippers</b> became a key element of Schiaparelli's designs, visibly fastening necklines and running down sleeves and skirts. She used chunky plastic <b>zippers</b> made from cellulose nitrate, the first semi-synthetic plastic fabric, and cellulose acetate. Along with Charles James, Schiaparelli had arrangements with the manufacturers to promote their zip fasteners, using specific brands depending on where the garment would be sold (such as Éclair for Paris models, Lightning Fastener Co. for London models, and Hookless Fastener Co. zips for American export models).|$|E

50|$|The {{airtight}} <b>zipper</b> {{is built}} like a standard toothed <b>zipper,</b> but with a waterproof sheeting (which is made of fabric-reinforced polyethylene and is bonded {{to the rest of}} the suit) wrapped around the outside of each row of <b>zipper</b> teeth. When the <b>zipper</b> is closed, the two facing sides of the plastic sheeting are squeezed tightly against one another (between the C-shaped clips) both above and below the <b>zipper</b> teeth, forming a double seal.|$|R

25|$|On metal toothed <b>zippers,</b> the {{cut edges}} of the {{rubberized}} fabric of the zipper tapes are susceptible to fraying along the exposed weave. if not trimmed, the frayed edges can accelerate damage to the weave and eventually delaminate the edge. The moulded plastic <b>zippers</b> {{do not have an}} exposed cut edge, so do not have this weakness.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers have {{expressed}} concern about the Velcro on the ACU. Dirt and mud can clog the hooks and loops or they can wear out with use, requiring the use of cleaning brushes for clearing the Velcro as part of daily maintenance. <b>Zippers</b> have also been a topic of concern. Soldiers also expressed concern because the <b>zippers</b> (as with any zipper) can bind up, and render the uniform uncomfortable to wear, especially with body armor.|$|E
25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} <b>zippers</b> rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the zipper tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular <b>zippers.</b> If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth <b>zippers</b> have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E
40|$|SummaryUnidirectional <b>zippering</b> {{is a key}} step in neural tube closure {{that remains}} poorly understood. Here, we combine {{experimental}} and computational approaches to identify the mechanism for <b>zippering</b> in a basal chordate, Ciona intestinalis. We show that myosin II is activated sequentially from posterior to anterior along the neural/epidermal (Ne/Epi) boundary {{just ahead of the}} advancing <b>zipper.</b> This promotes rapid shortening of Ne/Epi junctions, driving the <b>zipper</b> forward and drawing the neural folds together. Cell contact rearrangements (Ne/Epi + Ne/Epi → Ne/Ne + Epi/Epi) just behind the <b>zipper</b> lower tissue resistance to <b>zipper</b> progression by allowing transiently stretched cells to detach and relax toward isodiametric shapes. Computer simulations show that measured differences in junction tension, timing of primary contractions, and delay before cell detachment are sufficient to explain the speed and direction of <b>zipper</b> progression and highlight key advantages of a sequential contraction mechanism for robust efficient <b>zippering...</b>|$|R

25|$|Manufacturing {{processes}} mainly {{depend on}} the material of the shell. Most suit shells are currently assembled by stitching the seams, which {{in the case of}} neoprene suits are first butt-glued, and are then overlock stitched and waterproofed by glued seam tape. DUI use a liquid polyurethane sealing compound over the seams {{on the inside of the}} suit instead of tape, and the rubber-coated Viking suits are dipped and heat cured for a seamless waterproof layer. DUI crushed neoprene suit shells are assembled before crushing the bubbles by hydrostatic pressure, then adding seals, <b>zippers</b> and accessories.|$|E
25|$|Most uppers have a mechanism, such as laces, straps with buckles, <b>zippers,</b> elastic, velcro straps, buttons, or snaps, for {{tightening}} the upper on the foot. Uppers with laces {{usually have a}} tongue that helps seal the laced opening and protect the foot from abrasion by the laces. Uppers with laces also have eyelets or hooks {{to make it easier}} to tighten and loosen the laces and to prevent the lace from tearing through the upper material. An aglet is the protective wrapping on the end of the lace.|$|E

25|$|The zipper is {{a popular}} device for {{temporarily}} joining two edges of fabric. <b>Zippers</b> are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago {{who was the first}} to invent, conceive of the idea, and to construct a workable zipper. Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of the zipper to be used on shoes. He also conceived the idea of the slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the zipper. Patents were issued to Judson for the zipper in 1891, 1894, and 1905.|$|E

25|$|The systems {{described}} above are ideal types: real systems may present themselves as hybrids of those categories. Consider, for example, that {{the production of}} jeans involves initially carding, spinning, dyeing and weaving, then cutting the fabric in different shapes and assembling the parts in pants or jackets by combining the fabric with thread, <b>zippers</b> and buttons, finally finishing and distressing the pants/jackets before being shipped to stores. The beginning {{can be seen as}} process production, the middle as part production and the end again as process production: it's unlikely that a single company will keep all the stages of production under a single roof, therefore the problem of vertical integration and outsourcing arises. Most products require, from a supply chain perspective, both process production and part production.|$|E

40|$|We propose <b>Zipper,</b> {{a compact}} {{representation}} of incidence and adjacency for manifold triangle meshes with fixed connectivity. <b>Zipper</b> uses on average only 6 bits per triangle, {{can be constructed}} in linear space and time, and supports all standard randomaccess and mesh traversal operators in constant time. Similarly to the previously proposed LR (Laced Ring) approach, the <b>Zipper</b> construction reorders vertices and triangles along a nearly Hamiltonian cycle called the ring. The 4. 4 x storage reduction of <b>Zipper</b> over LR results from three contributions: (1) For most triangles, <b>Zipper</b> stores a 2 -bit delta (plus three additional bits) rather than a full 32 -bit reference. (2) <b>Zipper</b> modifies the ring {{to reduce the number}} of exceptional triangles. (3) <b>Zipper</b> encodes the remaining exceptional triangles using 2. 5 x less storage. In spite of these large savings in storage, we show that <b>Zipper</b> offers comparable performance to LR and other data structures in mesh processing applications. <b>Zipper</b> may also serve as a compact indexed format for rendering meshes, and hence is valuable even in applications that do not require adjacency information. Key words: triangle meshes, mesh connectivity, Hamiltonian cycle, differential coding 1...|$|R
25|$|Swing {{blended with}} other genres {{to create new}} styles. In country music, artists such as Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican and Bob Wills {{introduced}} many elements of swing along with blues to create a genre called western swing. Gypsy swing is an outgrowth of Venuti and Lang's jazz violin swing. Swing revivals have occurred periodically from the late 1960s to the 2000s. In the late-1980s (into the early 1990s) a trendier, more urban-styled swing-beat emerged called new jack swing, spearheaded by Teddy Riley. In the late 1990s and into the 2000s there was a swing revival, led by Squirrel Nut <b>Zippers,</b> Brian Setzer, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and Lavay Smith. In Canada, {{some of the early}} 2000s records by The JW-Jones Blues Band included swing revival elements.|$|E
25|$|Some {{designs of}} dress shoes {{can be worn}} by either gender. The {{majority}} of dress shoes have an upper covering, commonly made of leather, enclosing most of the lower foot, but not covering the ankles. This {{upper part of the}} shoe is often made without apertures or openings, but may also be made with openings or even itself consist of a series of straps, e.g. an open toe featured in women's shoes. Shoes with uppers made high to cover the ankles are also available; a shoe with the upper rising above the ankle is usually considered a boot but certain styles may be referred to as high-topped shoes or high-tops. Usually, a high-topped shoe is secured by laces or <b>zippers,</b> although some styles have elastic inserts to ease slipping the shoe on.|$|E
25|$|The car is spartan, {{although}} it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle storage. Side curtains of fabric and clear plastic operated by <b>zippers</b> can be inserted into the door and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, {{for the first time since}} release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.|$|E
