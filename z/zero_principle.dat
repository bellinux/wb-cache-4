40|$|Thermodynamics: a {{crash course}} 1. 1 Thermodynamic {{equilibrium}} states From a mechanical point of view, the equilibrium state of an elastic wire is characterized by its length L, that can be changed applying a tension (force) T on the extremes. The resulting length is an increasing function of τ: L = F (T). We also observe that this function F depends also on the temperature θ of the wire, typically increasing with θ. The first object of thermodynamics is to introduce this parameter θ, whose definition (or measurement) is much more delicate than L or T. The definition of temperature goes through first defining when two systems are at the same temperature, by {{what is called the}} 0 th principle of thermodynamics 1 If a system A remains in equilibrium when isolated and placed in thermal contact first with system B and then with system C, the equilibrium of B and C will not be disturbed when they are placed in contact with each other. Here “remains in equilibrium ” means that the relation between L and T does not change. We also use here the concept of isolated system and thermal contact, that require respectively the notion of adiabatic wall and conductive wall. The system A and B are separated by an adiabatic wall if they can have 1 The numbering of the principles in thermodynamics follows a inverse chronological order: the second principle was postulated by Carnot in 1824, the first principle was clearly formulated by Helmholtz and Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1848, while the need of the <b>zero</b> <b>principle</b> was realized by Fowler in 1931.

The QKD protocol is therefore shown to be secure against collective attacks and for some coherent attacks.

Additionally, we give the filters and measurements which achieve these optimal values. We find that over any distance in this channel the quantum bit error rate is identically <b>zero,</b> in <b>principle,</b> and the states in the protocol are always able to violate a Bell inequality.
