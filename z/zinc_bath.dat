30|$|Electroplating is {{a widely}} used {{technique}} to protect metal pieces from corrosion. There are different types of electroplating systems. Chromium electroplating and anodizing tanks are among the largest sources of chromium emissions in the USA. However, the use of <b>zinc</b> in electroplating <b>baths</b> is also widespread. The monitoring of additives in electrolytic baths is a fundamental task for proper coatings. Benzylideneacetone (BDA), benzoic acid (BA), and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) are easily found among the additives used in <b>zinc</b> <b>baths</b> (Barriola et al. 2012). Many of these additives can act as metal ligands affecting {{the efficiency of the}} recovery and/or wastewater treatment processes. Spent plating baths and some rinsing solutions use conventional treatment methods based on alkaline precipitation, but these processes generate large amounts of hazardous plating sludge that require dumping sites.|$|R

50|$|Production of {{galvannealed}} {{sheet steel}} begins with {{hot dip galvanization}} of sheet steel. After passing through the galvanizing <b>zinc</b> <b>bath</b> the sheet steel passes through air knives to remove excess zinc, and is then heated in an annealing furnace for several seconds causing iron and zinc layers to diffuse into one another causing the formation of zinc-iron alloy layers at the surface. The annealing step is performed with the strip still hot after the galvanizing step, with the zinc still liquid. The galvanising bath contains slightly over 0.1% aluminium, added to form a layer bonding between the iron and coated zinc. Annealing temperatures are around 500 to 565 °C. Pre-1990 annealing lines used gas-fired heating; post-1990s the use of induction furnaces became common.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{quaternary}} ammonium compounds on the electrodeposition of ZnCo alloys from an alkaline chloride-gluconate electrolyte was studied. A thermodynamic {{analysis was performed}} which indicated that Zn(OH) 4 2 - should be the predominant zinc species, whereas for cobalt the mixed hydroxy-gluconate complexes CoL 3 (OH) 2 and CoL(OH) 2 {{are expected to be}} prevalent. The electrodeposition of the alloy from this alkaline medium was found to be anomalous, but increasing the cobalt content in the bath caused the cobalt content in the deposit to increase. The effects of three quaternary ammonium compounds, N-benzyl- 3 -carboxylpyridinium chloride (3 NCP), N-benzyl-triethylammonium chloride, and tetraethylammonium hydroxide, on the electrochemical behavior of ZnCo deposition were studied. The incorporation of these additives in the electrolytes modified the composition, morphology, and crystallographic structure of the ZnCo-alloy deposits. Cyclic voltammetry indicated the formation of several alloy phases as cobalt was added to these <b>zinc</b> <b>baths.</b> 3 NCP had the greatest impact on the process, limiting the Co content and changing the structure of the deposit...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{identify}} the influence of <b>zinc</b> <b>bath</b> temperature on the morphology, texture and corrosion behavior of hot-dip galvanized coatings. Hot-dip galvanized samples were prepared at temperature {{in the range of}} 450 - 480 °C in steps of 10 °C, which is the conventional galvanizing temperature range in the galvanizing industries. The morphology of coatings was examined with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The composition of the coating layers was determined using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The texture of the coatings was evaluated using X-ray diffraction. Corrosion behavior was performed using salt spray cabinet test and Tafel extrapolation test. From the experimental results, it was found that increasing the <b>zinc</b> <b>bath</b> temperature affects the morphology of the galvanized coatings provoking the appearance of cracks in the coating structure. These cracks prevent formation of a compact structure. In addition, it was concluded that (00. 2) basal plane texture component was weakened by increasing the <b>zinc</b> <b>bath</b> temperature and, conversely, appearance of (10. 1) prism component, (20. 1) high angle pyramidal component and low angle component prevailed. Besides, coatings with strong (00. 2) texture component and weaker (20. 1) components have better corrosion resistance than the coatings with weak (00. 2) and strong (20. 1) texture components. Furthermore, corrosion resistance of the galvanized coatings was decreased by increasing the <b>zinc</b> <b>bath</b> temperature...|$|E
