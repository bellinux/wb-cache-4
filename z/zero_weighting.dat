A special variant of the IFT criterion is used, where <b>zero</b> <b>weighting</b> is applied during the transient response. The result of the IFT method is compared {{with the results of}} three tuning schemes commonly used in industry. It turns out that the IFT method always performs as good as or better than the other methods...|$|E

40|$|We examine Dirichlet series which {{combine the}} data of a {{distance}} function, u, a homogeneous degree <b>zero</b> <b>weighting</b> function 2 ̆ 6 phiv;, and a multivariable Dirichlet series, K. By using an integral representation and Cauchy 2 ̆ 7 s residue formula, we show that under certain conditions on K, such functions extend to meromorphic functions on C, or to some region strictly larger than the domain of absolute convergence, and have real poles and polynomial growth in vertical strips. When 2 ̆ 6 phiv; 1, we also do this for u which come from completely nonvanishing polynomials on Rn 3 ̆e 0. Using standard Tauberian results, this allows us to deduce estimates for counting functions of points in expanding regions. We show {{that some of these}} results can be generalized to multivariable mixed zeta functions, and we use these to prove relations between coefficients of Laurent series of different Dirichlet series at s= 0. ...|$|E

The study of <b>zero</b> <b>weight</b> spaces in irreducible representations of G {{has been a}} topic of considerable interest; there are many works which study the <b>zero</b> <b>weight</b> space as a representation space for the Weyl group. In this paper, we study the variation on the dimension of the <b>zero</b> <b>weight</b> space as the irreducible representation varies over the set of dominant integral weights for T which are lattice points in a certain polyhedral cone. The theorem proved here asserts that the <b>zero</b> <b>weight</b> spaces have dimensions which are piecewise polynomial functions on the polyhedral cone of dominant integral weights.

40|$|Cane {{fibre content}} has {{increased}} {{over the past ten}} years. Some of that increase can be attributed to new varieties selected for release. This paper reviews the existing methods for quantifying the fibre characteristics of a variety, including fibre content and fibre quality measurements – shear strength, impact resistance and short fibre content. The variety selection process is presented and it is reported that fibre content has <b>zero</b> <b>weighting</b> in the current selection index. An updated variety selection approach is proposed, potentially replacing the existing selection process relating to fibre. This alternative approach involves the use of a more complex mill area level model that accounts for harvesting, transport and processing equipment, taking into account capacity, efficiency and operational impacts, along with the end use for the bagasse. The approach will ultimately determine a net economic value for the variety. The methodology lends itself to a determination of the fibre properties that {{have a significant impact on}} the economic value so that variety tests can better target the critical properties. A low-pressure compression test is proposed as a good test to provide an assessment of the impact of a variety on milling capacity. NIR methodology is proposed as a technology to lead to a more rapid assessment of fibre properties, and hence the opportunity to more comprehensively test for fibre impacts at an earlier stage of variety development...|$|E
40|$|Decisions {{concerning}} activities" both in:,the personal sphere and {{in industry}} and 'government, {{may be considered}} as being {{the result of a}} choosing process effected on a collection of possibilities (activities, projects, measures etc.). Any estimable consequences of the possibilities considered can also be included in the choosing process, so that necessary efforts and expected results can both play a role. On some occasions these consequences are objectively determined, measured and quantitatively known. On others, they are subjectively determined, estimated and only qualitatively appraised. There has been no lack, during the last few decades, of attempts to make the decision making process explicit or to develop decision-making models. There is extensive documentation concerning the application of such models in many specialized fields, including transport, traffic and traffic safety. In particular, considerable attention has been devoted to cost benefit analyses. This is in fact a book-keeping type of estimation in which the problems lie mainly in assigning financial values to phenomena which have no demonstrable value in terms of money, but can exert such an effect on welfare that they deserve high priority when policies are; being drawn up. This is particularly the case where life, health, possibilities of human development, joie de vivre, and comparable human values are at stake. It is no wonder that it is publications on cost/benefit analysis in the field of traffic safety in particular that give this problem such an emphasis. A decision making criterion that only considers the financial consequences of traffic accidents is difficult to accept, keeping in mind that it is this factor of human suffering caused by injuries and fatal accidents that, while difficult to quantify, gave so much priority to combating traffic hazards. The need for an effective decision making technique able to contribute to an optimal determination of priorities is still just as valid. Reactions in the documentation to methods of cost/benefit analysis vary from tense expectation to expressions such as "nonsense on stilts". In what follows, a decision making model will be put forward that has been developed for solving policy problems {{in such a way that}} in addition to the financial aspect, one or more welfare aspects will play a role. The contribution of a measure to general welfare is calculated as the weighted sum of the effects per component of welfare. The ratio of the increase of general welfare to the costs of bringing about the measure is used as a comparison factor. The cost/benefit model can be regarded as a special case in which all other than financial components are assigned a <b>zero</b> <b>weighting.</b> Three essentially different types of decision making problems can be distinguished: 1. Must a measure be brought into effect or not? 2. Which of two more available measures is preferable? 3. Which of a group of mutually compatible measures or projects should be given priority? The model has been developed for solving the third type of decision making problem, but can also be useful for the two other types...|$|E
