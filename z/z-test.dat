After the first step of variant calling, germline and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations are removed in CAPP-seq to reduce the background biases. Several statistical significance tests can be performed against background to all type of variant calling. For example, statistical significance of tumor-derived SNVs can be estimated by random sampling of background alleles using Monte Carlo method. For the indel calls, statistical significance is calculated applying a separate method that used a strand specific analysis by <b>Z-test</b> shown in previous work. Finally, a computational validation steps reduces the false positive calls. However, a robust computational framework specific for CAPP-seq data analysis is a high demand in this field.|$|E

[...] Normality of the individual data values is not required if these conditions are met. [...] By the central limit theorem, sample means of moderately large samples are often well-approximated by a normal distribution even if the data are not normally distributed. [...] For non-normal data, the distribution {{of the sample}} variance may deviate substantially from a χ2 distribution. [...] However, if the sample size is large, Slutsky's theorem implies that {{the distribution of the}} sample variance has little effect on the distribution of the test statistic.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT BACKGROUND: It has {{recently}} been proposed that major depression disorder (MDD) may, in a heterogeneous population-based cohort, be interpreted {{in terms of a}} random-mood model. Mood fluctuations are thought to result from stressors that occur randomly in time. We have investigated whether this concept also holds for more homogeneous groups, defined by known determinants for MDD, and whether the model's parameters, susceptibility (Z) and relaxation time (T), may be evaluated and used to differentiate between subcohorts. MethodFrom a large epidemiological survey, the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), data on the duration of MDD were obtained for subcohorts, based on gender, severity of depression, recurrence and co-morbidity with dysthymia, anxiety and somatic disorder, and were compared with random-mood simulation calculations. RESULTS: Susceptibility, Z, is empirically found to be proportional to incidence and may be identified with a risk ratio. A second scaling rule states the proportionality of mean duration with the product of Z and T. This <b>Z-T</b> classification proves to be more sensitive than conventional significance tests. Notably for men/women and for co-morbid anxiety, differences are seen that have previously gone unnoticed. CONCLUSIONS: Depression may be conceptualized as a disorder resulting from random-mood fluctuations, the response to which is influenced by a large variety of determinants or risk factors. The model's parameters can be evaluated and may be used in differentiating between risk factor-defined subgroups...|$|R

The {{concentration}} {{and distribution of}} Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd in the soils from Zlatna and Copşa Mică (Romania) highly polluted by metallurgical activity, have been studied in the soil profile for different types of soils related with the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the soils. In Zlatna area, there have been studied the Aluviosol, Dystricambosol and Alosol types and in Copşa Mică area the Aluviosol and Phaeozem types. Content of humus, pH, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, organic carbon, C/N ratio, nutrient elements, texture and the heavy metals concentration in total and mobile form were determined for each pedogenetic horizon. The heavy metals concentration varies within the soil profiles related with different properties of the soils and with the metal species. The highest concentrations of lead, of 245 ppm to 763 ppm, are in relation with the organic horizons, in conditions of acid pH (3. 12 – 3. 85) of Dystricambosols and of Alosols from Zlatna zone, and of 561 ppm to 2768 ppm in Aluviosols and Phaeozems from Copşa Mică area, in conditions of alkaline pH. Lead contents decrease suddenly, under the maximum allowable limit in C horizons within the soil profiles. The affinity of Pb for surface horizons is emphasized by the excessive contents of global samples of 995 ppm in <b>Z-T,</b> 980 ppm in Z- 2 and of 5000 ppm in CM-T. The copper contents o...|$|R
40|$|Historic methods (the {{time lag}} approach, the {{velocity}} approach, and the <b>Z-t</b> approach), utilized to reduce two stage borehole test data, were evaluated. Two {{of the historic}} methods provided viable results and were used for this research project. Additionally, these two methods are recommended for reducing two stage borehole test data in the future. Flexible wall permeameter and soil index laboratory testing were conducted on the soil used to construct three environmentally controlled compacted clay liners (test pads) to develop a zone of acceptance (placement window). Using {{the results from the}} laboratory testing, two acceptance criterions were evaluated, while one criterion was used for construction purposes and is recommended. Two stage borehole testing was conducted in Test Pads 1 and 2, while sealed double ring infiltrometer testing was conducted in Test Pad 3. After in-situ hydraulic conductivity testing was completed for Test Pads 1 and 2, Shelby tube and hand carved samples were obtained and laboratory testing was performed on the samples. Time domain reflectometry probes and tensiometers were used to monitor the movement of the wetting front during testing conducted in Test Pad 3. Hydraulic conductivity results obtained from each testing method were compared. The laboratory obtained hydraulic conductivity values from testing conducted on Shelby tube samples were compared to laboratory hydraulic conductivity values obtained from testing conducted on hand carved samples. The laboratory hydraulic conductivity values obtained from testing conducted on Shelby tube and hand carved samples were compared to field hydraulic conductivity values obtained from two stage borehole hydraulic conductivity testing. The field hydraulic conductivity values obtained from two stage borehole hydraulic conductivity testing were compared to field hydraulic conductivity values obtained from sealed double ring infiltrometer hydraulic conductivity testing. Collection of soil specimens using Shelby tubes causes the soil to compress and thereby changes the soil parameters (unit weight and hydraulic conductivity).

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth [© American Geophysical Union]. The North Pacific contains active mid-oceanic ridges and the oldest, Jurassic (166. 8 ± 4 Ma), drilled oceanic crust. Its bathymetry is therefore critical to studies of the applicability of thermal contraction models (e. g., the infinite half-space and cooling plate) to the subsidence of seafloor with crustal age. The bathymetry, however, contains seamounts and oceanic islands (e. g., Mid-Pacific Mountains), oceanic plateaus (e. g., Hess, Magellan, and Shatsky), and midplate topographic swells (e. g., Hawaii), which are unrelated to the current plate-scale thermal state of the oceanic lithosphere. We use here a regional-residual separation algorithm called MiMIC to remove these features and to isolate the depths associated with the subsidence of North Pacific oceanic crust. These depths, z (m), increase with time, t (Ma), as z = 3010 + 307 until 85 Ma. For greater ages the depths “flatten” and asymptotically approach ∼ 6. 1 km and are well described by z = 6120 − 3010 exp(− 0. 026 t). The flattening is not “abrupt” as recently described in <b>z-t</b> curves produced using the mean, median, and mode. As a result, the depths of both young and old seafloor are fit well (mean difference between and observed and calculated depths of 75 ± 54 m 1 σ) by a single cooling plate model. Using a thermal conductivity, k, of 3. 138 mW m− 2 as previous studies, however, gives a plate of similar thickness (i. e., thermal thickness, L, of ∼ 115 km) but one which is unreasonably hot (i. e., temperature {{at the base of the}} plate, Tb, of 1522 °C) and inexpansive (i. e., coefficient of thermal expansion, α, of 2. 57 × 10 − 5 °C− 1).
