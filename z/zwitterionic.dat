5|$|Psilocybin is an {{alkaloid}} that is soluble in water, methanol and aqueous ethanol, but insoluble {{in organic}} solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether. Its pKa values {{are estimated to}} be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a <b>zwitterionic</b> structure.|$|E
5|$|While lipid tails {{primarily}} modulate bilayer phase behavior, {{it is the}} headgroup {{that determines}} the bilayer surface chemistry. Most natural bilayers are composed primarily of phospholipids, although sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and sterols such as cholesterol are also important components. Of the phospholipids, the most common headgroup is phosphatidylcholine (PC), accounting for about half the phospholipids in most mammalian cells. PC is a <b>zwitterionic</b> headgroup, as it has a negative charge on the phosphate group and a positive charge on the amine but, because these local charges balance, no net charge.|$|E
25|$|Unlike typical Claisen rearrangements {{which require}} heating, <b>zwitterionic</b> Claisen rearrangements {{take place at}} or below room temperature. The acyl {{ammonium}} ions are highly selective for Z-enolates under mild conditions.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the outer}} part of the {{membranes}} of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges {{since most of the}} lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes. Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of <b>zwitterionic</b> phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, even though {{a small portion of the}} membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged gangliosides. Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the <b>zwitterionic</b> phospholipids on the cell surface of mammalian cell membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding. However, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the electrostatic interaction, thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} betaine, N,N,N-trimethylglycine, {{was named}} after its discovery in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) in the 19th century. It is a small N-trimethylated amino acid, existing in <b>zwitterionic</b> form at neutral pH. This substance is now often called glycine betaine to distinguish it from other betaines that are widely distributed in microorganisms, plants and animals.|$|E
25|$|Thiazoles {{can react}} in cycloadditions, {{but in general}} at high {{temperatures}} due to favorable aromatic stabilization of the reactant; Diels-Alder reactions with alkynes are followed by extrusion of sulfur, and the endproduct is a pyridine; in one study, a very mild reaction of a 2-(dimethylamino)thiazole with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) to a pyridine was found to proceed through a <b>zwitterionic</b> intermediate in a formal cycloaddition to a cyclobutene, then to a 1,3-thiazepine in an 4-electron electrocyclic ring openening {{and then to a}} 7-thia-2-azanorcaradiene in an 6-electron electrocyclic ring, closing before extruding the sulfur atom.|$|E
25|$|This almost-correct {{molecule}} {{possesses a}} tricyclic guanidine group (rings A, B & C), {{along with a}} uracil ring (D). The <b>zwitterionic</b> nature of the molecule makes this highly water-soluble, {{as the presence of}} charged areas within the molecule creates a dipole effect, suiting the polar solvent. Sensitivity of key signals in the NMR spectrum to small changes in pH suggested that the uracil ring exists in a keto/enol tautomeric relationship, where a hydrogen transfer results in two distinct structures (Figure 2). It was originally proposed that a hydrogen bond between the uracil and guanidine groups in the enol tautomer would make this the dominant form.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{membranes}} of bacteria {{are rich in}} acidic phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. These phospholipid headgroups are heavily negatively charged. Therefore, the outmost leaflets of the bilayer which is exposed {{to the outside of}} the bacterial membranes are more attractive to the attack of the positively charged antimicrobial peptides. So the interaction between the positive charges of antimicrobial peptides and the negatively charged bacterial membranes is mainly the electrostatic interactions, which is the major driving force for cellular association. In addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the <b>zwitterionic</b> phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} {{behind this}} complex {{sequence of events}} are still a matter of debate. To simplify the system and allow more definitive study, many experiments have been performed in vitro with synthetic lipid vesicles. These {{studies have shown that}} divalent cations {{play a critical role in}} the fusion process by binding to negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. One role on these ions in the fusion process is to shield the negative charge on the surface of the bilayer, diminishing electrostatic repulsion and allowing the membranes to approach each other. This is clearly not the only role, however, since there is an extensively documented difference in the ability of Mg2+ versus Ca2+ to induce fusion. Although Mg2+ will induce extensive aggregation it will not induce fusion, while Ca2+ induces both. It has been proposed that this discrepancy is due to a difference in extent of dehydration. Under this theory, calcium ions bind more strongly to charged lipids, but less strongly to water. The resulting displacement of calcium for water destabilizes the lipid-water interface and promotes intimate interbilayer contact. A recently proposed alternative hypothesis is that the binding of calcium induces a destabilizing lateral tension. Whatever the mechanism of calcium-induced fusion, the initial interaction is clearly electrostatic, since <b>zwitterionic</b> lipids are not susceptible to this effect.|$|E

2500|$|Cylindrospermopsin (abbreviated to CYN, or CYL) is a cyanotoxin {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} freshwater cyanobacteria. CYN is a polycyclic uracil derivative containing guanidino and sulfate groups. It is also <b>zwitterionic,</b> making it highly water soluble. CYN is toxic to liver and kidney tissue and is thought to inhibit protein synthesis and to covalently modify DNA and/or RNA. [...] It is not known whether cylindrospermopsin is a carcinogen, but it appears to have no tumour initiating activity in mice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{xanthine}} core {{of caffeine}} contains two fused rings, a pyrimidinedione and imidazole. [...] The pyrimidinedione in turn contains two amide functional groups that exist predominately in a <b>zwitterionic</b> resonance the location {{from which the}} nitrogen atoms are double bonded to their adjacent amide carbons atoms. Hence all six of the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are sp2 hybridized and planar. Therefore, the fused 5,6 ring core of caffeine contains a total of ten pi electrons and hence according to Hückel's rule is aromatic.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} {{examples}} of this arrangement was identified by Burpitt, who recognized the rearrangement occurring in ammonium salts, which, due to their charged nature, proceeded exothermically without addition of heat—importantly, without a tetrasubstituted nitrogen, the rearrangement did not proceed. [...] Following this logic, {{much of the research}} on the 3-aza-Cope rearrangement has focused on charged <b>zwitterionic</b> versions of this reaction, as the charge distribution helps lower the activation barrier: in certain cases, the rearrangement can occur at temperatures as low as -20°C.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{separating}} the proteins by mass, {{they are treated}} with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) along with other reagents (SDS-PAGE in 1-D). [...] This denatures the proteins (that is, it unfolds them into long, straight molecules) and binds a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's length. [...] Because a protein's length (when unfolded) is roughly proportional to its mass, this is equivalent to saying that it attaches a number of SDS molecules roughly proportional to the protein's mass. [...] Since the SDS molecules are negatively charged, {{the result of this}} is that all of the proteins will have approximately the same mass-to-charge ratio as each other. [...] In addition, proteins will not migrate when they have no charge (a result of the isoelectric focusing step) therefore the coating of the protein in SDS (negatively charged) allows migration of the proteins in the second dimension (SDS-PAGE, it [...] is not compatible for use in the first dimension as it is charged and a nonionic or <b>zwitterionic</b> detergent needs to be used).|$|E

50|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanism of the}} Perkow reaction consists of a nucleophilic addition of the phosphite at the carbonyl carbon forming a <b>zwitterionic</b> intermediate. The <b>zwitterionic</b> intermediate rearranges to a cationic species while eliminating the halide.

50|$|For {{the second}} case of Janus {{particles}} which contain two distinct, but still water-soluble sides, the work of Granick's group provides some insight. Their research deals with the clustering of dipolar (<b>zwitterionic),</b> micronsized Janus particles, whose two sides are both fully water-soluble. <b>Zwitterionic</b> Janus particles are interesting {{because they do not}} behave like classical dipoles, since their size is much larger than the distance at which electrostatic attractions are strongly felt. The study of <b>zwitterionic</b> Janus particles once again demonstrates their ability to form defined clusters. However, this particular type of Janus particle prefers to aggregate into larger clusters since this is more energetically favorable because each cluster carries a macroscopic dipole which allows the aggregation of already-formed clusters into larger assemblies. Compared to aggregates formed through van der Waals interactions for homogenous particles, the shapes of the <b>zwitterionic</b> janus nanoclusters are different and the Janus clusters are less dense and more asymmetric.|$|E
