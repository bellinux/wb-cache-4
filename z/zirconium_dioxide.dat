25|$|The {{first phase}} lasted only several seconds, with {{temperatures}} locally exceeding 2600°C, when a zirconium-uranium-oxide melt formed from {{no more than}} 30% of the core. Examination of a hot particle showed a formation of Zr-U-O and UOx-Zr phases; the 0.9mm thick niobium zircaloy cladding formed successive layers of UOx, UOx+Zr, Zr-U-O, metallic Zr(O), and <b>zirconium</b> <b>dioxide.</b> These phases were found individually or together in the hot particles dispersed from the core.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{internal}} components and fuel assembly cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately , zircaloy is inert. However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas. The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction. In addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form <b>zirconium</b> <b>dioxide</b> and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.|$|E

25|$|Zirconium from zircaloy, {{together}} with other metals, reacts with water and produces <b>zirconium</b> <b>dioxide</b> and hydrogen. The production of hydrogen is a major danger in reactor accidents. The balance between oxidizing and reducing chemical environments {{and the proportion of}} water and hydrogen influences the formation of chemical compounds. Variations in the volatility of core materials influence the ratio of released elements to unreleased elements. For instance, in an inert atmosphere, the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods releases almost only cadmium. In the presence of water, the indium forms volatile indium(I) oxide and indium(I) hydroxide, which can evaporate and form an aerosol of indium(III) oxide. The indium oxidation is inhibited by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, resulting in lower indium releases. Caesium and iodine from the fission products that can react to produce volatile caesium iodide, which condenses as an aerosol.|$|E
25|$|After almost 80minutes of slow {{temperature}} rise, {{the primary}} loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, {{and it was}} believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the Zircaloy nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding <b>zirconium</b> <b>dioxide,</b> hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Crystalline bulk silicon {{is rather}} inert, but becomes more {{reactive}} at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) {{that protects the}} metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900nbsp&°C, but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950nbsp&°C and 1160nbsp&°C and when 1400nbsp&°C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600nbsp&°C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000nbsp&°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300nbsp&°C, and bromine and iodine at about 500nbsp&°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the liquid state, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as <b>zirconium</b> <b>dioxide</b> or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.|$|E

The objective of this retrieval {{study was to examine the}} tissue reactions and exposure to metal ions and wear particles in periprosthetic tissues and blood samples from patients with titanium (Ti) -based hip prostheses that were revised due to wear, osteolysis, and/or aseptic loosening. Semiquantitative, histological tissue evaluations in 30 THR-patients revealed numerous wear debris-loaded macrophages, inflammatory cells, and necrosis in both groups. Particle load was highest in tissues adjacent to loosened cemented Ti stems that contained mainly submicron <b>zirconium</b> (Zr) <b>dioxide</b> particles. Particles containing pure Ti and Ti alloy elements were most abundant in tissues near retrieved uncemented cups. Polyethylene particles were also detected, but accounted only for a small portion of the total particle number. The blood concentrations of Ti and Zr were highly elevated in cases with high abrasive wear and osteolysis. Our findings indicate that wear particles of different chemical composition induced similar inflammatory responses, which suggests that particle size and load might be more important than the wear particle composition in periprosthetic inflammation and osteolysis...|$|R
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} {{the concrete and}} the corium melt. Free and chemically bound water is released from the concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the corium mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the corium and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the corium. The oxide phase, in which the nonvolatile fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten zircaloy, iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of <b>zirconium</b> <b>dioxide</b> and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the corium penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the metal layer is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete. Decomposition of concrete and volatilization of the alkali metal compounds consumes {{a substantial amount of}} heat.|$|E

40|$|In this report, Los Alamos {{scientists}} characterize properties {{relevant to}} storage of an impure plutonium oxide (74 mass % plutonium) {{in accordance with}} the Department of Energy (DOE) standard DOE-STD- 3013 - 96. This oxide is of interest because it is the first impure plutonium oxide sample to be evaluated and it is similar to other materials that must be stored. Methods used to characterize the oxide at certain points during calcination include surface-area analyses, mass loss-on-ignition (LOI) measurements, elemental analysis, moisture-adsorption measurements, and quantitative supercritical-CO{sub 2 } extraction of adsorbed water. Significant decreases in the LOI and surface area occurred as the oxide was calcined at progressively increasing temperatures. Studies indicate that supercritical-CO{sub 2 } extraction is an effective method for removing adsorbed water from oxides. We extracted the water from powdered oxides (high-purity ZrO{sub 2 }, pure PuO{sub 2 }, and impure plutonium oxide) using CO{sub 2 } at 3000 psi pressure and 75 {degrees}C, and we quantitatively determined it by using gravimetric and dew-point procedures. The effectiveness of the extraction method is demonstrated by good agreement between the amounts of water extracted from pure <b>zirconium</b> and plutonium <b>dioxides</b> and the mass changes obtained from LOI analyses. However, the amount of moisture (0. 025 mass %) extracted from the impure plutonium oxide after it had been calcined at 950 {degrees}C and stored for a period of months is much less than the LOI value (0. 97 mass %). These results imply that the impure plutonium oxide is free of adsorbed water after calcination at 950 {degrees}C, even though the sample does not satisfy the LOI requirement of < 0. 50 mass % for storage...|$|R
