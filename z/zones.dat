5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} <b>zones</b> that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these <b>zones</b> begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological <b>zones</b> demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these <b>zones.</b> These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E

50|$|The {{teams are}} divided across five zonal groups: Central <b>Zone,</b> East <b>Zone,</b> North <b>Zone,</b> South <b>Zone</b> and West <b>Zone.</b> The top two teams from Central <b>Zone,</b> East <b>Zone</b> and South <b>Zone</b> advance {{directly}} to the quarterfinals. The top two teams from each of North <b>Zone</b> and West <b>Zone</b> play in the pre-quarterfinals to determine which two teams advance to the quarterfinals.

5000|$|The <b>zone</b> {{which extends}} {{from the base of}} the {{euphotic}} <b>zone</b> to about 200 metres is sometimes called the disphotic <b>zone.</b> [...] While there is some light, it is insufficient for photosynthesis, or at least insufficient for photosynthesis at a rate greater than respiration. The euphotic <b>zone</b> together with the disphotic <b>zone</b> coincides with the epipelagic <b>zone.</b> The bottommost <b>zone,</b> below the euphotic <b>zone,</b> is called the aphotic <b>zone.</b> Most deep ocean waters belong to this <b>zone.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates and vegetation <b>zones.</b> There are over ten of these vegetation <b>zones</b> in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine <b>zones</b> in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, lodgepole and oak, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, the increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the occupation, the Allies {{controlled}} traffic between the <b>zones</b> to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western <b>zones,</b> but were tightened between Western and Soviet <b>zones</b> in 1946 to stem a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6million Germans left the Soviet zone for the west.|$|E
5|$|Many hybrid <b>zones</b> {{are known}} where the ranges of two species meet, and hybrids are {{continually}} produced in great numbers.

5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian <b>zones.</b> Approximately 53percent of riparian <b>zones</b> in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian <b>zones</b> are invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E
