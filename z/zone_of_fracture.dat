40|$|AbstractThe {{investigation}} of ductile fracture plays {{a significant role}} in achieving the required deformation without the failure of the specimen. The formability of the material can be enhanced by employing proper lubricant at the die/billet interfaces in the upsetting process. When two different lubricants are applied at the die/billet interface and deformed, the billet geometry gets truncated. After observing the experimental results at the incipient of fracture, finite element simulations were conducted to the same strain level. Four workability criterions were considered to investigate the formability of the truncated billets. The strain at which the fracture initiates can be determined and the value thus obtained using these workability criterions is termed as critical damage. With the aid of finite element analysis, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> inside the billet was observed and the accurate workability criterion was suggested...|$|E

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a serious}} and multifactorial disease. The number of people {{affected}} with osteoporosis is increasing due to the lengthening of life expectancy. Currently, unlike the genetic, nutritional and hormonal factors {{that have been the}} focus of most studies of osteoporosis, mechanical stimuli that potentially can produce an increase in bone strength have not been well studied. Studies suggest that the relationship between the health of the bone and mechanical stimuli occurs through bone adaptive remodeling, which is activated by means of the shear stress transmitted by the interstitial fluid flow. The present work consists of a finite element analysis of a femur to simulate the basic movements of the hip (flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction) to compare the shear stresses in a common <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> and in the critical mechanical strength zones of the femoral head. A comparison of the distribution and magnitude of the shear stresses was performed to estimate the movement that could induce a more rapid adaptive bone remodeling. This study {{is the first step in}} the development of a physical therapy for a preventive rehabilitation that helps to prevent patients with low bone mineral density to avoid suffering osteoporosis hip fractures. The finite element model was constructed using a free-access three-dimensional standardized femur obtained from the Instituti Ortopedici Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy. The mechanical properties and the muscular forces were obtained from a specialized bibliography.

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} processes occurring at the accretion plate boundary in plate tectonics have been investigated. Regional stresses have been investigated, arising from lateral density contrasts in the ocean lithosphere. Elastic, visco-elastic and elastic/visco-elastic models predict regional stresses in the ocean basin {{of the order of}} 0. 25 kb. Investigation of the thermal stresses created in the oceanic lithosphere {{as a consequence of the}} cooling of the ocean lithosphere as it moves away from the ridge axis, shows that tensional stresses occur in the upper lithosphere and compressional stresses in the lower lithosphere. An elastic/viscous model of the lithosphere predicts deviatoric stresses of the order of 3 kb. in the upper crust. The temperature distribution beneath the ocean ridge with magma solidifying to form crustal layer 3 has been investigated. Numerical models show that the width of the magma chamber and the thickness of the dyke complex depends on half spreading rate. If there is significant crystal settling, the width of the chamber is predicted to be considerably reduced. A critical half spreading rate of 0. 45 cm/yr is predicted, below which the intruded material solidifies instantaneously. Computations support Cann's petrological model. Investigation of the magnitude of the stresses caused by the buoyancy of a magma chamber in the lower crust at the ridge axis suggest that the magma chamber is unable to cause crustal fracture and is, alone, a dynamically stable structure. The additional stresses due to the upthrust of molten upper mantle material is required to cause crustal fracture and a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> of less than 5 km wide is predicted. The stress field created in the oceanic lithosphere by a mantle plume has been calculated analytically.

40|$|Statement of problem: Self-etching {{adhesives}} reveal lower bond strengths {{compared to}} conventional products. Furthermore, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracture</b> has been rarely examined. Objectives: This in-vitro-study evaluated the penetration depth of self-etching adhesives in human enamel {{as well as}} the bond strengths of various composite combinations. Adhesive penetration and site of fracture have been determined by means of a confocal-laser-raster-microscope (CLSM). Materials and methods: The oral and buccal surfaces of 120 human molars were polished and applicated with an Rhodamin-B-Isothiocyanat tinctured adhesive (A: AdheSE®, Ivoclar Vivadent; B: Futurabond NR®, VOCO; C: Adper Prompt L-Pop™, 3 M/Espe). Each adhesive was combined with the following composites (1 : Tetric Evo Ceram®, Ivoclar Vivadent; 2 : Grandio®, VOCO; 3 : Filtek Supreme XT™, 3 M/Espe). Subgroup 4 (separate conditioning with 37 % phosphoric acid) was studied with the respective composite. The adhesives of the control groups revealed uncoloured to eliminate negative effects of fluorescence dies on bond strength; in addition reference specimens were build only from the respective composite or from enamel. Up the adhesive a composite-block was build (3 mm) and light cured. Following, a cylinder was prepared from each specimen (ø 3 mm; n= 252), and the predetermined breaking point grinded (1 mm). Subsequently, the specimens were stored in a fluoresceinisothiocyanat containing solution for 24 hours at room temperature. The interlocking surface was studied using a CLSM before and after bond strength testing (crosshead speed: 0. 5 mm/min). Results: The adhesives A 1 - 3 [1. 3 (0. 4) µm] and B 1 - 3 [1. 5 (0. 9) µm] showed similar penetration depths (p > 0. 05; Kruskal-Wallis); C 2 [3. 1 (0. 9) µm] differed significantly from groups A 1 - 3 and B 1 - 3 (p 0. 05]. No significant differences could be observed between the groups with regard to the variable bond strength (p > 0. 05). Additional conditioning resulted in significantly higher bond strengths values in group C 4 [8. 1 (3. 9) N/mm 2] compared to A 1 [2. 0 (1. 9) N/mm 2] (p < 0. 05). The control groups did not differ significantly compared to their corresponding groups. In subgroups 1 - 3, fractures were predominantly observed inside the adhesive layer (69 %), whereas most fractures were located at the adhesive-enamel interface (67 %). The composit-resin itself revealed the least weekness (13 %). After additional etching a reduction of adhesive fractures (30 %) could be evaluated in all groups. Conclusions: The adhesives showed different penetration depths. The bond strengths did not correspond to the penetration depth of the adhesives. However, penetration depths increased with additional phosphoric acid conditioning...|$|E

40|$|Evaluation {{of surface}} {{faulting}} that may pose a hazard to prospective surface facilities {{is an important}} element of the tectonic studies for the potential Yucca Mountain high-level radioactive waste repository in southwestern Nevada. For this purpose, a program of detailed geologic mapping and trenching was done to obtain surface and near-surface geologic data that are essential for determining the location and recency of faults at a prospective surface-facilities site located east of Exile Hill in Midway Valley, near the eastern base of Yucca Mountain. The dominant tectonic features in the Midway Valley area are the north- to northeast-trending, west-dipping normal faults that bound the Midway Valley structural block-the Bow Ridge fault {{on the west side of}} Exile Hill and the Paint-brush Canyon fault on the east side of the valley. Trenching of Quaternary sediments has exposed evidence of displacements, which demonstrate that these block-bounding faults repeatedly ruptured the surface during the middle to late Quaternary. Geologic mapping, subsurface borehole and geophysical data, and the results of trenching activities indicate the presence of north- to northeast-trending faults and northwest-trending faults in Tertiary volcanic rocks beneath alluvial and colluvial sediments near the prospective surface-facilities site. North to northeast-trending faults include the Exile Hill fault along the eastern base of Exile Hill and faults to the east beneath the surficial deposits of Midway Valley. These faults have no geomorphic expression, but two north- to northeast-trending <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> exposed in excavated profiles of middle to late Pleistocene deposits at the prospective surface-facilities site appear to be associated with these faults. Northwest-trending faults include the West Portal and East Portal faults, but no disruption of Quaternary deposits by these faults is evident.

The eastern <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> is within Quaternary alluvial sediments, but no bedrock was encountered in trenches and soil pits in this part of the prospective surface facilities site; thus, the direct association <b>of</b> this <b>zone</b> with one or more bedrock faults is uncertain.

40|$|International audienceFluid {{circulation}} in <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> {{are a key}} challenge to exploit deep geothermal heat from natural reservoir. At Rittershoffen (Upper Rhine Graben, France), two geothermal boreholes, GRT- 1 and GRT- 2, were drilled in 2012 and 2014, respectively. They targeted the local Rittershoffen normal fault, which strikes N-S and dips westward. In this study, major natural fractures were observed in the open holes of both wells from acoustic image logs correlated with other standard geophysical logs (gamma ray, neutron porosity, and caliper). Their permeability was evaluated at the borehole scale from temperature logs, mud losses, and gas surveys. One originally permeable (OP) fracture zone was observed in the granite of GRT- 1. In GRT- 2, four OP fracture zones were observed in the granite and two in sandstones. In GRT- 2, fracture zones are composed by several fluid pathways that could explain the higher natural permeability than in GRT- 1. All OP fractures are associated with positive temperature anomaly, interpreted as circulation of hot geothermal water through the permeable fracture, or negative one, interpreted as the cooling of a porous, altered and fractured zone around the permeable fracture after drilling operations. Permeability <b>of</b> natural <b>fracture</b> oriented N 170 ° seems to be intimately linked to the secondary mineral deposits resulting from paleocirculations.

This means that the water table occurs at shallow depth in more prolific wells at Igboora, which emphasised that the groundwater is under pressure and rises above the fractured bedrock aquifers.

A study conducted at Cross Bar Ranch wellfield, Pasco County, Florida, demonstrates that several surface geophysical techniques can be used to delineate <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> higher yield within the wider surface expression of photolinears. Seismic refraction and d. c. electrical resistivity proved to be the most useful techniques. The geophysical signatures result from the effect of increased karstic solution on overburden thickness and stratigraphy over the inferred fracture zone. Microgravimetry also appears to be an effective technique, showing a distinctive and linearly consistent gravity low of 0. 1 – 0. 3 mGal over the inferred fracture zone. The geophysical signatures of these methods appear to delineate <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> increased <b>fracture</b> density even where overburden thicknesses exceed 20 m. However, due to the density of data needed to delineate these zones, these methods may be practical only in areas where the locations <b>of</b> such <b>zones</b> are critical, and not as a reconnaissance tool...|$|R
30|$|The Narmada-Son Lineament (NSL) is a late Archean mega geo-fracture {{extending}} {{for about}} 1200 km across the Indian peninsula in the E-W/ENE-WSW direction. Tecton-ically, this lineament is highly disturbed and reactivation of this lineament {{is believed to}} be due to the collision of the Indian plate with the Eurasian plate. As a result, the rigid continental crust has broken down along the pre-existing fracture system (Jain et al., 1984). Detailed geological studies of the region have been reported (West, 1962; Wellman and Mc Elhinny, 1970; Ghosh, 1976 etc.). The origin of the lineament {{is believed to have been}} formed in two distinctly different periods—after the commencement of the eruption of the Deccan traps, and the period prior to it. From various geological studies, this lineament is shown to be situated close to the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractures</b> belonging to early Precam-brian, Cretaceous and post-Deccan trap period. The Nar-mada valley dates back predominantly to the pre-Deccan trap period. Although the tectonic movements began significantly before the Deccan traps, it is still active as is attested by the number of earthquakes reported along the lineament (Ramalingeswara Rao and Sitapathi Rao, 1984).|$|R
50|$|The lunar {{cratering}} record {{suggests that}} the rate of impacts in the Inner Solar System 4000 million years ago was 500 times higher than today. During the Noachian, about one 100-km diameter crater formed on Mars every million years, with the rate of smaller impacts exponentially higher. Such high impact rates would have fractured the crust to depths of several kilometers and left thick ejecta deposits across the planet’s surface. Large impacts would have profoundly affected the climate by releasing huge quantities of hot ejecta that heated the atmosphere and surface to high temperatures. High impact rates probably played a role in removing much of Mars’ early atmosphere through impact erosion.By analogy with the Moon, frequent impacts produced a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>fractured</b> bedrock and breccias in the upper crust called the megaregolith. The high porosity and permeability of the megaregolith permitted the deep infiltration of groundwater. Impact-generated heat reacting with the groundwater produced long-lived hydrothermal systems that could have been exploited by thermophilic microorganisms, if any existed. Computer models of heat and fluid transport in the ancient Martian crust suggest that the lifetime of an impact-generated hydrothermal system could be hundreds of thousands to millions of years after impact.|$|R
40|$|Soft-sediment {{deformation}} {{structures are}} exposed in sea cliffs {{in the lower}} part of the Calcarenite di Gravina Formation (late Pliocene-early Pleistocene) in the Cala Corvino area N of Monopoli (Adriatic sector of the Apulian Foreland, southern Italy). Deformation affects a thickness of about 5 m involving a lower calcareous-terrigenous sand and gravel unit and an upper heavily bioturbated grainstone and packstone unit. Deformation is absent from the overlying part of the succession. Large-scale soft-sediment deformation structures are collapse features comprising irregularly elongated conical <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> sinking. In vertical section, narrow "drop" zones occur in the lower sandy-gravelly facies and large gentle folds in the upper grainstone-packstone beds. The degree of deformation decreases upwards. Small-scale soft-sediment deformation structures adjacent to the large-scale conical collapse structures are narrow, vertically elongated load structures about 2 m high and 30 - 50 cm wide that involve only the basal terrigenous facies. The distribution of small- and large-scale soft-sediment deformation structures corresponds closely to <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>fracturing</b> in the underlying Cretaceous limestones, and the elongation directions of soft-sediment deformation structures correspond to the orientation <b>of</b> major <b>fractures</b> in the limestones. The soft-sediment deformation occurred due to collapse associated with karstic sinkhole formation along fractures in the bedrock Geometrical relationships between deformed and undeformed sedimentary units show that deformation occurred in a shallow marine environment. The structures at Cala Corvino provide a rare outcrop-scale record of sinkhole-induced soft-sediment deformation occurring in a shallow marine environment...|$|R
