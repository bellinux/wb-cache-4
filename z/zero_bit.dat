50|$|This last example {{demonstrates}} that a leading <b>zero</b> <b>bit</b> {{does not always}} indicate a short code; if u < 2k, some long codes will begin with a <b>zero</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Independently, Commodore Business Machines (CBM) {{created a}} group coded {{recording}} scheme for their Commodore 2040 {{floppy disk drive}} (launched {{in the spring of}} 1979). The relevant constraints on the 2040 drive were that no more than two <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> could occur in a row, and no more than eight one bits in a row; the drive imposed no special constraint on the first bit in a byte. This allowed the use of a scheme similar to that used in [...] bpi tape drives. Every four bits of data are translated into five bits on disk, according to the following table:Inhere, no code starts with two <b>zero</b> <b>bits,</b> nor ends with two <b>zero</b> <b>bits.</b> This ensures that regardless of the input data, the encoded data will never contain more than two <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> in a row. With this encoding not more than eight one bits in a row are possible. Therefore, Commodore used sequences of ten or more one bits in a row as synchronization mark.|$|R
50|$|This code {{forces a}} {{transition}} after at most five consecutive identical bits, or four consecutive <b>zero</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Count {{the bits}} written, {{subtract}} one, and write that number of starting <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> preceding the previous bit string.|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} that finds {{the index of}} the most significant <b>zero</b> <b>bit,</b> which is a rounded version of the binary logarithm.|$|E
5000|$|Bit {{test and}} {{manipulation}} in memory: BSET (to 1), BCLR (to 0), BCHG (invert bit) and BTST (set the <b>zero</b> <b>bit</b> if tested bit is 0) ...|$|E
50|$|Data {{characters}} {{start with}} an odd parity, followed by a <b>zero</b> <b>bit.</b> This means that the character is a normal data character, followed by eight data bits.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{cause is}} [...] "losing count", as {{on a hard}} drive: if a hard drive {{encounters}} {{a long string of}} 0s, without any 1s (or a string of 1s without 0s), it may lose track of the frame between fields, and suffer bit slip.When a pulse of N consecutive <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> are sent, clock drift may cause the hardware to apparently detect N-1 <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> or N+1 <b>zero</b> bitsâ€”both kinds of errors are called bit slip.|$|R
50|$|Each 8-bit output symbol {{contains}} 4 <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> and 4 one bits, so {{the code}} can, like a parity bit, detect all single-bit errors.|$|R
50|$|Count Leading Zeros (clz) {{counts the}} number of <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> {{preceding}} the most significant one bit. For example, the clz of 0x00000F00 is 20, and the clz of 0x00000001 is 31.|$|R
50|$|With {{knowledge}} of the canonical Huffman algorithm, it is then possible to recreate the entire table (symbol and code values) from just the bit-lengths. Unused symbols are normally transmitted as having <b>zero</b> <b>bit</b> length.|$|E
5000|$|In {{case of a}} leap second, a <b>zero</b> <b>bit</b> is {{inserted}} between seconds 16 and 17. [...] In case of a negative leap second, second 16 will be deleted. Since negative leap seconds can only occur when DUT1 is positive, bits 9B through 16B will be zero.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} two <b>zero</b> <b>bit</b> codec frame types: null frames and erasure frames, similar to EVRC. One {{significant}} enhancement in EVRC-B {{is the use of}} 1/4 rate frames that were not used in EVRC. This provides lower average data rates (ADRs) compared to EVRC, for a given voice quality.|$|E
50|$|Count Trailing Zeros (ctz) {{counts the}} number of <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> {{succeeding}} the least significant one bit. For example, the ctz of 0x00000F00 is 8, and the ctz of 0x80000000 is 31.|$|R
50|$|Since 10*1 padding always adds {{at least}} two bits, in byte aligned {{libraries}} there are always six unused <b>zero</b> <b>bits.</b> Therefore, these appended extra bits never make the padded message longer.|$|R
50|$|Confirming {{that the}} header is valid always takes {{the same amount}} of time, no matter how many <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> are {{required}} for a valid header, since this requires only a single hashing operation.|$|R
50|$|The {{time needed}} to compute such a hash {{collision}} is exponential {{with the number of}} zero bits. So zero bits can be added (doubling the amount of {{time needed to}} compute a hash with each additional <b>zero</b> <b>bit)</b> until it is too expensive for spammers to generate valid header lines.|$|E
50|$|In FM encoding, {{the number}} of 0-bits that may appear between {{consecutive}} 1-bits is either 0 or 1. In MFM encoding there is a minimum of 1 <b>zero</b> <b>bit</b> between adjacent ones (there are never two adjacent one bits), and {{the maximum number of}} zeros in a row is 3. Thus, FM is a (0,1) RLL code, while MFM is a (1,3) code.|$|E
50|$|The {{instructions}} LD A,R and LD A,I {{affect the}} Z80 flags register, unlike {{all the other}} LD (load) instructions. The Sign (bit 7) and <b>Zero</b> (<b>bit</b> 6) flags are set {{according to the data}} loaded from the Refresh or Interrupt source registers. For both instructions, the Parity/Overflow flag (bit 2) is set according to {{the current state of the}} IFF2 flip-flop.|$|E
5000|$|The input message [...] {{is split}} into 256-bit blocks [...]In the case the last block [...] {{contains}} less than 256 bits, it is prepended left by <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> {{to achieve the}} desired length.|$|R
50|$|The {{disparity}} of a {{bit pattern}} {{is the difference}} in the number of one bits vs the number of <b>zero</b> <b>bits.</b> The running disparity is the running total of the disparity of all previously transmitted words.|$|R
5000|$|This code has two disadvantages. First, it {{actually}} requires an n+1-bit register {{to hold the}} [...] so that the [...] coefficient can be tested. More significantly, it requires the [...] to be padded with n <b>zero</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Classical block {{codes are}} usually decoded using hard-{{decision}} algorithms, {{which means that}} for every input and output signal a hard decision is made whether it corresponds to a one or a <b>zero</b> <b>bit.</b> In contrast, convolutional codes are typically decoded using soft-decision algorithms like the Viterbi, MAP or BCJR algorithms, which process (discretized) analog signals, and which allow for much higher error-correction performance than hard-decision decoding.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} two <b>zero</b> <b>bit</b> codec frame types: null frames and erasure frames, similar to EVRC. One {{significant}} enhancement in EVRC-B {{is the use of}} 1/4 rate frames that were not used in EVRC. This provides lower average data rates (ADRs) compared to EVRC, for a given voice quality. The new 4GV Codecs used in CDMA2000 are based on EVRC-B. 4GV is designed to allow service providers to dynamically prioritize voice capacity on their network as required.|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{ring counter}} or Overbeck counter (most probably named after Wilcox Pratt Overbeck) connects {{the output of}} the last shift register to the first shift register input and circulates a single one (or <b>zero)</b> <b>bit</b> around the ring. For example, in a 4-register one-hot counter, with initial register values of 1000, the repeating pattern is: 1000, 0100, 0010, 0001, 1000... Note that one of the registers must be pre-loaded with a 1 (or 0) in order to operate properly.|$|E
5000|$|Bob calculates the bitwise XOR of all {{the numbers}} he got in step 3 and [...] from step 4. Bob scans the result {{from left to right}} until he finds a large {{sequence}} of <b>zero</b> <b>bits.</b> Let [...] be the bit to the right of that sequence ( [...] is non <b>zero).</b> If the <b>bit</b> to the right of [...] equals 1 then [...] otherwise [...]|$|R
5000|$|In software, find {{first set}} (ffs) or find {{first one is}} a bit {{operation}} that, given an unsigned machine word, identifies the least significant index or position of the bit set to one in the word. A nearly equivalent operation is count trailing zeros (ctz) or number of trailing zeros (ntz), which counts the number of <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> following the least significant one bit. The complementary operation that finds the index or position {{of the most significant}} set bit is log base 2, so called because it computes the binary logarithm [...] This is closely related to count leading zeros (clz) or number of leading zeros (nlz), which counts the number of <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> preceding the most significant one bit. These four operations also have negated versions: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{process is}} {{repeated}} {{on the remaining}} data until fewer than four octets remain. If three octets remain, they are processed normally. If fewer than three octets (24 bits) are remaining to encode, the input data is right-padded with <b>zero</b> <b>bits</b> to form an integral multiple of six bits.|$|R
