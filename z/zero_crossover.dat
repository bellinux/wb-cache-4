40|$|Insulated gate bipolar {{transistors}} (IGBTs) {{are used in}} high-power voltage-source converters rated up to hundreds of kilowatts or even a few megawatts. Knowledge of device switching characteristics is required for reliable design and operation of the converters.

But the devices in a converter also switch low currents close to the zero crossings of the line currents. Further, the switching behaviour under these conditions could significantly influence the output waveform quality including <b>zero</b> <b>crossover</b> distortion. Hence, the switching characteristics of high-current IGBTs (300 -A and 75 -A IGBT modules) at low load current magnitudes are investigated experimentally in this paper. The collector current, gate-emitter voltage and collector-emitter voltage are measured at various low values of current (less than 10 % of the device rated current).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} growth orientation {{dependence of}} the piezoelectric polarization of InxGa 1 -xN and AlyGa 1 -yN layers lattice matched to GaN. This topic has become relevant {{with the advent of}} growing nitride based devices on semipolar planes [A. Chakraborty, Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., Part 2 44, L 945 (2005) ]. The calculations demonstrate that for strained InxGa 1 -xN and AlyGa 1 -yN layers lattice matched to GaN, the piezoelectric polarization becomes zero for nonpolar orientations and also at another point approximate to 45 degrees tilted from the c plane. The <b>zero</b> <b>crossover</b> has only a very small dependence on the In or Al content of the ternary alloy layer. With the addition of spontaneous polarization, the angle at which the total polarization equals zero increases slightly for InxGa 1 -xN, but the exact value depends on the In content. For AlyGa 1 -yN mismatched layers the effect of spontaneous polarization becomes important by increasing the crossover point to similar to 70 degrees from c-axis oriented films. These calculations were performed using the most recent and convincing values for the piezoelectric and elasticity constants, and applying Vegard's law to estimate the constants in the ternary InxGa 1 -xN and AlyGa 1 -yN layers...|$|E

The motor drive is phased to damp nutation motion to zero for stabilization. To increase the noise immunity of the system, when the output of the accelerometer falls below a threshold level, the circuitry operates in an open loop, beat mode where data representing the last accelerometer signal that exceeded that threshold level is stored, and the motor drive is controlled by the stored data. In a second version, the motor is controlled to supply a predetermined amount of nutation motion to a body undergoing testing on a spin table for energy dissipation evaluation. In each version, the use of an angular accelerometer rather than a linear accelerometer or gyro to monitor nutation enables placement of the nutation control apparatus at any location relative to the spin axis of the body requiring only crude orientation and no calibration...|$|E

ISPRS-ISRO Cartosat- 1 Scientific Assessment Programme (C-SAP) was initiated with an announcement of opportunity on January 13, 2006, through an e-mail and a web-page announcement in Commission-IV website for evaluating the mapping potential of Cartosat- 1 stereo data.

40|$|Our {{simultaneous}} multicolor (UBVRI) circular polarimetry {{has revealed}} nearly sinusoidal variation over the WD spin cycle, and almost symmetric {{positive and negative}} polarization excursions. Maximum amplitudes are observed in the B and V bands (+- 3 %). This {{is the first time}} that polarization peaking in the blue has been discovered in an IP, and suggests that V 405 Aur is the highest magnetic field IP found so far. The polarized flux spectrum is similar to those found in polars with magnetic fields in the range B ~ 25 - 50 MG. Our low resolution circular spectropolarimetry has given evidence of transient features which can be fitted by cyclotron harmonics n = 6, 7, and 8, at a field of B = 31. 5 +- 0. 8 MG, consistent with the broad-band polarized flux spectrum. Timings of the circular polarization <b>zero</b> <b>crossovers</b> put strict upper limits on WD spin period changes and indicate that the WD in V 405 Aur is currently accreting closely at the spin equilibrium rate, with very long synchronization timescales, T_s > 10 ^ 9 yr. For the observed spin to orbital period ratio, P_{spin}/P_{orb} = 0. 0365, and P_{orb} ~ 4. 15 hr, existing numerical accretion models predict spin equilibrium condition with B ~ 30 MG if the mass ratio of the binary components is q_ 1 ~ 0. 4.

Such a dependence was found experimentally for the radius of magnetic correlations in La_ 2 -xSr_xCuO_ 4. The short range Coulomb repulsion was also taken into account. It is shown that the behaviour of the system with doping is fundamentally different from the case with r_ 0 (n_f) =const. In particular, similarly to the d-wave case, the crossover in the s-channel takes place only if the coupling is larger of some minimal value, otherwise the Cooper pairing scenario takes place at any small carrier density.
