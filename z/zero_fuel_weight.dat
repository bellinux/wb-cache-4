5000|$|Installation of vortex {{generators}} {{can usually}} {{bring about a}} slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative climb performance. The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements. [...] An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>weight</b> or, if a maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>weight</b> is already specified {{as one of the}} airplane's limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>weight.</b> [...] For these reasons, vortex generator kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>weight</b> and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.|$|E

50|$|Most small {{airplanes}} do {{not have}} an MZFW specified among their limitations. For these airplanes with cantilever wings, the loading case that must be considered when determining the maximum takeoff weight is the airplane with <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> and all disposable load in the fuselage. With <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> in the wing the only wing bending relief is due to the weight of the wing.|$|R
30|$|AO {{is another}} {{important}} dependent factor related to the fuel efficiency. According to Peeters et al. [62] and Hileman et al. [32] improved aviation operations have resulted in better value of fuel efficiency. The relationships between operational efficiency and efficiency are expressed by payload fuel efficiency equation [21, 32]. Therefore, aircraft operational efficiency were {{measured in terms of}} parameters such as aircraft range [4, 51], <b>fuel</b> <b>weight,</b> reserve <b>fuel</b> <b>weight,</b> payload, aircraft speed, crew weight, takeoff filed length, and landing filed length ([2, 4, 5, 27, 29, 65]). Aircraft range is the total distance that an aircraft can fly with full fuel tank. We can improve the aircraft fuel consumption by optimizing the aircraft range. Optimized <b>fuel</b> <b>weight,</b> reserve <b>fuel</b> <b>weight,</b> and crew weight have also contributed toward the improved fuel efficiency [2, 27]. The payload rate is another operational performance indicator that is commonly used to assess fuel burn. Air transport emission can be reduced with increased payload (reduce the number of empty seats flown) while optimizing the flight frequencies. Also, optimized aircraft speed [5], has also improved the fuel efficiency of airliners [4, 65]. Optimum values of takeoff filed length, and landing filed length also affects positively the fuel efficiency. So, therefore we have included the aircraft range, <b>fuel</b> <b>weight,</b> reserve <b>fuel</b> <b>weight,</b> payload, aircraft speed, crew weight, takeoff filed length, and landing filed length to measure AO construct.|$|R

40|$|With rising {{environmental}} alarm, {{the reduction}} of critical aircraft emissions including carbon dioxides (CO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) is one of most important aeronautical problems. There can be many possible attempts to solve such problem by designing new wing/aircraft shape, new efficient engine, etc. The paper rather provides a set of acceptable flight plans {{as a first step}} besides replacing current aircrafts. The paper investigates a green aircraft design optimisation in terms of aircraft range, mission <b>fuel</b> <b>weight</b> (CO 2) and NOx using advanced Evolutionary Algorithms coupled to flight optimisation system software. Two multi-objective design optimisations are conducted to find the best set of flight plans for current aircrafts considering discretised altitude and Mach numbers without designing aircraft shape and engine types. The objectives of first optimisation are to maximise range of aircraft while minimising NOx with constant mission <b>fuel</b> <b>weight.</b> The second optimisation considers minimisation of mission <b>fuel</b> <b>weight</b> and NOx with fixed aircraft range. Numerical results show that the method is able to capture a set of useful trade-offs that reduce NOx and CO 2 (minimum mission <b>fuel</b> <b>weight)</b> ...|$|R
