40|$|Thin {{layers of}} copper micro-particles were {{deposited}} on {{the surfaces of}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) micro-veneers using atmospheric pressure plasma to improve {{the resistance of the}} surfaces to weathering. Three different loadings of copper were established. Micro-veneers were exposed to artificial weathering in a QUV weathering tester for 0, 24, 48, 96 and 144 h following the standard EN 927 - 6. Mass losses after each exposure showed significant differences between copper coated and untreated micro-veneers. Tensile strength was assessed at zero span (<b>z-strength)</b> and finite span (f-strength) under dry conditions (20 °C, 65 % RH). During 48 h, micro-veneers lost their <b>z-strength</b> progressively. In contrast, copper coating at highest loading imparts a photo-protective effect to wood micro-veneers during 144 h exhibiting <b>z-strength</b> retention of 95 %. F-strength losses were similar in all copper treated and untreated micro-veneers up to 96 h. However, after 144 h, copper coated micro-veneers at highest loading showed significantly greater strength retention of 56 %, while untreated micro-veneers exhibited only 38 %. Infrared spectroscopy suggested that copper coating does not stabilize lignin. Inductively Coupled Plasma revealed that micro-veneers coated with the highest loading exhibited the lowest percentage of copper loss. Blue stain resistance of copper coated Scots pine following the guidelines of EN 152 was performed. Additional test with different position of the coated surface was also assessed. Copper coating reduced fungal growth when coated surface is exposed in contact with vermiculite. Spores of Aureobasidium pullulans were not able to germinate on the copper coated surface positioned uppermost...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of the materials combined in corrugated board are set to give the board its strength, flexibility and protection towards impact and pressure. The raw material is of course the single fibre but additives that enhance e. g. the wet and dry paper strength are also added. As the strength enhancing additives used today are most efficient between pH 4 and pH 7 {{there is a need}} for new types of additives that can be used under alkaline conditions. In the present report polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) and polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) of PAH and polyacrylic acid (PAA) were investigated as strength enhancing additives. The components can be used under alkaline conditions and results showed that PAH alone or incorporated into a PEC gave different effects regarding strength {{properties of}} sheets from kraft pulps of different yields. The results showed that by treating the fibres with PEC´s of PAH and PAA it was possible to considerably increase the tensile properties, the <b>Z-strength</b> and the compression strength of papers made from the treated fibres. The results showed an increase of as much as 54 % to 180 % in dry <b>Z-strength</b> and 14 % to 53 % in compression strength, when using the PEC as an additive, indicating an increase in inter-fibre joint strength. It was also found that a heat treatment of the non-treated papers and of the papers from the PAH treated fibres gave a large improvement in tensile properties as well as <b>Z-strength</b> properties for the different pulps. For the PEC treated fibres it was not necessary to heat-treat the paper to achieve a higher dry strength. The molecular mechanism behind the large improvements is not identified in the present work but the problem is currently being investigated in the lab of the authors...|$|E
40|$|A {{change in}} fiber length {{is known to}} change fiber {{flocculation}} and formation of machine-made paper, {{but it has been}} unclear how a change in formation through fiber length affects strength efficiency. (The strength efficiency reflects how well the furnish strength, as indicated by the handsheet strength, is utilized in the machine-made paper.) The effect of fiber length on strength efficiency in twin-wire roll forming was presently investigated by examining two furnishes with different average fiber length, prepared from the same batch of softwood kraft pulp, over a wide range of headbox consistencies on a pilot machine. An increase in fiber length resulted not only in worse Ambertec formation over the whole range of headbox consistencies but also in faster relative deterioration of the formation with increasing consistency. Tensile strength efficiency and <b>Z-strength</b> efficiency were both reduced when the formation was impaired through increased fiber length, and the effect was similar to the effect of a corresponding change in formation through headbox consistency. A given change in formation, through fiber length or headbox consistency, had a larger relative effect on <b>Z-strength</b> efficiency than on tensile strength efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Here, the {{objective}} is to analyze estimates of the handsheet properties Scott-Bond, <b>Z-strength</b> and tensile index. It is shown that temperature profile measurements from the refining zones make it is possible to derive hidden physical phenomena that are impossible to measure inside the refining zones. Such measures are typical internal variables (consistency and fiber residence time) which can be used as predictors in multilinear models. The analysis is based on process data comprises three different chip mixtures. It is shown that the selected internal variables as predictors outperform the external variables (such as dilution water and plate clearance) in the polynomial fit. This is even more pronounced when validating the models using a holdout set. The methodology outlined in this paper makes it possible to model Scott-Bond, <b>Z-strength</b> and tensile index independently of the type of chip mixture when internal variables are used. It is also shown that the use of mean values of the handsheet properties can deteriorate the final model prediction considerably. Only about 60 % of all handsheet property samples were acceptable for modeling purposes. However, due to the extended laboratory test procedures a ranked and assured database as well as on-line models where possible to derive...|$|E
40|$|A multivariate {{statistical}} analysis of paper strength and production process data from the SCA Munksund paper mill is presented. The analysis is divided into five parts: (i) paper quality variables, (ii) process variables from the paper machine, (iii) process variables from digester and refiner, (iv) {{a combination of all}} process variables, and (v) a further analysis of the <b>z-strength.</b> Analysing the correlations between the paper strength variables, two groups of variables could be discerned: one group comprising the variables tensile strength in MD, tensile stiffness in MD, elongation in CD, and bursting strength, and another group containing the variables SCT in CD, tensile strength in CD, and tensile stiffness in CD. The strongest correlations between paper machine process variables and paper strength variables were found for the strength variables in the first of the above mentioned groups. The same strength variables were negatively correlated with the wet end process variables conductivity, base line paper machine flow, and the amount of return fibre, while they were positively correlated with the concentration at the base line refiner. Combining wet end and paper machine process variables in a regression analysis for the paper strength variables yields a limited increase in the amount of variance explained, compared with the case where only wet end process variables are used as predictors, due to the correlations between the process variables. A more detailed study of the time series of <b>z-strength</b> measurements showed that this was non-stationary, which makes it hard to fit a single over-all linear regression model which will give good predictions over the whole year -or even from one production run to another...|$|E
40|$|So far, {{chemical}} pulp fibres have been utilized as conventional stock materials for nanocellulose production. The main {{aim of this}} work is to use stock materials from mechanical or chemi-thermomechanical pulping process to produce lignin containing nanofibres, which {{are referred to as}} nano-ligno-cellulose (NLC) in this study. The present study shows the influence on handsheets of chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP) fibres blended with NLC. For comparison reasons, nanocellulose (NC) from bleached kraft pulp (BKP) was produced in a similar approach as NLC. Both the NLC and the NC were blended with their respective pulp fibres and their corresponding handsheets properties were evaluated with respect to sheet density. It was found that the handsheets of pulp fibres blended with NLC/NC improved the mechanical properties of handsheets with only a slight effect in relation to the sheet density. Improvements in strength properties of handsheets such as <b>z-strength,</b> tensile index, tear index, burst index, E-modulus, strain at break, tensile stiffness, air resistance were observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Slip rupture {{processes}} on velocity-weakening faults {{have been}} found in simulations to occur by two basic modes, the expanding crack and self-healing modes. In the expanding crack mode, as the rupture zone on a fault keeps expanding, slip continues growing everywhere within the rupture. In the self-healing mode, rupture occurs as a slip pulse propagating along the fault, with cessation of slip behind the pulse, so that the slipping region occupies only a small width {{at the front of the}} expanding rupture zone. We discuss the determination of rupture mode for dynamic slip between elastic half-spaces that are uniformly prestressed at background loading level r 0 b outside a perturbed zone where rupture is nucleated. The interface follows a rate and state law such that strength <b>z-strength</b> approaches a velocity-dependent steady-state value z-s,(V) for sustained slip at velocity V, where dz-ss(V) /dV < = 0 (velocity weakening). By proving a theorem on when a certain type of cracklike solution cannot exist, and by analyzing the results of 2 D antiplane simulations of rupture propagation for different classes of constitutive laws, and for a wide range of parameters within each, w...|$|E
40|$|Fibres become curled {{during high}} {{consistency}} treatments in the pulp mill. This changes {{the properties of}} paper, for instance it is belived that the shrinkage during drying is increased. The drying shrinkage {{is an important factor}} to control, one reason is that it can lead to misprint in multi colour printing. In this thesis the influence of fibre curl on the shrinkage and mechanical properties of paper is studied. One chemical and two mechanical methods are used to introduce different degrees of fibre curl. The papers are dried in a biaxial dryer, which allows the paper to shrink or be stretched in two directions while the stresses and strains are measured. The drying stresses occuring in the paper are used to determine the shrinkage potential of paper. Both in-plane and out-of-plane properties are evaluated. It was found that the influence of fibre curl on the shrinkage potential and tensile properties depended on the beating. Shrinkage potential and tensile strength, for unbeaten pulps, were increased with increasing fibre curl while they were decreased for beaten pulps. The <b>z-strength</b> increased with increasing fibre curl. It was also found that wet strain is the determining parameter for tensile properties, which means that the tensile properties in cross direction can be changed without affecting tensile properties in the machine direction.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{the properties}} of dry handsheets from two different mechanical pulps and one chemithermomechanical pulp and their respective long fibre fractions depend {{on the level of}} dryness to which the sheets are pressed at high temperature. Sheets were pressed and dried to different dryness levels at 400 kPa and 93 degrees C in a modified Rapid Kothen dryer. Prior to testing of the physical properties, the sheets were dried without pressure at, room temperature to full dryness and kept in a conditioning room. This was performed with the aim of evaluating the consolidation and development of final strength properties with respect to dryness after a press section in a paper machine. The most interesting finding from these trials was that the increase in density and strength were far from linear with increased press dryness, especially for the long fibre fractions when looking at the <b>Z-strength</b> development. There was a distinct inflection of the curve when the sheets reached a press dryness level of some 50 %. The most important dryness interval for internal strength development was found between 50 and 80 %. The fact that most paper and board machines press the sheet to only some 50 % dryness, before feeding it into the drying section, implies that much of the inherent strength potential of mechanical pulps may be unexploited. Further research on pressing to higher dryness levels will in the future be continued at FSCN at Mid Sweden University...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to analyze and model pulp and handsheet properties using two different approaches based on a reduced set of binomial coefficients for small data sets and constrained linear functions for larger data sets. The properties are linked to process data from the daily CTMP operation in a CD- 82 refiner. From a laboratory test program perspective, the test series was extensive and covered 80 pulp samples at different process conditions. In this paper, external variables (dilution water feed rate, specific energy and plate clearance) are compared with internal variables (consistency and fiber residence time) as predictors. It is shown that internal variables as predictors seem to outperform the external variables when estimating CSF Freeness, sheet density, tensile strength, tensile index, elongation to rupture, tensile energy absorption, tensile energy absorption index, tensile stiffness, tensile stiffness index, tear strength, tear index, short-span compressive test index, ISO brightness, Scott-Bond, <b>Z-strength,</b> shives(>= 0. 3 mm), long fibers and fines. It is important to cover all important dynamics to select the best possible models. Here, the absolute differences between the measured and estimated pulp and handsheet properties are ranked in ascending order, followed by a selection procedure before the polynomial fitting. Moreover, three different sets of chip mixtures were analyzed, and the results shown in this paper indicate that only one model is required for each pulp and handsheet property when using internal variables as predictors. Finally, at a given threshold of shives, it is shown that both Scott-Bond and sheet density can be optimized by changing the consistency and fiber residence time in the refining zones individually. This opens for implementation of new control strategies based on soft sensors...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{and wood}} fibre {{ultrastructure}} is of key {{importance for the}} pulp and paper making industry. In this thesis {{there has been a}} focus on development of methods for studying wood degrading enzymes. The methods have been used in different ways to render new information on wood and wood fibres. Wood degrading enzymes are chosen since they are tailor made to specifically degrade certain sub-structures in the wood bio-polymer, e. g. cellulose. In the first part an a-amino group of a carbohydrate binding module (CBM) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium cellulase Cel 7 D was covalently labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The fluorescein labelled CBM showed specific binding only to cellulose and not to mannan and xylan. The labelled CBM was successfully used as a probe for detection of cellulose in lignocellulose material such as never dried spruce, birch wood and processed pulp fibres. Furthermore, the endoglucanase Cel 5 A from Trichoderma reesei and monocomponent endoglucanase from Aspergillus sp (Novozyme 476 TM from Novozyme A/S) were evaluated as probes for the surface properties of soft- and hardwood chemical pulp fibres. The empirical kinetic degradation parameters correlated with the tensile index, relative bonded area and <b>z-strength</b> of paper. All paper properties showing a correlation with enzyme kinetic parameters were related to fibre-fibre interactions. Fluorescence labelling of the reducing end groups in pulp fibres was also used to further characterize the degradation. Finally, in vitro model studies as well as studies on intact wood samples were performed with different enzymes to characterize a fluorescent substance found in tori of water-sprinkled spruce logs. The model experiments showed that tannic acid can bind to pectin and that its presence inhibits pectinase action. Furthermore, it was shown that tannin acyl hydrolase can degrade tannic acid adsorbed to pectin. Neither pectinase nor tannase could, however, remove the discolouring substances from pit membranes in intact spruce samples. Manganese peroxidase had a minor but documented effect which, together with HCl/vanillin labelling experiments supported the conclusion that the discolouring substance corresponds to condensed tannin...|$|E
40|$|Almost all {{research}} on biorefinery concepts {{are based on}} chemical pulping processes and ways of utilising lignin, hemicelluloses and extractives {{as well as a}} part of the remaining cellulose for production of nano materials in order to create more valuable products than today. Within the Forest as a Resource (FORE) research program at FSCN we are utilising the whole chain of unit processes from forestry to final products as paper and board, where the pulping process research focus on high yield process as TMP and CTMP. As these process solutions are preserving or only slightly changing the properties of the original wood polymers and extractives, the idea is to find high value adding products designed by nature. From an economic perspective, the production of nanocellulose from a chemical pulp is quite expensive as the pulp has to be either enzymatically (e. g. mono-component endoglucanase) pre-treated or chemically oxidised using the TEMPO (2, 2, 6, 6 - tetramethyl-piperidine- 1 -oxil) - mediated oxidation method in order to make it possible to disrupt the fibres by means of homogenisation. In high yield pulping processes such as in TMP and CTMP, the idea with this study was to investigate the possibility to use fractions of low quality materials from fines fractions for the production of nano-ligno-cellulose (NLC). The integration of a NLC unit process in a high yield pulping production line has a potential to become a future way to improve the quality level of traditional products such as paper and board grades. The intention of this research work was that, by using this concept, a knowledge base can be created so that it becomes possible to develop a low-cost production method for its implementation. In order to study the potential of this concept, treatment of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) fines fractions were studied by means of homogenisation It seems possible to homogenise fine particles of thermo-mechanical pulp (1 % w/v) to NLC. A correspond fines fraction from bleached kraft pulp (BKP) was tested as a reference at 0. 5 % w/v concentration. The objective presented in this work was to develop a methodology for producing mechanical pulp based NLC from fines fractions and to utilise this material as strength additives in paper and board grades. Laboratory sheets of CTMP and BKP, with addition of their respective NLC, were made in a Rapid Köthen sheet former. It was found that handsheets of pulp fibres blended with NLC improved the <b>z-strength</b> and other important mechanical properties for similar sheet densities. The characterisation of the particle size distribution of NLC is both important and challenging and the crill methodology developed at Innventia (former STFI) already during the 1980 s was tested to see if it would be both fast and reliable enough. The crill measurement technique is based on the optical responses of a micro/nano particle suspension at two wavelengths of light; UV and IR. The crill value of TMP and CTMP based nano-ligno-cellulose were measured as a function of the homogenisation time. Results showed that the crill value of both TMP-NLC and CTMP-NLC correlated with the homogenisation time...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{different}} aspects on the re-use of wood based fibres have been studied, focusing on ink detachment of flexographic ink from model cellulose surfaces {{and changes in}} porous structure of kraft fibres following different treatments. New model systems for evaluation of ink detachment and ink-cellulose interactions were used. Ink detachment was studied using Impinging jet cell equipment, taking into consideration the influence of storage conditions, surface roughness and surface energy of the cellulose substrate. A micro adhesion measurement apparatus (MAMA) was used to directly study ink-cellulose interactions, from which the adhesive properties between ink and cellulose, having various surface energies, could be derived. UV-light, elevated temperatures, longer storage time, decreased surface energy, i. e. making the cellulose surface more hydrophobic, and high surface roughness all negatively affected ink detachment. Attenuated total reflectance - fourier transform infra red (ATR-FTIR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) {{was used to evaluate}} structural and chemical changes of ink and cellulose upon storage at elevated temperature or under UV-light. After storage at elevated temperatures, ATR-FTIR spectra indicated that a hydrolysis or an oxidative reaction took place as a peak at 1710 cm- 1 appeared. AFM revealed that storage at elevated temperatures caused the latex particles present in the ink to form a film, most likely due to annealing. Less ink detached from hydrophobic cellulose surfaces. Ink detachment decreased for rougher cellulose substrates due to an increased molecular contact area. Fibre pore structure and water retaining ability influenced fibre/fibre joint strength and different paper strength properties. Investigations took into account the effect of pulp yield, counter-ion types, pH, salt, hornification and strength enhancing additives. Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation (NMR), inverse size exclusion chromatography (ISEC) and water retention value (WRV) measured the changes that occur in the fibre wall upon varying the conditions. Each different measuring technique contained unique information such that a combination of the techniques was necessary to give as complete a picture as possible over the changes that occurred in the fibre wall upon varying the conditions for the fibre. A correlation between fibre pore radius and sheet strength properties was found, suggesting that fibres with larger pores allow for a larger molecular contact area between fibres to be formed during drying and consolidation of the paper. Fibre/fibre joint strength, fibre flexibility, and the number of efficient fibre/fibre contacts also controlled sheet strength. The effect of different strength enhancing additives on fibre pore structure and paper strength was investigated. Larger pores in the fibres allowed for additives to penetrate into the fibre wall. Additives with low molecular mass (Mw) penetrated into the fibre wall to a larger extent than additives with a high Mw, causing an embrittlement of the fibre. However, low Mw additives gave higher sheet tensile strength despite a leveling out in strength at high additions, indicating that the fibre wall can only adsorb a limited amount of chemical. Polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH) and polyelectrolyte complexes (PEC) of PAH and polyacrylic acid (PAA) were added separately to the pulp. PEC significantly improved both tensile strength and <b>Z-strength,</b> whereas PAH alone did not increase the strength properties to the same extent unless the sheets were heated to 150 °C for 10 minutes. The results suggested that the effect of PEC was dominated by an improvement in fibre/fibre joint strength, whereas the effect of PAH was significantly affected by an improvement of the intra-fibre bond strengt...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical pulping is {{a process}} for {{production}} of wood pulp in papermaking. Thermomechanical Pulp (TMP) and Groundwood (GW) are historically the two production methods used for mechanical pulping. Because of high electrical prices and increasing requirements in pulp quality it is of interest to improve the mechanical pulping process. The Advanced Thermomechanical Pulp (ATMP) process is a development of the TMP process developed to reduce the electrical energy consumption in production of mechanical pulp. ATMP also has better strength properties and optical properties compared to TMP. Andritz, Paper and Fibre Research Institute (PFI) and Norske Skog together have developed this production method throughout several pilot plant trials with excellent results. Mechanical pre-treatment of wood chips with a screw press and chemical addition in a high intensity primary refining stage are {{the features of the}} ATMP process. This process has recently been described (Hill et al. 2009, Hill et al. 2010, Gorski et al. 2011 and Johansson et al. 2011). Improvements in the electrical energy efficiency in refining of up to 0, 65 MWh/odt or 34 % as well as higher brightness and lower shive contents compared to reference TMP pulp were shown for spruce raw material (Gorski et al. 2011). To further understand what happens with the pulp in ATMP process compared to the TMP process different investigations were carried out. Methylene blue sorption were evaluated and used to measure the total amount of anionic groups on both ATMP and TMP produced pulps. ATMP produced pulps achieved a higher number of acidic groups compared to pulps without addition of chemicals for not only the whole pulp but also for three different fractions of each pulp. Additional tests are now carried out with conductometric titration to further verify the results from these tests. Laboratory sheets were produced from different fibre fractions of these pulps. Optical properties, strength properties, Ambertec formation and charge decay properties were measured on these sheets. The brightness and light absorption were significantly better for all fractions of ATMP pulps compared to pulps without addition of chemicals. Pulps added bisulphite achieved the highest light absorption and lowest light scattering in these trials. The results from light scattering showed that pulps produced without addition of chemicals achieved significantly poorer result for the long fraction compared to the other pulps. However, for the middle and fines fraction the ATMP produced pulps achieved high light scattering but not necessary the highest light scattering. TMP achieved high light scattering for both the middle and fines fraction. It is however difficult to compare the different ATMP pulps without an optimization of the addition of chemicals. Both strain and tensile index were measured to calculate the Tensile Energy Absorption (TEA). These results showed that to produce pulp with high intensity in the primary refining stage it is preferable to have a mechanical pre-treatment prior to this refining stage. TMP was produced with low intensity in the primary refining stage resulting in poor tensile index and TEA for the long fraction. The measurements of tensile strength in the z-direction showed that ATMP (Bisulphite) gave significantly higher <b>z-strength</b> compared to the other pulps for all fractions. Measurements of Ambertec formation were also carried out. The long fraction of TMP had significantly poorer ambertec formation compared to the long fraction of the other pulps. For the middle and fines fraction there were difficult to conclude with anything, the reason is probably {{because of the lack of}} agitation prior to the production of sheets from these fractions. Evaluation of charge decay properties were difficult to perform since the results varied from day to day. The variation in these results was probably due to differences in relative humidity. The humidity differences could be described by a hysteresis curve that describes differences in humidity from absorption and desorption of water going from one air humidity to another.
