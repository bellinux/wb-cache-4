Under a furious barrage of enemy machinegun and small-arms fire from the commanding cliffs on the right, Col. Chambers (then Lt. Col.) landed immediately after the initial assault waves of his battalion on D-day to find the momentum of the assault threatened by heavy casualties from withering Japanese artillery, mortar rocket, machinegun, and rifle fire. Exposed to relentless hostile fire, he coolly reorganized his battle-weary men, inspiring them to heroic efforts by his own valor and leading them in an attack on the critical, impregnable high ground from which the enemy was pouring an increasing volume of fire directly onto troops ashore as well as amphibious craft in succeeding waves. Constantly in the front lines encouraging his men to push forward against the enemy's savage resistance, Col. Chambers led the 8-hour battle to carry the flanking ridge top and reduce the enemy's fields of aimed fire, thus protecting the vital foothold gained. In constant defiance of hostile fire while reconnoitering the entire regimental combat team <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> he maintained contact with adjacent units and forwarded vital information to the regimental commander. His zealous fighting spirit undiminished despite terrific casualties and the loss of most of his key officers, he again reorganized his troops for renewed attack against the enemy's main line of resistance and was directing the fire of the rocket platoon when he fell, critically wounded. Evacuated under heavy Japanese fire, Col. Chambers, by forceful leadership, courage, and fortitude in the face of staggering odds, was directly instrumental in insuring the success of subsequent operations of the 5th Amphibious Corps on Iwo Jima, thereby sustaining and enhancing the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.|$|E

As far as the 4th Marine Division was concerned, the 23rd Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Walter W.

The soils of the Manawatu-Rangitikei sand country, being naturally deficient in phosphate, are no exception to this requirement for regular applications of phosphate.

Thus trials conducted by the Department of Agriculture have shown that, on Himatangi sand, pasture production in the range 15, 700 - 16, 800 kg D. M. /ha can be realized (Blackmore, pers. comm.). The need for regular, preferably at least annual, application of phosphate to these sand country soils implies a fall in the level of availability of the applied phosphate within the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> of the pasture roots due either to:- (i) actual loss of phosphate from this zone by leaching a distinct possibility in such light-textured soils; or (ii) a change in the soil/soil solution equilibrium distribution of phosphate as a result of changes {{in the nature of the}} fixed forms with time; or (iii) a combination of those factors. The object of the present study was to investigate the operation of these factors for two representative sand country soils, the differing moisture regime and pH status of which might be expected to exert some influence on the course of phosphate fixation. At the same time, it was hoped to reach some conclusion as to the relative sensitivity of a number of commonly used chemical "quick tests" for evaluation of phosphate availability in these soils and to determine whether changes in these values were paralleled by demonstrable changes in the forms of phosphate binding...|$|E

40|$|In {{the area}} of Punta Funtanas (Arbus, Central-West Sardinia) some small {{surfaces}} of Miocene limestones crop out, partially covered with Quaternary calcarenites and Plio-Quaternary basalts. The biggest of these outcrops forms a fossil wave-cut shore platform of up to 50 m wide with an altitude above sea level of approximately 4 – 5 m. On this platform {{a wide variety of}} dissolution landforms can be observed. These morphologies are related to the influence <b>of</b> the seawater (<b>zone</b> <b>of</b> wave <b>action,</b> marine splash and spray zone, up to progressively more continental environments) and to biokarst processes (erosional <b>action</b> <b>of</b> marine organisms, algae and micro-organisms) and are arranged in bands parallel to the coast, corresponding to different morphological zones. This paper describes all the karst landforms observed in this coastal area from a morphological and genetic point of view...|$|R
