40|$|An {{approach}} {{to finding the}} solution equations for simple manipulators is described which enhances the well known method of Paul, Renaud, and Stevenson, by explicitly making use of known decouplings in the manipulator kinematics. This reduces the set of acceptable equations from which we obtain relationships for the joint variables. For analyzing the Jacobian, such decoupling is also useful since it manifests itself as a block of zeros, which makes inversion much easier. This <b>zero</b> <b>lock</b> {{can be used to}} obtain a concise representation for the forward and inverse Jacobian computations. The decoupling also simplifies the calculations sufficiently to allow us to make good use of a symbolic algebra program (MACSYMA) in obtaining our results. Techniques for using MACSYMA in this way are described. Examples are given for several industrial manipulators...|$|E

40|$|The {{rectification}} efficiency of an underdamped ratchet operated in the adiabatic regime increases {{according to a}} scaling current-amplitude curve as the damping constant approaches a critical threshold; below threshold the rectified signal becomes extremely irregular and eventually its time average drops to <b>zero.</b> Periodic (<b>locked)</b> and diffusive (fully chaotic) trajectories coexist on fine tuning the amplitude of the input signal.

50|$|Thach later {{faced the}} A6M Zero during the Battle of Midway, in June 1942, {{for the test}} of his theory. Although outnumbered, he found that a <b>Zero</b> would <b>lock</b> onto the tail {{of one of the}} fighters. In response, the two planes would turn toward each other. When the Zero {{followed}} its original target through the turn it would come into a position to be fired on by the target's wingman, and the predator would become the prey. His tactic proved to be effective and was soon adopted by other squadrons. The Thach Weave helped make up for the inferiority of the US planes in maneuverability and numbers, until new aircraft could be brought into service. The usefulness of this strategy survives until today.|$|R
50|$|Tidal locking (also called {{gravitational}} locking {{or captured}} rotation) occurs when, {{over the course}} of an orbit, there is no net transfer of angular momentum between an astronomical body and its gravitational partner. This state can result from the gravitational gradient (tidal force) between two co-orbiting bodies, acting over a sufficiently long period of time. In the case where the orbital eccentricity is exactly <b>zero,</b> tidal <b>locking</b> results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner, an effect known as synchronous rotation. For example, {{the same side of the}} Moon always faces the Earth, although there is some libration because the Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular. A tidally locked body in synchronous rotation takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner.|$|R

No matter what the initial starting value of the coupling is, if it is sufficiently large it will reach this fixed point value, and the corresponding quark mass is predicted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A clock {{generation}} circuit having {{the function of}} multiphase locking was designed using the synchronous mirror delay (SMD) scheme. The internal clock can be synchronized to the external clock with intended phase difference. The synchro-nizing error of the clock {{generation circuit}} is reduced below the delay time of unit delay stage by compensation characteristics of detecting circuit in SMD. A 32 -M double data rate (DDR) SRAM including the clock generation circuit is fabricated using 0. 13 - m CMOS technology. To measure the synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit, the test elements group (TEG) system is designed and fabricated with the main system. The synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit is far smaller than the delay time of unit delay stage at <b>zero</b> phase <b>locking</b> and similar to the delay time of unit delay stage at multiphase locking.

On average expect 1% radial rotation {{in either direction}} {{from the center of}} the true combination number to allow the fence to fall despite slight deviation. so that for a given safe it may be necessary only to try a subset of the combinations. Such [...] "slops" [...] may allow for a margin of error of plus or minus two digits, which means that trying multiples of five would be sufficient in this case. This drastically reduces the time required to exhaust the number of meaningful combinations. A further reduction in solving time is obtained by trying all possible settings for the last wheel for a given setting of the first wheels before nudging the next-to-last wheel to its next meaningful setting, instead of <b>zeroing</b> the <b>lock</b> each time with a number of turns in one direction.|$|R
40|$|PLL {{frequency}} synthesizers play {{an important}} role in communication field and continuously increases. Frequency synthesizer is a system that generate a set of frequency, which is an integer multiple of input frequency. After that fractional frequency synthesizer was inventesd. In which output frequency is fractional multiple of input frequency. They suddenly used in mobile communication and in spread spectrum applications and their use continuously increasing. Communication used single carrier frequency, which is fixed. After modulation when modulating signal transmitted, then frequency of modulating signal will change because of noise. So at receiver to get the input signal, we require input carrier frequency so that we require frequency synthesizer. PLL is closed loop frequency system that can be used as a frequency synthesizer and for synchronizing purpose. PLL’s are having building block like, Phase frequency detector (PFD), charge pump, loop filter, voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). When it used as a frequency synthesizer than one another block require which is called divider circuit. PFD compare input signal frequency and phase with feedback signal and generate UP and DOWN signal. Which drive charge pump, that convert two signal into one signal. That signal increase or decrease the charge of loop filter. By which output frequency of VCO will change, it may be increase or decrease depending on charge on loop filter. That output frequency (fvco) applied to divider circuit, which divide the f vco by an number, that number may be integer or fractional. Output frequency of divider circuit compare with input frequency. If input frequency same as feedback frequency and phase error is zero then we say that PLL is locked, mean’s frequency of input signal same as feedback signal and phase difference between is <b>zero.</b> After <b>locked</b> state, output of PFD is zero and charge on loop filter also constant, so fvco is constant. After that PLL track the input signal...|$|R
40|$|The {{gap between}} the memory {{bandwidth}} and the bandwidth of modern high [...] performance interconnects is getting smaller. This increases the relative performance penalty for each copy operation on a data buffer to be transferred between two user processes on different nodes of a cluster. The optimal solution is direct data transfer between the source and destination buffers, without any in [...] between copy operations, so [...] called zero [...] copy transfer. Support for this zero [...] copy transfer mode {{is inherent in the}} design of the SCI interconnect as its communication is based on transparent remote read and write accesses. However, with the available SCI driver software, the user needs to allocate a designated SCI shared memory segment which then can be exported to or which represents remote memory imported from other nodes. In this paper, we present a solution which allows to use arbitrary regions of a process' address space for SCI communication by mapping it into the global SCI address space. Such a technique allows advanced and efficient usage models of SCI like true zero [...] copying in communication libraries.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a simple {{analytic}} strategy for predicting, or engineering, two frequency locking phenomena for S" 1 -equivariant ordinary differential equations. First we consider the forced frequency locking of a rotating wave solution of the unforced equation with a forcing of 'rotating wave type', and we describe the creation of modulated wave solutions which is connected with this locking phenomenon. And second, we consider the forced frequency locking of amodulated wave solution with a forcing of 'modulated wave type'. Especially, we describe the sets of all control parameters and of all forcings such that frequency locking occures, the dynamic stability and the asymptotic behavior (for the forcing intensity tending to <b>zero)</b> of the <b>locked</b> solutions and the structural stability of all the phenomena. This paper is essentially founded on results from our previous work concerning abstract forced symmetry breaking. The equations considered in the present paper are finite dimensional prototypes of certain infinite dimensional models describing the behavior of continuous wave operated or self-pulsating multisection DFB lasers under continuous or pulsating light injection, respectively.

40|$|The woman pictured {{below is}} {{sitting down to}} a nutritious, easily-prepared meal similar to those {{consumed}} by Apollo astronauts. The appetizing dishes shown were created simply by adding water to {{the contents of a}} Mountain House* Easy Meal package of freeze dried food. The Easy Meal line is produced by Oregon Freeze Dry Foods, Inc., Albany, Oreaon, a pioneer in freeze drying technology and a company long associated with NASA in developing suitable preparations for use on manned spacecraft. Designed to provide nutritionally balanced, attractive hot meals for senior adults, Easy Meal is an offshoot of a 1975 - 77 demonstration project managed by Johnson Space Center and called Meal System for the Elderly. The project sought ways to help the estimated 3. 5 million elderly Americans who are unable to take advantage of existing meal programs. Such services are provided by federal, state and local agencies, but they are not available to many who live in rural areas, or others who are handicapped, temporarily ill or homebound for other reasons. Oregon Freeze Dry Foods was a participant in that multi-agency cooperative project. With its Easy Meal assortment of convenience foods pictured above left, the company is making commercially available meal packages similar to those distributed in the Meal System for the Elderly program. In the freeze drying process, water is extracted from freshly-cooked foods by dehydration at very low temperatures, as low as 50 I degrees below <b>zero.</b> Flavor is <b>locked</b> in by packaging the dried food in pouches which block out moisture and oxygen, the principal causes of food deterioration; thus the food can be stored for long periods without refrigeration. Meals are reconstituted by adding hot or cold water, {{depending on the type of}} food, and they are table ready in five to 10 minutes. Oregon Freeze Dry Foods offers five different meal packages and plans to expand the line...|$|R
