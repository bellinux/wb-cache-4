For special linear groups, they were independently discovered by Israel Gelfand and Mark Naimark. For complex groups, the theory simplifies significantly, because G is the complexification of K, and the formulas {{are related to}} analytic continuations of the Weyl character formula on K. The abstract functional analytic theory of <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>functions</b> was first developed by Roger Godement. Apart from their group theoretic interpretation, the <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>functions</b> for a semisimple Lie group G also provide a set of simultaneous eigenfunctions for the natural action of {{the centre of the}} universal enveloping algebra of G on L2(G/K), as differential operators on the symmetric space G/K. For semisimple p-adic Lie groups, the theory of <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>functions</b> and Hecke algebras was first developed by Satake and Ian G. Macdonald. The analogues of the Plancherel theorem and Fourier inversion formula in this setting generalise the eigenfunction expansions of Mehler, Weyl and Fock for singular ordinary differential equations: they were obtained in full generality in the 1960s in terms of Harish-Chandra's c-function.|$|E

50|$|The {{theory of}} <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>functions</b> for SL(2,R) {{originated}} {{in the work of}} Mehler in 1881 on hyperbolic geometry. He discovered the analogue of the Plancherel theorem, which was rediscovered by Fock in 1943. The corresponding eigenfunction expansion is termed the Mehler-Fock transform. It was already put on a firm footing in 1910 by Hermann Weyl's important work on the spectral theory of ordinary differential equations. The radial part of the Laplacian in this case leads to a hypergeometric differential equation, the theory of which was treated in detail by Weyl. Weyl's approach was subsequently generalised by Harish-Chandra to study <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>functions</b> and the corresponding Plancherel theorem for more general semimisimple Lie groups. Following the work of Dirac on the discrete series representations of SL(2,R), the general theory of unitary irreducible representations of SL(2,R) was developed independently by Bargmann, Harish-Chandra and Gelfand-Naimark. The irreducible representations of class one, or equivalently the theory of <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>functions,</b> form an important special case of this theory.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFrom the {{irreducible}} decompositions' {{point of}} view, {{the structure of}} the cyclic GLn(C) -module generated by the α-determinant degenerates when α=± 1 k (1 ⩽k⩽n− 1) (see [S. Matsumoto, M. Wakayama, Alpha-determinant cyclic modules of gln(C), J. Lie Theory 16 (2006) 393 – 405]). In this paper, we show that − 1 k-determinant shares similar properties which the ordinary determinant possesses. From this fact, one can define a new (relative) invariant called a wreath determinant. Using (GLm,GLn) -duality in the sense of Howe, we obtain an expression of a wreath determinant by a certain linear combination of the corresponding ordinary minor determinants labeled by suitable rectangular shape tableaux. Also we study a wreath determinant analogue of the Vandermonde determinant, and then, investigate symmetric functions such as Schur functions in the framework of wreath determinants. Moreover, we examine coefficients which we call (n,k) -sign appeared at the linear expression of the wreath determinant in relation with a <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>function</b> of a Young subgroup of the symmetric group Snk...|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, a <b>zonal</b> <b>spherical</b> <b>{{function}}</b> or {{often just}} <b>spherical</b> <b>function</b> {{is a function}} on a locally compact group G with compact subgroup K (often a maximal compact subgroup) that arises as the matrix coefficient of a K-invariant vector in an irreducible representation of G. The key examples are the matrix coefficients of the spherical principal series, the irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of the unitary representation of G on L2(G/K). In this case the commutant of G is generated by the algebra of biinvariant functions on G with respect to K acting by right convolution. It is commutative if in addition G/K is a symmetric space, for example when G is a connected semisimple Lie group with finite centre and K is a maximal compact subgroup. The matrix coefficients of the spherical principal series describe precisely the spectrum of the correspondingC* algebra generated by the biinvariant functions of compact support, often called a Hecke algebra. The spectrum of the commutative Banach *-algebra of biinvariant L1 functions is larger; when G is a semisimple Lie group with maximal compact subgroup K, additional characters come from matrix coefficients of the complementary series, obtained by analytic continuation of the spherical principal series.|$|R
