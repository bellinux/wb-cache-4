This survey covers essentially all aspects of the physics of fast Z pinches: initiation, instabilities of the early stage, magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the implosion phase, formation of a transient quasi-equilibrium near the stagnation point, and rebound. Considerable attention is paid to the analysis of hydrodynamic instabilities governing the implosion symmetry. Possible ways of mitigating these instabilities are discussed. Non-magnetohydrodynamic effects (anomalous resistivity, generation of particle beams, etc.) are summarized. Various applications of fast <b>Z</b> <b>pinches</b> are briefly described.

40|$|Nobody {{could have}} {{predicted}} the circuitous {{course of the last}} 30 years of progress in intense beams and pulsed power. There were many discoveries and twists and turns along the way, but the steady flow of understanding and technological advances has sustained the field. Pulsed power research began in the early 1960 s with the development of the technology to test the reliability of nuclear weapons in a pulsed radiation environment. Because of the effort in the 1970 s on an electron beam approach to inertial confinement fusion (ICF) at Sandia National Laboratories and at the Kurchatov Institute, simulation codes, diagnostics, and innovative pulsed power techniques such as self-magnetic insulation were developed. The electron approach ended in 1979, and the more promising ion approach continued. At the same time, <b>z</b> <b>pinches,</b> used since the early 1970 s to evaluate the response of materials to keV X rays, were considered as an alternative to drive ICF capsules. The use of <b>z</b> <b>pinches</b> for ICF was discontinued in 1984 because of budget cuts and the belief that ions offered a route to the standoff requirement for energy applications. Now, in 1998, because of budget limitations and the 1995 discovery that the soft x-ray power achievable in a z-pinch implosion can be greatly enhanced, the ion approach has been suspended, and a new facility, X- 1, proposed to achieve high yield in the laboratory with <b>z</b> <b>pinches.</b> In this paper the authors review the research paths that led to these changes, describe the present status of <b>z</b> <b>pinches,</b> and predict what the future holds.

40|$|Sandia National Laboratories is {{completing}} a major modification to the PBFA-II facility. PBFA Z {{will be a}} z-pinch driver capable of delivering up to 20 MA to a z-pinch load. It optimizes the electrical coupling to the implosion energy of <b>z</b> <b>pinches</b> at implosion velocities of {approximately} 40 cm/{mu}s. Design constraints resulted in an accelerator with a 0. 12 -{Omega} impedance, a 10. 25 -nH inductance, and a 120 -ns pulse width. The design required new water transmission lines, insulator stack, and vacuum power feeds. Current is delivered to the z-pinch load through four, self-magnetically-insulated vacuum transmission lines and a double post-hole convolute. A variety of design codes are used to model the power flow.

These dimensions allow increased accuracy of both shock velocity and particle velocity measurements. The <b>Z</b> <b>pinch</b> radiation source uses imploding metal plasma induced by self-magnetic fields applied to wire arrays to produce high temperature x-ray environments in vacuum hohlraum enclosures.

Analysis of these results indicate that another effect, not initially anticipated, is an apparent change in refractive index that occurs in the various optical components used in the system.

40|$|In the ''metal liner'' {{approach}} to Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF), a preheated magnetized plasma target is compressed to thermonuclear temperature and high density by externally driving the implosion of a flux conserving metal enclosure, or liner, which contains the plasma target. As in inertial confinement fusion, the principle fusion fuel heating mechanism is pdV {{work by the}} imploding enclosure, called a pusher in ICF. One possible MTF target, the hard-core diffuse <b>z</b> <b>pinch,</b> has been studied in MAGO experiments at VNIIEF, and is one possible target being considered for experiments on the Atlas pulsed power facility. Numerical MHD simulations show two intriguing and helpful features of the diffuse <b>z</b> <b>pinch</b> with respect to compressional heating. First, in two-dimensional simulations the m= 0 interchange modes, arising from an unstable pressure profile, result in turbulent motions and self-organization into a stable pressure profile. The turbulence also gives rise to convective thermal transport, but the level of turbulence saturates at a finite level, and simulations show substantial heating during liner compression despite the turbulence. The second helpful feature is that pressure profile evolution during compression tends towards improved stability rather than instability when analyzed according to the Kadomtsev criteria. A liner experiment is planned for Atlas to study compression of magnetic flux without plasma as a first step. The Atlas geometry is compatible with a diffuse <b>z</b> <b>pinch,</b> and simulations of possible future experiments show that keV temperatures and useful neutron production for diagnostic purposes should be possible if a suitable plasma injector {{is added to the}} Atlas facility...|$|E

The first topic is the energy spectrum of products of fusion reactions in plasmas, called the production spectrum. The second is {{an investigation of}} the fusion reaction processes in high energy density <b>Z</b> <b>pinch</b> plasmas and the feasibility of ignition of such plasmas. A method is presented for the derivation of production spectra for plasmas with various distributions of ion velocities. The method is exact, requiring the solution of a 5 dimensional integral and is suitable for both isotropic and anisotropic distributions. It is shown that many of the integrals can be solved analytically. The solutions are used to study the spectra of neutron energies produced by deuterium-deuterium and deuterium-tritium reactions. It is found that for maxwellian distributions of ions the neutron spectrum is asymmetric with a longer high energy tail when compared with gaussian approximations of the spectrum. Deuterium and deuterium-tritium <b>Z</b> <b>pinch</b> plasmas are studied computationally using a hybrid code in which the fuel is modelled as a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fluid and fast ions are modelled as discrete particle-in-cell (PIC) particles. Using a <b>Z</b> <b>pinch</b> model in which the magnetic and thermal pressures are in equilibrium it is found that significant energy gain can be achieved for currents greater than 50 MA. Deuterium gas puff experiments with a 15 MA current are also analysed computationally {{in order to determine the}} reaction mechanism.

Extensive benchmark testing against data {{from a number of}} single-wire experiments is presented. Artificial laser schlieren and x-ray back-lighting images generated from the code data are compared directly to experimental results. The results were found to be insensitive to inaccuracies in the equations of state and transport coefficients. Simulations of individual wires in a wire array show different behavior to that observed experimentally due to the absence of three-dimensional effects. Simulations with similar conditions to wires in an array show a general trend in the plasma structure at start of implosion from discrete wires with large m= 0 perturbation amplitudes to partially merged wires with smaller perturbation amplitudes as the number of wires is increased. Results for a wire number scan with aluminum wire arrays on the SATURN generator suggest that the observed sharp transition to high x-ray power at around 40 wires corresponds to a sharp decrease in m= 0 perturbation amplitude and hence a sharp decrease in the seed perturbation for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability...|$|R
