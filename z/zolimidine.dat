40|$|ABSTRACT: An expeditious one-pot, ligand-free, Pd(OAc) 2 -catalyzed, three-component {{reaction}} for {{the synthesis}} of 2, 3 -diarylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines was developed under microwave irradiation. With the high availability of commercial reagents and great efficiency in expanding molecule diversity, this methodology is superior to the existing procedures for {{the synthesis of}} 2, 3 -diarylimidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines analogues. Imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines are extremely popular amongchemists and medicinal chemists due to their remarkable biological and pharmacological activities 1 such as anticancer, 2 anti-inflammatory, 3 antibacterial, 4 antiprotozonal, 5 antiviral, 6 antiulcer, 7 and antifungal. 8 Within the imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine family, several products have progressed to market, including alpidem (anxiolytic), 9 necopidem (anxiolytic), 10 saripidem (anxiolytic), 11 zolpidem (insomnia), 12 olprinone (cardioton-ic), 13 minodronic acid (bisphosphonate), 14 divalpon (anxio-lytic), 15 and <b>zolimidine</b> (antiulcer). 16 The imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine derivatives, 2, 3 -diarylimidazo-[1, 2 -a]pyridines also exhibit {{a wide range of}} biologica...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine and {{the related}} imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidines {{derivatives}} have received a significant attention in pharmaceutical industry owing to their interesting biological activities [1]. They displayed {{a broad range of}} therapeutic activities, including antibac-terial [2], antifungal [3], antiviral [4 - 6], and inhibitors of p 38 MAP kinase [7]. They have also been used as inotropic and β-blocking agents [8], benzodiazepine receptor ago-nists [9], and anesthetic activity [10]. Drug formulations containing imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridines are currently available on the market, for example alpidem (anxiolytic), zolpidem (hypnotic), and <b>zolimidine</b> (antiulcer). On the other hand, bis(heterocycles) have received a great deal of attention, not only as model compounds for main chain polymers but also because many biologically active natural and syn-thetic products have molecular symmetry [11 - 22]. More-over, the synthesis of the imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyridine and imidazo[1, 2 -a]pyrimidine ring systems has been widelyCorrespondence...|$|E

Pyrido[20, 10 : 2, 3]imidazo[4, 5 -c]isoquinolin- 5 (6 H) -ones such as {{the title}} compound, C 24 H 21 N 3 O 3, can be {{obtained}} {{in a few minutes}} in a microwave-assisted three-component reaction from 2 -aminopyridines, isocyanides and 2 -carboxybenzaldehydes. In the title compound, the pyrido[20, 10 : 2, 3] imidazo[4, 5 -c]isoquinolin- 5 (6 H) -one ring system is almost planar (mean deviation 0. 068 A ˚). The dihedral angle between the benzyl ring and the pyrido[20, 10 : 2, 3]imidazo[4, 5 -c]iso quinolin- 5 (6 H) -one ring system is 78. 2. The crystal structure is stabilized by intermolecular C—H O and C—H N hydrogen bonds. Related literature For the biological activity of fused imidazo[1, 2 -a]heterocycles, see: Almirante et al.
