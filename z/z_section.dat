The idea of the large neutral area was opposed by both Liverpool and Juventus, as it would provide an opportunity for fans of both clubs to obtain tickets from agencies or from ticket touts outside the ground and thus create a dangerous mix of fans.|$|E

Firstly, the basic deformation characteristics of bolted fastenings between cold-formed steel strips in lap shear tests is described, and advanced finite element modelling with solid elements as well as contact elements is carried out for comparison. Secondly, the structural behaviour of lapped <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> with bolted moment connections is reported, and both analytical and numerical predictions on strength and stiffness of lapped <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> are presented. Finally, the structural performance of double span lapped Z purlins is investigated numerically where the effects of lapped <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> over internal supports on the internal force distributions along the purlin members are examined.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on the structural behaviour of lapped cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections.</b> A total of 26 one point load tests on lapped connections between <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> with various lap lengths and test spans were carried out, {{and both the}} strength and the deformation characteristics of these connections were examined in detail. Among all tests, section failure {{at the end of}} lap under combined bending and shear was always found to be critical in the connected <b>Z</b> <b>sections.</b> Moreover, the moment resistances of lapped connections with lap lengths equal to 1. 2 times section depth were found to develop only 80 % of the moment capacities of connected sections. For lapped connections with lap lengths equal to six times section depth, their moment resistances were found to be significantly increased to about 140 % of the moment capacities of connected sections. Similar results in the flexural rigidities of the lapped connections were also found. Consequently, it is shown that the degree of structural continuity in lapped connections against bending depend on not only the load levels, the lap length to section depth ratios, but also the lap length to test span ratios. Hence, the widely adopted assumption of full strength and stiffness connections in lapped sections is not always correct. The research work aims to provide understanding to the structural performance of lapped connections between cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections,</b> and hence, to develop a set of rational design rules for multi-span purlin systems with overlaps in modern roof construction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis and design method for lapped connections between cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> after careful calibration against test {{data obtained from}} a total of 26 one point-load tests on lapped connections. Based on the experimental observations on the lapped connection tests where combined bending and shear is always critical in the cross-sections {{at the end of}} laps, an analysis method is proposed to evaluate all the internal forces within the lapped connections. Once the co-existing moments and shear forces in the lapped connections are evaluated, the critical sections are readily checked against combined bending and shear using codified design rules. Moreover, design expressions are also proposed for the evaluation of effective flexural rigidities of lapped connections with various bolt configurations against practical lap length to section depth ratios. Consequently, the structural behaviour of lapped sections between cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> in terms of strength and stiffness is quantified rationally for general design.

A two-noded, 8 df per node thin-walled open-section laminated composite beam finite element has been used.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical method {{to predict the}} deformation characteristics of lapped connections between cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections.</b> Based on the test results of typical lap shear tests on bolted fastenings between cold-formed steel strips of various strengths and thicknesses, a normalized bearing deformation curve was established. The curve was then adopted to predict the deformation characteristics of lapped connections between cold-formed steel sections where deformations due to global bending and shear actions {{as well as local}} bearing were significantly. The predicted deformation characteristics of a total of 26 lapped <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> with different section sizes and connection configurations up to failure were then compared with the measured results, and comparison is found to be highly satisfactory. Moreover, an empirical formula was also proposed for the moment rotation relationship of lapped connections at large deformations after failure under combined bending and shear. The proposed method is considered to be very important in assessing the structural behaviour of multi-span purlin systems with lapped <b>Z</b> <b>sections,</b> in particular, in determining the effective flexural rigidities of lapped connections over internal supports. Such design data is essential for the establishment of internal force distribution along the entire lengths of the purlin members. Hence, the co-existing shear forces and moments at the ends of lap of the lapped connections are obtained accurately to check against section failure under combined bending and shear.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the buildability of cold-formed steel structures, a series of {{research}} and development projects have been undertaken by the authors to study the structural behavior of bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel sections. As one of the major applications of cold-formed steel sections in building construction is modern roof structures with multi-span purlin systems, an extensive experimental and theoretical investigation on the structural behavior of lapped moment connections between cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> was carried out. Both generic configurations with high structural efficiency were adopted, namely, Config. W 4 and W 6, in which only the webs of the sections were bolted together for easy installation. Moreover, an analysis and design method was proposed to assess both the moment resistance and the effective flexural rigidity of the generic lapped connections. The research work aims to provide understanding on the structural behavior of cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> with lapped connections, and hence, to develop a set of rational design rules for multi-span purlin systems with overlaps. In order to verify the applicability of the proposed analysis and design method for other commonly adopted connection configurations, namely, Config. W 2 F 2 and W 4 F 2 where bolts were installed to both section webs and flanges within the lapped connections, an experimental and theoretical investigation on a total of 12 one point load tests on lapped cold-formed steel <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> were carried out. Among all tests, section failure under combined bending and shear at the ends of lap was found to be critical while twisting of the lapped <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> was apparent throughout the entire deformation ranges. In general, the structural behavior of lapped connections with Config. W 2 F 2 and W 4 F 2 was found to be similar to those with Config. W 4 and W 6. Moreover, the formulation of the proposed analysis and design method was modified to accommodate the presence of the flange bolts, and back analysis of the lapped <b>Z</b> <b>sections</b> against combined bending and shear using the proposed method was performed. After careful calibration against test data, the method was shown to be structurally adequate and efficient for lapped connections with Config. W 2 F 2 and W 4 F 2. Moreover, simple design expressions were also proposed for the evaluation of effective flexural rigidities of the lapped connections. Comparison on the structural behavior between the two sets of connection configurations was also presented. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

A main feature of the invention is that the light beam is guided in a <b>Z</b> <b>section</b> lithium niobate or lithium tantalate crystal, preferably in a monomode layer optical waveguide extending along its surface, and the prism deflectors each consist of two triangular or prism-shaped regions in which a largely uniform polarization direction is formed by inverting the polarization direction determined by the E field vector in domaines where the spontaneous polarization direction opposes the present direction, whereby each of the neighbouring triangular-shaped regions has an opposing polarization direction, and that a square electrode covering the triangular regions {{is attached to the}} top side of the crystal and a counter-electrode is attached to the bottom side of the crystal.
