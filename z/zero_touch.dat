UDI deployments require full manual intervention to respond to every installation prompt, such as machine name, password or language setting. ZTI and UDI deployments both require a Microsoft System Center infrastructure. ZTI deployments require a persistent network connection to the distribution point.

Modern <b>zero</b> <b>touch</b> deployment tools generally lack support for routers and are platform dependent. This forces Internet Service Providers {{to rely on}} manual node deployment methods when deploying Customer-Premise Equipment which is time consuming and error prone. This thesis investigates how the process of deploying Customer-Premises Equipment can be automated and optimized. State-of-the-art is discussed to point out requirements and possible improvements. Based on that, a tool is implemented performing deployment of Customer-Premises Equipment while minimizing manual intervention. As Internet Service Providers typically work with equipment from various vendors, multivendor support is implemented.

40|$|With {{the rise}} of smart phones {{integrated}} with GPS devices, {{we have seen the}} advent of location-based contextual services. "Contextual" in this sense, refers to a simple query of nearby points of interest based on the current location. This type of filtering is but the most rudimentary of what can be done with such information. Depending on if the user is at the location because of recreation or work, the phone should provide varying services appropriate for that purpose. In this thesis, I present a technique to perform inference on user purpose and an implementation of that technique in a demonstration application called Concierge. Concierge showcases how purpose can be used to provide a compelling, personal mobile experience. The application uses a Bayesian inference system with Gittins index utilizing location, past behavior, search queries, as well as other data present on the phone to make an assessment about the user's purpose. Using this data, the application assembles the most relevant applications, offers deals and discounts for appropriate nearby businesses, and shows information about the user's friends and their statues. With Concierge, the most interesting content simply appears without any user input; hence the <b>Zero</b> <b>Touch</b> Experience. I discuss how such an inference system is designed and how it was implemented in a first-stage demonstration for France Telecom/Orange and then explore the implications as it pertains to mobile applications, mobile advertisement, and social interaction. by Jong-Moon Kim.

The presented work refers to use cases from data intensive research that require high performance computation resources and large storage volumes that are typically distributed between datacenters often involving multiple cloud providers. Automation for large scale scientific (and industrial) applications should include provisioning of both inter-cloud network infrastructure and intra-cloud application resources. It should provide support for the complete application operation workflow together with the possible application infrastructure and resources changes that can occur during the application lifecycle. The authors investigate existing technologies for automation of the service provisioning and management processes aiming to cross-pollinate best practices from currently disconnected domains such as cloud based applications provisioning and multi-domain high-performance network provisioning. The paper refers to the previous and legacy research by authors, the Open Cloud eXchange (OCX), that has been proposed to address {{the last mile problem}} in cloud services delivery to campuses over trans-national backbone networks such as GEANT. OCX will serve as an integral component of the prospective ZTP infrastructure over the GEANT network. Another important component, the Marketplace, is defined for providing cloud services and applications discovery (in generally intercloud environment) and may also support additional services such as services composition and trust brokering for establishing customer-provider federations.

40|$|Pervasive {{computing}} {{implies the}} invisibility {{of the technology}} involved in providing ubiquity, such that technology is integrated into the environment and non-intrusive. In such a manner, computing and networking resources become diffused into physical environments, enabling users to exploit their provided functionalities such that functionality is distributed, enabling it to be controlled, monitored, managed, and extended beyond what it was initially designed to do. Moreover, computer awareness moves towards user-centricity, whereby systems seamlessly adapt to the characteristics, preferences, and current situations of users and their respective surrounding environments. Users exploit such functionalities {{in the form of}} a virtual device, whereby a collection of heterogeneous devices in the vicinity of the user are behaving as one single homogeneous device for the benefit of the user in solving some given task. This dissertation investigates the problem of dynamic composition and management of virtual devices for ad hoc multimedia service delivery and proposes an autonomous policy driven framework for virtual device management. The framework consists of a hierarchical structure of distributed elements, including autonomic elements, all working towards the self-management of virtual devices. The research presented in this dissertation addresses the functionalities of these components. More specifically, contributions are made towards the autonomous management of virtual devices, moving away from infrastructure based schemes with heavy user involvement to decentralized and <b>zero</b> <b>touch</b> (i. e., no user involvement) solutions. In doing so, the components and methodology behind a policy-driven autonomous framework for the dynamic discovery, selection, and composition of multimodal multi-device services are presented. The framework operates in an ad hoc network setting and introduces a Service Overlay Network (SON) based definition of a virtual device. Furthermore, device and service discovery, composition, integration, and adaptation schemes are designed for Mobile Ad hoc Network Environments (MANETs) enabling users to generate, on-the-fly, complex strong specific systems, embedding in a distributed manner, QoS models providing compositions that form the best possible virtual device at the time of need. Experimental studies are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed schemes...|$|E

40|$|Extending {{the ideal}} MHD {{stability}} code MISHKA, a new code, MISHKA-A, is developed {{to study the}} impact of pressure anisotropy on plasma stability. Based on full anisotropic equilibrium and geometry, the code can provide normal mode analysis with three fluid closure models: the single adiabatic model (SA), the double adiabatic model (CGL) and the incompressible model. A study on the plasma continuous spectrum shows that in low beta, large aspect ratio plasma, the main impact of anisotropy lies in the modification of the BAE gap and the sound frequency, if the q profile is conserved. The SA model preserves the BAE gap structure as ideal MHD, while in CGL the lowest frequency branch does not <b>touch</b> <b>zero</b> frequency at the resonant flux surface where m+nq= 0, inducing a gap at very low frequency. Also, the BAE gap frequency with bi-Maxwellian distribution in both model becomes higher if p_ > p_∥ with a q profile dependency.
