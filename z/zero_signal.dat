5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with <b>zero</b> <b>signal</b> present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

50|$|A class - B {{push-pull}} amplifier {{is more efficient}} than a class-A power amplifier because each output device amplifies only half the output waveform and is cut off during the opposite half. It can be shown that the theoretical full power efficiency (AC power in load compared to DC power consumed) of a push-pull stage is approximately 78.5%. This compares with a class-A amplifier which has efficiency of 25% if directly driving the load {{and no more than}} 50% for a transformer coupled output. A {{push-pull amplifier}} draws little power with <b>zero</b> <b>signal,</b> compared to a class-A amplifier that draws constant power. Power dissipation in the output devices is roughly one-fifth of the output power rating of the amplifier. A class-A amplifier, by contrast, must use a device capable of dissipating several times the output power.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{experiments in}} RDF {{were carried out}} in 1888 when Heinrich Hertz discovered the directionality of an open loop of wire used as an antenna.

Later experimenters also used dipole antennas, which worked in the opposite sense, reaching maximum gain at right angles and zero when aligned. RDF systems using mechanically swung loop or dipole antennas were common {{by the turn of the}} 20th century.

A pulse on the Interrogate winding was induced into the Readout winding, if the ferrite was not magnetically saturated. The larger control windings, if current was flowing through them, saturated the magnetic material, hence decoupling the Interrogate winding from the Readout winding which would return a <b>Zero</b> <b>signal.</b> The Interrogate windings of 16 ferrods of a row were wired in series to a driver, and the Readout windings of 64 ferrods of a column were wired to a sense amp.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{stochastic}} iteration approach to signal set design. Four practical stochastic iterative algorithms are proposed {{with respect to}} equal and average energy constraints and sequential and batch modes. By simulation, a new optimal signal set, the L 2 signal set (consisting of a regular simplex set of three <b>signals</b> and some <b>zero</b> <b>signals),</b> is found under the strong simplex conjecture (SSC) condition (equal a priori probability and average energy constraint) at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The optimality of the L 1 signal set, the confirmation of the weak simplex conjecture, and two of Dunbridge’s theorems {{are some of the}} results obtained by simulations. The influence of SNR and a priori probabilities on signal sets is also investigated via simulation. As an application to practical communication system design, the signal sets of eight two-dimensional (2 -D) signals are studied by simulation under the SSC condition. Two signal sets better than V-PSK are found. In the second part of this paper, optimal properties of the L 2 signal set are analyzed under the SSC condition at low SNR’s. The L 2 signal set is proved to be uniquely optimal in 2 -D space. The class of signal sets ƒ@wY uA (consisting of a regular simplex set of u signals and w 0 u <b>zero</b> <b>signals)</b> is analyzed. It is shown that any of the signal sets ƒ@wY uA for Q u w 0 I disproves the strong simplex conjecture for w! R, and if w! U, ƒ@wY PA (the L 1 signal set) also disproves the strong simplex conjecture. It is proved that the L 2 signal set is the unique optimal signal set in the class of signal sets ƒ@wY uA for all w! R. Several results obtained by Steiner for all w! U are extended to all w! R. Finally, we show that for w!

5000|$|Historically {{referred}} to as the [...] "Q" [...] or bias point by engineers, the operating point of a vacuum tube is a condition generally fixed by the amplifier manufacturer. In general, the operating point determines the device's bias value at <b>zero</b> <b>signal</b> input and determines the distribution of harmonics introduced into the output of the amplifier. Tubes that operate with a higher operating point close to cutoff give more [...] "headroom", enabling greater volume gains to be applied before signal degradation in the form of [...] "breakup" [...] or saturation results. By contrast, a lower operating point introduces more harmonic distortion into the final output {{as a result of the}} different non-linearity distribution near cut-off as compared to operation in the nominally linear portion of the characteristic. Some guitar amplifiers are designed to produce this type of distortion as its sound effect is considered desirable.|$|E

While the Prosonic featured cathode bias in the Class A mode and fixed bias in the Class AB mode, not all class A tube amplifiers are cathode-biased, and not all fixed biased amplifiers are Class AB.

40|$|AbstractAn error {{analysis}} of so-called <b>signal</b> <b>zeros</b> of polynomials associated with exponentially damped/undamped signals is performed and zero error bounds are derived.

The key idea behind the analysis is to regard <b>signal</b> <b>zeros</b> as eigenvalues of projected companion matrices and then to generate error bounds by exploiting perturbation theorem for eigenvalues. The conclusion drawn from the bounds is that the <b>signal</b> <b>zeros</b> become relatively insensitive to small perturbations on the polynomial coefficients as long as the polynomial degree is large enough and the zeros are extracted as eigenvalues of projected companion matrices.

5000|$|The new Mode S {{system was}} {{intended}} to operate with just a single reply from an aircraft, a system known as monopulse. The accompanying diagram shows a conventional main or [...] "sum" [...] beam of an SSR antenna to which has been added a [...] "difference" [...] beam. To produce the sum beam the signal is distributed horizontally across the antenna aperture. This feed system {{is divided into two}} equal halves and the two parts summed again to produce the original sum beam. However the two halves are also subtracted to produce a difference output. A signal arriving exactly normal, or boresight, to the antenna will produce a maximum output in the sum beam but a <b>zero</b> <b>signal</b> in the difference beam. Away from boresight the signal in the sum beam will be less but there will be a non-zero signal in the difference beam. The angle of arrival of the signal can be determined by measuring the ratio of the signals between the sum and difference beams. The ambiguity about boresight can be resolved as there is a 180° phase change in the difference signal either side of boresight. Bearing measurements can be made on a single pulse, hence monopulse, but accuracy can be improved by averaging measurements made on several or all of the pulses received in a reply from an aircraft. A monopulse receiver was developed early in the UK Adsel programme and this design is still used widely today. Mode S reply pulses are deliberately designed to be similar to mode A and C replies so the same receiver can be used to provide improved bearing measurement for the SSR mode A and C system with the advantage that the interrogation rate can be substantially reduced thereby reducing the interference caused to other users of the system.|$|E

40|$|Micromachine accelerometers offer a way {{to enable}} {{critical}} functions only when a system encounters a particular acceleration environment. This paper describes the optical readout of a surface micromachine accelerometer containing a unique 24 -bit code. The readout uses waveguide-based optics, which are implemented as a photonic integrated circuit (PIC). The PIC is flip-chip bonded over the micromachine, for a compact package. The shuttle moves 500 {micro}m during readout, and each code element is 17 {micro}m wide. The particular readout scheme makes use of backscattered radiation from etched features in the accelerometer shuttle. The features are etched to create corner reflectors that return radiation back toward the source for a one bit. For a zero bit, the shuttle is not etched, and the radiation scatters forward, away from the detector. This arrangement provides a large signal difference between a one and <b>zero</b> <b>signal,</b> since the <b>zero</b> <b>signal</b> returns virtually no signal to the detector. It is thus superior to schemes that interrogate the code vertically, which have a limited contrast between a one and a zero.

Intraoperative assessment of the microcirculation could possibly predict postoperative outcome. The present pilot study introduces laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) as a new clinical method for assessing liver microcirculation.
