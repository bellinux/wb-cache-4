40|$|More than 285 {{specimens}} of Conotheca subcurvata with three-dimensionally preserved digestive tracts were {{recovered from the}} Terreneuvian (early Cambrian) Heraultia Limestone of the northern Montagne Noire, southern France. They represent {{one of the oldest}} occurrences of such preserved guts. The newly discovered operculum of some complete specimens provides additional data allowing emendation of the species diagnosis. Infestation of the U-shaped digestive tracts by smooth uniseriate, branching to anastomosing filaments along with isolated botryoidal coccoids attests to their early, microbially mediated phosphatisation. Apart from taphonomic deformation, C. subcurvata exhibits three different configurations of the digestive tract: (1) anal tube and gut parallel, straight to slightly undulating; (2) anal tube straight and loosely folded gut; and (3) anal tube straight and gut straight with local <b>zigzag</b> <b>folds.</b> The arrangement of the digestive tracts and its correlation with the mean apertural diameter of the specimens are interpreted as ontogenetically dependent.

By taking the C 4 F fluorination as an example, we find that the morphology of both graphene sheet (GS) and graphene nanoribbon (GNR) can be effectively tailored by fluorination patterning via molecular dynamics simulations. The fluorine atom produces out-of-plane forces which trigger several intriguing morphology changes to monolayer graphene, including <b>zigzag,</b> <b>folded,</b> ruffle, nanoscroll, and chain structures. Notably, for multilayer GNR, the delamination and climbing phenomena of the surface layer are observed. Further studies show that the fluorination pattern can also be utilized to modulate the mechanical properties of graphene, e. g., about 40 % increase of the effective yield strain is observed for the examined GNR with fluorination patterns. This study not only demonstrates the significant impacts on the morphology of graphene from fluorination but also suggests an effective avenue to tailor the morphology and thus mechanical properties of GS and GNR...|$|R
40|$|The {{compaction}} {{level of}} arrays of nucleosomes may {{be understood in}} terms of the balance between the self-repulsion of DNA (principally linker DNA) and countering factors including the ionic strength and composition of the medium, the highly basic N termini of the core histones, and linker histones. However, the structural principles that come into play during the transition from a loose chain of nucleosomes to a compact 30 -nm chromatin fiber have been difficult to establish, and the arrangement of nucleosomes and linker DNA in condensed chromatin fibers has never been fully resolved. Based on images of the solution conformation of native chromatin and fully defined chromatin arrays obtained by electron cryomicroscopy, we report a linker histone-dependent architectural motif beyond the level of the nucleosome core particle that {{takes the form of a}} stem-like organization of the entering and exiting linker DNA segments. DNA completes ≈ 1. 7 turns on the histone octamer in the presence and absence of linker histone. When linker histone is present, the two linker DNA segments become juxtaposed ≈ 8 nm from the nucleosome center and remain apposed for 3 – 5 nm before diverging. We propose that this stem motif directs the arrangement of nucleosomes and linker DNA within the chromatin fiber, establishing a unique three-dimensional <b>zigzag</b> <b>folding</b> pattern that is conserved during compaction. Such an arrangement with peripherally arranged nucleosomes and internal linker DNA segments is fully consistent with observations in intact nuclei and also allows dramatic changes in compaction level to occur without a concomitant change in topology...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel class of periodically grafted amphiphilic copolymers (PGACs) {{that could serve}} as nonionic functional mimics of ionenes, the primary difference being that the periodically occurring charged units along the backbone of ionenes are replaced by hydrophilic oligoethylene glycol segments. The synthesis and properties of this new class of segmented polymers that carry a hydrophobic alkylene polyester backone with periodically placed hydrophilic oligo(oxyethylene) pendant units are presented. When the length of the intervening alkylene segment is adequately long, 22 -carbons in this case, and the pendant unit is a hexaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (HEG) segment, the polymer chain appears to adopt a <b>folded</b> <b>zigzag</b> conformation, reminiscent of the accordion-type structure formed by cationic ionenes. This transformation is driven by the intrinsic immiscibility of the alkylene and HEG segments and is reinforced by the strong tendency for long chain alkylene segments to crystallize in a paraffinic lattice. Evidence of the formation of such structures comes from the AFM images, which reveal the formation of remarkably flat pancake-like aggregates that are formed by the lateral aggregation of individually collapsed polymer chains; importantly, the heights of these structures match well with the lamellar layer-spacing obtained from SAXS studies of bulk samples. DSC studies further confirm the crystallization of the intervening alkylene segments, especially when they are long (C 22), suggesting the formation of the <b>folded</b> <b>zigzag</b> structures. In a suitably designed PGAC that carries diacetylene units symmetrically placed within the alkylene segment, attempts were made to cross-polymerize the diacetylene units and generate PEGylated nanoparticles.

Interestingly, the two flat nanoribbons can form new stacking styles instead of the most stable AB-stacking sequences for bilayer nanoribbons. The stability of the FGNRs are associated with several factors of initial structures, such as interlayer distance of two nanoribbons, stacking sequences, edge styles, and width of nanoribbons.

Employing both analytical and numerical models, we study the key mechanical properties of the folded materials.

These lasers are designed for damage-free power scaling when pumped by CVL’s configured for maximum output power (of order 100 W) but with poor beam quality (M² ~ 300). A simple Brewster-angled slab laser side pumped by a CVL produced 10 -W average power (1. 25 -mJ pulses at 8 kHz) with 4. 2 -ns FWHM pulse duration at an absolute efficiency of 15 % (68 -W pump power).

40|$|The {{result of}} this {{research}} may be summarized as follows : 1) Connective tissue fibers appearing in the above described 6 groups of structures of pig ovaries were observed {{with the use of}} GOMORI's silver impregnation method. 2) Normal vesicular follicles were divided into 2 types. 3) Normal vesicular follicles in the process of maturation could not be distinguished by the findings of silver preparations : fibrous elements are not found in the granulosa layer. The theca interna consists of only argyrophil fibers, which form a meshwork. The theca externa is composed of collagenous fibers, which run to parallel to the follicle wall and do not tend to form a meshwork. 4) In mature follicles and in just before ovulation the behavior of the connective tissue fibers in the walls {{is similar to that of}} follicles in maturating process. But in these follicles small masses of similar networks to these in the theca interna protrude from the inner side of the theca interna into the granulosa layer, showing plica-like configuration. 5) Cystic atretic follicles were divided into 9 types. 6) At the earliest stage of the regressive process the behavior of connective tissue fibers is almost like that in normal vesicular follicles. At the more advanced and the middle stages in a meshwork of argyrophil fibers of theca interna, collagenous fibers appear and increase gradually. Then after the appearance and gradual development of the yellow body-like tissues in the periphery of the follicle cavity, fine argyrophil fibers penetrate into these tissues from the theca interna, and gradually form a fine meshwork. Accompanied by the appearance and increasing of hyaline layers in the inner side of the theca interna, fine granular substances come into sight and increase in quantity. Moreover, with the appearance of radial layers in the outer wall of atretic follicles, collagenous fibers of these parts increase and form large networks in radial arrangement. At the last stage, in the scar tissue, the small <b>zigzag</b> <b>folds</b> composed of fine granular substances are found in parts corresponding to so-called glass membrane. In the outer side of this scar, radially arranged networks begin to decrease and argyrophil fibers which filled out the original follicle cavity show gradual transformation into collagenous fibers. 7) In this research there were found some follicles which were recognized to be undergoing change into the regressive process after maturation. 8) Atretic follicles with hemorrhage were divided into 4 types in this research. 9) In this research these follicles at the early stage of regression were found to be similar to the normal vesicular follicles, and those at the last stage were also like in character to the last stage of cystic atretic follicles. At the middle stage, however, slight differences were found in the connective tissue fibers of the wall, in spite of the active penetrating and increasing of the argyrophil fibers into the follicle cavity. 10) Corpora lutea of non-pregnancy were divided into 9 types. 11) At the vascularization stage fine argyrophil fibers penetrate actively from theca lutein cell layers into granulosa lutein cell layers, and form networks enclosing 2 or more granulosa lutein cells in one of the same networks. At the bloom stage these fibers encircle completely each lutein cell. At the earliest stage of regression the condition of argyrophil fibers is similar to that of the bloom stage. But at a later stage collagenous fibers appear and increase gradually around lutein cells contrary to the diminishing of argyrophil fibers. And fine pale purple fibers or fine pale purple granular structures come into sight and develop gradually in the parts which are undergoing hyaline degeneration. At the last stage the whole wall of a corpus luteum becomes occupied by fine pale purple granular substances, in which a few broken argyrophil and swollen collagenous fibers are scattered. 12) On the derivation of lutein cells, the present writer in this research has confirmed definitely the dualistic theory of CORNER. 13) Corpora lutea of non-pregnancy with a large central cavity were divided into 6 types. 14) In this research the behavior of the connective tissue fibers in the wall was found to be similar to that of corpora lutea of non-pregnancy. 15) "Vascular bodies" were divided into 3 types. 16) In the regressive process the connective tissue fibers show similar processes of change as in corpora lutea of non-pregnancy. In this research, however, argyrophil fibers in the wall of blood vessels, especially arterioles are maintained in the far advanced stage, showing the characteristics of the present writer's so-called "vascular bodies.

40|$| {{the latter}} vice versa. The {{anterior}} {{part of the}} oesophagus is provided with more mucous cells and taste buds than the posterior one where mixed type of epithelium (oesophago-intestinal epithelium) is present. Taste buds in the oesophagus are marked in about 6. 8 mm larva much later than the buccal cavity where immature buds are recognized at about IO- 12 hours after hatching (Fig. 29 A). The function of the lip is essentially gustatory. hence, the taste organs. Once the food enters the buccal cavity its further passing posteriorly depends upon the slippery epithelium with simultanous food selection: hence both the mucous cells and taste buds. The {{same is true for}} pharynx and the oesophagus, too. The presence of gustatory organ in the oesophagus is an indication of the extreme delicacy of taste in accepting eatable substances by the carp. The oesophageal mucosa are stratified like the pharynx and are thrown into longitudinal folds 6 - 8 in number at 6. 8 mm in total length In 200 - 300 mm carp about 24 - 27 folds are developed (Table 11). An oval thickening of unidentified character is marked at the oesophagointestinal junction but the exact function seems to be obscure. 6. Primary gill lamellae are observed as 2 - 3 bud-like protuberances 15 - 16 hours after hatching on the first gill arch and the secondary gill lamellae are formed in 6. 0 - 6. 6 mm in total length (Fig. 30). The outer gill lamellae are larger in size than the inner ones which aid in covering the gill openings (Fig. 31 L). The gill rakers are formed in 15 - 16 mm in total length (Figs. 30 H, 31 E). The papillated gill rakers on the adjacent gill arches interdigitate with each other so closely over the narrow gill clefts as to form an accurate straining mechanism, which appears to be important for bottom feeding. The central cores of the joining ends of the epi- and cerato-branchials are cartilaginous, which help in the easy movement of the arches during respiration. Histologically, the arches, the rakers and the lamellae alike in their epithelial structures but differ in thickness. Typical taste buds like those of the arches and the rakers are noticed on the margins of the primary gill lamellae. A large number of rounded, oval, or elongated mucous cells are abundantly present on the gills, the secretion of which helps in entangling the food particles from surrounding water. The intestinal folds are the continuations of the oesophageal ones; they number about 8 - 13, and measure 25 - 42,U in height in 6. 8 mm larva. Network of the folds are formed in 20 - 24 mm larvae. <b>Zigzag</b> <b>folds</b> are also marked in 31 - 35 mm young carp. A double network of the folds are present in the large specimens and is higher and more complex {{in the first part of}} the intestine than the rest. Anal folds are always longitudinal like the oesophageal ones (Fig. 33). 7. The structure of the carp intestine is similar to that of other cyprinids. The development of the intestinal coiling is divided into seven stages in this study (Table 13). The initial step in the coiling is first marked at about lo- 12 mm and is completed by 28 - 30 mm. The complication of the coiling seems to depend upon the length of the intestine. Long intestine is a characteristic of the herbivores and is marked by 29 mm in total length in the carp. The intestine may be histologically divided into three regions. The anterior swollen part consists of a more complicated network of folds than the middle one which is almost uniform in diameter. The height of the columnar cells in the anterior part is greater than the middle one. The anal part consists of longitudinal folds covered by stratified epithelium containing mucous cells like those of the pharynx (Fig. 37 H, I<, L). True stomach is absent but the anterior swollen part may be regarded as a receptacle for storing the food. In the epithelium 4 or 5 types of cells are identified : mucous cells, wandering cells or lymphocytes, granular cells, pear-shaped cells, and certain unidentified large secretory cells. Mucous cells form stratification like those of the pharynx in the rectal region, while they are few in other parts of the intestine. 8. Inflection points of regression lines in the relative growth of snout length, head length, eye diameter, opercular opening, body depth, caudal peduncle height, snout-insertion of the dorsal fin length, pcctoral fin length, intestine length, and pharyngeal arch length at 20 - 24 mm in standard length (Figs. 38, 39) are marked. The gill arch length, the large primary gill length, and the number or gill filaments on the first left gill arch show an inflection point on the growth curve at 9. 5 - 10. 5 mm which correlate with the differentiation and growth of tissues and organs i. e., hepato-pancreas, spleen, taste buds in the buccal cavity, pharynx, and the gill arch. The growth line of the intestine is represented by two inflection points which correspond with the coiling of the alimentary canal, the change of food habits and the developmental stages of the larva, post-larva and juvenile, young, and adult. The epidermal thickness of the head skin (between the upper lip and the nasal cavity) shows two inflection points at 11 and 36 mm in total length, which appear to be related to the disappearance of the cytoplasmic extentions of the superficial cells and the appearance of the club cells in the epidermis in 12 mm in total length. The height of taste buds from the roof of the buccal cavity and pharynx to gill arch shows inflection ponits at 8. 6 - 10. 6 mm in total length and the same of the latter one is higher than the former ones. The coefficient of the weight-length is calculated to be 3. 049 (Fig. 38). The growth of the organs or tissues may conclusively be represented by two inflection points (Figs. 38. 40) which are found to correlate with the transition period of food, developmental stages (larva, juvenile, young and adult) and other histological and morphological changes discussed...|$|R
40|$|Block {{copolymers}} can self-assemble into {{a variety}} of periodic nanostructures and therefore, are promising candidates for a diverse range of applications. While self-assembly of block copolymers has been widely studied and exploited, graft copolymers have remained far less explored in this context. One of the primary reasons for this is that the most commonly used methods to prepare graft copolymers leads to polymers that do not have precisely defined structures; specifically, controlling the precise location of the grafted segments is a synthetically difficult challenge. In typical chain polymerization processes, statistically random incorporation of monomers takes place and consequently, the periodicity of the grafted segment along the backbone is very difficult to control precisely; therefore, such methods cannot be utilized to prepare periodically grafted copolymers. Some recent efforts towards the preparation of sequence regulated copolymers using controlled radical polymerization in conjunction with periodic dosing of a commoner could provide an alternative to better regulate the periodicity, although this will also not be perfectly periodic. The only approach to control the periodicity perfectly is to utilize condensation polymerization approaches, wherein one of the monomers serve as a spacer whereas the other provides the opportunity to install the graft segment, as depicted in Scheme 1. One of the earliest examples of the utilization of a condensation approach to locate desired units at periodic intervals was reported by Wagener and co-workers using Acrylic Diene Metathesis (ADMET) process. 1]n periodicity]n graft segment Scheme 1. Synthetic scheme for the preparation of periodically grafted copolymers using condensation polymerization. From our lab, Roy et al. developed periodically grafted amphiphilic copolymers (PGAC), based on a readily available starting material, diethyl malonate; 2 melt trans-esterification between diethyl malonate, containing a pendant hexaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (HEG) segment and 1, 22 -docosane diol resulted in PGAC wherein the hydrophilic oligo ethylene glycol units were placed on every 27 th atom along the backbone (Scheme 2). Such PGAC underwent self-segregation and adopted a <b>folded</b> <b>zigzag</b> conformation, which was driven by the intrinsic immiscibility of the alkylene and HEG segments and was reinforced by the strong tendency for long chain alkylene segments to crystallize in a paraffinic lattice. However, one of the drawbacks of the above approach was that the hydrophilic pendant unit was installed at the monomer stage and consequently, the synthetic approach does not allow easy variation of the hydrophilic grafted segment; this limits the flexibility and any structural variation of the pendant segment would be synthetically tedious. 150 oC DBTDL	 5 	 20 DBTDL = Dibutyltin dilaurate Scheme 2. Synthesis of PGAC, based on diethyl malonate, and immiscibility-driven folding of such PGACs. Mandal et al. developed a more general strategy for the synthesis of such periodically grafted systems; they prepared periodically clickable polyesters carrying propargyl groups at regular intervals, by the solution polycondensation of 2 -propargyl- 1, 3 -propanediol or 2, 2 -dipropargyl- 1, 3 -propanediol and the acid chloride of 1, 20 -eicosanedioic acid. Such periodically clickable polyesters were shown to react quantitatively with a fluoroalkyl azide 3 and PEG 350 azide 4, thus allowing them to place different kinds of functionalities precisely along the backbone, as shown in Scheme 3. The immiscibility of the alkylene and fluoroalkyl/PEG segments caused the polymer chains to <b>fold</b> in a <b>zigzag</b> fashion, thereby facilitating the segregation of these segments, as observed earlier in the study by Roy et al. 2 The objective {{of this study was to}} place various desired functionalities along the polymer backbone and examine their effect on the self-assembly behaviour and morphology of such periodically clicked systems. Scheme 3. Synthetic scheme for the generation of periodically clickable polyesters and their subsequent functionalization via Cu-catalysed click chemistry. In Chapter 2, we describe an alternative general strategy for the scalable synthesis of periodically graftable polyesters and their subsequent functionalization to generate a wide variety of periodically grafted systems. The importance of our approach lies in our choice of the monomer, which is based on itaconic acid, an inexpensive and bio-sourced molecule. We demonstrated that dibutyl itaconate can be melt-condensed with aliphatic diols to generate unsaturated polyesters (Scheme 4); importantly, we showed that the double bonds in the itaconate moiety remain unaffected during the melt polymerization. A particularly useful attribute of these polyesters is that the exo-chain double bonds are conjugated to the ester carbonyl and therefore, can serve as excellent Michael acceptors. A variety of organic thiols, such as alkane thiols, MPEG thiol, thioglycerol, derivative cysteine etc., were shown to quantitatively Michael-add to the exo-chain double bonds and generate interesting functionalized polyesters; similarly, organic amines, such as N-methylbenzylamine, diallyl amine and proline also underwent Michael addition across the double bond (Scheme 4). Thus, such poly(alkylene itaconate) s could be utilized to place diverse functionalities at regular intervals along the polymer backbone. Scheme 4. Preparation of periodically graftable polyesters, based on itaconic acid, and their subsequent modification by Michael addition. In Chapter 3, we examined a series of periodically grafted polyesters carrying long crystallizable alkylene (C- 20) segments along the backbone and pendant polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (MPEG) segments grafted at periodic intervals. Such periodically grafted amphiphilic copolymers (PGAC) having MPEG graft segments of varying lengths were prepared by utilizing the activated exo-chain double bonds in poly(icosyl itaconate) (PII) that carries a 20 -carbon alkylene segment; MPEG thiols of varying lengths (TREG, 350, 550 and 750) 	were quantitatively grafted under standard Michael addition conditions to yield the required graft copolymers, as shown in Scheme 5. Scheme 5. Synthesis of a series of periodically grafted amphiphilic copolymers (PGAC) utilizing post-polymerization modification via Michael addition with MPEG thiols of varying lengths. The immiscibility of the backbone alkylene and pendant MPEG segments, and the strong propensity of the alkylene segments to crystallize in a paraffinic lattice, drive these systems to <b>fold</b> in a <b>zigzag</b> fashion and subsequently organize into a lamellar morphology, as shown in Scheme 6. Interestingly, all the graft copolymers exhibited a clear and invariant melting transition at ~ 44 °C that suggested the crystallization of the backbone C- 20 segment; the MPEG segments were, however, amorphous except in the case of polymers carrying MPEG 550 /MPEG- 750 segments, wherein a second melting transition corresponding to the independent crystallization of the PEG segment was also seen. SAXS studies indicated that all of the samples exhibited lamellar morphologies wherein more importantly, the inter-lamellar spacing was seen to increase linearly with the MPEG length (Scheme 6). This study provides a new design for controlling the dimensions of the microphase-separated nanostructures at significantly smaller length scales (sub- 10 nm) than is typically possible using block copolymers. Scheme 6. Schematic representation of formation of lamellar morphology in PGACs and control of interlamellar spacing in such systems. In order to understand the influence of having a mixture of MPEG lengths on the self-assembled morphology, in Chapter 4 we prepared a series of PGACs by co-grafting the parent poly(icosyl itaconate) with a mixture of two different MPEG thiols, namely MPEG- 350 and MPEG- 750; the mole-ratios of these two PEGs were varied to generate co-grafted PGACs, carrying different amounts of the two MPEG segments randomly distributed along the chain (Scheme 7). Parallely, we also examined the behaviour of physical mixtures of two different PGACs, one bearing MPEG- 350 and the other MPEG- 750 grafts; keeping the total MPEG content constant, we sought to examine the differences in the behaviour of randomly co-grafted polymers and physical mixtures. Scheme 7. Preparation of co-grafted PGACs and physical mixtures of two different PGACs. The co-grafted PGACs also exhibited a lamellar morphology; interestingly, the inter- lamellar spacing increased linearly with the total volume of PEG domain. This suggested that despite the presence of MPEG segments of two different lengths in the co-grafted samples, there occurred a reorganization of the PEG chains within the amorphous domain ensuring that the condition of incompressibility is not violated, thereby giving rise to a weighted average interlamellar spacing, as shown in Scheme 8. In contrast, the SAXS patterns of the physical mixtures revealed the presence of two distinct lamellar domains in the sample; this indicated that the two homo-grafted samples do not mix and form separate lamellar domains. The self- segregation induced folding and subsequent crystallization of the central alkylene segments clearly appeared to dominate the final morphology. Scheme 8. Schematic depiction of the possible scenarios that could arise when MPEG segments of two different lengths, namely MPEG 350 and MPEG 750, are present in the PGACs; top panel depicts the co-grafted PGACs, whereas the bottom panel shows the case of mixtures of PGACs with two different MPEG lengths. In Chapter 5, we have dealt with the design and synthesis of chain-end functionalizable polyalkylene itaconates. Changing the monomer from dibutyl itaconate to dipropargyl itaconate and using it in controlled excess allowed us to generate chain-end functionalizable polymers containing propargyl groups at the chain ends, in addition to the exo-chain double bonds along the backbone, thereby providing the opportunity for orthogonal functionalization. In order to obtain three different telechelic polymers with target DPs (degree of polymerization) of 5, 10 and 20 respectively, 3 different mole ratios of the two monomers (dipropargyl itaconate and 1, 20 -eicosanediol) were used (Scheme 9). Scheme 9. Synthetic scheme for the generation of chain-end functionalizable polyalkylene itaconates. Orthogonal functionalization of the resultant polymers was carried out using thiol-Michael addition and Cu(I) -catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (AAC), without interference between the functional handles present along the polymer backbone and the chain-end, respectively. Michael addition with triethylene glycol thiol and subsequent Cu-catalysed click reaction with MPEG 750 azide led to the generation of ABA type triblock copolymers where the middle block is a periodically grafted amphiphilic block and the two linear end blocks are hydrophilic in nature. Furthermore, such propargyl-terminated polyalkylene itaconates were used as macromonomers to prepare multiblock copolymers. The telechelic polymers were first treated with PEG 600 diazide, resulting in the formation of alternating multiblock copolymers; these multiblock copolymers were further reacted with thioglycerol to generate amphiphilic multiblock copolymers where one of the blocks is a periodically functionalized amphiphilc block, as depicted in Scheme 10. In both these amphiphilic block copolymer systems, a key feature is that the periodically functionalized amphiphilic block <b>folds</b> into a <b>zigzag</b> form, as evident from the presence of a nearly invariant melting peak corresponding to the crystallization of the alkylene segment. Scheme 10. Preparation of multiblock copolymers utilizing propargyl-terminated polyalkylene itaconates as a macromonomer. In summary, the thesis has demonstrated the design and synthesis of a series of novel amphiphilic copolymers using a bio-sourced monomer, wherein the driving theme is the immiscibility driven self-segregation that leads to the folding of the chain; these have been thoroughly examined using DSC, SAXS, WAXS, variable temperature FT-IR and AFM measurements.
