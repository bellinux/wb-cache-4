It builds upon {{the outcomes of}} a comprehensive research programme {{on the study of}} generic thermal performance of naturally ventilated office buildings with DSF, which has identified and evaluated the key design parameters affecting the thermal behaviour of DSF through computational simulation models. Taking into account Brazil's bioclimatic zones characteristics, including the solar incidence and wind conditions, design configurations are adapted, optimized and embedded within computational models for analysis. Thermal <b>acceptance</b> <b>levels</b> of each region, using operative temperatures as the thermal comfort index, are illustrated. The highest <b>levels</b> of thermal <b>acceptance,</b> as high as 90 %, are experienced in the south and southeast regions. Around 65 % can be achieved in regions of centre-west, north-west and coastal areas, but only 20 % in the arid region of the north-east.

The methodology and the results developed from this study enable initial assessment of application of DSF in naturally ventilated buildings under warm and hot climates...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} demand for irrigation water—but, at the same time, with the constraints in the supply from traditional resources—desalinated seawater has been {{recognized as one of}} the alternative sources of water to increase the supply for agricultural irrigation. However, its use among farmers has not yet started to expand. Policy makers need to understand what is causing the low <b>acceptance</b> <b>levels</b> of farmers, and how their attitudes could be improved. This is the first study that has conducted an analysis of farmers’ perceptions and acceptance of the use of desalinated seawater for irrigation. The study is based on collected data from a survey completed by farmers in southeastern Spain who do not use desalinated seawater. The main results indicate that desalinated seawater as a water supply source has the lowest <b>acceptance</b> <b>level</b> for farmers. Barriers for its use are price, the need for additional fertilization, and the perception that it would negatively affect the yield and crop quality. The farmers’ general level of knowledge about the impact of using desalinated seawater in agriculture is extremely low. Furthermore, farmers consider it a priority that their startup investment should be subsidized and that water prices should be reduced. Based on the study findings, this paper makes recommendations for the decision-making process in order to improve farmers’ <b>acceptance</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

It is almost impossible for education not to be affected from this change in technology. It has shifted from the traditional applications to the technology use in the classrooms. In this case, teachers’ role in the application of technology into education has become {{an essential part of the}} research in the field. Also, in higher education, teachers become the key factors to the effective use of technology in the teaching and learning processes.

Following the announcement, the Accountants General Department (AGD) of Malaysia has been appointed as the agency to head and responsible for the implementation of accrual accounting system in the public sector. The shift from cash basis accounting to accrual accounting represents the fiscal management change in the Malaysian public sector. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} transition process from cash basis accounting to full adoption of accrual accounting was not easy. Countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and United Kingdom took a long period of time to fully adopt the accrual accounting system. The Malaysian government however, has directed the agency to complete the full adoption of accrual accounting system within a period of only 8 years. In order to ensure the implementation success of the accrual accounting system, there is a need to examine the <b>acceptance</b> <b>level</b> of accrual accounting system among the personnel in the public sector. This study examines the <b>acceptance</b> <b>level</b> of accrual accounting system among public sector accounting personnel. Subsequently, this study examines whether the <b>acceptance</b> <b>level</b> of accrual accounting system among the public sector accounting personnel influence their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance. This study found that the public sector accounting personnel are ready for accrual accounting due to the high rate of <b>acceptance</b> <b>level</b> among them. This study also shows that the acceptance of accrual accounting system among the public sector accounting personnel significantly influences their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance. Further analyses show that employees' motivation has significant influence on job satisfaction and job performance.

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose an EU-Accession model that simulates the EU {{accession}} dates for the realized (Spain, Poland), declared (Croatia) and future (Turkey) accessions. The processualist approach is adopted and a System Dynamics model based on the EU’s standards is developed from a technical and institutional perspective. The model consists of three balancing loops: political stability, economic stability and adopting the acquis. These negative feedback loops exhibit a goal-seeking behavior towards fulfilling the criteria set by the EU. The flow variable ‘fulfillment of membership criteria by the candidate’ increases the ‘total progress of the candidate’. As a candidate country fulfills the membership criteria, final approval of membership process begins, which is simply denoted by ‘ratification’ variable in the model. An acceptance percentage indicates that when the country reaches that threshold level, her membership is approved. The simulation results correctly reproduced the accession date for Spain as January 1986 and for Poland as May 2004 with acceptance percentages of 85 % and 80 %, respectively. When the model is run for Croatia with the 85. 6 % <b>acceptance</b> <b>level</b> (very close to the value for Spain), the results reproduced the declared accession date for Croatia that is 1 July 2013.
