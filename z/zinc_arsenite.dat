5000|$|Zinc nitrate [...] (used as {{oxidizing}} agent), zinc chlorate , {{zinc sulfate}} [...] (known as [...] "white vitriol"), zinc phosphate [...] (used as primer pigment), zinc molybdate [...] (used as white pigment), zinc chromate [...] (one {{of the few}} colored zinc compounds), <b>zinc</b> <b>arsenite</b> Zn(AsO2)2 (colorless powder) and zinc arsenate octahydrate [...] (white powder, {{also referred to as}} koettigite) are a few examples of other common inorganic compounds of zinc. The latter two compounds are both used in insecticides and wood preservatives. One of the simplest examples of an organic compound of zinc is zinc acetate , which has several medicinal applications. Zinc salts are usually fully dissociated in aqueous solution. Exceptions occur when the anion can form a complex, such {{as in the case of}} zinc sulfate, where the complex Zn(H2O)n(SO4 may be formed, (log K = ca. 2.5).|$|E
40|$|We have {{compiled}} {{all known}} heavy metal transporters of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified their orthologs in four other species spanning the entire Hemiascomycete phylum. The 213 transporters belong to 27 distinct phylogenetic families distributed within the three classes: channels, secondary porters (permeases) and transport ATPases. They {{are present in}} all cellular membranes: plasma membranes, vacuoles, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, Golgi and various cytoplasmic vesicles. The major physiological heavy metals transported are: iron, manganese, <b>zinc,</b> copper, <b>arsenite</b> and cadmium. The major subfamilies that comprise {{the highest number of}} transporters are Siderophore-Iron Transporters (SIT) and CT 2 (conjugated ABC transporters). They transport heavy metals (iron or cadmium, respectively) conjugated to organic chelators such as siderophores or glutathione. Both subfamilies are considerably amplified in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. The pattern of expansion and restriction of the subfamilies during the evolution of the different species is highly variable. The phylogenetic trees of the major transporters subfamilies distinguish homogenous clusters of transporters suggesting that possible different physiological or mechanistic functions evolved independently. We also validated the use of the Hemiascomycetes heavy metal transporters for identification of orthologs transporters in the pathogenic Basidiomycetes Cryptococcus neoformans...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic enhances skin tumor {{formation}} {{when combined}} with other carcinogens, including UV radiation (UVR). In this study we report that low micromolar concentrations of arsenite synergistically increases UVR-induced oxidative DNA damage in human keratinocytes as detected by 8 -hydroxyl- 2 â€²-deoxyguanine (8 -OHdG) formation. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) is involved in base excision repair, a process that repairs 8 -OHdG lesions. Arsenite suppresses UVR-induced PARP- 1 activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of PARP- 1 activity by 3 -aminobenzamide or small interfering RNA silencing of PARP- 1 expression significantly increases UVR-induced 8 -OHdG formation, suggesting that inhibition of PARP- 1 activity by arsenite contributes to oxidative DNA damage. PARP- 1 is a zinc finger protein, and mass spectrometry analysis reveals that arsenite can occupy a synthetic apopeptide representing the first zinc finger of PARP- 1 (PARPzf). When the PARPzf peptide is preincubated with Zn(II) followed by incubation with increasing concentrations of arsenite, the ZnPARPzf signal is decreased while the AsPARPzf signal intensity is increased {{as a function of}} arsenite dose, suggesting a competition between <b>zinc</b> and <b>arsenite</b> for the same binding site. Addition of Zn(II) abolished arsenite enhancement of UVR-stimulated 8 -OHdG generation and restored PARP- 1 activity. Our findings demonstrate that arsenite inhibits oxidative DNA damage repair and suggest that interaction of arsenite with the PARP- 1 zinc finger domain contributes to the inhibition of PARP- 1 activity by arsenite. Arsenite inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation is one likely mechanism for the reported co-carcinogenic activities of arsenic in UVR-induced skin carcinogenesis...|$|R
