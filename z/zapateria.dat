Says, in effect, Friar Juan de Vitoria the Portal and fort houses either sides of the Correría were of the Nanclares, related to the Sotos which had in turn entrances of the <b>Zapatería.</b>|$|E

Obtained by the {{influence}} of the degree Luis Zapata, Director and Advisor to Isabella, it was aided by the existence of Jewish population in the lower Extremadura. It was the third Court of Spain, as regards the extension of its jurisdiction. It occupied 42.260 square kilometers, and included the bishoprics of Ciudad Rodrigo, Piacenza, Coria, and Badajoz. Occupying three headquarters in Llerena, the Priory Palace in <b>Zapatería</b> Street, the House maestral Street La Prison and finally, until its abolition in 1834, Palace of the Zapata, now justice in la Corredera Street today.|$|E

The rest of guilds of {{the city}} settled in streets near the Plaza Mayor, such as the well-known and commercial Calle Pintores and others such as Paneras, Hornos, Hornillos, <b>Zapatería,</b> Caleros, Tenerías, Rivera de Curtidores, Boilers, Shops. In the surroundings and {{in the vicinity of}} the Plaza Mayor are the two medieval parishes (Santiago and San Juan), around which new spaces were created that, together with the Plaza Mayor, created the urban structure of the enclosure outside the walls.|$|E

He was a frequent representative of the party in electoral matters, {{as well as a}} Scout and an instructor teaching business training courses in Ciudad Juárez and Durango; additionally, between 1978 and 1985, he was a middle and high school teacher at various educational institutions in Durango and Ciudad Juárez, as well as an administrator of an accounting and administration company. Between 1983 and 1985, Espino acted as an intervening administrator at <b>Zapatería</b> Bernini, a Ciudad Juárez company. From 1983 and 1988, Espino worked in the General Directorate of Public Security of Ciudad Juárez, first heading the department of Unit Control and later moving to Archives and Statistics; his final year in the agency was spent as a systems director.|$|E
40|$|Table olives {{are highly}} {{appreciated}} and consumed worldwide. Different aspects {{are used for}} trade category classification being the sensory assessment of negative defects present in the olives and brines {{one of the most}} important. The trade category quality classification must follow the International Olive Council directives, requiring the organoleptic assessment of defects by a trained sensory panel. However, the training process is a hard, complex and sometimes subjective task, being the low number of samples that can be evaluated per day a major drawback considering the real needs of the olive industry. In this context, the development of electronic tongues as taste sensors for defects sensory evaluation is of utmost relevance. So, an electronic tongue was used for table olives classification according to the presence and intensity of negative defects. Linear discrimination models were established based on sub-sets of sensor signals selected by a simulated annealing algorithm. The predictive potential of the novel approach was first demonstrated for standard solutions of chemical compounds that mimic butyric, putrid and <b>zapateria</b> defects (93 % for cross-validation procedures). Then its applicability was verified; using reference table olives/brine solutions samples identified with a single intense negative attribute, namely butyric, musty, putrid, <b>zapateria</b> or wineyvinegary defects (93 % cross-validation procedures). Finally, the E-tongue coupled with the same chemometric approach was applied to classify table olive samples according to the trade commercial categories (extra, 1 st choice, 2 nd choice and unsuitable for consumption) and an additional quality category (extra free of defects), established based on sensory analysis data. Despite the heterogeneity of the samples studied and number of different sensory defects perceived, the predictive linear discriminant model established showed sensitivities greater than 86 %. So, the overall performance achieved showed that the electrochemical device {{could be used as a}} taste sensor for table olives organoleptic trade successful classification, allowing a preliminary quality assessment, which could facilitate, in the future, the complex task of sensory panelists.

40|$|Table olives {{are prone}} to the {{appearance}} of sensory defects that decrease their quality {{and in some cases}} result in olives unsuitable for consumption. The evaluation of the type and intensity of the sensory negative attributes of table olives is recommended by the International Olive Council, although not being legally required for commercialization. However, the accomplishment of this task requires the training and implementation of sensory panels according to strict directives, turning out in a time-consuming and expensive procedure that involves a degree of subjectivity. In this work, an electronic tongue is proposed as a taste sensor device for evaluating the intensity of sensory defects of table olives. The potentiometric signal profiles gathered allowed establishing multiple linear regression models, based on the most informative subsets of signals (from 24 to 29 recorded during the analysis of olive aqueous pastes and brine solutions) selected using a simulated annealing meta-heuristic algorithm. The models enabled the prediction of the median intensities (R 2 ≥ 0. 942 and RMSE ≤ 0. 356, for leave-one-out or repeated K-fold cross-validation procedures) of butyric, musty, putrid, winey-vinegary, and <b>zapateria</b> negative sensations being, in general, the predicted intensities within the range of intensities perceived by the sensory panel. Indeed, based on the predicted mean intensities of the sensory defects, the electrochemical-chemometric approach developed could correctly classify 86. 4 % of the table olive samples according to their trade category based on a sensory panel evaluation and following the International Olive Council regulations (i. e., extra, 1 st choice, 2 nd choice, and olives that may not be sold as table olives). So, the satisfactory overall predictions achieved demonstrate that the electronic tongue could be a complementary tool for assessing table olive defects, reducing the effort of trained panelists and minimizing the risk of subjective evaluations.
