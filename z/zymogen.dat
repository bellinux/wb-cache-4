5|$|Examples of post-translational {{modification}} include phosphorylation, myristoylation and glycosylation. For example, in {{the response to}} insulin, the phosphorylation of multiple enzymes, including glycogen synthase, helps control the synthesis or degradation of glycogen and allows the cell to respond to changes in blood sugar. Another example of {{post-translational modification}} is the cleavage of the polypeptide chain. Chymotrypsin, a digestive protease, is produced in inactive form as chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas and transported in this form to the stomach where it is activated. This stops the enzyme from digesting the pancreas or other tissues before it enters the gut. This type of inactive precursor to an enzyme {{is known as a}} <b>zymogen</b> or proenzyme.|$|E

50|$|Acinar cells: Mainly {{responsible}} for {{production of the}} inactive pancreatic enzymes (<b>zymogens)</b> that, once present in the small bowel, become activated and perform their major digestive functions by breaking down proteins, fat, and DNA/RNA. Acinar cells are stimulated by cholecystokinin (CCK), which is a hormone/neurotransmitter produced by the intestinal cells (I cells) in the duodenum. CCK stimulates production of the pancreatic <b>zymogens.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{proteins}} are <b>zymogens</b> {{and become}} active after their cleavage at specific sites within the molecule.|$|R
50|$|Powerful hydrolytic enzymes, for instance, {{digestive}} enzymes, are {{activated by}} proteolysis {{so we can}} ensure that {{they are unable to}} hydrolyze any unwilling protein until they get to the right place: hydrolyzing protein <b>zymogens</b> are synthesized at the pancreas and accumulated in vesicles where they remain harmless. When they are needed, some hormonal or nervous stimulus triggers the release of the <b>zymogens</b> right to the intestine and they are activated.|$|R
25|$|Urokinase is a 411-residue protein, {{consisting}} of three domains: the serine protease domain, the kringle domain, {{and the growth}} factor domain. Urokinase is synthesized as a <b>zymogen</b> form (prourokinase or single-chain urokinase), and is activated by proteolytic cleavage between Lys158 and Ile159. The two resulting chains are kept together by a disulfide bond.|$|E
25|$|To achieve {{functional}} degradomics, the {{enzymatic activity}} of proteases must be analyzed. Methods {{have been developed}} to distinguish the proteolytic activity of different enzymes in biological samples and separate active proteases from their inactive forms, namely <b>zymogen</b> precursors and those proteases bound by inhibitors. Two techniques are activity-based probes (ABPs) and Proteolytic Signature Peptides (PSPs).|$|E
25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (<b>zymogen)</b> of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E
40|$|In {{guinea pig}} exocrine {{pancreatic}} cells intracisternal granules (ICGs) occur {{at a low}} frequency within the lumen of the RER. By starving and refeeding guinea pigs or injecting them in CoCl 2 solution, the number of these granules is greatly increased. We show here that ICGs contain the complete set of secreted pancreatic digestive enzymes and proenzymes. Two other soluble proteins in the lumen of the RER, GRP 78 /BiP and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), are specifically excluded from ICGs. The formation of ICGs, which occurs without acidification of the RER cisternae, is therefore a sorting event involving the cocondensation of {{a complete set of}} secretory enzymes and proenzymes, which for brevity we refer to collectively as the <b>zymogens.</b> With the exception of approximately 50 % of the RNase, the <b>zymogens</b> in ICGs are covalently cross-linked by intermolecular disulphide bonds. The synthesis of all three resident ER cisternal proteins [...] PDI, GRP 78 /BiP, and GRP 94 [...] with the carboxy-terminal sequence KDEL, is induced in response to the accumulation of massive amounts of misfolded secretory protein in the ICGs in the lumen of the RER. After injection of rats with large doses of parachlorophenylalanine-methylester, crystals form in the lumen of the RER. We show that these crystals appear to be a lattice of amylase with the other <b>zymogens</b> incorporated between the layers. Both GRP 78 /BiP and PDI are excluded from these crystals. The formation of these amylase crystals within the RER and the inclusion of other <b>zymogens</b> is, therefore, also a sorting event. These data establish that in exocrine pancreatic cells <b>zymogens</b> can cocondense in the RER into either amorphous aggregates or crystals that exclude other soluble RER proteins. This demonstrates that cocondensation is a mechanism capable of sorting <b>zymogens</b> within the secretory pathway...|$|R
40|$|Members of the caspase {{family of}} proteases {{transmit}} {{the events that}} lead to apoptosis of animal cells. Distinct {{members of the family}} are involved in both the initiation and execution phases of cell death, with the initiator caspases being recruited to multicomponent signaling complexes. Initiation of apoptotic events depends on the ability of the signaling complexes to generate an active protease. The mechanism of activation of the caspases that constitute the different apoptosis-signaling complexes can be explained by an unusual property of the caspase <b>zymogens</b> to autoprocess to an active form. This autoprocessing depends on intrinsic activity that resides in the <b>zymogens</b> of the initiator caspases. We review evidence for a hypothesis—the induced-proximity model—that describes how the first proteolytic signal is produced after adapter-mediated clustering of initiator caspase <b>zymogens...</b>|$|R

25|$|PSPs do {{not depend}} on {{targeting}} active proteases with tagged compounds but rather on quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeled standard peptides. Standard peptides synthesized from amino acids labeled with stable isotope atoms serve as internal standards for serial dilutions of a sample. These allow for later absolute quantification of a proteins and post-translational modifications by mass spectrometry. This technique has been adapted to absolute quantification of proteases, deciphering both activity states and total amounts in biological samples. This is thanks to trypsin treatment for mass spectrometry generating peptides specific to inactive <b>zymogen</b> precursors, active proteases, or common to both forms. PSPs is one form of standard peptide for absolute quantification and Standard of the Expressed Protease (STEP) is the other. The major {{difference between the two}} is PSP sequences are designed to mimic tryptic peptides that contain sequences spanning the zymogen’s pro-domain and the protease’s final form, whereas STEP sequences match tryptic peptide sequences found in both forms of the protease. This capitalizes on protease activation, where the zymogen’s pro-domain is cleaved off and the final form lacks that domain. Experiments using iTRAQ labeling and LC-MS/MS with STEP and PSP peptide internal standards have successfully quantified total and active protease levels in biological samples. One major drawback for this approach is the inability to account for inhibitor bound enzymes. It is also difficult to ensure standard peptides can be generated for this method for each and every protease for study.|$|E
2500|$|Trypsin is {{produced}} as the inactive <b>zymogen</b> trypsinogen in the pancreas. When the pancreas is stimulated by cholecystokinin, {{it is then}} secreted into {{the first part of}} the small intestine (the duodenum) via the pancreatic duct. Once in the small intestine, the enzyme enteropeptidase activates trypsinogen into trypsin by proteolytic cleavage. [...] Auto catalysis does not happen with trypsin, as [...] trypsinogen is a poor substrate, therefore enzymatic damage to the pancreas is avoided.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: Activation of trypsinogen to trypsin is {{a crucial}} step in the {{development}} of acute pancreatitis. The cause of this activation is not known although suggested explanations include autoactivation, cathepsin B-mediated activation and activation by mast cell tryptase. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate cathepsin B and tryptase activation of pancreatic <b>zymogens.</b> Methods: Trypsinogen- 1, proelastase, and procarboxypeptidase B were purified from human pancreatic juice. Human cathepsin B and beta I- tryptase are commercial products. Activation and degradation of <b>zymogens</b> were measured by activity towards specific substrates for trypsin and pancreatic elastase, ELISAs for procarboxypeptidase B and its activation peptide, and a radioimmunoassay for the trypsinogen activation peptide. Results: Cathepsin B caused activation of trypsinogen- 1 with a trypsin yield of about 30 % of that produced by enterokinase. Proelastase and procarboxypeptidase B was not activated by cathepsin B. None of the <b>zymogens</b> were inactivated by cathepsin B. Neither monomeric nor tetrameric tryptase could activate any of the examined <b>zymogens.</b> Conclusion: Cathepsin B is a competent activator of trypsinogen- 1, although not as efficient as enterokinase. If cathepsin B is to play a role in protease activation in acute pancreatitis, this most probably occurs by activation of trypsinogen...|$|R

2500|$|Plasmin is {{released}} as a <b>zymogen</b> called plasminogen (PLG) from the liver into the systemic circulation.

[...] Type II plasminogen is preferentially recruited to the cell surface over the type I glycoform. [...] Conversely, type I plasminogen appears more readily recruited to blood clots.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{members of}} the MMP family are {{organized}} into three basic, distinctive, and well-conserved domains based on structural considerations: an amino-terminal propeptide; a catalytic domain; and a hemopexin-like domain at the carboxy-terminal. The propeptide consists of approximately 80–90 amino acids containing a cysteine residue, which interacts with the catalytic zinc atom via its side chain thiol group. A highly conserved sequence ([...] [...]PRCGXPD[...] [...]) {{is present in the}} propeptide. Removal of the propeptide by proteolysis results in <b>zymogen</b> activation, as all {{members of the}} MMP family are produced in a latent form.|$|E
2500|$|ABP {{molecules}} {{serve as}} probes to irreversibly bind only to active proteases and ignore their <b>zymogen</b> precursors and inhibited proteases. Placing a reactive group and a recognizable tag feature {{on the same}} molecule using a linker moiety gives an ABP molecule its structure. The reactive molecule, designed after protease inhibitor mechanisms, lends ABPs their specificity towards targeting active proteases. Once bound, the reactive group acts much like an irreversible inhibitor to the protease. Depending {{on the nature of}} the tag moiety, the ABP-protease complex can then be visualized or retrieved from biological samples for further studies of localization and quantification. Limitations including difficult production, specificity, stability, and toxicity hamper ABP development but [...] these probes have proved useful in revealing protease biological activity and remain a promising avenue in degradomic technology.|$|E

2500|$|The {{coagulation}} {{cascade of}} secondary hemostasis has two initial pathways {{which lead to}} fibrin formation. These are the contact activation pathway (also known as the intrinsic pathway), and the tissue factor pathway (also known as the extrinsic pathway), which both lead to the same fundamental reactions that produce fibrin. [...] It was previously thought that the two pathways of coagulation cascade were of equal importance, but it is now known that the primary pathway for the initiation of blood coagulation is the tissue factor (extrinsic) pathway. The pathways {{are a series of}} reactions, in which a <b>zymogen</b> (inactive enzyme precursor) of a serine protease and its glycoprotein co-factor are activated to become active components that then catalyze the next reaction in the cascade, ultimately resulting in cross-linked fibrin.
