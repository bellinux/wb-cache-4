5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of <b>zoonotic</b> pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more <b>zoonotic</b> viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of <b>zoonotic</b> transmission.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{can act as}} vectors for {{spreading}} {{diseases such}} as psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, mycobacteriosis (avian tuberculosis), avian influenza (bird flu), giardiasis, and cryptosporidiosis over long distances. Some of these are <b>zoonotic</b> diseases that can also be transmitted to humans.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 20th century, malaria {{remained}} endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of <b>zoonotic</b> species of the parasite have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} malaria {{stretches}} from its prehistoric origin as a <b>zoonotic</b> {{disease in the}} primates of Africa through to the 21st century. A widespread and potentially lethal human infectious disease, at its peak malaria infested every continent, except Antarctica. Its prevention and treatment have been targeted in science and medicine for hundreds of years. Since {{the discovery of the}} parasites which cause it, research attention has focused on their biology, {{as well as that of}} the mosquitoes which transmit the parasites.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a <b>zoonotic</b> infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of Â£105,000.|$|E
5|$|Keeping rats as pets {{can come}} with the stigma that rats {{supposedly}} transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not among the list of species considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, {{along with many other}} <b>zoonotic</b> rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such <b>zoonotic</b> infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged <b>zoonotic</b> viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|While living indoors {{decreases}} {{the risk of}} contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health {{to make them more}} prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a <b>zoonotic</b> disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with strep throat. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|H7N7 has unusual <b>zoonotic</b> potential.|$|E
25|$|Bar-Yosef and Cohen {{suggest that}} the success of hominins within Eurasia once out of Africa is in part due to the absence of <b>zoonotic</b> {{diseases}} outside their original habitat. <b>Zoonotic</b> diseases are those that are transmitted from animals to humans. While a disease specific to hominins must keep its human host alive long enough to transmit itself, <b>zoonotic</b> diseases will not necessarily do so as they can complete their life cycle without humans. Still, these infections are well accustomed to human presence, having evolved alongside them. The higher an African ape's population density, the better a disease fares. 55% of chimps at the Gombe reserve die of disease, most of them <b>zoonotic.</b> The majority of these diseases are still restricted to hot and damp African environments. Once hominins had moved out into drier and colder habitats of higher latitudes, one major limiting factor in population growth was out of the equation.|$|E
25|$|Many food {{outbreaks}} can {{be linked}} to <b>zoonotic</b> pathogens. Many different types of food can be contaminated that have an animal origin. Some common foods linked to <b>zoonotic</b> contaminations include eggs, seafood, meat, dairy, and even some vegetables. Food outbreaks should be handled in preparedness plans to prevent widespread outbreaks and to efficiently and effectively contain outbreaks.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} <b>zoonotic</b> pathogens causing foodborne diseases are , Campylobacter, Caliciviridae, and Salmonella.|$|E
25|$|Wild rodents, {{including}} rats, {{can carry}} many different <b>zoonotic</b> pathogens, such as Leptospira, Toxoplasma gondii, and Campylobacter. The Black Death is traditionally {{believed to have}} been caused by the micro-organism Yersinia pestis, carried by the tropical rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) which preyed on black rats living in European cities during the epidemic outbreaks of the Middle Ages; these rats were used as transport hosts. Another <b>zoonotic</b> disease linked to the rat is the foot-and-mouth disease.|$|E
25|$|Rats {{can serve}} as <b>zoonotic</b> vectors for certain {{pathogens}} and thus spread disease, such as bubonic plague, Lassa fever, leptospirosis, and Hantavirus infection.|$|E
25|$|Giardiasis* is an {{intestinal}} infection in dogs {{caused by the}} protozoa Giardia lamblia. The most common symptom is diarrhea. The <b>zoonotic</b> potential of giardiasis is controversial.|$|E
25|$|H7N7 has unusual <b>zoonotic</b> potential. In 2003 in Netherlands 89 {{people were}} {{confirmed}} to have H7N7 influenza virus infection following an outbreak in poultry on several farms. One death was recorded.|$|E
25|$|Following the NBAF decision, {{leaders at}} two {{additional}} federal facilities announced {{they are coming}} to K-State. The Arthropod-Borne Animal Disease Research Unit, or ABADRU, specializes in animal and plant diseases transmitted by insects. The lab relocated from Laramie, Wyo., to K-State in order to fully realize its research mandate. The Center of Excellence for Emerging and <b>Zoonotic</b> Animal Diseases, or CEEZAD, will research foreign animal, <b>zoonotic</b> and newly discovered pathogens that can have a consequential economic impact on U.S. agriculture, homeland security and human and animal health. It will be led by K-State's Dr. Juergen Richt.|$|E
25|$|Viral phylodynamics {{is defined}} as the study of how epidemiological, immunological, and {{evolutionary}} processes act and potentially interact to shape viral phylogenies. spatio-temporal dynamics including metapopulation dynamics, <b>zoonotic</b> transmission, tissue tropism, and antigenic drift.|$|E
25|$|Western lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla) are {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} <b>zoonotic</b> origins of HIV/AIDS. The SIVgor Simian immunodeficiency virus that infects them is similar to a certain strain of HIV-1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zoonotic</b> {{transmission}} {{can occur in}} any context {{in which there is}} companionistic (pets), economic (farming, etc.), predatory (hunting, butchering or consuming wild game) or research contact with or consumption of animals, animal products, or animal derivatives (vaccines, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Because {{they depend}} on the human host for part of their life-cycle, {{diseases}} such as African schistosomiasis, river blindness, and elephantiasis are not defined as <b>zoonotic,</b> {{even though they may}} depend on transmission by insects or other vectors.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{a conference}} held in Berlin was {{focusing}} {{on the issue of}} <b>zoonotic</b> pathogen effects on food safety, urging governments to intervene, and the public to be vigilant towards the risks of catching food-borne diseases from farm-to-dining table.|$|E
25|$|OROV is {{a disease}} that is {{transmitted}} between humans by the biting midge (Culicoides paraensis). It {{is referred to as}} a <b>zoonotic</b> arbovirus and causes febrile illness, characterized by the onset of a sudden fever known as Oropouche fever.|$|E
25|$|Most {{species of}} Leishmania {{are capable of}} infecting humans and causing {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis. In the New World, these organisms include L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. lainsoni, L. lindenbergi, L. mexicana, L. naiffi, L. panamensis, L. peruviana, L. shawi, and L. venezuelensis. Old World species that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis include L. aethiopica, L. infantum, L. major, and L. tropica. With the exception of L. tropica â which is commonly associated with human settlements and therefore {{considered to be an}} anthroponotic species â all of these organisms are <b>zoonotic.</b> As demographic changes occur in developing nations, some species that have traditionally been considered to be <b>zoonotic</b> (e.g., L. panamensis) are becoming primarily human pathogens.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} {{primates}} whose habitats overlap with or are encroached upon by human settlement activities, {{there is some}} risk of <b>zoonotic</b> disease transference to individuals who come into close contact with them. One 1984 study has identified their susceptibility to malarial parasites.|$|E
25|$|As the {{mammalian}} and avian game {{populations are}} gradually depleted in the Congo Basin, {{the proportion of}} large-bodied snakes offered at rural bushmeat markets increases. Consequently, {{a large proportion of}} the human population faces the threat of Armillifer armillatus infections, a python-borne <b>zoonotic</b> disease.|$|E
25|$|Rabies (hydrophobia) is a fatal {{viral disease}} {{that can affect}} any mammal, {{although}} the close relationship of dogs with humans makes canine rabies a <b>zoonotic</b> concern. Vaccination of dogs for rabies is commonly required by law. Please see the article dog health for information on this disease in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Uncertainties {{have existed}} of B. {{pertussis}} and whooping cough as a <b>zoonotic</b> disease since around 1910 {{but in the}} 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.|$|E
25|$|Ahmed Hegazi (or Ahmed Gaffer Hegazi; Ø§Ø­ÙØ¯ Ø¬Ø¹ÙØ± Ø­Ø¬Ø§Ø²Ù) (born May 31, 1948) is {{currently}} a Professor of Microbiology and Immunology {{in the department of}} <b>Zoonotic</b> Diseases, National Research Centre, Egypt. Prof. Hegazi received his master's degree in 1979, and his PhD in 1981. Hegazi's research work has been focused lately on bee products and their therapeutic effects.|$|E
25|$|Paramyxoviruses {{are also}} {{responsible}} {{for a range of}} diseases in other animal species, for example canine distemper virus (dogs), phocine distemper virus (seals), cetacean morbillivirus (dolphins and porpoises), Newcastle disease virus (birds), and rinderpest virus (cattle). Some paramyxoviruses such as the henipaviruses are <b>zoonotic</b> pathogens, occurring naturally in an animal host, but also able to infect humans.|$|E
25|$|Major modern {{diseases}} such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a <b>zoonotic</b> disease transmitted to humans {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, though it has now evolved to a separate human-only disease. Most strains of influenza that infect humans are human diseases, although many strains of swine and bird flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu. Taenia solium infection is one of the neglected tropical diseases with public health and veterinary concern in endemic regions. Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were <b>zoonotic.</b> Most human diseases originated in animals; however, only diseases that routinely involve animal to human transmission, like rabies, are considered direct zoonosis.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{in recent}} times avian {{influenza}} and West Nile virus have spilled over into human populations probably due to interactions between the carrier host and domestic animals. Highly mobile animals such as bats and birds may present {{a greater risk of}} <b>zoonotic</b> transmission than other animals due to the ease with which they can move into areas of human habitation.|$|E
25|$|Zoonoses are of {{interest}} because they are often previously unrecognized diseases or have increased virulence in populations lacking immunity. The West Nile virus appeared in the United States in 1999 in the New York City area, and moved through {{the country in the}} summer of 2002, causing much distress. Bubonic plague is a <b>zoonotic</b> disease, as are salmonellosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease.|$|E
25|$|Threats {{from several}} {{infectious}} diseases, include both those transmitted by humans, such as HIV/AIDS, TB, and Hepatitis B and C, {{as well as}} from several economically costly <b>zoonotic</b> diseases (that is, those transmitted from animals to humans). The region's large volume of travel, trade, and immigration increases the risks of importing diseases from other regions, but its highly developed health care systems will limit their impact.|$|E
25|$|Swine {{influenza}} virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission {{of the virus}} from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human flu, often resulting only {{in the production of}} antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called <b>zoonotic</b> swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.|$|E
