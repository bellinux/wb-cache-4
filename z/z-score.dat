25|$|The <b>z-score</b> of an ROC {{curve is}} always linear, as assumed, except in special situations. The Yonelinas familiarity-recollection {{model is a}} {{two-dimensional}} account of recognition memory. Instead of the subject simply answering yes or no to a specific input, the subject gives the input a feeling of familiarity, which operates like the original ROC curve. What changes, though, is a parameter for Recollection (R). Recollection {{is assumed to be}} all-or-none, and it trumps familiarity. If there were no recollection component, zROC would have a predicted slope of 1. However, when adding the recollection component, the zROC curve will be concave up, with a decreased slope. This difference in shape and slope result from an added element of variability due to some items being recollected. Patients with anterograde amnesia are unable to recollect, so their Yonelinas zROC curve would have a slope close to 1.0.|$|E
40|$|Aims: This study {{compares the}} WHO (2007) and the National Health Examination Survey (NHANES III) {{reference}} intervals and investigates the differences when applied on a Canadian cohort of older children and adolescents. Methods: We calculated height, weight and BMI <b>z-scores</b> of 4375 consecutive patients (1993 female, 45. 6 %) aged 5 - 20 years attending outpatient clinics {{at a single}} tertiary care centre using reference data of the latest NHANES (III) survey and the WHO (2007) growth charts. To address age dependency, data was stratified into age groups. Results: Using the NHANES III reference intervals, medians of weight (+ 0. 46), height (+ 0. 29) and BMI <b>z-scores</b> (+ 0. 46) were significantly non-zero. The WHO (2007) growth charts yielded medians of + 2. 05, + 0. 32, + 0. 53 for weight, height and BMI <b>z-scores</b> respectively, all significantly non-zero. When comparing both growth charts, Canadian children had significantly different weight and BMI <b>z-scores</b> (p 95 th percentile) doubled from 8. 6 % to 16. 0 %. A significant age dependency was observed with higher WHO (2007) weight <b>z-scores</b> (> 7 years) and higher BMI <b>z-scores</b> (7 to 13 years) and no significant difference was observed for height <b>z-scores</b> across all age groups.

30|$|In {{the case}} of the {{preservation}} transformations, all <b>Z-scores</b> are positive and far from zero indicating strong influence from the structural network. As the thresholds increase, FP’s vanish at a faster rate than do TP’s, and the <b>Z-scores</b> increase indicating that the FP’s are important in determining how close to random our transformation <b>Z-scores</b> are. For conversion transformations representing FP’s and FN’s, we see negative <b>Z-scores</b> with large distance from zero.

25|$|Quantitative {{computed}} tomography differs from DXA {{in that it}} gives separate estimates of BMD for trabecular and cortical bone and reports precise volumetric mineral density in mg/cm3 rather than BMD's relative Z score. Among QCT's advantages: it can be performed at axial and peripheral sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is sensitive to change over time, can analyze a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, and air, and does not require knowledge of the patient's subpopulation {{in order to create}} a clinical score (e.g. the <b>Z-score</b> of all females of a certain age). Among QCT's disadvantages: it requires a high radiation dose compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, and because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results are more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced to improve upon the limitations of DXA and QCT.|$|E

However, {{many of the}} {{studies have been conducted}} in urban areas with older pediatric populations. This study was undertaken to evaluate growth patterns after ART initiation in a young pediatric population in rural Zambia with a high prevalence of undernutrition. Methods Between 2007 and 2009, 193 HIV-infected children were enrolled in a cohort study in Macha, Zambia. Children were evaluated every 3 months, at which time a questionnaire was administered, height and weight were measured, and blood specimens were collected. Weight- and height-for-age <b>z-scores</b> were constructed from WHO growth standards. All children receiving ART at enrollment or initiating ART during the study were included in this analysis. Linear mixed effects models were used to model trajectories of weight and height-for-age <b>z-scores.</b> Results A high proportion of study children were underweight (59 %) and stunted (72 %) at treatment initiation. Improvements in both weight- and height-for-age <b>z-scores</b> were observed, with weight-for-age <b>z-scores</b> increasing during the first 6 months of treatment and then stabilizing, and height-for-age <b>z-scores</b> increasing consistently over time. Trajectories of weight-for-age <b>z-scores</b> differed by underweight status at treatment initiation, with children who were underweight experiencing greater increases in <b>z-scores</b> in the first 6 months of treatment. Trajectories of height-for-age <b>z-scores</b> differed by age, with children older than 5 years of age experiencing smaller increases over time. Conclusions Some of the effects of HIV on growth were reversed with ART initiation, although a high proportion of children remained underweight and stunted after two years of treatment. Partnerships between treatment and nutrition programs should be explored so that HIV-infected children can receive optimal nutritional support. </p...|$|R
