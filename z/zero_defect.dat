40|$|The {{existence}} {{and stability of}} defect solitons supported by parity-time (PT) symmetric superlattices with nonlocal nonlinearity are investigated. In the semi-infinite gap, in-phase solitons are found to exist stably for positive or <b>zero</b> <b>defects,</b> but can {{not exist in the}} presence of negative defects with strong nonlocality.

The dependence of soliton stabilities on modulation depth of the PT potentials is studied.

Arguments exist that oppose the Zero Defects Policy including W. Edwards Deming who stated that the philosophy is more a fad and would lose favor. Dr. Deming stressed the importance of establishing a level of variation, or anomalies, acceptable to the recipient (or customer) in the next phase of a process. Often, some defects are quite acceptable, and efforts to remove all defects would be an excessive waste of time and money. Another criticism leveled at the <b>Zero</b> <b>Defect</b> manufacturing philosophy is the cost inherent with implementing it versus the benefits achieved post-implementation.|$|E
