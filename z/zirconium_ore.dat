50|$|Zirconium {{is found}} in the Earth's crust only {{in the form of an}} ore, usually a {{zirconium}} silicate, such as zircon. Zirconium is extracted from <b>zirconium</b> <b>ore</b> by removing the oxygen and silica. This process, known as the Kroll process, was first applied to titanium. The Kroll process results in an alloy containing hafnium. The hafnium and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step. Zirconium hydride is created by combining refined zirconium with hydrogen. Like titanium, solid zirconium dissolves hydrogen quite readily.|$|E
50|$|Coster {{was born}} in Amsterdam. On February 26, 1919, he married Lina Maria Wijsman, who held a degree in Oriental languages. Eventually, {{she was one of}} the first women to obtain a {{doctorate}} degree in this field from the University of Leiden. Dirk and Miep had two sons and two daughters (Hendrik, Ada, Els, and Herman). Coster is known as the co-discoverer of Hafnium (Hf) (element 72) in 1923, along with George de Hevesy, by means of X-ray spectroscopic analysis of <b>zirconium</b> <b>ore.</b> The discovery took place in Copenhagen, Denmark.Hafnia is the Latin name for Copenhagen.|$|E
500|$|Encouraged {{by these}} {{suggestions}} {{and by the}} reappearance in 1922 of Urbain's claims that element 72 was a rare earth element discovered in 1911, Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy were motivated {{to search for the}} new element in <b>zirconium</b> <b>ores.</b> Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. It was ultimately found in zircon in Norway through X-ray spectroscopy analysis. The place where the discovery took place led to the element being named for the Latin name for [...] "Copenhagen", Hafnia, the home town of Niels Bohr. Today, the Faculty of Science of the University of Copenhagen uses in its seal a stylized image of the hafnium atom.|$|R

Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in <b>zirconium</b> <b>ores.</b> Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and, without knowing what to look for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|R
40|$|International audienceNanocrystalline hafnium diboride, carbide and nitride are {{synthesised}} by a two-step process, namely a short mechanical activation step (∼ 1 ? 2 h) {{of powder}} mixtures based on partially hydrated hafnium tetrachloride, ph-HfCl 4, and on magnesium, {{followed by a}} brief annealing step (∼ 1 h) of the activated powders in flowing argon at 1100 ?C. HfCl 4 is a by-product of the carbochlorination process of extraction of <b>zirconium</b> from <b>ores.</b> Magnesium has a strong reducing capacity and is insoluble in metallic hafnium. The unsought reaction products may then be eliminated during the additional heat treatment or by further leaching. Mechanically activated powder mixtures of ph-HfCl 4 + B and of ph-HfCl 4 + B + Mg yield either facetted grains or monocrystalline rods of HfB 2 according to {{the composition of the}} initial mixtures and to the temperature and duration of the annealing treatment. The mean size of the facetted grains ranges between 100 nm and 300 nm. The growth direction of the rods is along the c-axis. Their mean diameters are around 100 nm and their mean lengths are in the range 500 nm? 1 um. Hafnium carbide HfC is directly mechanosynthesised from ph-HfCl 4 + Mg + C powder mixtures. A subsequent heat treatment in flowing argon allows to better crystallise the grains of HfC (∼ 100 nm) and to decompose the intermediate products. Annealing of ground ph-HfCl 4 + Mg blends in flowing nitrogen for 1 h at 1100 ?C yields HfN nanoparticles whose size ranges between 10 nm and 30 nm. Characterisations of powders by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy were performed to follow the phase evolution and to clarify the reaction mechanisms...|$|R
