25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E
50|$|Socket 1 was a 169-pin low {{insertion}} force (LIF) or <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> 17×17 {{pin grid array}} (PGA) socket suitable for the 5-volt, 16 to 33 MHz 486 SX, 486 DX, 486 DX2 and 486 OverDrive processors.|$|E
50|$|Socket 2 was a 238-pin low {{insertion}} force (LIF) or <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> 19×19 {{pin grid array}} (PGA) socket suitable for the 5-volt, 25 to 50 MHz 486 SX, 486 DX, 486 DX2, 486 OverDrive and 63 or 83 MHz Pentium OverDrive processors.|$|E
50|$|The CF, DE, DEG, FX suffixes are for CompactFlash+ Type II, <b>ZIF,</b> (<b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force)</b> IDE interface, Flex (IDE interface) {{interfaces}} respectively. DEG models {{also include}} an additional free-fall sensor for robust drop performance.|$|R
5000|$|Socket 479 has 479 pin holes. Pentium M {{processors}} in PGA package have 479 pins that {{plug into}} this <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket. Only 478 pins are electrically connected (B2 is reserved and [...] "depopulated on the Micro-FCPGA package").|$|R
50|$|Socket 604 was {{designed}} by Intel as a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket intended for workstations and server platforms. While the socket contains 604 pins, it only has 603 electrical contacts, the last being a dummy pin. Each contact has a 1.27mm pitch with regular pin array, to mate with a 604-pin processor package.|$|R
50|$|Socket 3 was a 237-pin low {{insertion}} force (LIF) or <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> 19×19 {{pin grid array}} (PGA) socket suitable for the 3.3 V and 5 V, 25-50 MHz Intel 486 SX, 486 DX, 486 DX2, 486 DX4, 486 OverDrive and Pentium OverDrive processors as well as AMD Am486, Am5x86 and Cyrix Cx5x86 processors.|$|E
50|$|The FC-PGA was {{introduced}} by Intel with the Coppermine core Pentium III and Celeron processors based on Socket 370, and was later used for Socket 478-based Pentium 4 and Celeron processors. FC-PGA processors fit into <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> Socket 370 and Socket 478-based motherboard sockets; similar packages have also been used by AMD. It is still used today for mobile Intel processors.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the LIF {{connectors}} {{were designed}} as a cheaper alternative compared to <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> connectors, to facilitate programming and testing of equipment. Compared with standard IC sockets, they have a lower friction force between the contacts of the device and the socket, making insertion and removal of the device easier, {{while at the same}} time eliminating the need for the complex mechanism that is used in ZIF sockets.|$|E
50|$|Video game {{cartridges}} typically {{take the}} form of a PCB with an edge connector: the socket is located within the console itself. The Nintendo Entertainment System was unusual in that it was designed to use a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> edge connector: instead of the user forcing the cartridge into the socket directly, the cartridge was first placed in a bay and then mechanically lowered into position.|$|R
50|$|DIPs can {{be mounted}} either by {{through-hole}} soldering or in sockets. Sockets allow easy replacement of a device and eliminates {{the risk of}} damage from overheating during soldering. Generally sockets were used for high-value or large ICs, which cost {{much more than the}} socket. Where devices would be frequently inserted and removed, such as in test equipment or EPROM programmers, a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket would be used.|$|R
50|$|Socket 603 was {{designed}} by Intel as a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket intended for workstations and server platforms. It contains 603 contacts arrayed in a grid about {{the center of the}} socket, each contact has a 1.27mm pitch with regular pin array, to mate with a 603-pin processor package. Intel's design notes distinguish Socket 603 from Socket 604 as low cost, low risk, robust, high volume manufacturable, and multi-sourceable.|$|R
50|$|Programmers for EPROMs like 2716 - 27256 using common {{programming}} voltages (Vpp) of 12.5, 21, and 25 V {{were available}} by connecting {{a device to}} the user port of the C64. These devices could cost 100 USD in 1985. The device often included a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> socket and a LED indicating when the EPROM chip was being programmed. The cartridge port was also used by some programmer devices.|$|E
5000|$|The Alpha {{microprocessor}} is socketed in a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> socket {{and can be}} upgraded. These workstations use Digital's 21174 chipset, {{also known}} as the [...] "Pyxis" [...] chipset. To increase flexibility and to reduce cost, the L3 cache is optional in these models. If the L3 cache is required, a cache module that contained the SRAMs which implemented the cache can be installed into a cache slot. The cache module has two capacities: 2 or 4 MB.|$|E
50|$|Common sockets have {{retention}} clips {{that apply}} a constant force, {{which must be}} overcome when a device is inserted. For chips {{with a large number}} of pins, either <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> sockets or land grid array (LGA) sockets are used instead. These designs apply a compression force once either a handle (for ZIF type) or a surface plate (LGA type) is put into place. This provides superior mechanical retention while avoiding the risk of bending pins when inserting the chip into the socket.|$|E
50|$|Sockets {{are still}} used for experimental, prototype, or {{educational}} applications, for testing of devices, for high-value chips such as microprocessors where replacement {{is still more}} economical than discarding the product, and for applications where the chip contains firmware or unique data that might be replaced or refreshed during {{the life of the}} product. Devices with hundreds of leads may be inserted in <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> sockets, which are also used on test equipment or device programmers.|$|R
50|$|In Spain, the NASA (model NS-90AP) or Creation (which {{are nearly}} the same, being the console name {{printed on the}} front the only difference) {{has been one of}} the most common NES clones. It is {{compatible}} with official NES games and also with copied and bootleg games. This is due to the fact that it has 72-pin connector, although it does not have a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket as the original NES had and it lacks a 10NES lockout chip.|$|R
50|$|Socket A (also {{known as}} Socket 462) is the CPU socket used for AMD {{processors}} {{ranging from the}} Athlon Thunderbird to the Athlon XP/MP 3200+, and AMD budget processors including the Duron and Sempron. Socket A also supports AMD Geode NX embedded processors (derived from the Mobile Athlon XP). The socket is a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> pin grid array type with 462 pins (nine pins are blocked in the socket to prevent accidental insertion of Socket 370 CPUs, hence the number 462). The front side bus frequencies supported for the AMD Athlon XP and Sempron are 133 MHz, 166 MHz, and 200 MHz.Socket A supports 32-bit CPUs only.|$|R
5000|$|The early 400 MHz (later 350 MHz) PCI-based version used a {{motherboard}} {{identical to}} the one used in Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White) computers including the use of <b>Zero</b> <b>Insertion</b> <b>Force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> processors sockets (minus the ADB port), in a [...] "graphite" [...] colored case and with the new Motorola PowerPC 7400 (G4) CPU. The higher-speed models, code name [...] "Sawtooth", used a greatly modified motherboard design with AGP 2x graphics (replacing the 66 MHz PCI slot). In December 1999, the entire Power Mac G4 line was updated to the AGP motherboard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> {{is a type}} of IC socket or {{electrical}} connector that requires very little force for insertion. With a ZIF socket, before the IC is inserted, a lever or slider {{on the side of the}} socket is moved, pushing all the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little force - generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient and no external downward force is required. The lever is then moved back, allowing the contacts to close and grip the pins of the IC. ZIF sockets are much more expensive than standard IC sockets and also tend to take up a larger board area due to the space taken up by the lever mechanism. Therefore they are only used when there is a good reason to do so.|$|E

50|$|DIP {{packages}} are usually made from an opaque molded epoxy plastic pressed around a tin-, silver-, or gold-plated lead frame {{that supports the}} device die and provides connection pins. Some types of IC are made in ceramic DIP packages, where high temperature or high reliability is required, or where the device has an optical window to {{the interior of the}} package. Most DIP {{packages are}} secured to a PCB by inserting the pins through holes in the board and soldering them in place. Where replacement of the parts is necessary, such as in test fixtures or where programmable devices must be removed for changes, a DIP socket is used. Some sockets include a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> mechanism.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{emergence}} of sleep and waking during embryonic life forms a fundamental part of understanding sleep physiology. Electroencephalography (EEG) {{is one of the most}} basic tools used to investigate sleep. We describe the preliminary design of a telemetry system composed of conductive polymer electrodes connected to a transmitter and a receiver. As an additional benefit, the system is electromagnetically compatible with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners, permitting the simultaneous acquisition of PET images and EEG data. The system was developed for recording chicken embryo EEG signals. Electromagnetic interference is avoided using an infrared data link for communication. The system makes use of six conductive polymer electrodes, with dimensions on a micrometer scale, connected via a <b>ZIF</b> (<b>Zero</b> <b>Insertion</b> <b>Force)</b> connector to a small, low power IR transmitter. This transmitter is optically coupled to a receiver, that it is connected to a PC for signal processing and data storage...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCryptographic {{primitives}} such as True Random Number Generator (TRNG), Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) {{but also}} cryptographic algorithms {{need to be}} tested and evaluated in different technologies, but with identical system architecture and operating conditions {{in order to be}} fairly compared. The random data generated by a TRNG or responses of a PUF are strongly linked to the underlying technology, but also to the environment conditions (EMI, temperature, power supply voltage…). Similarly, success of the side channel attacks on cryptographic algorithms depends strongly on technology, system architecture and operating conditions. Most of FPGA families have their own evaluation boards developed by their constructors and they are not adapted to fair benchmarking and side channel analysis (SCA). Indeed, all these boards are built in a completely different ways and have different architectures, communication protocols and peripherals. Consequently, fair comparison of TRNGs, PUFs or side channel attacks using standard evaluation boards is clearly impossible. The proposed multi-FPGA modular system Evariste III that is derived from the older Evariste II modular system [1], which was aimed at testing TRNGs, is now extended to be suitable for testing all hardware dependent cryptographic primitives: TRNGs, PUFs, but also for performing side channel attacks on cryptographic algorithms in different FPGA technologies with a unified hardware platform. Figure 1 : Evariste III system (left), Evariste III hardware (right) : motherboards and application modules The hardware system of Evariste III is composed of a set of motherboards with <b>ZIF</b> (<b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force)</b> connectors and application modules (see Figure 1). A base of six motherboards placed in a box interconnected by a JTAG chain makes a parallel evaluation of up to six modules possible. This is very helpful in PUF characterization that needs numerous data acquisitions to be performed in different operating conditions [2]. Besides the ZIF connectors for application modules, the Evariste III motherboards contain a USB interface controller, linear power supplies, high quality low pass filters and all necessary connectors. Three types of application modules have been designed for this new modular system. Each module is built around different FPGA family: Altera Cyclone V, Xilinx Spartan 6 and Microsemi Smart Fusion 2 with an embedded SoC based on an ARM processor. All daughter modules contain SMA connectors making SCA easier. The Evariste III motherboards are compatible with old modules of Evariste II (9 types of modules are available). The software tools and IP functions are open source. Reference designs can be freely downloaded. For academic institutions, the hardware can be made available remotely. Researchers can download related tools from the website and can upload their configuration bitstream to the remote FPGA. They can then download random data or PUF responses that were generated in the same hardware and in the same working conditions, in order to compare fairly different state-of-the-art TRNGs or PUFs.

Press-fit style connections {{are the most}} mature and conventional method typically used for implementing a connector structure [1]. These technologies require plated through-hole (PTH) vias for mating with pins. PTH vias can disrupt the return path which in turn increases the return path inductance and crosstalk, particularly at higher frequencies. They also introduce impedance mismatch problems at high frequencies due to reflections from stub...|$|E
40|$|An electrostatically-actuated micromirror {{optimized}} for large static pointing angles is designed, fabricated, and tested. A singlemask SOI process {{is used to}} create the actuators, mechanisms, and microassembly tools described in this paper. Two pick-and-place microassembly steps are used to (a) attach a mechanism that converts the actuators ’ in-plane motion into rotational motion, and (b) attach a mirror face sheet to the rotation mechanism. We report the largest static range of deflection angles for a micromirror: 0 - 28. 2 o and 0 - 14. 9 o at 50 V for each axis. Compared to the previous record [1], this corresponds to a 27 % improvement in one axis but a 12 % reduction in the other axis. Moreover, we use a single-mask process {{as opposed to the}} seven-mask process in [1]. Other new accomplishments reported here include a microfabricated tweezer that grabs and simultaneously rotates parts out of plane, a flexurally-suspended <b>Zero</b> <b>Insertion</b> <b>Force</b> (<b>ZIF)</b> socket for the assembled part, and a new tether design that holds the part while the tether is being broken...|$|E
30|$|In phase II, {{the total}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> {{waveforms}} exhibited several peaks. On the other hand, the needle tip force remained constant at 0.5  N while the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increased. The total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> decreased with needle tip force.|$|R
30|$|In phase II, {{the total}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force,</b> the {{friction}} force, and the needle tip force repeatedly increased and decreased. This {{can be explained}} by the fact that muscle tissue consists of fibers and bundles [13]. The needle <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increased while the muscle fibers deformed, and then fell as the muscular tissue ruptured. The needle tip force was a constant 0.5  N while the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increased.|$|R
30|$|In phase I, {{the total}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> {{increased}} non linearly until the needle penetrated the tissue surface.

40|$|Needle {{insertion}} into {{soft tissue}} {{is one of}} the most common medical interventions. This study provides macroscopic and microscopic observations of needle–gel interactions. A gelatin mixture is used as a soft-tissue simulant. For the macroscopic studies, system parameters, such as insertion velocity, needle diameter, gel elasticity, needle tip shape (including bevel angle) and insertion motion profile, are varied, while the maximum <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> and maximum needle deflection are recorded. The needle tip and gel interactions are observed using confocal microscopic images. Observations indicate that increasing the insertion velocity and needle diameter results in larger <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and smaller needle deflections. Varying the needle bevel angle from 8 ° to 82 ° results in the <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increasing mono- tonically, while the needle deflection does not. These variations are due to the coupling between gel rupture and tip compression interactions, which are observed during microscopic studies. Increasing the gel elasticity results in larger <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and needle deflections. Varying the tip shapes demonstrates that bevel-tipped needles produce the larg- est deflection, but <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> does not vary among the tested tip shapes. Insertion with different motion profiles are performed. Results show that adding 1 Hz rotational motion during linear insertion decreases the needle deflection. Increasing the rotational motion from 1 Hz to 5 Hz decreases the <b>insertion</b> <b>force,</b> while the needle deflection remains the same. A high-velocity (250 mm/s and 300 mm/s) tapping during insertion yields no significant decrease in needle deflection and a slight increase in <b>insertion</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In {{order to}} achieve a minimal trauma to the inner ear {{structures}} during array insertion, it would be suitable to control <b>insertion</b> <b>forces.</b> The aim of this work was to compare the <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> of an array insertion into anatomical specimens with three different insertion techniques: with forceps, with a commercial tool, and with a motorized tool. Materials and Methods. Temporal bones have been mounted on a 6 -axis force sensor to record <b>insertion</b> <b>forces.</b> Each temporal bone has been inserted, with a lateral wall electrode array, in random order, {{with each of the}} 3 techniques. Results. Forceps manual and commercial tool insertions generated multiple jerks during whole length insertion related to fits and starts. On the contrary, <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> with the motorized tool only rose {{at the end of the}} <b>insertion.</b> Overall <b>force</b> momentum was 1. 16 ± 0. 505 [*]N (mean ± SD, n= 10), 1. 337 ± 0. 408 [*]N (n= 8), and 1. 573 ± 0. 764 [*]N (n= 8) for manual insertion with forceps and commercial and motorized tools, respectively. Conclusion. Considering force momentum, no difference between the three techniques was observed. Nevertheless, a more predictable force profile could be observed with the motorized tool with a smoother rise of <b>insertion</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
