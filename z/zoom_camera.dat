The design draws heavily on that of the Mastcam camera used on the Mars Curiosity Rover with some upgrades.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes new algorithms {{to recover}} the calibration parameters and 3 D structure of a scene, using 2 D images taken by uncalibrated stationary <b>zooming</b> <b>cameras.</b> This is a common configuration, usually encountered in surveillance camera networks, stereo camera systems, and event monitoring vision systems. This problem is known as camera auto-calibration (also called self-calibration) and the motivation behind this work is to obtain the Euclidean three-dimensional reconstruction and metric measurements of the scene, using only the captured images. Under this configuration, the problem of auto-calibrating <b>zooming</b> <b>cameras</b> differs from the classical auto-calibration problem of a moving camera in two major aspects. First, the camera intrinsic parameters are changing due to <b>zooming.</b> Second, because <b>cameras</b> are stationary in our case, using classical motion constraints, such as a pure translation for example, is not possible. In order to simplify the non-linear complexity of this problem, i. e., auto-calibration of <b>zooming</b> <b>cameras,</b> we have followed a geometric stratification approach. In particular, we {{have taken advantage of}} the movement of the camera center, that results from the zooming process, to locate the plane at infinity and, consequently to obtain an affine reconstruction. Then, using the assumption that typical cameras have rectangular or square pixels, the calculation of the camera intrinsic parameters have become possible, leading to the recovery of the Euclidean 3 D structure. Being linear, the proposed algorithms were easily extended to the case of an arbitrary number of images and cameras. Furthermore, we have devised a sufficient constraint for detecting scene parallel planes, a useful information for solving other computer vision problems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we propose an {{accurate}} and robust image mosaicing method of soccer video taken from a rotating and <b>zooming</b> <b>camera</b> using line tracking and self-calibration. The mosaicing of soccer videos is not easy, because their playing fields are low textured and moving players {{are included in the}} fields. Our approach is to track line features on the playing fields. The line features are detected and tracked using a self-calibration technique for a rotating and <b>zooming</b> <b>camera.</b> To track line features efficiently, we propose a new line tracking algorithm, called camera parameter guided line tracking, which works even when the camera motion undergoes sudden changes. Since we do not need to know any model for scenes beforehand, the proposed algorithm can be easily extended to other video sources, as well as other sports videos. Experimental results show the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm. An application of mosaicing is also presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method for {{actively}} calibrating a multi-camera system consisting of pan-tilt <b>zoom</b> <b>cameras.</b> After a coarse initial cali-bration, we determine the probability of each relative pose using a prob-ability distribution based on the camera images. The relative poses are optimized by rotating and <b>zooming</b> each <b>camera</b> pair {{in a way that}} sig-nificantly simplifies the problem of extracting correct point correspon-dences. In a final step we use active camera control, the optimized rela-tive poses, and their probabilities to calibrate the complete multi-camera system with a minimal number of relative poses. During this process we estimate the translation scales in a camera triangle using only two of the three relative poses and no point correspondences. Quantitative experi-ments on real data outline the robustness and accuracy of our approach. ...|$|R
