The city council decided against a formal protection of the view, favoring increased development near transit.|$|E
5|$|The plan to {{relocate}} the Central Ferry Piers {{dates back to}} July 1999, when proposed amendments to the draft Central District (Extension) Outline <b>Zoning</b> <b>Plan</b> covering the Central Reclamation III area were published. Both the third generation Star Ferry Pier and Queen's Pier would be demolished and 16 hectares of land {{directly in front of}} the fourth-generation pier reclaimed to make way for a six-lane road and a low-rise shopping centre. The cost was estimated at HK$3.5 billion. The Government said that the historical significance of the third-generation pier would be recognised and promised to recreate the landmark on the new waterfront.|$|E
5|$|The <b>zoning</b> <b>plan</b> for {{the station}} was passed in 1998 and demands for {{accessibility}} were laid down in 2003, causing a contrast between these goals and the curved platforms. This would particularly be a challenge for the Class 70 trains, which would have a wide gap. Part of the dispute centered on the Vollsveien Bridge, {{whether or not it}} had a heritage status and whether or not its demolition would allow for a straight station. Minister of Transport and Communication Torild Skogsholm stated that she laid the blame on director of the National Rail Administration, Steinar Killi. Her successor, Liv Signe Navarsete, announced in July 2006 that the construction would continue following the curved design, though minor functional changes would be made.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1970s, {{the county}} has had in place a Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit (MPDU) <b>zoning</b> <b>plan</b> that {{requires}} developers to include affordable housing in any new residential developments that they construct in the county. The {{goal is to create}} socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods and schools so the rich and poor are not isolated in separate parts of the county. Developers who provide for more than the minimum amount of MPDUs are rewarded with permission to increase the density of their developments, which allows them to build more housing and generate more revenue.

25|$|A planned 20,000 {{jobs and}} 6,000 residences {{are to be}} located at Fornebu. The transit system {{therefore}} has to be dimensioned to handle this number of commuters during the morning rush-hour. Further expansion to the plans could bring {{the total number of}} jobs to 25,000. The increase would have to be entirely based on transit, as there is no sufficient parking capacity for more people to drive. Demand for the various modes is more or less the same, at about 4,000 people per hour in both directions. However, given a long-term, high-growth development, only the metro alternative actually has sufficient capacity to handle the traffic estimates. The <b>zoning</b> <b>plan</b> of Fornebu is designed {{in such a way that}} only a limited amount of the area can be built before a rail transit is under construction.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Akers-Jones briefly {{emerged from}} {{retirement}} to defend, before Hong Kong's Legislative Council, {{his role in}} zoning the Discovery Bay resort project on Lantau in the 1970s. Developers were allowed to build there with the stipulation that it would become a resort, {{but most of the}} units were later converted into luxury housing. Akers-Jones was involved in the original zoning decision as the then Secretary for the New Territories. With the new Hong Kong Disneyland having opened nearby and property prices having skyrocketed as a result, suspicions {{about the fact that the}} original <b>zoning</b> <b>plan</b> was never enforced have again come to the fore. He criticised the decision to call on an elderly man to testify on the matter, which happened some 30 years earlier. However, he revealed that colonial officials had abruptly changed the zoning of the Discovery Bay project, and gave it to new developers because they feared it would fall into the hands of the former Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Plans for a {{new stadium}} at Høddvoll were first {{articulated}} in 1951, resulting in a visit from NFF the following year to investigate the possibilities. The motion {{was passed by the}} club's annual meeting the same year and was included near the schools in the municipal <b>zoning</b> <b>plan</b> which was being revised. Hødd applied for a municipal grant in 1954. This resulted in a political disagreement as to the location of the new venue. The majority in the municipal council wanted the new stadium to be located at Høddvoll, while the minority called for it to be located next to the schools. This would have given a more central placement in town, but the majority was concerned that this would not give sufficient space for future school expansions, as well as giving higher construction costs. The municipality gave a grant of NOK10,000 towards land purchases, and Hødd paid NOK26,321 for the necessary land.|$|E

25|$|Frogn Municipal Council {{attempted}} {{to veto the}} development in November 1995, by demanding that either two or no tubes be built. The ministry stated that they would if necessary pass state zoning laws to avoid such disruptions. The municipal opposition rested in part on opposition to building a new road through a recreational forest area and the auxiliary road would come {{too close to the}} settlements at Heer. After the municipal council voted against rezoning, a new <b>zoning</b> <b>plan</b> was thus legislated by the ministry and Frogn Municipal Council lost further ability to participate in the planning. The ministry also decided that the road would be designated National Road 23 and be treated as a trunk route. The tunnel was expected to see a quintupling of the traffic compared to the ferry service. By June 1996 commitments from the Labour and Conservative Party ensured a majority in Parliament for the link. The project was passed by Parliament on 13 December 1996, against the votes of the other parliamentary parties.|$|E
25|$|The <b>zoning</b> <b>plan</b> was {{slightly}} changed in August. The W-1 area expanded a block {{and a half}} north of K Street NW and a block and a half west of 31st Street NW. The W-2 area expanded north to M Street NW as well as east to include a section bounded by the Potomac River, 30th Street NW, M Street NW, Pennsylvania Avenue NW, and 29th Street NW. The W-3 area above the C Canal was converted into W-1 zoned space. Public hearings on the revised plan began on August 6. The NCPC opposed the proposed regulations, arguing that it permitted buildings that were too high, did not regulate rooftop structures (such as penthouses or towers), provided too many exceptions for industrial use, and did not adequately protect historic structures. A group of local citizens and consultants known as the Georgetown Planning Group argued that the proposed rules permitted development that was too dense and too tall, and which would draw too much automobile and pedestrian traffic to the area. On November 15, the zoning board postponed action on the rezoning plan until the NCPC finished its regional planning exercise for the same area.|$|E
