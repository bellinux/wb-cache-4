5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace <b>zinc</b> <b>selenide</b> as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons.

25|$|Transmissivity is {{determined}} by the percentage of light transmitted per the incident light. Transmissivity is usually the same from both first and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For transmissive mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, beam splitters, or laser output couplers, the transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the transmissivity. For the substrate, the material used must also have good transmissivity to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as <b>zinc</b> <b>selenide</b> or synthetic sapphire may be used for infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|E

Light-emitting semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable emission properties are of great interest for applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics and biology. However, these applications require nanocrystals that are small and cadmium-free (that is, nontoxic), which are currently not available. To make such nanocrystals, the researchers added a selenium precursor molecule to a mixture of zinc, indium and copper salts. This produced copper-doped <b>zinc</b> indium <b>selenide</b> alloy nanocrystals with a fixed size of around 2. 5 nm.

Varying the cation composition allowed the nanocrystal's emission properties to be tuned from green to red wavelengths.

The nanocrystals are unique because they retain their small fixed size during wavelength tuning. The nanocrystals are ultrasmall, cadmium-free and absorb visible and ultraviolet light.
