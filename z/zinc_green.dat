However, this product is known to cause "bait-shyness" following the initial application so additional control with subsequent applications of ZP targeting the same rat population would not likely result in a significant increase in control. Ramik Green and Ramik Brown are slow acting anticoagulant rodenticides, and performed similarly to each other. Anticoagulant rodenticides are not known to cause bait-shyness. In this study, these products only offered 20 to 38 % control, but it is possible that these values may be artificially low since the rats may have been preferentially feeding on stored oat groats used to gauge feeding activity rather than consuming the anticoagulant baits...|$|R

30|$|Pioneering work on digital color {{reconstruction}} (‘rejuvenation’) {{of historic}} paintings {{has been conducted}} by Berns following a hybrid strategy of spectral reflectance measurements and photographic image color segmentation [8]. Georges Seurat used a zinc yellow paint that darkened over time, affecting pointillist dabs of yellow, orange and <b>green,</b> made from <b>zinc</b> yellow; zinc yellow, vermilion, and white; and <b>zinc</b> yellow, emerald <b>green,</b> and white, respectively. This darkening occurred for his iconic painting, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, dated 1884. Kubelka–Munk theory was used to create an optical database of these paints and concentrations were determined for each measurement using nonlinear optimization minimizing spectral reflectance root-mean-square difference. Using a laboratory dispersion of zinc yellow and linseed oil, the darkened zinc yellow was replaced with the laboratory dispersion for measurements representing each color. Color changes between the measurement {{before and after the}} paint replacement was used to create custom curves that were used for segmented areas of La Grande Jatte. Berns used the same technique in producing color reconstructions of two of the three versions of Van Gogh’s Bedroom where eosin and cochineal lake pigments faded [9]. Because the concentration of the faded paints could not be determined, a team of curators and conservators made informed decisions on concentration.|$|R

The buildings were located on the site and oriented to face north, {{the direction in which}} Tubman led slaves to freedom. Plans called for four buildings, three dedicated to exhibits and one to house administrative offices. Each of the buildings is shaped like a barn, since Tubman and the slaves she was leading to freedom often slept in barns at night and barns are evocative of the rural architecture of the area. The three exhibit buildings are clad in a light <b>green</b> <b>zinc</b> siding which will dull with time. Zinc was chosen because it is a self-healing material which the architects felt reflected the healing which has gone on since the American Civil War. The administration building is clad in wood. Construction of the buildings utilized a number of craftsman. Building materials included stone and reclaimed wood, and the architectural style featured exposed beams and timbers. [...] The buildings were designed to have windows which featured views of the surrounding wildlife refuge, little of which had changed since Tubman's day. All the structures were designed to be green buildings with at least a LEED Silver certification. The buildings feature geothermal heating and cooling, green roofs, permeable paving in parking areas and on pathways, and solar-powered external lighting.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{highlights}} {{the effect of}} copper, cadmium and <b>zinc</b> in <b>green</b> tiger prawn Penaeus semisu/catus, one of the penaeids occurring throughout the Indian coastal waters particularly in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay. Acute toxicity bioassays were conducted for copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (In). The 96 h LCso for copper, cadmium and zinc were 6. 98 ppm, 2. 8 ppm and 5. 00 ppm respectively. The degree of toxicity of the three metals {{were in the order}} Cd > In > Cu. Based on the LCso values, two sublethal concentrations of copper (0. 7 ppm and 1. 4 ppm), cadmium (0. 25 ppm and 0. 5 ppm) and zinc (0. 5 ppm and 1. 00 ppm) were selected for bioaccumulation, physio-biochemical and histopathological studies. In all the lethal and sublethal exposures, blackening of the gill lamellae and exoskeleton was noticed. The accumulation of metals was pronounced in the hepatopancreas, gills, muscle, tail and carapace. The results of the study suggest that the shrimps could not regulate the accumulation of Cu. Cd and In. The bioaccumulation in the selected organsltissues was found to be dose dependent. In the physio-biochemical studies. an increase in the respiration rate was found in shrimps exposed to lethal concentrations of copper. cadmium and zinc. The biochemical components, carbohydrate, protein and lipid were found to get reduced during the various phases of metal exposure. The observed change in the proximate components is attributed to the alterations in the enzymes involved in cellular energy generation processes. inhibition of protein synthesis by the alteration in the DNA and RNA content and increases in the free fatty acid content due to changes in the synthesis and mobilization of lipids.

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{strategy}} to prepare metal oxides including binary oxide and mixed metal oxide (MMO) in form of nanometer-sized particles using polymer as precursor. Zinc oxide nanoparticles are prepared as an example. The obtained zinc polyacrylate precursor is amorphous as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The conversion from polymer precursor to ZnO nanocrystals by thermal pyrolysis was investigated by means of XRD, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and electron microscopy. The as-synthesized ZnO consists of many individual particles with a diameter around 40 nm as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photoluminescence (PL) and electron paramagnetic (EPR) properties of the material are investigated, too. Employing this method, ZnO nanocrystalline films are fabricated via pyrolysis of a zinc polyacrylate precursor film on solid substrate like silicon and quartz glass. The results of XRD, absorption spectra as well as TEM prove that both the ZnO nanopowder and film undergo same evolution process. Comparing the PL properties of films fabricated in different gas atmosphere, it is assigned that the blue emission of the ZnO films is due to crystal defect of <b>zinc</b> vacancy and <b>green</b> emission from oxygen vacancy. Two kinds of ZnO-based mixed metal oxide (Zn 1 -xMgxO and Zn 1 -xCoxO) particles with very precise stoichiometry are prepared by controlled pyrolysis of the corresponding polymer precursor at 550 oC. The MMO crystal particles are typically 20 - 50 nm in diameter. Doping of Mg in ZnO lattice causes shrinkage of lattice parameter c, while it remains unchanged with Co incorporation. Effects of bandgap engineering are seen in the Mg:ZnO system. The photoluminescence in the visible is enhanced by incorporation of magnesium on zinc lattice sites, while the emission is suppressed in the Co:ZnO system. Magnetic property of cobalt doped-ZnO is checked too and ferromagnetic ordering was not found in our samples. An alternative way to prepare zinc oxide nanoparticles is presented upon calcination of zinc-loaded polymer precursors, which is synthesized via inverse miniemulsion polymerization {{of the mixture of}} the acrylic acid and zinc nitrate. The as-prepared ZnO product is compared with that obtained from polymer-salt complex method.

40|$|AbstractThe U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has {{restricted}} concentrated {{animal feeding}} operation (CAFO) release of waste products into U. S. waters. These waste products must {{be disposed of}} using best management practices. Most of the waste is spread on cropland, but some operations have found other creative uses for waste products. Use of a phosphorus (P) reduction system to remove P from wastewater results in magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP), a slowly soluble fertilizer. Using a P reduction system will not {{eliminate the need for}} land application of manure and wastewater, but it reduces the nutrient load in the waste that is applied thereby making compliance with regulations easier. In the first year of this study, MAP was compared to a controlled release fertilizer (CRF) with a similar nutrient element ratio on plant growth, fruit yield, nitrogen (N), P, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) concentration in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. ‘Mountain Fresh Plus’) plant parts. Plant growth and fruit production were similar with the two fertilizers, but the number of tomato culls was greater with either fertilizer than on control plants. Foliar N, P, Ca, and Mg concentration did not differ regardless of fertilizer treatment. Plants fertilized with CRF had a greater leaf K concentration than those fertilized with MAP, but foliar K concentration did not differ between fertilized and nonfertilized plants. Iron and Mn concentration in above-ground vegetative plant parts (stems and leaves) did not differ regardless of fertilizer treatment, but Zn concentration increased linearly as CRF increased. In the second year, MAP, each of the essential elements contained in MAP separately, and a hand mixture of each of these elements was tested for their effect on tomato plant growth, fruit yield, and tissue N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn concentration and content. Magnesium ammonium phosphate and the hand mixture of fertilizer resulted in greater above-ground biomass excluding fruit stem weight and fruit yield than any of the individual nutrient treatments. Calcium sulfate resulted in a greater number and weight of tomatoes harvested than MAP. Nitrogen concentration did not differ among the fertilizer treatments for roots, stems, or leaves, but N content was greater in red fruit with the hand mix of fertilizer than with no fertilizer or with ammonium sulfate or Mg oxide. In immature green fruit at termination of the study, N content was greater with no fertilizer or Ca sulfate than with MAP or triple superphosphate (TSP). Phosphorus, K, and Ca concentrations did not differ among fertilizer treatments for any tissue tested. Magnesium concentration in green tomatoes differed among fertilizer treatments such that Mg concentration of green tomatoes from plants fertilized with TSP was greater than Mg concentration of green tomatoes fertilized with ammonium sulfate or Mg oxide. Phosphorus and K content of green fruit differed among fertilizer treatments with P and K concentration highest in green fruit from plants fertilized with Ca sulfate and lowest in green fruit from plants fertilized with MAP or TSP. Iron and Mn concentrations did not differ among fertilizer treatments for any tissue tested. Zinc concentration in leaves was greater when plants were fertilized with MAP, TSP, Ca sulfate, or Mg oxide than with ammonium sulfate. <b>Zinc</b> concentration of <b>green</b> fruit was greater when fertilized with MAP than with the hand mix, Ca sulfate or Mg oxide. Iron content was highest in green fruit from plants fertilized with TSP and lowest in plants fertilized with ammonium sulfate or control plants. Manganese content of leaves from control plants was greater than that of plants receiving ammonium sulfate while red fruit from plants fertilized with the hand mix had a greater Mn content than red fruit from any other treatment. Foliar Zn content was greater in plants fertilized with Ca sulfate than in those fertilized with the hand mix, ammonium sulfate, or TSP. In contrast, Zn content of red fruit fertilized with the hand mix was greater than for red fruit in any other treatment. Green fruit from control plants and those receiving MAP had a greater Zn content than plants fertilized with the hand mix, TSP, or Mg oxide. Fertilizer application increased Fe, Mn, and Zn content of several plant tissues. None of the labels of fertilizers applied stated that they contained micronutrients; however, small amounts of contamination were possible. Differing micronutrient contents of various plant tissues among fertilizer treatments were probably associated with other elements affecting plant growth or nutrient uptake. The nutrient elements present in the various fertilizers were not always the nutrient elements affected in the plants likely due to another element that may have limited plant growth or nutrient uptake...|$|R
