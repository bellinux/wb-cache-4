50|$|Just {{like the}} other root knot {{nematode}}s, {{to be able to}} feed within the host, this nematode must establish an interaction with the plant. J2s are attracted to the root tip in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> and the areas of lateral root emergence. Initially it was reported that they are attracted by CO2, and apparently by small molecules that are dialysable - perhaps amino acids. Recent studies suggest that the attraction may not be to CO2 but to lower pH resulting from carbonic acid formed from the CO2 in solution.|$|E
40|$|To control organ shape, plant cells expand differentially. The {{organization}} of the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall is a key determinant of differential expansion. Mutations in the COBRA (COB) gene of Arabidopsis, known to affect the orientation of cell expansion in the root, are reported here {{to reduce the amount}} of crystalline cellulose in cell walls in the root growth zone. The COB gene, identified by map-based cloning, contains a sequence motif found in proteins that are anchored to the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. In animal cells, this lipid linkage is known to confer polar localization to proteins. The COB protein was detected predominately on the longitudinal sides of root cells in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> rapid <b>elongation.</b> Moreover, COB RNA levels are dramatically upregulated in cells entering the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> rapid <b>elongation.</b> Based on these results, models are proposed for the role of COB as a regulator of oriented cell expansion...|$|R
40|$|The gravitropic bending {{of maize}} roots, as a {{response}} to reorientation of the root within a gravitational field, was examined for sensitivity to exogenous applications of the cytoskeletal inhibitor, cytochalasin D.

When untreated roots were placed in a horizontal position with respect to gravity, a 40 degree bending response was observed within one hour. This bending also occurred when cytochalasin D was applied at high concentrations to the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> root cell <b>elongation.</b> However, when cytochalasin D above 40 micrograms/ml was applied to the root cap, roots lost the ability of directional reorientation within the gravitational field, causing a random bending...|$|R
40|$|In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; Columbia- 0) roots, the {{so-called}} <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>elongation</b> comprises two clearly different domains: the transition zone, a postmeristematic region (approximately 200 - 450 mu m proximal {{of the root}} tip) with a low rate <b>of</b> <b>elongation,</b> and a fast elongation zone, the adjacent proximal region (450 mu m away from the root tip {{up to the first}} root hair) with a high rate <b>of</b> <b>elongation.</b> In this study, the surface pH was measured in both zones using the microelectrode ion flux estimation technique. The surface pH is highest in the apical part <b>of</b> the transition <b>zone</b> and is lowest at the basal part <b>of</b> the fast <b>elongation</b> <b>zone.</b> Fast cell elongation is inhibited within minutes by the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid; concomitantly, apoplastic alkalinization occurs in the affected root zone. Fusicoccin, an activator of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase, can partially rescue this inhibition <b>of</b> cell <b>elongation,</b> whereas the inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide does not further reduce the maximal cell length.

50|$|In plant systems, Klebsiella can {{be found}} in a variety of plant hosts.

They are bacteria of interest in an agricultural context, due to their ability to increase crop yields under agricultural conditions. Their high numbers in plants are thought to be at least partly attributable to their lack of a flagellum, as flagella are known to induce plant defenses.

5000|$|The second {{juvenile}} (J2) penetrates <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> by mechanical (stylet thrusts) {{and probably}} chemical (cellulase and pectinase) means. It moves between, rather than through, cortical cells towards root apex, turns at the meristem, and migrates {{back to the}} vascular cylinder in the zone of cell differentiation. [...] Once the J2 is in the root, they migrate intracellularly to the provascular cells and begin to parasitize cells within 24 hours. The nematode initiates formation of the giant cell (also called a nurse cell) from potential vascular tissue. Sub ventral gland become prominent after penetrating the root, {{and it could be}} playing a role of secreting enzymes that {{play a role in the}} formation of the giant cell which is a large cell with several nuclei. Giant cell are very large in size (100 fold increase), with reduced vacuoles and they are multinucleate containing about 40 to 100 nuclei. The female feeds from the giant cell as it expands further posteriorly accumulating eggs. After formation of the giant cells, gall development occurs though these two events are separate. Galls result from hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the cells around the giant cells. Growth regulators (IAA) are thought to have a role in cell enlargement since they increases cell wall plasticity.|$|E
40|$|Auxin {{is a prime}} {{candidate}} for regulating and modulating the differential growth response of primary corn roots to gravity. Auxin, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), both promotes and inhibits root elongation rapidly within a narrow concentration range. Thus growth regulation would require only small changes in the short lag period for initiation of gravitropism. Since auxin is transported to/through the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> toward the meristem, it {{may serve as a}} direct communication link between the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation,</b> site of gravitropic response, and the root cap (RC), site of gravity perception. When auxin transport is inhibited, gravitropism is also inhibited. Napthylpthalamic acid (NPA) is one such inhibitor. It inhibits gravitropism only when applied to the apical growing and dividing region of the root. Application at the basal end of the root does not influence gravitropic NPA causes upward curvature when applied to the upper surface of horizontal, two day-old, intact corn roots. This effect is countered by application of IAA to the opposite side...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{balance between}} {{cellular}} proliferation and differentiation {{is a key}} aspect of development in multicellular organisms. Using high-resolution expression data from the Arabidopsis root, we identified a transcription factor, UPBEAT 1 (UPB 1), that regulates this balance. Genomewide expression profiling coupled with ChIP-chip analysis revealed that UPB 1 directly regulates {{the expression of a}} set of peroxidases that modulate the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) between the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> cell proliferation and the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>elongation</b> where differentiation begins. Disruption of UPB 1 activity alters this ROS balance, leading to a delay in the onset of differentiation. Modulation of either ROS balance or peroxidase activity through chemical reagents affects the onset of differentiation {{in a manner consistent with}} the postulated UPB 1 function. This pathway functions independently of auxin and cytokinin plant hormonal signaling. Comparison to ROS-regulated growth control in animals suggests that a similar mechanism is used in plants and animals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Root-knot {{nematodes}} (Meloidogyne spp.) are obligate endoparasites of a {{wide range}} of plant species. The infective stage is attracted strongly to and enters host roots at the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation,</b> but the compounds responsible for this attraction have not been identified. We developed a simple assay to investigate nematode response to chemical gradients that uses Pluronic F- 127, a synthetic block copolymer that, as a 23 % aqueous solution, forms a liquid at low temperature and a gel at room temperature. Test chemicals are put into a modified pipette tip, or ‘chemical dispenser, ’ and dispensers are inserted into the gel in which nematodes have been dispersed. Meloidogyne hapla is attracted to pH gradients formed by acetic acid and several other Brønsted acids and aggregates between pH 4. 5 and 5. 4. While this pH range was attractive to all tested root-knot nematode strains and species, the level of aggregation depended on the species/strain assessed. For actively growing roots, the pH at the root surface is most acidic at the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation.</b> This observation is consistent with the idea that low pH is an attractant for nematodes. Root-knot nematodes have been reported to be attracted to carbon dioxide, but our experiments suggest that the observed attraction may be due to acidification of solutions by dissolved CO 2 rather than to CO 2 itself. These results suggest that Pluronic F- 127 gel will be broadly applicable for examining responses of a range of organisms to chemical gradients or to each other...|$|E
40|$|Adhesion {{sites on}} grass roots for Klebsiella strains {{carrying}} type 3 or type 1 fimbriae or both were determined.

No adhesion to the epidermal cells between root hairs was observed. The adhesion sites were identical for the type 3 - and 1 -fimbriated bacteria and for P. pratensis, F. rubra, and Trifolium pratense.

40|$|The {{reduction}} in growth of maize (Zea mays L.) seedling primary roots induced by salinization of the nutrient medium with 100 millimolar NaCl {{was accompanied by}} reductions in {{the length of the}} root tip <b>elongation</b> <b>zone,</b> the length <b>of</b> fully elongated epidermal cells, and the apparent rate of cell production: Each was partially restored when calcium levels in the salinized growth medium were increased from 0. 5 to 10. 0 millimolar. We investigated the possibility that the inhibition <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> growth by salinity might be associated with an inhibition of cell wall acidification, such as that which occurs when root growth is inhibited by IAA. A qualitative assay of root surface acidification, using bromocresol purple pH indicator in agar, showed that salinized roots, with and without extra calcium, produced a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> surface acidification which was similar to that produced by control roots. The <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> acidification began 1 to 2 millimeters behind the tip and coincided with the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>elongation.</b> The remainder <b>of</b> the root alkalinized its surface. Kinetics of surface acidification were assayed quantitatively by placing a flat tipped pH electrode in contact with the elongation zone. The pH at the epidermal surfaces of roots grown either with 100 millimolar NaCl (growth inhibitory), or with 10 millimolar calcium ± NaCl (little growth inhibition), declined from 6. 0 to 5. 1 over 30 minutes. We conclude that NaCl did not inhibit growth by reducing the capacity of epidermal cells to acidify their walls...|$|R

Kunth were studied. Additionally, Azoarcus spp. were localized in roots of field-grown Kallar grass. To facilitate localization and to assure identity of bacteria, genetically engineered microorganisms expressing beta-glucuronidase {{were also used}} as inocula. beta-Glucuronidase staining indicated that the apical region of the root behind the meristem was the most intensively colonized. Light and electron microscopy showed that strain BH 72 penetrated the rhizoplane preferentially in the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> and differentiation and colonized the root interior inter- and intracellularly. In addition to the root cortex, stelar tissue was also colonized; bacteria {{were found in the}} xylem. No evidence was obtained that Azoarcus spp. could reside in living plant cells; rather, plant cells were apparently destroyed after bacteria had penetrated the cell wall. A common pathogenicity test on tobacco leaves provided no evidence that representative strains of Azoarcus spp. are phytopathogenic. Compared with the control, inoculation with strain BH 72 significantly promoted growth of rice seedlings. This effect was reversed when the plant medium was supplemented with malate (0. 2 g/liter). N 2 fixation was apparently not involved, because the same response was obtained with a nifK mutant of strain BH 72, which has a Nif- phenotype. Also, Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of protein extracts from rice seedlings gave no indication that nitrogenase was present. PCR and Western immunoblotting, using primers specific for eubacteria and antibodies recognizing type-specific antigens, respectively, indicated that strain BH 72 could colonize rice plants systemically, probably mediated by longitudinal spreading through vessels...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{plastids}} {{are fundamental}} to {{many aspects of}} plant biology {{and the production of}} enhanced crop cultivars, research into the dynamics of non-green plastids has remained somewhat disregarded by the scientific community compared to chloroplasts. They are equally pivotal to normal plant development however, and are now increasingly becoming the focus of research made possible by genetic manipulation and reporter gene constructs. The total plastid content of all plant cells originates from small, undifferentiated plastids termed proplastids found within the meristematic regions of both root and shoot tissue. The cellular regulatory mechanisms controlling the development of plastids in young tissues are poorly understood, {{especially in the case of}} non-green plastids in roots. This investigation consequently aimed to elucidate the differences in plastid content, morphology and subcellular localization within epidermal cells derived from the root and shoot apical meristems (RAM and SAM respectively) of Arabidopsis thaliana. Quantification of non-green plastids was facilitated via the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy in conjunction with the expression of plastid-targeted green fluorescent protein driven by a constitutive promoter. Characterization of early seedling development and tissue diversification was also achieved by assessing epidermal cell size relative to developmental progression, ultimately facilitating comparative analyses of plastid dynamics on both a temporal and tissue-varietal basis. The number of plastids in epidermal cells within RAM-derived tissue was shown to increase across regions of cell division before being regulated throughout subsequent <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> and maturing root tissue. In contrast, epidermal cells of the hypocotyl exhibit a more generalized increase in plastid number and less strict maintenance of cell plan area coverage during tissue expansion. The findings presented here suggest the functioning of distinct mechanisms regulating plastid division and growth in relation to cell size within shoot and root apical meristem-derived tissues...|$|R
40|$|Root {{infection}} in {{susceptible host species}} is initiated predominantly in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation,</b> whereas {{the remainder of the}} root is resistant. Nectria haematococca infection of pea (Pisum sativum) was used as a model to explore possible mechanisms influencing the localization of root infection. The failure to infect the root tip was not due to a failure to induce spore germination at this site, suppression of pathogenicity genes in the fungus, or increased expression of plant defense genes. Instead, exudates from the root tip induce rapid spore germination by a pathway that is independent of nutrient-induced germination. Subsequently, a factor produced during fungal infection and death of border cells at the root apex appears to selectively suppress fungal growth and prevent sporulation. Host-specific mantle formation in response to border cells appears to represent a previously unrecognized form of host-parasite relationship common to diverse species. The dynamics of signal exchange leading to mantle development may {{play a key role in}} fostering plant health, by protecting root meristems from pathogenic invasion...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{cells are}} {{considered}} to possess functionally different types of vacuoles in the same cell. One of the papers cited {{in support of this}} concept reported that protein storage and lytic vacuoles in root tips of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings were initially separate compartments that later fused to form a central vacuole during cell elongation. We have reinvestigated the situation in these two roots using immunogold electron microscopy as well as immunofluorescence microscopy of histological sections. Using antisera generated against the whole protein of α-tonoplast intrinsic protein (TIP) as well as specific C-terminal TIP peptide antisera against α-, γ-, and δ-TIP, together with antisera against the storage proteins barley lectin and pea legumin and vicilin, we were unable to obtain evidence for separate vacuole populations. Instead, our observations point to the formation of a single type of vacuole in cells differentiating both proximally and distally from the root meristem. This is a hybrid-type vacuole containing storage proteins and having both α- and γ-TIPs, but not δ-TIP, in its tonoplast. As cells differentiate toward the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation,</b> their vacuoles are characterized by increasing amounts of γ-TIP and decreasing amounts of α-TIP...|$|E

In each well, one 4 -mm root segment, excised from the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> of rough lemon roots, was buried in 0. 88 g dry sand. Addition of a Radopholus citrophilus suspension containing ca. 300 nematodes in 50 μ 1 test solution completely moistened the sand in each well. The technique assured uniform treatment concentration throughout the medium. Within 16 - 24 hours, burrowing nematodes penetrated citrus root pieces, primarily through the cut ends. The lectins (100 μg/ml) Concanavalin A (Con A), soybean agglutinin (SBA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and Lotus tetragonolobus agglutinin (LOT) stimulated an increase in penetration of citrus root segments by Radopholus citrophilus. Concentrations as low as 12. 5 μg/ml Con A, LOT, and WGA stimulated burrowing nematode penetration of citrus roots. Heat denaturation of the lectins reversed their effect on penetration; however, incubation of nematodes in lectin (25 μg/ml) with 25 mM competitive sugars did not. The reason for enhanced penetration associated with lectins is unclear...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{role for}} {{cortical}} microtubules, cellulose microfibrils and cell wall enzymes {{in the control}} of plant cell expansion has been suggested for several decades, but {{has not yet been}} proven ill any system. Arabidopsis root epidermis is ail ideal tissue to test this hypothesis, and consequently is the Subject of many recent reports. Microtubules of epidermal cells are transverse to the root axis in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> fast <b>elongation,</b> but when cells enter the differentiation zone microtubules switch to a slightly oblique orientation in atrichoblasts and to a disordered distribution ill trichoblasts. Factors that severely affect root elongation do so by acting oil the process <b>of</b> fast <b>elongation.</b> Ethylene, auxin, water stress as well as reduced cellulose synthesis induce a similar response. Within minutes a new and much shorter final cell size is defined, and cells do not grow beyond this length. Eventually, fast cell elongation is totally inhibited. In cells that are longer than this new final cell size, cortical microtubules change their orientation in the time frame of 10 - 15 min and adopt orientations typical for the differentiation zone, while the orientation of cellulose fibrils is not changed in the walls of the affected cells. Microtubules, however, are not the causal agents: as fast elongation and its inhibition are insensitive to microtubule disrupting or stabilizing drugs. Control of cell size seems to be located at the level of cell wall metabolism.

Southern-blot data suggested that β-glu-cosidase is encoded by a small multigene family in sorghum. Northern-blot data indicated that the mRNA corresponding to the cloned Dhr cDNA is present at high levels in the node and upper half of the mesocotyl in etiolated seedlings but at low levels in the root—only in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> and the tip region. Light-grown seedling parts had lower levels of Dhr mRNA than those of etiolated seedlings. Immunoblot analysis performed using maize-anti-β-glucosidase sera detected two distinct dhurrinases (57 and 62 kD) in sorghum. The distribution of Dhr activity in different plant parts supports the mRNA and immunoreactive protein data, suggesting that the cloned cDNA corresponds to the Dhr 1 (57 kD) isozyme and that the dhr 1 gene shows organ-specific expression...|$|E
40|$|Plant roots {{apply force}} to make {{cylindrical}} cavities in soil, which {{allow them to}} grow and elongate. However, in certain situations, roots need to apply {{only a small amount}} of force, for instance, when a root tip reaches an existing channel (made by either earthworms, roots of a previous crop, or cracks from shrinkage of soil). Studies in homogeneous soils of uniform strength usually show development of localized zones of compressed soil around roots. A root growing in soil exerts force within the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation</b> behind the root cap (Fig. 1) until the elongation zone reaches maturity and the force shifts to a new elongation zone developed through cell division. Roots apply force in axial and radial directions. As roots have a cylindrical shape (some departure from cylindrical shape is expected for roots in very strong soils) they apply force over a cylindrical area. Therefore, root growth pressure is an estimated quantity from separate measurements of force and area. For axial pressure, area over which the force is exerted is circular, which can be estimated from the measurement of diameter in the elongation zone of the root. For radial pressure, force is exerted over a cylindrical surface; so, both diameter and length of the root are important. At the soil-root interface, axial and radial root growth forces are expected to vary with time, and so does the area over which these forces are exerted...|$|E
40|$|A {{requirement}} for understanding morphogenesis {{is being able}} to quantify expansion at the cellular scale. Here, we present new software (RootflowRT) for measuring the expansion profile of a growing root at high spatial and temporal resolution. The software implements an image processing algorithm using a novel combination of optical flow methods for deformable motion. The algorithm operates on a stack of nine images with a given time interval between each (usually 10 s) and quantifies velocity confidently at most pixels of the image. The root {{does not need to be}} marked. The software calculates components of motion parallel and perpendicular to the local tangent of the root 2 ̆ 7 s midline. A variation of the software has been developed that reports the overall root growth rate versus time. Using this software, we find that the growth zone of the root can be divided into two distinct regions, an apical region where the rate of motion, i. e. velocity, rises gradually with position and a subapical region where velocity rises steeply with position. In both zones, velocity increases almost linearly with position, and the transition between zones is abrupt. We observed this pattern for roots of Arabidopsis, tomato (Lycopersicon lycopersicum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), alyssum (Aurinia saxatilis), and timothy (Phleum pratense). These velocity profiles imply that relative elongation rate is regulated in a step-wise fashion, being low but roughly uniform within the meristem and then becoming high, but again roughly uniform, within the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>elongation.</b> The executable code for RootflowRT is available from the corresponding author on request...|$|E
40|$|The infectible {{cells of}} soybean roots {{appear to be}} located {{at any given time}} just above the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> root <b>elongation</b> and just below the {{position}} of the smallest emergent root hairs. The location of infectible cells on the primary root at the time of inoculation was inferred from the position of subsequent nodule development, correcting for displacement of epidermal cells due to root elongation. Marks were made on the seedling growth pouches at the time of inoculation to indicate the position of the root tip and the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> root hair development. Virtually all of the seedlings developed nodules on the primary root above the marks made at the root tips at the time of inoculation. None of the plants formed nodules on the root where mature root hairs were present at the time of inoculation. These results and profiles of nodulation frequency indicate that the location of infectible cells is developmentally restricted. When inoculations were delayed for intervals of 1 to 4 hours after marking the positions of the root tips, progressively fewer nodules were formed above the root tip marks, and the uppermost of these nodules were formed at progressively shorter distances above the marks. These results indicate that the infectibility of given host cells is a transient property that appears and then is lost within a few hours. The results also indicate that host responses leading to infection and nodulation are triggered or initiated in less than 2 hours after inoculation. The extent of nodulation above the root tip mark increased in proportion to the logarithm of the number of bacteria in the inoculum...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study {{on the effects of}} N-supply on leaf cell elongation, the spatial distribution <b>of</b> relative cell <b>elongation</b> rates (RCER), epidermal cell turgor, osmotic pressure (OP) and water potential (¿) along the <b>elongation</b> <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the third leaf of barley was determined (W. Fricke et al. 1997. Planta 202 : 522 - 530). The results suggested that in plants receiving N at fixed relative addition rates (N-supply limitation <b>of</b> growth), cell <b>elongation</b> was rate-limited by the rate of solute provision, whereas in plants growing on complete nutrient solution containing excessive amounts of N (N-demand limitation), cell elongation was rate-limited by the rate of water supply or wall yielding. In the present paper, these suggestions were tested further. The generation rates of cell OP, turgor and ¿ along the elongation zone were calculated by applying the continuity equation of fluid dynamics to the previous data. To allow a more conclusive interpretation of results, anatomical data were collected and bulk solute concentrations determined. The rate of OP generation generally exceeded the rate of turgor generation. As a result, negative values of cell ¿ were created, particularly in demand-limited plants. These plants showed highest RCER along the elongation zone and a ¿ gradient of at least - 0. 15 MPa between water source (xylem) and expanding epidermal cells. The latter was similar to a theoretically predicted value (- 0. 18 MPa). Highest rates of OP generation were observed in demand-limited plants, with a maximum rate of 0. 112 MPa. h- 1 at 16 - 20 mm from the leaf base. This was almost twice the rate in N-supply-limited plants and implied that the cells in the leaf <b>elongation</b> <b>zone</b> were capable <b>of</b> importing (or synthesising) every minute almost 1 mM of osmolytes. Potassium, Cl- and NO-~ 3 were the main inorganic osmolytes (only determined for demand-limited plants). Their concentrations suggest that, unlike the situation in fully expanded epidermal cells, sugars are used to generate OP and turgor. Anatomical data revealed that the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> lateral cell expansion extended distally beyond the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>elongation.</b> It is concluded that leaf cell expansion in barley relies on high rates of water and solute supply, rates that may not be sustainable during periods of sufficient N-supply (limitation by water supply: ¿ gradients) or limiting N-supply (limitation by solute provision: reduced OP-generation rates). To minimise the possibility of growth limitation by water and osmolyte provision, longitudinal and lateral cell expansion peak at different locations along the growth zone...|$|R
40|$|Maize (Zea mays) roots {{respond to}} a variety of {{environmental}} stimuli which are perceived by a specialized group of cells, the root cap. We are studying the transduction of extracellular signals by roots, particularly the role of protein kinases. Protein phosphorylation by kinases is an important step in many eukaryotic signal transduction pathways. As a first phase of this research we have isolated a cDNA encoding a maize protein similar to fungal and animal protein kinases known {{to be involved in the}} transduction of extracellular signals. The deduced sequence of this cDNA encodes a polypeptide containing amino acids corresponding to 33 out of 34 invariant or nearly invariant sequence features characteristic of protein kinase catalytic domains. The maize cDNA gene product is more closely related to the branch of serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domains composed of the cyclic-nucleotide- and calcium-phospholipid-dependent subfamilies than to other protein kinases. Sequence identity is 35 % or more between the deduced maize polypeptide and all members of this branch. The high structural similarity strongly suggests that catalytic activity of the encoded maize protein kinase may be regulated by second messengers, like that of all members of this branch whose regulation has been characterized. Northern hybridization with the maize cDNA clone shows a single 2400 base transcript at roughly similar levels in maize coleoptiles, root meristems, and the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> root <b>elongation,</b> but the transcript is less abundant in mature leaves. In situ hybridization confirms the presence of the transcript in all regions of primary maize root tissue...|$|R
