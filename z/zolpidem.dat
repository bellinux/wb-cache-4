5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include <b>zolpidem,</b> zaleplon and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and <b>zolpidem</b> and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon, like <b>zolpidem,</b> zopiclone, or eszopiclone, are all {{specific}} agonists at the benzodiazepine GABAA α1 sub-receptor site. It also modulates the GABAA sub-sites, α2 and α3, to {{a lesser}} degree. It has no statistical significance as an anticonvulsant. However, as a pyrazolopyrimidine, zaleplon {{has served as a}} novel chemical platform from which new anxiolytics will hopefully arise. Much like <b>zolpidem,</b> as an imidazopyridine and also a full agonist at the GABAA α1 sub-receptor site, has been reviewed considerably with some novel contributions. See also: alpidem.|$|E
25|$|Combined use of {{clonazepam}} {{with certain}} antidepressants, antiepileptics, such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics like <b>zolpidem</b> and alcohol {{may result in}} enhanced sedative effects.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam was {{detected}} in 26% {{of cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs in Sweden, and its active metabolite nordazepam {{was detected}} in 28% of cases. Other benzodiazepines and <b>zolpidem</b> and zopiclone also were found in high numbers. Many drivers had blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines and <b>zolpidem</b> and zopiclone. In Northern Ireland in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine.|$|E
25|$|The FAA allows {{zaleplon}} with a 6-hour wait {{period and}} no more than twice a week, which makes it the sleep medication with the shortest allowed waiting period after use. The substances with the 2nd shortest period, which is of 24 hours, are <b>zolpidem</b> and ramelteon.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone {{and other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs are detected frequently {{in cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs. Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and <b>zolpidem,</b> are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range and often in combination with other alcohol, illegal, or prescription drugs of abuse, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines, <b>zolpidem,</b> and zopiclone. Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. Zaleplon or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of zopiclone to reduce traffic accidents. Zopiclone as with other hypnotic drugs is sometimes abused to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam (marketed under {{brand names}} Doral, Dormalin) is a {{relatively}} long-acting benzodiazepine derivative drug developed by the Schering Corporation in the 1970s. Quazepam is indicated {{for the treatment of}} insomnia including sleep induction and sleep maintenance. Quazepam induces impairment of motor function and has relatively (and uniquely) selective hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties with considerably less overdose potential than other benzodiazepines (due to its novel receptor-subtype selectively). Quazepam is an effective hypnotic which induces and maintains sleep without disruption of the sleep architecture. Quazepam is a trifluoroalkyl type of benzodiazepine, like fletazepam, halazepam, triflubazam and triflunordazepam. Quazepam is unique amongst benzodiazepines in that it selectively targets the GABAA α1 subunit receptors which are responsible for inducing sleep. Its mechanism of action is very similar to <b>zolpidem</b> and zaleplon in its pharmacology and can successfully substitute for <b>zolpidem</b> and zaleplon in animal studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to zopiclone or other Z {{drugs such as}} <b>zolpidem</b> and zaleplon has found few clear and consistent differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.|$|E
25|$|Sertraline had {{no effect}} on the actions of digoxin and atenolol, which are not metabolized in the liver. Case reports suggest that taking {{sertraline}} with phenytoin or <b>zolpidem</b> may induce sertraline metabolism and decrease its efficacy, and that taking sertraline with lamotrigine may increase the blood level of lamotrigine, possibly by inhibition of glucuronidation.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{that may}} prove more {{effective}} and safer than benzodiazepines for insomnia {{is an area of}} active research. Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as <b>zolpidem</b> (Ambien), zaleplon, zopiclone (Imovane), and eszopiclone (Lunesta), are a class of hypnotic medications that are similar to benzodiazepines in their mechanism of action, and indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight, and they have similar—though potentially less severe—side effect profiles compared to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Drugs which induce sleep, {{known as}} hypnotics, include Benzodiazepines, {{although}} these interfere with REM; Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata), and <b>zolpidem</b> (Ambien); Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and doxylamine; Alcohol (ethanol), despite its rebound effect {{later in the}} night and interference with REM; barbiturates, which have the same problem; melatonin, a component of the circadian clock, and released naturally at night by the pineal gland; and cannabis, which may also interfere with REM.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{is often}} {{recommended}} {{due to its}} long elimination half-life and also because of its availability in low potency doses. The non-benzodiazepine Z drugs such as <b>zolpidem,</b> zaleplon, and zopiclone {{should not be used}} as a replacement for benzodiazepines, as they have a similar mechanism of action and can induce a similar dependence. The pharmacological mechanism of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence is the internalization (removal) of receptor site in the brain and changes in gene transcription codes in the brain.|$|E
25|$|In EEG studies, {{zopiclone}} significantly {{increases the}} energy of the beta frequency band and shows characteristics of high-voltage slow waves, desynchronization of hippocampal theta waves, and an increase in {{the energy of}} the delta frequency band. Zopiclone increases both stage 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS), while <b>zolpidem,</b> an α1-selective compound, increases only SWS and causes no effect on stage 2 sleep. Zopiclone is less selective to the α1 site and has higher affinity to the α2 site than zaleplon. Zopiclone is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can result}} from the action of {{mescaline}} and other hallucinogenic drugs. Although drug-induced changes in perception usually subside as the chemical leaves the body, long-term cocaine use can result in the chronic residual effect of micropsia. Micropsia can be a symptom of Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, or HPPD, {{in which a person}} can experience hallucinogenic flashbacks long after ingesting a hallucinogen. A majority of these flashbacks are visual distortions which include micropsia, and 15-80% of hallucinogen users may experience these flashbacks. Micropsia can also be a rare side effect of <b>zolpidem,</b> a prescription medication used to temporarily treat insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{reported}} positive outcomes of combining cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia treatment with treatments such as stimulus control and the relaxation therapies. Hypnotic medications are equally effective in the short-term treatment of insomnia, but their effects wear off over time due to tolerance. The effects of CBT-I have sustained and lasting effects on treating insomnia long after therapy has been discontinued. The addition of hypnotic medications with CBT-I adds no benefit in insomnia. The long lasting benefits of a course of CBT-I shows superiority over pharmacological hypnotic drugs. Even {{in the short term}} when compared to short-term hypnotic medication such as <b>zolpidem</b> (Ambien), CBT-I still shows significant superiority. Thus CBT-I is recommended as a first line treatment for insomnia.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam is {{selective}} for type I benzodiazepine receptors containing the α1 subunit, {{similar to other}} drugs such as zaleplon and <b>zolpidem.</b> As a result, quazepam {{has little or no}} muscle relaxant properties. Most other benzodiazepines are unselective and bind to type1 GABAA receptors and type2 GABAA receptors. Type1 GABAA receptors include the α1 subunit containing GABAA receptors which are responsible for hypnotic properties of the drug. Type 2 receptors include the α2, α3 and α5 subunits which are responsible for anxiolytic action, amnesia and muscle relaxant properties. Thus quazepam may have less side effects than other benzodiazepines but, it has a very long half-life of 25 hours which reduces its benefits as a hypnotic due to likely next day sedation. It also has two active metabolites with half-lives of 28 and 79 hours. Quazepam may also cause less drug tolerance than other benzodiazepines such as temazepam and triazolam perhaps due to its subtype selectivity. The longer half-life of quazepam may have the advantage however, of causing less rebound insomnia than shorter acting subtype selective nonbenzodiazepines. However, one of the major metabolites of quazepam, the N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam (aka N-desalkylflurazepam), binds unselectively to both type1 and type2 GABAA receptors. The N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam metabolite also has a very long half-life and likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of quazepam.|$|E
500|$|Alcoholics {{may also}} require {{treatment}} for other psychotropic drug addictions and drug dependences. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is benzodiazepine dependence, with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine {{drugs such as}} valium or clonazopam. These drugs are, like alcohol, depressants. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, {{or they may be}} purchased as illegal drugs [...] "on the street" [...] through illicit channels. [...] Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers. Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as <b>zolpidem</b> and zopiclone as well as opiates and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of psychosis or seizures if not managed properly.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{prevalent}} research on prescription drugs with {{side effects of}} macropsia deals with <b>zolpidem</b> and citalopram. [...] <b>Zolpidem</b> is a drug prescribed for insomnia, and although it has proven beneficial effects, {{there have been numerous}} reported cases of adverse perceptual reactions. [...] One of these cases discusses an anorexic woman’s episode of macropsia, which occurred twenty minutes after taking 10mg <b>zolpidem.</b> [...] The same woman later had two more episodes of zolpidem-induced macropsia, after taking 5mg and 2.5mg <b>zolpidem,</b> respective to each episode. [...] The intensity of the macropsia episodes decreased with the decreasing amount of <b>zolpidem</b> administered; it is implied in the article that the level of intensity was based on the patients accounts of her macropsia episodes, and that no external diagnosis was used. [...] Hoyler points out notable similarities among the different reported cases of zolpidem-induced [...] disorganization. [...] The similarities were that all the cases were reported by women, the disorganization and agitation followed the first administration of <b>zolpidem,</b> and once <b>zolpidem</b> was discontinued, there were no lasting residual effects. [...] It is believed that zolpidem-related macropsia is more prevalent in women because plasma <b>zolpidem</b> concentration is 40% higher in women, a concentration that further increases in anorexic women.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{effect of}} {{recreational}} zaleplon use is {{the occurrence of}} (typically short-lived) hallucinations. Fewer visual and auditory hallucinations/disruptions occur {{with the use of}} zaleplon than with other Z-drugs, like <b>zolpidem.</b> [...] Anterograde amnesia can occur and can cause one to lose track of the amount of zaleplon already ingested, prompting the ingesting of more than originally planned. However, continuous ingestion is extremely unlikely precisely because of zaleplon's quick onset of action.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Air Force uses {{zaleplon}} {{as one of}} the hypnotics approved as a [...] "no-go pill" [...] to help aviators and special-duty personnel {{sleep in}} support of mission readiness (with a four-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation). [...] "Ground tests" [...] are required prior to authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation. (The other hypnotics used as [...] "no-go pills" [...] are temazepam and <b>zolpidem,</b> which both have longer mandatory recovery periods.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Citalopram-induced {{macropsia}} {{is similar}} to zolpidem-induced macropsia since both types have been observed in relatively few cases, and neither of the drugs’ side effects can be supported by experimental evidence. [...] Citalopram is an antidepressant that inhibits serotonin reuptake. [...] The first case of macropsia thought to be induced by citalopram involves a woman who experienced macropsia after her first administration of 10mg citalopram. [...] Just as with <b>zolpidem,</b> after the immediate discontinuation of citalopram, there were no further episodes of macropsia.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Air Force uses {{temazepam}} {{as one of}} the hypnotics approved as a [...] "no-go pill" [...] to help aviators and special-duty personnel {{sleep in}} support of mission readiness. [...] "Ground tests" [...] are necessary prior to required authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation, and a 12-hour restriction is imposed on subsequent flight operation. The other hypnotics used as [...] "no-go pills" [...] are zaleplon and <b>zolpidem,</b> which have shorter mandatory recovery periods.|$|E
2500|$|Zopiclone {{is known}} colloquially as a [...] "Z-drug". Other Z-drugs include {{zaleplon}} (Sonata) and <b>zolpidem</b> (Ambien and AmbienCR) and were initially {{thought to be}} less addictive or habit-forming than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat {{in the last few}} years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken on a short-term basis, usually a week or less. Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with antidepressants, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|Future {{research}} may focus {{on ways to}} limit the occurrence of retinally-induced macropsia due to surgery. [...] In terms of treatment, the most effective optical correction is still being researched with respect to visual field angles and direction to a target. [...] The susceptibility of certain age demographics to macropsia is a subject that requires further validation. [...] Overall, there have not been very many reports of macropsia induced by certain drugs, specifically <b>zolpidem</b> and citalopram. [...] Once a larger effort is made to compile such reports, there will inevitably be more research {{on the subject of}} macropsia.|$|E
2500|$|This {{disorder}} is usually acquired {{in one of}} four ways: One cause is benzodiazepine drugs such as; midazolam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, temazepam, [...] nitrazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and nimetazepam; {{all of which are}} known to have powerful amnesic effects. This has also been recorded in non-benzodiazapine sedatives or [...] "z-drugs" [...] which act on the same set of receptors; such as <b>zolpidem</b> (also known as Ambien), eszopiclone (also known as [...] Lunesta), and zopiclone (also known by brand names Imovane and Zimovane). A second cause is a traumatic brain injury in which damage is usually done to the hippocampus or surrounding cortices. It may also be caused by a shocking event or an emotional disorder.|$|E
50|$|A review medical {{publication}} found {{long-term use}} of <b>zolpidem</b> {{is associated with}} drug tolerance, substance dependence, rebound insomnia, and CNS-related adverse effects. It was recommended that <b>zolpidem</b> be used for {{short periods of time}} using the lowest effective dose. <b>Zolpidem</b> 10 mg is effective in treating insomnia when used intermittently no fewer than three and no more than five pills per week for a period of 12 weeks. The 15-mg <b>zolpidem</b> dosage provided no clinical advantage over the 10-mg <b>zolpidem</b> dosage.|$|E
50|$|An {{overdose}} of <b>zolpidem</b> may cause excessive sedation, pin-point pupils, or depressed respiratory function, which may progress to coma, and possibly death. Combined with alcohol, opiates, or other CNS depressants, {{it may be}} even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. <b>Zolpidem</b> overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which displaces <b>zolpidem</b> from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the <b>zolpidem.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{elderly are}} more {{sensitive}} to the effects of hypnotics including <b>zolpidem.</b> <b>Zolpidem</b> causes an increased risk of falls and may induce adverse cognitive effects.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the vast}} {{majority}} of benzodiazepine-like molecules, <b>zolpidem</b> has no affinity for α4 and α6 subunit-containing receptors. <b>Zolpidem</b> positively modulates GABAA receptors, it is presumed by increasing the GABAA receptor complex's apparent affinity for GABA without affecting desensitization or peak current. Like zaleplon (Sonata), <b>zolpidem</b> may increase slow wave sleep but cause no effect on stage 2 sleep.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zolpidem</b> {{received}} widespread {{media coverage}} in Australia {{after the death}} of a student who fell 20 m from the Sydney Harbour Bridge while under the influence of <b>zolpidem.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} that the hypnotic drug <b>zolpidem</b> has an effect. The results of the few scientific {{studies that have been}} published so far on the effectiveness of <b>zolpidem</b> have been contradictory.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{patent for}} <b>zolpidem</b> {{was held by}} the French {{pharmaceutical}} corporation Sanofi-Aventis. On April 23, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 13 generic versions of <b>zolpidem</b> tartrate. <b>Zolpidem</b> is available from several generic manufacturers in the UK, as a generic from Sandoz in South Africa and TEVA in Israel, {{as well as from}} other manufacturers such as Ratiopharm and Takeda GmbH (both Germany).|$|E
50|$|Alpidem (Ananxyl) is an {{anxiolytic}} drug {{from the}} imidazopyridine family, {{related to the}} more well known sleeping medication <b>zolpidem.</b> Unlike <b>zolpidem</b> however, alpidem does not produce sedative effects at normal doses, and is instead used specifically {{for the treatment of}} anxiety.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zolpidem</b> {{has been}} {{assigned}} to pregnancy category C by the FDA.
