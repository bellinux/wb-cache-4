5000|$|Although the {{attribution}} of individual status to the mycelia confined by intraspecific <b>zone</b> <b>lines</b> is a comparatively new idea, <b>zone</b> <b>lines</b> themselves {{have been known}} since time immemorial.

Dematiaceous hyphomycetes, with their dark-coloured mycelia, produce particularly attractive black <b>zone</b> <b>lines</b> when they colonise the areas occupied by two antagonistic basidiomycete individuals. Spalted wood {{can be difficult to}} work, since different individual wood-rotting fungi have different decay efficiencies, and thus produce zones of different softness, and the <b>zone</b> <b>lines</b> themselves are usually unrotted and hard.|$|R

50|$|The {{only major}} {{difference}} between Sports Table Football and football/soccer is the shooting zone {{in front of each}} goal. The ball must enter the shooting zone able to score a legal goal. The pitch is divided into four equal quarters, normally 300 mm each, but dimensions may vary (FISTF playing rules). When the entire ball crosses the shooting <b>zone</b> <b>line,</b> you may take a shot at the goal. The defending player tries to keep the ball out of the shooting area with his defending flicks, blocking the figure or the ball. The ball may be flicked (played) up to three consecutive flicks with the same figure, after that another figure must play the ball. With this rule the passing like in football/soccer is warranted and it gives the game its tactical features.|$|E

5000|$|Players {{take turns}} sliding, or [...] "shuffling," [...] the weights to the {{opposite}} end of the board, trying to score points, bump opposing pucks off the board, or protect their own pucks from bump-offs. Points are scored by getting a weight to stop in one of the numbered scoring areas. A weight has to completely cross the <b>zone</b> <b>line</b> to count as a full score (if a weight is partially in zone 2 and 3 the weight's score is 2). A weight that's hanging partially over the edge at the end of the table in the 3-point area, called a [...] "hanger" [...] (or sometimes a [...] "shipper"), usually receives an extra point (count as 4).
