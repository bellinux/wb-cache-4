50|$|<b>Zindoxifene</b> (INN; former {{developmental}} code names D-16726, NSC-341952) is a nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) {{that was}} under {{development in the}} 1980s and early 1990s {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer but was not marketed. It showed estrogenic-like activity in preclinical studies and failed to demonstrate effectiveness as a treatment for breast cancer in clinical trials. <b>Zindoxifene</b> was the lead compound of the distinct 2-phenylindole class of SERMs, and the marketed SERM bazedoxifene was derived from the major active metabolite of <b>zindoxifene,</b> D-15414. <b>Zindoxifene</b> was first described in 1984.|$|E

50|$|D-15414 is a nonsteroidal weak {{estrogen}} of the 2-phenylindole {{group which}} was never marketed. It {{is the major}} metabolite of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) <b>zindoxifene</b> (D-16726). D-15414 has high affinity for the estrogen receptor (ER) and inhibits the growth of ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro. However, contradictorily, subsequent research found that the drug produced fully estrogenic effects in vitro similarly to but less actively than estradiol, with no antiestrogenic activity observed. The reason for {{the discrepancy between the}} findings is unclear, though may be due to methodology. The unexpected estrogenic activity of D-15414 may be responsible for the failure of <b>zindoxifene</b> in clinical trials as a treatment for breast cancer.|$|E
40|$|The anti-oestrogen <b>zindoxifene</b> was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} drug {{for the treatment of}} hormone-dependent mammary carcinomas. Experiments with rats bearing androgen-dependent prostatic tumours revealed anti-neoplastic activity of <b>zindoxifene</b> on these tumours also. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of this drug was studied in various prostatic tumour models in comparison to the anti-oestrogen tamoxifen and to castration. The growth of the hormone-dependent Dunning R 3327 H tumour was strongly inhibited by <b>zindoxifene</b> (4 mg/kg), which was more effective than tamoxifen (43 % T/C vs 87 % T/C, the ratios of tumour weights in control and drug-treated rats). <b>Zindoxifene</b> was able to delay the relapse of these tumours by 7 weeks in comparison to castration. The experiments with Noble Nb-R prostatic tumours showed that administration of <b>zindoxifene</b> (5 mg) is superior to castration (5 % T/C vs 52 % T/C). The growth of tumours in castrated rats was completely inhibited by administration of <b>zindoxifene.</b> Therefore a peripheral mode of action has to be assumed...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} phase I/II {{study of the}} indole derivative, <b>zindoxifene,</b> an anti-oestrogen with {{intrinsic}} oestrogenic activity. We have treated 28 women with advanced breast cancer of whom 26 had received prior endocrine therapy. Oral <b>zindoxifene</b> doses ranged from 10 to 100 mg daily; doses were escalated in some patients. Twenty-five patients were assessed for response; the remaining three patients completed less than 3 weeks of treatment. There were no objective responses; disease stabilised in seven patients for up to 5 months and progressed in the remaining 18. Five patients (including three treated with tamoxifen) responded to subsequent endocrine therapy. Nausea, which was dose-limiting, affected half of the patients treated with 80 mg daily. Metabolites of <b>zindoxifene</b> were detectable in serum at all doses used, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels showed a strong tendency to rise at the higher doses, indicating that <b>zindoxifene</b> is absorbed and has biological activity. We conclude that <b>zindoxifene</b> in the doses {{used in this study}} has only marginal therapeutic activity in the treatment of advanced breast cancer...|$|E

40|$|Endocrine therapy of hormone-dependent prostatic carcinomas {{can be very}} {{effective}} at the beginning. However, tumour growth eventually resumes possibly {{because of the presence}} of androgen-independent cell clones. Addition of a cytotoxic agent to the hormonally active drug at an early stage could possibly delay progression of disease. Therefore, we studied the effects of hormonal and cytostatic treatment in a rat prostate carcinoma model: freshly transplanted Dunning R 3327 -G prostatic tumours of the rat were treated with the partial antioestrogen <b>zindoxifene</b> and cisplatin alone and in combination. In addition we tested a 2 -phenylindole-linked platinum complex 3 -PtCl 2, which contains both effective functions. This particular complex had only a weak non-significant inhibitory effect on tumour growth. Comparing monotherapies with <b>zindoxifene</b> or cisplatin at various dose levels with the corresponding combinations, it became evident that the latter treatment was significantly more effective than the use of single agents. A very low dose of 0. 4 mg cisplatin together with 2 mg/kg <b>zindoxifene</b> inhibited tumours by 91 %, which was close to the effects of castration or diethylstilbestrol (1 mg). The analyses of accessory sex organs revealed much weaker oestrogenic side-effects than those observed with diethylstilbestrol at an equivalent dose. These results demonstrated that it is possible to increase the efficacy of hormonal therapy of prostatic carcinomas by concomitant administration of cisplatin and reduce side-effects of oestrogenic drugs...|$|E
