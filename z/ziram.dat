25|$|Peach {{trees are}} prone to a disease called leaf curl, which usually does not {{directly}} affect the fruit, but does reduce the crop yield by partially defoliating the tree. Several fungicides {{can be used to}} combat the disease, including Bordeaux mixture and other copper-based products (the University of California considers these organic treatments), <b>ziram,</b> chlorothalonil, and dodine. The fruit is susceptible to brown rot or a dark reddish spot.|$|E
50|$|While <b>Ziram</b> has {{not been}} found in groundwater, <b>ziram</b> is {{moderately}} detected in soils with medium to high content of organic matter. However, <b>ziram</b> only moderately persists in soils, as it has a field half-life of 30 daysIn water, <b>ziram</b> is the most stable of all metallic dithiocarbamate fungicides, which means degradation is rather slow. If <b>ziram</b> reaches {{the bottom of a}} body of water, it may stay there for months.However, in plants, <b>ziram</b> is readily broken down; carbon disulfide is released, as evidenced by the acidic surfaces (dissolved carbon dioxide).|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, <b>ziram</b> {{is used as}} an {{additive}} {{ingredient in}} industrial adhesives, caulking, and paint. It {{also serves as a}} bird and mammal repellent on outdoor ornamental items. Annually, approximately 1.9 million pounds of the active <b>ziram</b> ingredient are used. <b>Ziram</b> is often sold in powder or granule form.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ziram</b> {{ingestion}} {{has been}} proven to cause decreased antibody formation and diminished growth and development in rats. Rats also {{have been shown to}} develop various motor changes when administered <b>ziram</b> at unknown doses and duration. However, the definitive effects of <b>ziram</b> are still not well understood, as a one-year study has shown no effects on rats receiving a low dose of 5 mg/kg/day. Additionally, dogs that were administered <b>ziram</b> exhibited no harmful effects at this same duration and dose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ziram</b> has {{deleterious}} effects {{on both the}} male and female reproductive systems in rats when administered at a moderate dose of 50 mg/kg. Female and male rats that ingested <b>ziram</b> at this dose two months before pregnancy exhibited reductions in fertility and litter size. <b>Ziram</b> has also been shown to inhibit fetal growth and organ development when pregnant mice ingested at both low and high doses.|$|E
50|$|If {{humans are}} exposed to <b>ziram</b> through {{inhalation}} for a prolonged period of time, they may develop nerve and irreversible eye damage. <b>Ziram</b> has also been observed to cause irritation of the skin, nose, and throat.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three major}} ways <b>ziram</b> is {{depleted}} are: hydrolysis, photodegradation, and aerobic soil metabolism. The Environmental Protection Agency {{has concluded that}} <b>ziram</b> poses a low toxicity risk to mammals, a moderate risk to birds, and a high risk to aquatic species. After reviewing studies that investigated the effect of <b>ziram</b> on aquatic organisms, the Pesticide Action Network Pesticide Database concluded that its LC50 dose (amount of pesticide that is lethal to 50% of the test organisms within the stated study time) for amphibians places it in the [...] "highly toxic" [...] category. Similarly, <b>ziram</b> {{has been found to}} be [...] "highly toxic" [...] for fish, [...] "highly toxic" [...] for zooplankton, and [...] "moderately toxic" [...] for molluscs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ziram</b> started {{being used}} in the United States in 1960 as a broad-spectrum fungicide. It was used on a variety of crops to control many {{different}} fungal infections, including scab on apples and pears, leaf curl in peaches, and anthracnose and blight in tomatoes. In 1981, additional uses for <b>ziram</b> were approved, including the prevention of leaf blight and scab on almonds, shot-hole in apricots, brown rot and leaf spot in cherries, and scab and anthracnose in pecans. <b>Ziram</b> also began to be used on residential ornaments as a bird and mammal repellent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ziram</b> or zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate is {{primarily}} {{used as an}} agricultural fungicide to control and {{prevent the spread of}} fungal infections. It functions as a protectant fungicide, which means it remains active on the plant’s surface where it forms a chemical barrier between the plant and a fungus. A protectant fungicide is not absorbed into the plant and must be applied prior to infection. <b>Ziram</b> can either be directly sprayed on to a plant’s leaf or it {{can be used as a}} soil and seed treatment. The top five crops <b>ziram</b> is used on are: almonds, peaches, nectarines, pears, and table and raisin grapes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ziram</b> {{was placed}} on the European Union Prioritization List to be further tested for endocrine-disrupting activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} {{needed to}} begin the synthesis of <b>ziram</b> are zinc oxide and carbon disulfide. A liquid suspension with carbon disulfide, emulsifier, oil, and dissolved urea in water is formed. Zinc oxide and dimethyl amine {{are added to the}} solution. This suspension is agitated {{for a period of time}} to allow reactions to occur between the zinc oxide, carbon disulfide, and dimethyl amine. This leads to the production of <b>ziram.</b> This entire process takes place under 40°C.|$|E
50|$|Pecans {{are also}} prone to {{infection}} by fungi, especially in humid conditions. <b>Ziram</b> {{is a common}} fungicide used to prevent scab and anthracnose in pecans.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ziram</b> is {{classified}} as [...] "slightly hazardous" [...] by the World Health Organization, which tests chemical toxicity by measuring rat oral LD50, the dose (in milligrams of substance per kilogram of body weight) that kills 50% of the experimental rats.|$|E
50|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to pesticides, particularly <b>ziram,</b> {{is associated with}} Parkinson's disease. It appears to do this by directly damaging dopaminergic neurons. A recent study from UCLA suggests that blocking or removing α-synuclein might delay or prevent disease progression, based on research in zebra fish.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, the United States {{enacted the}} Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and the Pollution Prevention Act, which {{required}} companies releasing toxic chemicals {{to report to}} the EPA when and how much of the chemical was being spread. <b>Ziram</b> is on this list of toxic chemicals.|$|E
50|$|Tolerances for {{the amount}} of <b>ziram</b> {{considered}} acceptable in food are first calculated as zinc ethylenebisdithiocarbamate, and then multiplied by a conversion factor of 0.6 to express the residue value in terms of carbon disulfide. Currently accepted tolerance for residues is 7 ppm for most uses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} affecting S. rostrata are damping-off caused by Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia spp., Cercospora leafspot caused by Cercospora spp., and leaf mosaic virus.

50|$|<b>Ziram</b> {{has been}} {{determined}} to have moderate acute toxicity. It is rated as toxicity category II/III for oral and dermal exposure, category II for inhalation, category I for eye irritation, and category IV for skin irritation, with category I being the most toxic and category IV being the least.|$|E
5000|$|Pathogenic fungi are fungi {{that cause}} disease in humans or other organisms. The study of {{pathogenic}} fungi {{is referred to}} as [...] "medical mycology." [...] Although fungi are eukaryotic organisms, many pathogenic fungi are also microorganisms. Fungicides, such as <b>ziram</b> are used to protect plants against fungal infections.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} fungicides {{on the market}} for controlling early blight. Some of the fungicides on the market are azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, Bacillus subtilis, chlorothalonil, copper products, hydrogen dioxide (Hydroperoxyl), mancozeb, potassium bicarbonate, and <b>ziram.</b> [...] Specific spraying regiments are found on the label. Labels for these products should be read carefully before applying.|$|E
50|$|A 103-week {{study has}} shown that <b>ziram</b> is {{correlated}} with thyroid cancer in rats, but no increase in cancer in female rats or male mice was seen. However, female rats did exhibit an increase in lung cancer. These findings are inconclusive, as the results were muddied by a viral infection, making the cause of cancer difficult to determine.|$|E
50|$|Fungicide {{residues}} {{have been}} found on food for human consumption, mostly from post-harvest treatments. Some fungicides are dangerous to human health, such as vinclozolin, which has now been removed from use. <b>Ziram</b> is also a fungicide that {{is thought to be}} toxic to humans if exposed to chronically. A number of fungicides are also used in human health care.|$|E

5000|$|Almond scab {{was first}} {{documented}} in almond orchards in the 1950s. However {{it did not}} become a major disease until sprinkler irrigation became popular in the 1980s. By the early 1990s almond scab could be found throughout California almond orchards. Scab infects leaves, fruit, and twigs in almonds causing dark spots to form. Scab lesions look greasy and oily. The major concern with almond scab is partial or complete defoliation of the tree. [...] As with leaf blight use of captan and <b>ziram</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce total incidence of almond scab infection.|$|E
5000|$|Leaf blight of almonds {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1950, and by 1983 it had {{spread throughout the}} Sacramento Valley. Almond leaf blight {{is characterized by the}} death of leaves throughout the summer. The fungus interferes with water conduction in the leaf. In fall and winter, dormant buds are killed by an extension of the lesion and in the spring, flowers are killed. [...] Repeated attacks of leaf blight, though rarely killing more than 20% of the leaves, ultimately reduce tree vigor. Experiments have shown that the use of <b>ziram</b> and captan can reduce the incidence of leaf blight by 75-80% in treated trees.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{introduced}} into Hawaii, Fiji and New Zealand. They were introduced to Samoa in 1943 and became common on Upolu by 1957. Red-vented bulbuls were introduced to Fiji around 1903 by indentured labourers from India. They established on the Tongan islands of Tongatapu and Niuafo'ou. They were introduced into Melbourne around 1917 but were not seen after 1942. They established in Auckland in the 1950s but were exterminated and another wild population that was detected was exterminated in 2006. In 2013 more were found, and authorities offered a $1000 reward for information {{that led to a}} bird's capture. They prefer the dry lowland regions in these introduced regions. They are considered as pests because of their habit of damaging fruit crops. Methiocarb and <b>ziram</b> have been used to protect cultivated Dendrobium orchids in Hawaii from damage by these birds. These birds learn to avoid the repellent chemicals. They can also disperse the seeds of invasive plants like Lantana camara and Miconia calvescens.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides are {{a control}} measure {{commonly}} used once grape anthracnose has become established in a vineyard. The most important fungicide application occurs {{in early spring}} during the dormant period before bud swell. [...] A lime-sulfur solution is most commonly used. This is typically applied {{at a rate of}} ten gallons per acre. [...] Commercially available Sulforix can also be used at a rate of one gallon per acre. [...] Both fungicides target the sclerotia overwintering in the canes. This dormant fungicide application is then followed up throughout the season by foliar sprays—sprays that target the surface of foliage. These sprays help protect the new susceptible tissues. Foliar sprays are typically recommended at two-week intervals. Other commercial products often used include Mancozeb, Captan, <b>Ziram,</b> Sovran, Rally, Elite, Inspire Super, Adamant, Mettle, Revus Top, Vintage, and Pristine. [...] The majority of these fungicides are sterol inhibitors and a few are EBDC—non-systemic, surface-acting fungicides. It is important to use fungicides with different modes of action to avoid resistance development.|$|E

40|$|The {{etiology}} of Parkinson disease (PD) is unclear but may involve environmental toxins such as pesticides leading to dysfunction of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Here, we measured the relative toxicity of <b>ziram</b> (a UPS inhibitor) and analogs to dopaminergic neurons {{and examined the}} mechanism of cell death. UPS (26 S) activity was measured in cell lines after exposure to <b>ziram</b> and related compounds. Dimethyl- and diethyldithiocarbamates including <b>ziram</b> were potent UPS inhibitors. Primary ventral mesencephalic cultures were exposed to <b>ziram,</b> and cell toxicity was assessed by staining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and NeuN antigen. <b>Ziram</b> caused a preferential damage to TH+ neurons and elevated α-synuclein levels but did not increase aggregate formation. Mechanistically, <b>ziram</b> altered UPS function through interfering with the targeting of substrates by inhibiting ubiquitin E 1 ligase. Sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate administered to mice for 2 weeks resulted in persistent motor deficits and a mild reduction in striatal TH staining but no nigral cell loss. These results demonstrate that <b>ziram</b> causes selective dopaminergic cell damage in vitro by inhibiting an important degradative pathway implicated in the {{etiology of}} PD. Chronic exposure to widely used dithiocarbamate fungicides {{may contribute to the}} development of PD, and elucidation of its mechanism would identify a new potential therapeutic target...|$|E
40|$|The {{neurotoxicity}} of dithiocarbamates {{has been}} previously reported, however the detailed mechanism underlying the neurotoxicity is still not fully understood Among the dithiocarbamates, we investigated thiram and <b>ziram</b> in a neuronal-like pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells. Thiram and <b>ziram</b> strongly induced cell death in both dose- and time-dependent manners with the LC 50 of 0. 3 and 2 muM, respectively. The cell death showed typical apoptotic features, such as DNA fragmentation and an increase of subdiploidy nuclei. Interestingly, both thiram and <b>ziram</b> induced rapid and sustained increases of intracellular Ca 2 + in PC 12 cells, which were almost completely blocked by flufenamic acid (FFA), an inhibitor of non-selective cation channel. BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca 2 + chelator inhibited the thiram- and ziraminduced apoptotic cell death. These results suggest that thiram and <b>ziram</b> induce apoptotic neuronal cell death by Ca 2 + influx through non-selective cation channels. The present study may provide a clue for understanding the mechanism of neurotoxicity of thiram and <b>ziram.</b> (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Incclose 131...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{populations of}} aminergic neurons are {{affected}} in Parkinson's disease (PD), with serotonergic and noradrenergic loci responsible for some non-motor symptoms. Environmental toxins, {{such as the}} dithiocarbamate fungicide <b>ziram,</b> significantly {{increase the risk of}} developing PD and the attendant spectrum of both motor and non-motor symptoms. The mechanisms by which <b>ziram</b> and other environmental toxins increase the risk of PD, and the potential effects of these toxins on aminergic neurons, remain unclear. To determine the relative effects of <b>ziram</b> on the synaptic function of aminergic versus non-aminergic neurons, we used live-imaging at the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In contrast to nearly all other studies of this model synapse, we imaged presynaptic function at both glutamatergic Type Ib and aminergic Type II boutons, the latter responsible for storage and release of octopamine, the invertebrate equivalent of noradrenalin. To quantify the kinetics of exo- and endo- cytosis, we employed an acid-sensitive form of GFP fused to the Drosophila vesicular monoamine transporter (DVMAT-pHluorin). Additional genetic probes were used to visualize intracellular calcium flux (GCaMP) and voltage changes (ArcLight). We find that at glutamatergic Type Ib terminals, exposure to <b>ziram</b> increases exocytosis and inhibits endocytosis. By contrast, at octopaminergic Type II terminals, <b>ziram</b> has no detectable effect on exocytosis and dramatically inhibits endocytosis. In contrast to other reports on the neuronal effects of <b>ziram,</b> these effects do not appear to result from perturbation of the UPS or calcium homeostasis. Unexpectedly, <b>ziram</b> also caused spontaneous and synchronized bursts of calcium influx (measured by GCaMP) and electrical activity (measured by ArcLight) at aminergic Type II, but not glutamatergic Type Ib, nerve terminals. These events are sensitive to both tetrodotoxin and cadmium chloride, and thus appear to represent spontaneous depolarizations followed by calcium influx into Type II terminals. We speculate that the differential effects of <b>ziram</b> on Type II versus Type Ib terminals may be relevant to the specific sensitivity of aminergic neurons in PD, and suggest that changes neuronal excitability could contribute to the increased risk for PD caused by exposure to <b>ziram.</b> We also suggest that the fly NMJ will be useful to explore the synaptic effects of other pesticides associated with an increased risk of PD...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{the second}} most common {{neurodegenerative}} disease, affecting seven to ten million people worldwide. Familial forms of PD account for 5 - 10 % of all PD cases suggesting that other factors such as the environment have a {{role in the development of}} sporadic cases of PD. Epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to pesticides increases the risk for PD. <b>Ziram,</b> a dithiocarbamate fungicide commonly used in California, increases the risk of PD for individuals living and working in areas where the pesticide is sprayed. <b>Ziram</b> has previously been found in vitro to cause selective dopaminergic cell toxicity, inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), and increased α-synuclein (α-syn) levels in primary neuronal cultures. In this dissertation we utilize zebrafish embryos (ZF, Danio rerio) to study <b>ziram</b> in an in vivo system and to determine if ziram’s toxicity is mediated via synuclein. We found that <b>ziram</b> is toxic to ZF at nanomolar concentrations and caused selective loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons and impaired swimming behavior in ZF. Since <b>ziram</b> increases α-syn concentrations in rat primary neuronal cultures, we investigated the effect of <b>ziram</b> on ZF γ-synuclein 1 (γ 1). ZF express 3 synuclein isoforms and ZF γ 1 appears to be a functional homologue of α-syn. We found that recombinant ZF γ 1 formed fibrils in vitro and overexpression of ZF γ 1 in ZF embryos led to the formation of neuronal aggregates and neurotoxicity similarly to α-syn. Importantly, knockdown of ZF γ 1 with morpholinos or disruption of oligomers with the molecular tweezer CLR 01 protected against ziram’s DA toxicity. Over the course of this dissertation we have demonstrated that <b>ziram</b> is selectively toxic to DA neurons in vivo and that its toxicity is synuclein-dependent. These findings provide potentially important mechanistic implications on how <b>ziram</b> and possibly other environmental toxins can contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ubiquitin {{activating}} enzyme E 1 plays {{a pivotal role}} in ubiquitin based protein signaling through regulating the initiating step of the cascade. Previous studies demonstrated that E 1 is inhibited by covalent modification of reactive cysteines contained within the ubiquitin-binding groove and by conditions that increase oxidative stress and deplete cellular antioxidants. In this study, we determined the relative contribution of covalent adduction and oxidative stress to E 1 inhibition produced by <b>ziram</b> and sodium N,N-dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDC) in HEK 293 cells. Although no dithiocar-bamate-derived E 1 adducts were identified on E 1 using shotgun LC/MS/MS for either <b>ziram</b> or DMDC, both dithiocarbamates significantly decreased E 1 activity, with <b>ziram</b> demonstrating greater potency. <b>Ziram</b> increased intra-cellular levels of zinc and copper, DMDC increased intracellular levels of only copper, and both dithiocarbamates enhanced oxidative injury evidenced by elevated levels of protein carbonyls and expression of heme oxygenase- 1.
