Variables that affect the process other than the MV are known as disturbances. Generally controllers are used to reject disturbances and to implement setpoint changes.

2500|$|Galton was a keen observer. In 1906, {{visiting a}} {{livestock}} fair, he stumbled upon an intriguing contest. An ox was on display, and the villagers {{were invited to}} guess the animal's weight after it was slaughtered and dressed. Nearly 800 participated, and Galton was able to study their individual entries after the event. Galton stated that [...] "the middlemost estimate expresses the vox populi, every other estimate being condemned as too low or too high {{by a majority of}} the voters", and reported this value (the median, in terminology he himself had introduced, but chose not to use on this occasion) as 1,207 pounds. To his surprise, this was within 0.8% of the weight measured by the judges. Soon afterwards, in response to an enquiry, he reported the mean of the guesses as 1,197 pounds, but did not comment on its improved accuracy. [...] Recent archival research has found some slips in transmitting Galton's calculations to the original article in Nature: the median was actually 1,208 pounds, and the dressed weight of the ox 1,197 pounds, so the mean estimate had <b>zero</b> <b>error.</b> [...] James Surowiecki uses this weight-judging competition as his opening example: had he known the true result, his conclusion on the wisdom of the crowd would no doubt have been more strongly expressed.|$|E

Negative <b>zero</b> <b>error</b> refers to the fact that when the jaws of the vernier caliper are just closed, the reading is a negative reading away from the actual reading of 0.00 mm.

50|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>error</b> {{is defined}} as such a {{condition}} when a measuring instrument registers a reading when {{there should not be}} any reading. In case of vernier calipers it occurs when a zero on main scale does not coincide with a zero on vernier scale.

50|$|Sources of {{systematic}} error may be imperfect calibration of measurement instruments (<b>zero</b> <b>error),</b> {{changes in the}} environment which interfere with the measurement process and sometimes imperfect methods of observation can be either <b>zero</b> <b>error</b> or percentage error. If you consider an experimenter taking {{a reading of the}} time period of a pendulum swinging past a fiducial marker: If their stop-watch or timer starts with 1 second on the clock then all of their results will be off by 1 second (<b>zero</b> <b>error).</b> If the experimenter repeats this experiment twenty times (starting at 1 second each time), then there will be a percentage error in the calculated average of their results; the final result will be slightly larger than the true period.|$|E
