40|$|Many {{scientific}} applications {{need support}} from a communication infrastructure that provides predictable performance, which requires effective algorithms for bandwidth reservations. Network reservation systems such as ESnet’s OSCARS, establish guaranteed bandwidth of secure virtual circuits for a certain bandwidth and length of time. However, users currently cannot inquire about bandwidth availability, nor have alternative suggestions when reservation requests fail. In general, the number of reservation options is exponential {{with the number of}} nodes n, and current <b>reservation</b> <b>commitments.</b> We present a novel approach for path finding in time-dependent networks taking advantage of user-provided parameters of total volume and time constraints, which produces options for earliest completion and shortest duration. The theoretical complexity is only O(n 2 r 2) in the worst-case, where r is the number of reservations in the desired time interval. We have implemented our algorithm and developed efficient methodologies for incorporation into network reservation frameworks. Performance measurements confirm the theoretical predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} divided into several chapters, which continously follow one another. The {{introductory}} part {{is focused on the}} definition and the general characteristic of the territory of the Zlaté Hory. Subsequently it deals with the detailed history of the mining town and the surrounding area from 13 th century, from when the first written mention of the town has survived, to this day. The thesis describes the gradual development of mining, the methods of mining the ore, the modern extraction and the total gold production. In the next chapter there are in short outlined the historical cultural monuments and their surroundings affected by mining. A separate part consists of the local gold washing area, which are divided according to the preserved mining relicts. The last chapters are focused on the general characteristics of the landscape memorial zones and the methodology for the creation of maps, which is the output of a literary review and includes the remains after the ore extraction and surface mining. In conclusion, the potential of the site in the context of landscape memorial <b>zones</b> <b>reservation</b> is scanned. Part of the literary review, but also the whole of the thesis are my own photographs, which are trying to complement and to better navigate in the content of the entire work...|$|R

40|$|Spatiotemporal {{distribution}} of migratory birds {{in relation to}} phenological changes in wetland vegetation is significant in studying various ecological issues. In this study, SPOT-VGT imagery was used to monitor vegetation cover change in the Poyang Lake wetland. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) served as an indicator to reveal vegetation change of the wetland. Spatiotemporal trends of the NDVI time series and {{distribution of}} migratory birds in the wetland from 1999 to 2009 were investigated. Migratory birds were classified based on their feeding guilds. The correlation coefficients between a time series of NDVI and different types of migratory birds were obtained. Our results show: (1) The inter-annual NDVI shows an uneven yet increasing trend since 2000, with the average NDVI ranging between 0. 17 and 0. 64. Its seasonal change is roughly {{in line with the}} seasonal variability of natural vegetative growth in the area. (2) Both the number of species present and the population of migratory birds show an increasing trend, and avian biodiversity has greatly increased. In most years herbivorous birds dominated over other foraging guilds. (3) The correlation between NDVI variability and bird population, usually above 0. 5 in typical <b>reservation</b> <b>zones,</b> differs in <b>reservation</b> <b>zones</b> and for foraging guilds of migratory birds. NDVI was significantly correlated with the population of herbivorous birds. (4) Land-use types can influence this correlation through its reflection of different NDVIs. Wetland is positively correlated with bird population of all species, while cropland is negatively correlated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the disparity of}} stem cell-like characteristics among human amniotic epithelial cells(hAEC) in different areas of human amnion epithelium. Methods Amnion epithelium was digested by two steps to separate into basal hAECs and superficial hAECs. Expression of surface antigens and molecule markers Nanog,Oct 4,Sox 2,SSEA 1,SSEA 3,SSEA 4,TRA 1 - 60,TRA 1 - 81 and CD 73 in fresh isolated cells were detected by flow cytometer,immune-fluorescence and immunehistochemistry,and expression of SSEA 3,TRA 1 - 60 and TRA 1 - 81 in human term full-thickness amnion and epithelium-separated human amnion after trypsinization were determined by histological stain method. Results The hAECs in basal area expressed stem cell markers Nanog,Oct 4,Sox 2,SSEA 3,SSEA 4,TRA 1 - 60 and TRA 1 - 81 {{at a higher level}} than those in superficial area. The hAECs intensely expressing SSEA 4 are the smaller and roundish cells distributed mostly in the basal layer of amnion epithelium. Conclusion The basal hAECs have more embryonic stem cell(ESC) -like characteristics than the superficial ones. The basal area of human amnion epithelium {{may be the most important}} <b>zone</b> of <b>reservation</b> of human amniotic epithelial stem cells...|$|R

50|$|Peace {{had come}} to Florida. The Indians were mostly staying on the reservation. Groups of ten or so men would visit Tampa to trade. Squatters were moving closer to the reservation, however, and in 1845 President James Polk {{established}} a 20-mile (30 km) wide buffer <b>zone</b> around the <b>reservation.</b> No land could be claimed within the buffer zone, no title would be issued for land there, and the U.S. Marshal would remove squatters from the buffer zone upon request. In 1845, Thomas P. Kennedy, who operated a store at Fort Brooke, converted his fishing station on Pine Island into a trading post for the Indians. The post did not do well, however, because whites who sold whiskey to the Indians {{told them that they}} would be seized and sent west if they went to Kennedy's store.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an interpretation of}} a cave system, the Khau Muong - Lan Trong conduit, in the National Natural <b>Reservation</b> <b>Zone</b> of Phu Luong in NW Vietnam. Geological and cave surveys are carried out which predict the existence of possible underground connections between the Khau Muong sinkhole and the Lan Trong resurgence. Tracer experiments, using common salt (NaCl) as a tracer, are implemented to verify these connections, which result in a two-peak break-through curve. The two peaks are interpreted {{as the result of}} the tracer transport through a cavern conduit system having a sump that act as a hydraulic barrier to postpone the tracer transport process. This interpretation is strongly supported by the analysis on geostructure and cave development, which shows that the conduit system is composed of two passages developed along two respective faults, and the sump is found at the intersection of the two faults. status: publishe...|$|R
25|$|In January 1963, Lehman invited {{one of his}} {{favorite}} directors, William Wyler, to travel to New York City with him to see the Broadway musical. After seeing the show, Wyler said he hated it, but after two weeks of Lehman's persuasion, Wyler reluctantly agreed to direct and produce the film. After hiring musical supervisor Roger Edens, Wyler, Lehman, and Edens traveled to Salzburg to scout filming locations. In two weeks they managed to see approximately seventy-five locations—an experience that helped Lehman conceptualize several important sequences. During that trip, Lehman began to have <b>reservations</b> about Wyler's <b>commitment</b> to the project, and communicated this to Zanuck, who instructed the writer to finalize the first draft of the screenplay as quickly as possible. Lehman completed the first draft on September 10, 1963 and sent it to Wyler, who had no suggestions or changes. At that time, Lehman also secretly gave a copy of the script to the agent of Robert Wise, whom Lehman still wanted as the director. Later that month, Wyler's agent approached Zanuck asking that production on the film be delayed so Wyler could direct The Collector. Zanuck told him to tell Wyler to make the other film, and that they would move ahead on schedule with another director, ending Wyler's participation.|$|R
5000|$|In the posthumously {{published}} Sense and Sensibilia (the {{title is}} Austin's own, and wittily echoes {{the title of}} Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's first book, just as his name echoes hers), Austin criticizes the claims put forward by A. J. Ayer's The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge (1940), {{and to a lesser}} extent, H.H. Price’s Perception (1932) and G.J. Warnock’s Berkley (1953), concerning the sense-data theory. He states that perceptual variation, which can be attributed to physical causes, does not involve a figurative disconnect between sense and reference, due to an unreasonable separation of parts from the perceived object. Central to his argument, he shows that [...] "there is no one kind of thing that we ‘perceive’ but many different kinds, the number being reducible if at all by scientific investigation and not by philosophy" [...] (Austin 1962a, 4). Austin argues that Ayer fails to understand the proper function of such words as [...] "illusion", [...] "delusion", [...] "hallucination", [...] "looks", [...] "appears" [...] and [...] "seems", and uses them instead in a [...] "special way...invented by philosophers." [...] According to Austin, normally these words allow us to express <b>reservations</b> about our <b>commitment</b> to the truth of what we are saying, and that the introduction of sense-data adds nothing to our understanding of or ability to talk about what we see. As an example, Austin examines the word ‘real’ and contrasts the ordinary meanings of that word based on everyday language and the ways it is used by sense-data theorists. In order to determine the meaning of ‘real’ we have to consider, case by case, the ways and contexts in which it is used. By observing that it is (i) a substantive-hungry word that is sometimes a (ii) adjuster-word, as well as a (iii) dimension-word [...] and (iv) a word whose negative use [...] "wears the trousers," [...] Austin highlights its complexities. Only by doing so, according to Austin, can we avoid introducing false dichotomies.|$|R
40|$|Despite Pakistan’s {{extensive}} {{contribution to}} {{the global war on}} terrorism, many questions persist {{about the extent to which}} Al Qaeda and its associated outfits are currently operating within Pakistan. This article examines this issue by posing several empiri-cal questions: (1) What are the general contours of militancy in Pakistan? (2) What motivates individuals to join specific Pakistan-based militant outfits? (3) By what means do groups recruit specific individuals? (4) What do these findings suggest for Al Qaeda operations in Pakistan? (5) What linkages exist between Pakistan-based organizations to Al Qaeda? These issues are addressed through regional fieldwork, extensive literature reviews, and consultation with numerous highly regarded ana-lysts to South Asia. This article concludes that Al Qaeda likely does not have an explicit and dedicated recruiting infrastructure to recruit Pakistanis for its opera-tions. Rather, Al Qaeda relies upon a web of informal relations with groups based in Pakistan to gain access to operational collaborators and individuals to execute attacks within Pakistan. U. S. officials have publicly praised Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf for providing unstinting support to the U. S. -led global war on terrorism. 1 Despite these public acco-lades, privately several questions loom regarding Islamabad’s ability and intent to coop-erate as fully as possible in the global war on terrorism. Observers within and without Pakistan are dubious that the Musharraf government is doing all that it can to deny neo-Taliban forces and Al Qaeda associates use of its territory as a staging ground for attacks in Afghanistan. 2 Strmecki articulated these varied concerns when he wrote, “Musharraf is a vital—but profoundly flawed—vehicle for such a [counter-terrorism] strategy. ” 3 Given these <b>reservations</b> about Pakistan’s <b>commitment</b> to the war on terrorism and the centrality of that state in degrading Al Qaeda, this essay examines the extent to which Al Qaeda and its associated outfits are currently operating within Pakistan. It does so by posing several empirical questions, specifically...|$|R
