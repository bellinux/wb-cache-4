We define asymptotic-information-lossless (AILL) designs and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition under which a design is AILL. Analogous to the condition that full-rank designs achieve the point corresponding to the <b>zero</b> multiplexing <b>gain</b> of the optimal tradeoff, we show that it is a necessary and sufficient condition for a design to be AILL to achieve the point corresponding to the <b>zero</b> diversity <b>gain</b> of the optimal tradeoff curve.

40|$|Below-knee {{amputation}} {{is associated}} with higher energy expenditure during walking, partially due to difficulty maintaining balance. We previously found that once-per-step push-off work control can reduce balance-related effort, both in simulation and in experiments with human participants. Simulations also suggested that changing ankle inversion/eversion torque on each step, in response to changes in body state, could assist with balance. In this study, we investigated the effects of ankle inversion/eversion torque modulation on balance-related effort among amputees (N = 5) using a multi-actuated ankle-foot prosthesis emulator. In stabilizing conditions, changes in ankle inversion/eversion torque were applied so as to counteract deviations in side-to-side center-of-mass acceleration {{at the moment of}} intact-limb toe off; higher acceleration toward the prosthetic limb resulted in a corrective ankle inversion torque during the ensuing stance phase. Destabilizing controllers had the opposite effect, and a <b>zero</b> <b>gain</b> controller made no changes to the nominal inversion/eversion torque. To separate the balance-related effects of step-to-step control from the potential effects of changes in average mechanics, average ankle inversion/eversion torque and prosthesis work were held constant across conditions. High-gain stabilizing control lowered metabolic cost by 13 % compared to the <b>zero</b> <b>gain</b> controller (p = 0. 05). We then investigated individual responses to subject-specific stabilizing controllers following an enforced exploration period. Four of five participants experienced reduced metabolic rate compared to the <b>zero</b> <b>gain</b> controller (− 15, − 14, − 11, − 6, and + 4 %) an average reduction of 9 % (p = 0. 05). Average prosthesis mechanics were unchanged across all conditions, suggesting that improvements in energy economy might have come from changes in step-to-step corrections related to balance. Step-to-step modulation of inversion/eversion torque could be used in new, active ankle-foot prostheses to reduce walking effort associated with maintaining balance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach using continuation and optimisation methods for modifying a process design to avoid control difficulties caused by input multiplicity. The approach assumes an initial design, with a preassigned SISO control structure, has been obtained and is useful {{where there is}} an input multiplicity in the operating region. The condition for input multiplicity is obtained by inflating the state space model with a state representing the locus of the point of <b>zero</b> <b>gain.</b> The multiplicity condition is determined using the bifurcation analysis package, AUTO, which allows {{the study of the}} influence of operating conditions and parameters on input multiplicity behaviour to obtain an expression for the point of <b>zero</b> <b>gain</b> {{as a function of the}} design and disturbance variables. A process modification problem is formulated within an optimisation framework and solved to determine the minimal design parameter changes necessary to avoid input multiplicity given an assumed maximal disturbance. Results are presented for the application of the algorithm to a CSTR system demonstrating that small changes in some design variables can avoid input multiplicity problems in this case, and that the method can determine the changes necessary...|$|E

40|$|For optimal action planning, the gain/loss {{associated}} with actions and {{the variability in}} motor output should both be considered. A number of studies make conflicting claims about the optimality of human action planning but cannot be reconciled due to their use of different movements and gain/loss functions. The disagreement is possibly because of differences in the experimental design and differences in the energetic cost of participant motor effort. We used a coincident timing task, which requires decision making with constant energetic cost, to test the optimality of participant’s timing strategies under four configurations of the gain function. We compared participant strategies to an optimal timing strategy calculated from a Bayesian model that maximizes the expected gain. We found suboptimal timing strategies under two configurations of the gain function characterized by asymmetry, in which higher gain is {{associated with}} higher risk of <b>zero</b> <b>gain.</b> Participants showed a risk-seeking strategy by responding closer than optimal {{to the time of}} onset/offset of <b>zero</b> <b>gain.</b> Meanwhile, there was good agreement of the model with actual performance under two configurations of the gain function characterized by symmetry.

40|$|It {{is known}} that neither the Alamouti nor the V-BLAST scheme {{achieves}} the Zheng–Tse diversity–multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. With respect to the DMT curve, the Alamouti scheme achieves the point corresponding to maximum diversity gain only, whereas V-BLAST meets only the point corresponding to maximum multiplexing gain. It is also known that D-BLAST achieves the optimal DMT for n transmit and n receive antennas, but only {{under the assumption that}} the leading and trailing zeros are ignored. When these zeros are taken into account, D-BLAST achieves the point corresponding to <b>zero</b> multiplexing <b>gain,</b> but not the point corresponding to <b>zero</b> diversity <b>gain.</b> The first scheme to achieve the DMT is the coding scheme of Yao and Wornell for the case of two transmit and two receive antennas.

40|$|Error {{analysis}} of a resistive sensor-to-microcontroller interface based on pulse-width modulation and time–ratio measurement shows that internal input and output resistances in microcontroller digital ports produce <b>zero,</b> <b>gain</b> and nonlinearity errors. The time–ratio measurement technique cancels these errors when the sensor resistance equals the reference resistor and reduces errors around that point. We propose two simple methods of reducing those errors for sensors with a wide dynamic range. Both methods use time–ratio measurements. The first method uses several reference resistors covering the sensor resistance range; the second method uses two-point calibration. The second method is more efficient and yields errors that can be smaller than 0. 5 Ω for a sensor resistance from about 600 Ω to 3550 Ω. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} useful {{features}} of a microservices architecture is its versatility to scale horizontally. However, not all services scale in or out uniformly. The performance of an application composed of microservices depends largely on a suitable combination of replica count and resource capacity.

Consequently, application providers pay more than necessary despite <b>zero</b> <b>gain</b> in overall performance. Solving this issue requires an application-specific determination of scaling limits due to the general infeasibility of an application-agnostic solution.

The two amplifiers are always biased oppositely meaning that one will have maximal gain when the other’s gain vanishes and vice versa. The overall input signal is split and sent through both amplifiers and then re-combined with a relative π phase shift.
