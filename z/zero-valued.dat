40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of <b>zero-value</b> subtraction on the performance of two laser fluorescence (LF) devices developed to detect occlusal caries. METHODS: The authors selected 119 permanent molars. Two examiners assessed three areas (cuspal, middle and cervical) of both mesial and distal portions of the buccal surface and one occlusal site using an LF device and an LF pen. For each tooth, the authors subtracted the value measured in the cuspal, middle and cervical areas in the buccal surface from the value measured in the respective occlusal site. RESULTS: The authors observed differences among the readings for both devices in the cuspal, middle and cervical areas in the buccal surface as well as differences for both devices with and without the <b>zero-value</b> subtraction in the occlusal surface. When the authors did not perform the <b>zero-value</b> subtraction, they found statistically significant differences for sensitivity and accuracy for the LF device. When this was done with the LF pen, specificity increased and sensitivity decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: For the LF device, the <b>zero-value</b> subtraction decreased the sensitivity. For this reason, the authors concluded that clinicians can obtain measures with the LF device effectively without using <b>zero-value</b> subtraction. For the LF pen, however, the absence of the <b>zero-value</b> subtraction changed both the sensitivity and specificity, and so the authors concluded that clinicians should not eliminate this step from the procedure. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: When using the LF device, clinicians might not need to perform the <b>zero-value</b> subtraction; however, for the LF pen, clinicians should do so...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Several {{experimental}} results {{ensure that the}} differential power analysis (DPA) breaks the implementation of elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) on memory constraint devices. In order to resist the DPA, {{the parameters of the}} underlying curve must be randomized. We usually randomize the base point in the projective coordinate, or we transform all parameters to the random isomorphic curve. However, Goubin pointed out the point (0, y) can not be randomized by these countermeasures. This point is often contained in the standard curves, and we have to care this attack. In this paper, we propose a novel attack, called the <b>zero-value</b> point attack. On the contrary to Goubin’s attack, we use the <b>zero-value</b> registers in the addition formulae. Even if a point has no <b>zero-value</b> coordinate, the auxiliary registers might take <b>zero-value.</b> We investigate these zerovalue registers that cannot be randomized by the above randomization. Indeed on elliptic curves over prime fields, we have found several points P = (x, y) which cause the <b>zero-value</b> registers, e. g., (1) 3 x 2 + a = 0, (2) 5 x 4 + 2 ax 2 − 4 bx + a 2 = 0, (3) P is y-coordinate self-collision point, etc. We demonstrate the standard curves that have these points. Interestingly, some conditions required for the <b>zero-value</b> attack depend on the explicit implementation of the addition formulae — in order to resist this type of attacks, we have to care how to assemble the multiplications and the additions in the addition formulae.

Goubin proposed a variant of DPA using the point (0, y), which is not randomized in Jacobian coordinates or in the isomorphic class. This point often exists in the standard curves, {{and we have to}} care this attack. In this paper, we propose the <b>zero-value</b> point attack as an extension of Goubin’s attack. Note that even if a point has no <b>zero-value</b> coordinate, the auxiliary registers might take <b>zero-value.</b> We investigate these zerovalue registers that cannot be randomized by the above randomization.

40|$|The optical {{systems with}} distributed/sparse {{apertures}} {{have a number}} of distinctive features in comparison with the systems with monolithic ones. Among them the possible existence of <b>zero-value</b> regions of the optical transfer function (OTF) and the existence of a beam combination system which forms a combined image in a common focal plane. Using the fast-convergent gradient methods for nonlinear constrained optimization, the first feature can result in a suspension of a calculation process if an intermediate solution falls into a <b>zero-value</b> region of the OTF. The second feature gives rise to introducing of some optical errors influencing the quality of the combined image due to the limited accuracy of a beam combination control system. In this thesis, the possibility of applying a gradient optimization method to optimize the distributed/sparse optical aperture configuration is shown. An appropriate approach based on approximation of the step pupil functions with <b>zero-value</b> regions by continuously differentiable functions with non <b>zero-value</b> regions is proposed. This method is demonstrated using examples of circular and annular subapertures. Further, the influence of the residual random image alignment (IA) and optical path difference (OPD) errors of the beam combination system on the OTF is investigated. On the basis of the Fraunhofer approach to the Kirchhoff diffraction theory, an analytical expression showing the dependence of an instantaneous OTF on the IA and OPD errors is derived. Using the Gaussian probability distributions for the random errors, an analytical expression determining an average OTF (AOTF) depending on statistical parameters of the errors is obtained. The calculation results permit to produce the necessary requirements to the accuracy of the beam combination control system. Finally, possible optimization variants utilizing the step pupil function approximation and the AOTF conception are presented. They use a gradient constrained optimization method with objective functions depending on a signal-to-noise ratio which is expressed in terms of the optimized parameters, in particular, the parameters of the aperture configuration, the effective focal length, and the geometrical parameters of a charge coupled device.

40|$|Information-theoretic {{clustering}} aims {{to exploit}} information theoretic measures as the clustering criteria. A common practice {{on this topic}} is so-called INFO-K-means, which performs K-means clustering with the KL-divergence as the proximity function. While expert efforts on INFO-K-means have shown promising results, a remaining challenge is to deal with high-dimensional sparse data. Indeed, it is possi-ble that the centroids contain many <b>zero-value</b> features for high-dimensional sparse data. This leads to infinite KL-divergence values, which create a dilemma in assigning ob-jects to the centroids during the iteration process of K-means. To meet this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a Summation-based Incremental Learning (SAIL) method for INFO-K-means clustering. Specifically, by using an equiv-alent objective function, SAIL replaces the computation of the KL-divergence by the computation of the Shannon en-tropy. This can avoid the <b>zero-value</b> dilemma caused {{by the use of}} the KL-divergence.
