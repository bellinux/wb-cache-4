40|$|First work {{carried out}} in calves fed soy protein in <b>Milk</b> <b>Replacer</b> that {{obtained}} similar growth rates than animals fed whey protein based <b>Milk</b> <b>Replacer.</b> The increasing cost of milk proteins is forcing the <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> industry to evaluate alternative protein sources to make more cost effective products. Alternative proteins should contain an appropriate amount of crude protein that is digestible with an adequate amino acid profile. Among the available protein sources, soy protein appears to be good alternative because of the protein content, availability, and lower cost compared with the milk proteins. However, soybean contains anti-nutritional factors such as trypsin inhibitor, lectins, and non-starch polysaccharides and inclusion of soy proteins in <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> has resulted in reduced growth and health in preruminant calves. The use of exogenous enzymes such as mannanases in poultry and swine has shown improved performance in the digestibility of soy-based feeds. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of soy-containing <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> with the addition of mannanase-based enzymes on growth and health of pre-ruminant Holstein bull calves. Two <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> were used for this experiment, a commercially available whey based <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> (28 % CP and 15 % fat) and a specially formulated soy protein containing <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> with fifty percent of the protein replaced by the soy protein concentrate. Fifty-six calves (n= 14 per treatment, four treatments) were assigned to treatments consisting of either the all whey protein, or the soy protein <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> without mannanase based enzymes or two additional treatments fed two concentrations of mannanase based enzymes. The calves were provided 0. 28 Mcal gross energy/kg BW 0. 75 the first seven days and 0. 32 Mcal gross energy/kg BW 0. 75 until day 21 when the absolute amount was held constant to maintain adequate inventory of <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> for the 56 -day study. On day 36 a commercial calf starter was provided to the calves on an ad libitum basis, and a step down weaning process weaning occurred at day 56 with complete starter removal and weaning by day 63. Initial (53. 6 +- 6. 4 Kg) and final (111. 2 +- 10. 7 Kg) body weights were not significantly different, thus average daily gain (0. 91 +- 0. 14 kg/d) was not different among treatments. Among treatments, dry matter intake (1. 64 +- 0. 25 kg/d) and overall feed efficiency (gain:feed, 0. 56 +-. 07) was not different.

Dairy herds with enteric bacteria with known low tetracycline susceptibility were enrolled for the study. Fecal samples from preweaned calves and environmental samples were collected from eight dairy herds in Michigan and New York State. Samples were collected monthly for 3 months prior to and 12 months after four of the eight herds discontinued medicated <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> feeding. Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. and E. coli were isolated, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using automated broth microdilution. A total of 804 intervention and 1, 026 control calf fecal samples and 122 intervention and 136 control environmental samples were collected for testing. No differences in owner-reported morbidity and mortality between treatment groups were seen. The intervention was significantly associated with increasing tetracycline susceptibility in E. coli and Salmonella. Tetracycline susceptibility increased in intervention herds for the first 3 months after switching to nonmedicated <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> but declined in subsequent months. Discontinuing the practice of feeding medicated <b>milk</b> <b>replacers</b> to calves increased tetracycline susceptibility in E. coli and Salmonella on dairy farms, without increasing cattle disease, but declines in effectiveness after 3 months suggest that other factors contribute to decreasing susceptibility on the farm...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} spray-dried animal plasma in milk re-placer without {{or with the}} {{addition}} of additives con-taining fructooligosaccharides and spray-dried serum on health, growth, and intake of Holstein calves was measured in two 56 -d experiments. In experiment 1, 120 calves were fed <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> containing 0 or 20 % of crude protein as spray-dried bovine plasma for 42 d and 30 to 60 g/d of additives containing whey protein concentrate or bovine serum for the first 15 d. Commer-cial calf starter was available from d 29, and water was available at all times. In experiment 2, 120 calves were fed <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> containing 0 or 16 % of crude protein as spray-dried bovine plasma with 0 or 30 to 60 g/d of additive containing bovine serum for the first 15 d. Additive containing bovine serum also contained fruc-tooligosaccharides, whey, and vitamin/mineral premix. In experiment 1, calves fed additive containing bovine serum tended to have fewer days with diarrhea, lower use of electrolytes, and improved BW gain from d 29 to 56. The addition of spray-dried bovine plasma to <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> did not influence any parameter measured. In experiment 2, calves fed additive containing bovine serum or <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> containing spray-dried bovine plasma had lower mortality (4. 4 vs. 20 %) and tended to have improved fecal scores and fewer days with scours. Antibiotic use was lower when calves were fed the addi-tive. Indices of enteric health (incidence of scours and treatment with antibiotics and electrolytes) were im-proved when plasma was added to <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> throughout the <b>milk</b> feeding period or as an additive during the first 15 d of the milk feeding period, when calves were most susceptible to enteric pathogens.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of heat stress and varying levels of <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> on dairy calf performance. Holstein bull calves ? 2 d of age were randomly assigned housing, outside under a covered area, heat stress (HS), or inside a controlled environment, non-heat stress (NHS), to test for heat stress effects on growth. Calves were also assigned to one of three feeding strategies: increasing amounts of <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> from 1. 1 % body weight (BW) to 1. 5 % BW (INC), constant at 1. 1 % BW (CON), or decreasing from 1. 6 % BW to 1. 2 % BW (DEC), adjusted weekly, commencing on day 9 of feeding and ending on day 40. <b>Milk</b> <b>replacer</b> amounts were adjusted twice weekly after weighing. Calves had ad libitum access to commercial starter feed and water. Starter intake, water intake, and fecal score (1 to 4) were recorded daily. Respiration rates and rectal temperatures were recorded twice daily at 0600 h and 1800 h. Average daily gain was greater (P < 0. 01) for NHS (0. 79 ? 0. 03 kg/d) compared to HS (0. 66 ? 0. 03 kg/d) The NHS calves consumed more starter (P < 0. 01) than HS (1. 77 vs 1. 16 ? 0. 06 kg/d. Water consumption averaged 3923 ? 105 mL/d for HS which was greater (P < 0. 01) than NHS (2338 ? 105 mL/d). No significant differences were observed among the feeding treatment groups for weight gain (P = 0. 73). <b>Milk</b> <b>replacer</b> levels had a significant impact (P < 0. 01) on the amount of calf starter consumed with CON consuming the most (1. 64 ? 0. 07 kg/d), followed by INC (1. 44 ? 0. 07) and DEC consuming the least (1. 34 ? 0. 07 kg/d). Water intake was also significantly impacted by <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> levels (P < 0. 01). Calves in the DEC group consumed the least amount of starter, and consumed more water (3657 ? 129 mL/d) than both INC calves (3119 ? 129 mL/d) and CON calves (2614 ? 129 mL/d). Overall, housing has an impact on growth in neonatal dairy calves; however, <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> levels did not impact growth of the calves...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{nutrition}} {{is important}} to provide all nutrients for proper health and growth of young calves, especially {{in the presence of}} stressors such as cold and transport. Serum protein products have been proposed to improve health and diminish effects of stress in dairy calves. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess a serum protein-based arrival formula (AF) and use of a serum protein supplement (G; Gammulin, APC Inc.) in <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> for neonatal male calves stressed by transport and cold on performance, morbidity, and mortality. Ninety-three male Holstein calves were stratified by arrival BW and plasma protein concentration, and then randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Treatments were 1 = control electrolyte, <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> without G (E; n = 25); 2 = AF, <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> without G (AF; n = 22); 3 = control electrolyte, <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> with G (EG; n = 24); and 4 = AF, <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> with G (AFG; n = 22). At arrival, calves were fed either AF or a control electrolyte solution. At the next feeding, all calves received either a commercial calf <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> (20 % CP, and 20 % fat; no G supplementation) or the same <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> supplemented with G. The G‐supplemented group received 50 g/d of G in the <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> during the first 14 d of feeding only. Feed offered and refused was recorded daily. Calf health was assessed by daily assignment of scour and respiratory scores. Body weight, withers height, body length, heart girth, hip height, and hip width were measured weekly. Blood samples were taken at d 0 (before treatments), d 2, d 7, d 14, and d 28. Calves were weaned at d 42 and remained in the experiment until d 56. Data were analyzed using the MIXED, GLIMMIX, LIFETEST, and LOGISTIC procedure of SAS (v. 9. 2). The environmental temperature during all periods was below the lower critical temperature. During the first 2 wk of dietary treatment, calves fed AF had significantly longer body length (P = 0. 05); greater starter DM and CP intakes (P = 0. 0007); superior total DM, CP, and ME intakes (P < 0. 05); and greater cortisol concentration (P = 0. 02) in blood. Supplementation with G resulted in greater BW (P = 0. 06); greater <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> DM and CP intakes (P < 0. 0001); higher total CP intake (P < 0. 0001); lower mean respiratory score, less odds for days (P = 0. 08) and number of calves (P = 0. 0008) with high respiratory score; and greater concentrations of total protein (P = 0. 04) and urea N (P = 0. 01) in plasma. In addition, during the 8 -wk experiment G supplementation resulted in improved mean fecal score (P = 0. 02) and less antibiotic treatments per calf (P = 0. 05). Mortality was greater (P = 0. 02) for calves that did not receive G. Results indicated that a serum protein-supplemented arrival formula improved early starter and total nutrient intakes. Addition of a serum protein product also improved early growth, and decreased morbidity and mortality in transported male calves. Despite the marked reduction in mortality of transported cold-stressed male calves fed the serum protein product, indicators of acute-phase response were not affected; however, protein status of calves may have been improved by early serum protein supplementation...|$|R

40|$|Four {{experiments}} involving 140 pigs {{were conducted}} to evaluate cow colostrum and twice-a-day feeding in artificial rearing of baby pigs. Piglets were allowed to nurse the sow for 15 hours after birth and allotted by litter and weight to <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> or <b>milk</b> <b>replacer</b> plus cow colostrum. Piglets were housed in individual wire cages and fed four times on day one, three times on day two, and twice daily days 3 through 21. Dry feed was offered to pigs after day 14. Pigs {{were removed from the}} individual cages and moved to a conventional nursery at 21 days of age. Piglets receiving cow colostrum had improved weight gains and decreased incidence of scours {{during the first week of}} life. Piglets fed cow colostrum had increased livability (98 vs. 91 %) compared to piglets receiving only <b>milk</b> <b>replacer.</b> There was little advantage to feeding cow colostrum after the first week. Piglets raised artificially were similar in weight to sow-reared pigs at 6 weeks of age.
