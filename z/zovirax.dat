40|$|Acyclovir (<b>Zovirax)</b> and {{zidovudine}} (Retrovir) dominate antiviral therapy. They {{interfere with}} the multiplication of herpes viruses (acyclovir) and HIV (zidovudine) by incorporation into nascent DNA chains and interruption of the further linking of nucleotides. All types of infection caused by herpes simplex virus are potentially treatable by acyclovir, but treatment has to start to be effective. It is especially important to treat immunosuppressed patients because their infections are more prolonged and severe. A typical attack of herpes zoster in an immunocompetent patient is shortened by about 2 days if high doses of acyclovir are given within 3 days of {{the start of the}} skin lesions, but unfortunately the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia is not diminished. Zidovudine lowers early mortality in patients with AIDS and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. However, much of the effectiveness of zidovudine is lost later; the average prolongation of life in treated patients is estimated to be about 1 year.

Acyclovir incorporated within the polymer was also significantly more effective than the acyclovir ointment when treatment was initiated on day 5 postinfection.

40|$|Infection with {{herpes simplex}} viruses (HSVs) {{resistant}} to treatment with acyclovir (9 -[(2 -hydroxyethoxy) -methyl]guanine, <b>Zovirax)</b> {{is a growing}} clinical problem in patients with AIDS and other immunosuppressed states. Most virus isolates resistant to acyclovir are deficient or defective in virally coded thymidine kinase (TK), which converts acyclovir to acyclovir monophosphate in virus-infected cells. To restore acyclovir efficacy, we synthesized acyclovir diphosphate dimyristoylglycerol, an analog of a naturally occurring phospholipid, CDP-diacylglycerol. Its biological activity was tested in WI 38 human lung fibroblasts infected with the acyclovir-resistant DM 21 strain of HSV, which is TK negative due to an 816 -base-pair deletion in the TK coding region. Acyclovir diphosphate dimyristoylglycerol has substantial activity in DM 21 -infected cells (IC 50 = 0. 25 microM), whereas acyclovir and acyclovir monophosphate were ineffective (IC 50 > 100 microM). Similar results were obtained in TK-altered and TK-deficient strains of HSV- 1 and in acyclovir-resistant isolates of HSV- 2 obtained from two AIDS patients. The phospholipid prodrug is active by means of TK-independent metabolic pathways that liberate acyclovir monophosphate inside the host cell. Acyclovir phosphates were 56 times greater in WI 38 human lung fibroblasts incubated for 24 hr with [8 - 3 H]acyclovir diphosphate dimyristoylglycerol relative to acyclovir. Acyclovir monophosphate added to the culture medium (outside the cell) did not circumvent the acyclovir resistance of the TK-negative DM 21 mutant, presumably due to its conversion to acyclovir by phosphatases. Acyclovir diphosphate diacylglycerol prodrugs {{may be useful in}} treating TK-deficient mutant and wild-type strains of HSV...|$|E
40|$|College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, RiyadhThis {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the bioavailability of a new tablet formulation of acyclovir (400 mg), Clovir, relative to reference product, <b>Zovirax</b> (400 mg) tablets. The 2 brands {{were found to be}} similar in weight variation, disintegration time, dissolution, and assay as stipulated by the USPXXIII, {{as well as by the}} manufacturer. The bioavailability was carried out on 24 healthy male volunteers who received a single dose (400 mg) of the test (T) and the reference (R) products in the fasting state, in a randomized balanced 2 -way crossover design. After dosing, serial blood samples were collected for a period of 16 hours. Plasma harvested from blood was analyzed for acyclovir by a sensitive and validated high-performance liquid chromatographic assay. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0 -t), and to infinity (AUC 0 -∞), and the absorption rate (Cmax/AUC 0 -∞) were analyzed statistically under the assumption of a multiplicative model. The time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was analyzed assuming an additive model. The parametric confidence intervals (90 %) of the mean values of the pharmacokinetic characteristics (AUC 0 -t, AUC 0 -∞, Cmax, Cmax/AUC 0 -∞) for T/R ratio were in each case, well within the bioequivalence acceptable range of 80 - 125 %. The test formulation was found bioequivalent to the reference formulation by the Schuirmann's two 1 -sided t tests and by Wilcoxon Mann Whitney two 1 -sided tests procedure. Therefore, the 2 formulations were considered to be bioequivalent...|$|E

To {{improve the}} {{treatment}} of early infectious corneal ulcers by combining microdiathermocoagulation (MDC), external autocytokinotherapy, and antiviral and/or antibacterial therapy. patients and methods. The study enrolled 2 groups of outpatients (a total of 112 patients, 112 eyes) who either showed no improvement or deteriorated under 7 -day to 1. 5 -month therapeutic treatment. Group I included 70 patients (70 eyes) with superficial corneal ulcers due to herpes virus infection under antiviral therapy (instillations and periocular injections of Poludan (PolyA:PoliU) as well as <b>Zovirax</b> 3 % ophthalmic ointment), group II — 42 patients (42 eyes) with early-stage purulent corneal ulcers under instillations of modern antibiotics (current-generation fluoroquinolones). results and discussion. The combination of MDC and external autocytokinotherapy {{is the most effective}} treatment for torpid herpetic ulcerative keratitis that allows a reliable reduction in the recovery period: from 24. 1 ± 2. 2 days (therapeutic treatment only) down to 9. 2 ± 1. 3 days (both methods plus antiviral therapy). Moreover, MDC is {{the treatment of}} choice in outpatients with purulent corneal ulcer in its early stage. The healing period in this case can be also reliably reduced (р< 0. 05) from 18. 6 ± 1. 9 days (MDC plus antibacterial therapy). Hence, MDC is a highly effective urgent method of treatment available to ambulatory care patients with herpetic keratitis and early-stage purulent corneal ulcers. External autocytokinotherapy shows a pronounced anti-inflammatory and regenerative effect. When applied together, MDC and external autocytokinotherapy act synergistically and provide twice as short treatment periods. MDC as well as its combination with external autocytokinotherapy, if started early, allow to avoid keratoplasty in most patients with herpetic keratitis and early-stage purulent corneal ulcers. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is {{estimation}} of pharmacokinetic parameters: Cmax, tmax, t 1 / 2, AUC 0 -t and AUC 0 -∞ with the two-way analysis of variance, single observation (ANOVA) for two preparations containing acyclovir. OBJECTIVE: In order to evaluate pharmacokinetic study of acyclovir, method for quantitative determination of acyclovir in human plasma should be simple, rapid and reproducible. Therefore, the method is developed, validated and applied for analysis of acyclovir in plasma samples obtained from healthy volunteers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: High performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with UV-detection for the determination of acyclovir in human plasma is presented. This method involves protein precipitation with 20 % (V/V) perchloric acid. The chromatographic separation was accomplished on a reversed phase C 8 column with a mobile phase composed of 0. 1 % (v/v) triethylamine in water (pH 2. 5). No internal standard is required. UV detection was set at 255 nm. The method was successfully applied for the evaluation of pharmacokinetic profiles of acyclovir tablets in 24 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The validation results shows that proposed method is rugged, precise (RSDs for intra- and inter-day precision ranged from 1. 02 to 8. 37 %) and accurate (relative errors are less than 6. 66 %). The calibration curve was linear in the concentration range of 0. 1 - 2. 0 µg/ml and the limit of quantification was 0. 1 µg/ml. The Cmax, tmax and AUCs for the two products were not statistically different (p> 0. 05), suggesting that the plasma profiles generated by <b>Zovirax</b> were comparable to those produced by acyclovir manufactured by Jaka 80 company. CONCLUSION: Good precision, accuracy, simplicity, sensitivity and shorter time of analysis of the method makes it particularly useful for processing of multiple samples in a limited period of time for pharmacokinetic study of acyclovir...|$|E
