25|$|The Permian {{period was}} characterised for 30 million years by arid desert and {{erosion of the}} areas uplifted in the Variscan Orogeny (southwest England and {{adjacent}} areas in the present-day English Channel). Later, much of England was submerged in shallow waters as the polar ice sheets melted and the Tethys Ocean and <b>Zechstein</b> Sea formed, depositing shale, limestone, gravel, and marl, before finally receding to leave a flat desert with salt pans.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is {{the name}} for the chemical compound with the formula MgCl2 and its various hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x. These salts are typical ionic halides, being highly soluble in water. The hydrated magnesium chloride can be extracted from brine or sea water. In North America, magnesium chloride is produced primarily from Great Salt Lake brine. It is extracted in a similar process from the Dead Sea in the Jordan valley. Magnesium chloride, as the natural mineral bischofite, is also extracted (via solution mining) out of ancient seabeds; for example, the <b>Zechstein</b> seabed in northwest Europe. Some magnesium chloride is made from solar evaporation of seawater. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is the principal precursor to magnesium metal, which is produced on a large scale. Hydrated magnesium chloride is the form most readily available.|$|E
500|$|Mastodonsaurus {{and other}} similar animals were {{referred}} to as labyrinthodonts, named like Labyrinthodon for teeth that were highly folded in cross section. Owen's [...] "Labyrinthodon Jaegeri" [...] was later found at Guy's Cliffe, England by paleontologist William Buckland. Other specimens {{were found in the}} red sandstone of Warwickshire. As more fossils were uncovered in England, Owen depicted these labyrinthodonts as the [...] "highest" [...] form of batrachian and compared them to crocodiles, which he considered the highest form of reptiles. He also noted the large labyrinthodonts of the Keuper (a unit of rocks that dates to the Late Triassic) were younger than more advanced reptiles in the Magnesian and <b>Zechstein,</b> which are Late Permian in age. Owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from a sequential progression from early amphibians (what he called [...] "metamorphosed fishes").|$|E
500|$|Potassium salts such as carnallite, langbeinite, polyhalite, and sylvite form {{extensive}} evaporite {{deposits in}} ancient lake bottoms and seabeds, making extraction of potassium salts in these environments commercially viable. The principal source of potassium – potash – is mined in Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, Jordan, {{and other places}} around the world. The first mined deposits were located near Staßfurt, Germany, but the deposits span from Great Britain over Germany into Poland. They {{are located in the}} <b>Zechstein</b> and were deposited in the Middle to Late Permian. The largest deposits ever found lie [...] {{below the surface of the}} Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The deposits are located in the Elk Point Group produced in the Middle Devonian. Saskatchewan, where several large mines have operated since the 1960s pioneered the technique of freezing of wet sands (the Blairmore formation) to drive mine shafts through them. The main potash mining company in Saskatchewan is the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The water of the Dead Sea is used by Israel and Jordan as a source of potash, while the concentration in normal oceans is too low for commercial production at current prices.|$|E
2500|$|The Ekofisk {{field is}} a central graben, north-south {{trending}} anticline [...] in area, with [...] of vertical closure and a hydrocarbon column [...] long, formed by Permian <b>Zechstein</b> salt movement {{in the form of}} salt pillows. [...] The production zones at a depth of about 3km, include the Paleocene Ekofisk Formation and the Upper Cretaceous Tor Formation, both Chalk Group rocks containing porosities of 30-40%. [...] "The reservoir rock...is a true chalk-a fine-grained limestone composed of the skeletal remains of pelagic unicellular golden-brown algae or coccolithophores". [...] The source rocks are the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridgian shales.|$|E
2500|$|By the Triassic, the Permian <b>Zechstein</b> Sea {{had retreated}} and the climate {{had become a}} little wetter giving a gentle {{transition}} making the Permian-Triassic boundary uncertain in northern England as there are no fossil horizons or facies changes that make a definitive separation possible as there in continental Europe. The horizon however is characterised by a succession of red marls (calcareous mudstones) deposited on coastal flats, followed by the Sherwood Sandstone (formerly Bunter Sandstone). [...] The 'British Isles' were not islands, but had an intra-continental position within Pangea. The area that now constitutes Great Britain was drifting northwards as Pangea rotated, was at a latitude of 10° - 20° north, equivalent to the latitude of the present day Sahara desert. Erosion of the then recently uplifted landmass formed Aeolian deposits in the southern and central parts of the country. This iron-rich silica sandstone was both oxidised and reworked to give it its red colouration and its name, [...] "New Red Sandstone". British deposits of the era consist of these red beds, alluvial, fluvial and lake deposits, with some shallow-water marine and evaporite deposits. These Permo-Triassic outcrops {{can be seen on}} either side of the Pennines and in Devon. Within the main central England basin (Staffordshire and Cheshire), the deposits are dominated by pebbly sandstones and conglomerates (Chester Pebble Beds, Wilmslow and Wildmoor Sandstones), which have been interpreted as the deposits of a fluvial system running within well-confined channels. The Sherwood Sandstone Group comprises a series of conglomerates, coarse sandstones and mudstones. The Chester pebble beds to the south of Alderley represent material deposited in alluvial fan/braided river system. The finer sediments of the Wilmslow and Helsby Sandstone to the west of Alderley represent alluvial deposits of low sinuosity channels. The Alderley area represents the midpoint between the full braided river system and the lower energy area. Minor aeolian dunes and channel infill deposits in the Wilmslow Sandstones indicate an inter channel area or seasonal drying of some of the minor river channels.|$|E

5000|$|In the Upper Permian, the <b>Zechstein</b> Unit {{began to}} {{accumulate}} {{on top of}} the Rotliegend Unit around 260 Ma. The <b>Zechstein</b> Unit is composed of alternating layers of carbonates and evaporate deposits, such as anhydrite and halite. [...] The thickness of the <b>Zechstein</b> is extremely diverse due to post-depositional salt tectonics, though there is a general increase in thickness in the northwestern region of the North German Basin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Zechstein</b> has {{significant}} economic {{importance in the}} North Sea Oil province. In the southern gas basin, it forms the main cap rock to the gas fields with Rotliegend reservoirs. It also forms a reservoir in the Auk oilfield in {{the central part of}} the North Sea. Further north, the <b>Zechstein</b> salt becomes diapiric, forming salt domes which form the structure for several oil fields, such as Machar. <b>Zechstein</b> dolomites crop out near the coast of County Durham, England where they are known as the Magnesian Limestone.|$|E

50|$|In the Late Jurassic, {{the third}} rifting event {{took place in}} {{response}} to the North Sea doming event. Major extensional faulting and rifting began approximately 157-155 Ma allowing for the <b>Zechstein</b> evaporites to form a detachment between basement rocks and upper stratigraphy largely influencing the natural gas and oil formation seen across the North German Basin. Organic-rich mudstones from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation {{is the source of the}} majority of the North German Basin's hydrocarbons which was restricted from migrating upward by the <b>Zechstein</b> salt.|$|E
5000|$|The North German Basin has a {{particularly}} abundance of natural gas. These large hydrocarbon accumulations {{have been created}} and clumped together by a single total petroleum system(TPS) called the Carboniferous-Rotliegend TPS. Approximately 85% of all gas production has been from the Rotliegend Group aeolian sandstones preserved by the <b>Zechstein</b> Unit, while 13% can be contributed to the Triassic fluvial sandstones, also preserved by the <b>Zechstein</b> Unit but due to the migration of salt rather than chronologically being placed below the <b>Zechstein</b> Unit. The Groningen Gas Field is the located below a region northeast Netherland is the basins largest reserve and {{also happens to be}} one of the largest gas fields in the world holding up to [...] of natural gas. The North German Basin along with the Anglo-Dutch Basin and the North Sea Graben Province, contain the majority of oil and gas reserves identified throughout Western Europe.|$|E
50|$|The Rotliegend {{is covered}} by the Late Permian <b>Zechstein</b> {{evaporite}} sequence, consisting of carbonate, anhydrite and halite, which provides an effective seal to the gas accumulations within the underlying sandstone.|$|E
50|$|This {{phase is}} {{currently}} active today and {{started in the}} Cretaceous.In the late Cretaceous and in the Tertiary inversion phases in the Southern North Sea region occurred due to the Alpine orogeny and its compressional stresses. Since there had been inversion the <b>Zechstein</b> salt played a huge role by acting as a buffer between two structural regimes. Although the phase reactivated pre-existing faults it allowed the salt tectonics to remain active during the Tertiary as the sediments were deposited, and later became penetrated by the salt diapers. The Alpine phase did add more structural confusion to the geologic history, but it also help create more traps with the <b>Zechstein</b> salt.|$|E

50|$|The gypsum {{was formed}} as sulfate {{evaporite}} sediments, which were deposited about 250 {{million years ago}} by the <b>Zechstein</b> Sea. Smaller disturbances in the more recent epochs of earth history allowed the less dense <b>Zechstein</b> salts to flow together and force their way upwards from a great depth into the younger overlying rocks to a level near that of the present-day surface. Under the Kalkberg is a salt dome, which rises by one to two millimeters a year. The red cliffs of Heligoland or the Münsterdorfer Geestinsel are limestone, one of the few formations in Schleswig-Holstein which was not created by the ice ages.
