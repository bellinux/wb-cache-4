5|$|During the Burma Campaign in 1944–1945, the 3rd Commando Brigade {{participated in}} several coastal {{landings}} of the Southern Front offensive. These landings {{culminated in the}} battle of Hill 170 at Kangaw. Here Lieutenant George Knowland of No. 1 Commando was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The Commandos' victory in the 36-hour battle for Hill 170 cut off the escape of the 54th Japanese Division. Further amphibious landings by the 25th Indian Infantry Division and the overland advance of the 82nd (West Africa) Division made the Japanese position in the Arakan untenable. A general withdrawal was ordered to avoid the complete destruction of the Twenty-Eighth Japanese Army. The Commando brigade was then withdrawn to India in preparation for Operation <b>Zipper,</b> the planned invasion of Malaya. The <b>Zipper</b> landings were not needed due to the Japanese surrender so the brigade was sent to Hong Kong for policing duties instead.|$|E
5|$|Ten Freedom Summers was {{recorded}} at <b>Zipper</b> Hall in Los Angeles, where Smith performed live for three nights from November 4 to November 6, 2011. He played 19 pieces, accompanied by either his Golden Quartet, the nine-piece Southwest Chamber Music ensemble conducted by Jeff von der Schmidt, or both. Smith's quartet featured drummers Pheeroan akLaff and Susie Ibarra, pianist Anthony Davis, and bassist John Lindberg.|$|E
5000|$|Plastic-molded <b>zippers</b> are {{identical}} to metallic <b>zippers,</b> {{except that the}} teeth are plastic instead of metal. Metal <b>zippers</b> can be painted to match the surrounding fabric; plastic <b>zippers</b> {{can be made in}} any color of plastic. Plastic <b>zippers</b> mostly use polyacetal resin, though other thermoplastic polymers are used as well, such as polyethylene. Used most popularly for pencil cases, small plastic pouchs and other useful stationery.|$|R
50|$|Reduced Noise: The {{mechanical}} {{noise that}} is usually associated with metal <b>zippers</b> is considerably reduced {{with the use of}} plastic <b>zippers.</b> Because of the innate lubrication and low friction, the Delrin <b>zippers</b> slide up and down smoothly and quietly. Thus, reduced noise is another benefit of these high-quality <b>zippers.</b>|$|R

5|$|Film critic Ben <b>Zipper</b> {{believes}} that Kiarostami’s {{work as a}} landscape artist {{is evident in the}} composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout a number of his films. He points out that Kiarostami’s use of rural locations and remote settings is reminiscent of Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura.|$|E
5|$|Ten Freedom Summers is a four-disc box set by American trumpeter and {{composer}} Wadada Leo Smith. It {{was released on}} May 5, 2012, by Cuneiform Records. Smith wrote its compositions intermittently {{over the course of}} 34 years, beginning in 1977, before performing them live in November 2011 at the Colburn School's <b>Zipper</b> Hall in Los Angeles. He was accompanied by the nine-piece Southwest Chamber Music ensemble and his own jazz quartet, featuring drummers Pheeroan akLaff and Susie Ibarra, pianist Anthony Davis, and bassist John Lindberg.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking her yet, and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the <b>zipper</b> on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E
50|$|Though nylon coil <b>zippers</b> are a {{very popular}} choice for {{a large number of}} applications, the use of nylon is now being {{replaced}} with polyester. Polyester coil <b>zippers</b> are also becoming widespread nowadays. But nylon coil <b>zippers</b> still remain one of the most manufactured <b>zippers</b> all across the globe. They are made in various gauge sizes and colors. This makes them well-suited to several items that are used daily. There are other variations of these coil <b>zippers</b> too which are also used extensively according to their requirements.|$|R
50|$|Nylon <b>zippers</b> {{are highly}} {{flexible}} {{and are available}} {{in a wide range}} of sizes. The high compatibility of the coil <b>zippers</b> is the main attribute for their huge number of applications in fashion wear, canvas goods, and bags. These types of <b>zippers</b> are also the top choice for the outdoor and luggage industries. Nylon coil <b>zippers</b> are most commonly found in tents, suitcases, backpacks, and other camping apparels.|$|R

5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a <b>zipper,</b> either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, the {{battalion}} was alerted to begin preparations for operations in Borneo {{as part of}} the Borneo campaign. As well as preparing for airborne operations, {{the battalion}} also conducted amphibious training in late January and early February 1945 as part of a possible role in the amphibious landing at Balikpapan. The battalion was not used in this operation, however, due to a shortage of suitable aircraft. A few months later, the battalion was also warned to prepare for a mission to rescue thousands of Allied prisoners held by the Japanese at Sandakan in North Borneo. This operation, codenamed Operation Kingfisher, was controversially also cancelled {{due to a lack of}} aircraft, and the prisoners were subsequently killed by the Japanese in what subsequently became known as the Sandakan Death Marches. The disappointment of not being deployed to Borneo caused significant frustration within the battalion, with many soldiers requesting transfers to other infantry units such as Z Special Unit. Many of these requests were denied, however, as the battalion had been instructed to prepare to operate alongside British paratroopers in the planned liberation of Singapore that was to have taken place later in 1945 as part of Operations <b>Zipper</b> and Mailfist.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, as {{the joint}} battles of Meiktila and Mandalay were {{drawing to a}} close, a conference was held at Monywa in Burma, {{attended}} by senior Allied military figures including Admiral Lord Mountbatten, {{the commander in chief}} of the Allied South East Asia Command, and General William Slim, commander of Fourteenth Army. The object of the conference was to discuss future Allied strategy in South East Asia in the aftermath of Meiktila and Mandalay, including the reconquest of Burma and the retaking of Malaya and then Singapore. In order to secure these objectives however, Rangoon, the capital of Burma, would have to be captured before the onset of the monsoon rains, which would impede any Allied advance over land; the Allied Chiefs of Staff worked on the assumption that this would occur before June. After Rangoon had fallen, a force of between four and five divisions would be landed in Western Malaya in an operation code-named <b>Zipper,</b> which would itself be followed by Mailfist, the capture of Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Now {{that the}} war in Europe was over, plans were made to form an {{airborne}} corps comprising the 6th Airborne Division and 44th Indian Airborne Division for service against Japanese forces in the Far East. The corps would be used in operations to recapture Malaya and Singapore. The division's advance party, based partly on the 5th Parachute Brigade, arrived in India in July 1945. The brigade travelled ahead {{of the rest of the}} division as it had been intended to use them for Operation <b>Zipper,</b> an independent mission in Burma. They would have landed in Malaya, between Singapore and the Japanese forces in Burma. Reinforcements would then arrive by sea and attack northwards and southwards, while the brigade carried out another airborne landing on Singapore itself. However, following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed, and the remainder of the 6th Airborne Division were sent to Palestine. Instead of carrying out an airborne landing, the 5th Parachute Brigade travelled by sea, leaving Bombay on 9 September and arriving at Morib in Malaya on 17 September. Only the 7th and 12th Parachute battalions landed, and they re-embarked the next day to sail for Singapore as part of Operation Tiderace; they arrived on 21 September. The brigade, now part of XV Corps, became the island's garrison. In December the 23rd Indian Infantry Division was sent from Seremban to Java, and the brigade was moved to replace them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>zipper</b> is {{a popular}} device for {{temporarily}} joining two edges of fabric. Zippers are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago {{who was the first}} to invent, conceive of the idea, and to construct a workable <b>zipper.</b> Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of the <b>zipper</b> to be used on shoes. He also conceived the idea of the slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the <b>zipper.</b> Patents were issued to Judson for the <b>zipper</b> in 1891, 1894, and 1905.|$|E
25|$|A <b>zipper</b> {{storage bag}} is {{a plastic bag}} with a sealed or zipped opening that allows for {{transparent}} viewing of stored items inside the bag. Better known under the brand name and genericized trademark Ziploc, <b>zipper</b> storage bags are commonly used to hold perishable foods and snacks. <b>Zipper</b> storage bags were patented by Robert W. Vergobbi on May 18, 1954. However, {{they would not be}} introduced to consumers until 1968, when Dow Chemical introduced the Ziploc bags.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor {{attachment}} protein receptors (SNAREs) are evolutionarily conserved {{machines that}} couple their folding/assembly to membrane fusion. However, {{it is unclear}} how these processes are regulated and function. To determine these mechanisms, we characterized the folding energy and kinetics of four representative SNARE complexes at a single-molecule level using high-resolution optical tweezers. We found that all SNARE complexes assemble by the same step-wise <b>zippering</b> mechanism: slow N-terminal domain (NTD) association, a pause in a force-dependent half-zippered intermediate, and fast C-terminal domain (CTD) <b>zippering.</b> The energy release from CTD <b>zippering</b> differs for yeast (13 kBT) and neuronal SNARE complexes (27 kBT), and is concentrated at the C-terminal part of CTD <b>zippering.</b> Thus, SNARE complexes share a conserved <b>zippering</b> pathway and polarized energy release to efficiently drive membrane fusion, but generate different amounts of <b>zippering</b> energy to regulate fusion kinetics...|$|R

25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the <b>zipper</b> tapes alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the <b>zipper</b> requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the <b>zipper</b> to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the <b>zipper</b> when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|E
