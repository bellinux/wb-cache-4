25|$|The value zero plays {{a special}} role for many {{physical}} quantities. For some quantities, the <b>zero</b> <b>level</b> is naturally distinguished {{from all other}} levels, whereas for others it {{is more or less}} arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an absolute temperature (as measured in kelvins) zero is the lowest possible value (negative temperatures are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the freezing point of water. Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons, the <b>zero</b> <b>level</b> is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In physics, the zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may possess and is the energy of the ground state of the system.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} {{theoretical}} energy distribution are recognized: the normal-energy distribution (NED), which {{shows how the}} energy εn is distributed immediately after emission (i.e., immediately outside the tunneling barrier); and the total-energy distribution, which shows how the total energy ε is distributed. When the emitter Fermi level is used as the reference <b>zero</b> <b>level,</b> both ε and εn can be either positive or negative.|$|E
2500|$|Drain {{efficiency}} is {{the ratio of}} output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a field-effect transistor. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its <b>zero</b> <b>level</b> at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding. [...] In this case the RF <b>zero</b> <b>level</b> is near the DC rail and will swing both {{above and below the}} rail during operation.

2500|$|Design {{changes to}} make the {{instrument}} more sensitive, simpler to read, and easier to transport resulted in variations such as the basin, siphon, wheel, cistern, Fortin, multiple folded, stereometric, and balance barometers. Fitzroy barometers combine the standard mercury barometer with a thermometer, {{as well as a}} guide of how to interpret pressure changes. [...] Fortin barometers use a variable displacement mercury cistern, usually constructed with a thumbscrew pressing on a leather diaphragm bottom. [...] This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. [...] To use a Fortin barometer, the level of mercury is set to the <b>zero</b> <b>level</b> before the pressure is read on the column. [...] Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the mercury column to be forced {{to the top of the}} column for transport. [...] This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.|$|E
2500|$|Cnoidal waves can {{be derived}} {{directly}} from the inviscid, irrotational and incompressible flow equations, and {{expressed in terms of}} three invariants of the flow, as shown by [...] in their research on undular bores. In a frame of reference moving with the phase speed, in which reference frame the flow becomes a steady flow, the cnoidal wave solutions can directly be related to the mass flux, momentum flux and energy head of the flow. Following —using a stream function description of this incompressible flow—the horizontal and vertical components of the flow velocity are the spatial derivatives of the stream function Ψ(ξ,z): +zΨ and −ξΨ, in the ξ and z direction respectively (ξ=x−ct). The vertical coordinate z is positive in the upward direction, opposite to the direction of the gravitational acceleration, and the <b>zero</b> <b>level</b> of z is at the impermeable lower boundary of the fluid domain. While the free surface is at z=ζ(ξ); note that ζ is the local water depth, related to the surface elevation η(ξ) as ζ=h+η with h the mean water depth.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{the first}} example of gauge {{symmetry}} to be discovered was classical electromagnetism. A static electric field {{can be described in}} terms of an electric potential (voltage) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the <b>zero</b> <b>level</b> of the potential, or ground. But only differences in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a voltmeter must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset. If the potential [...] is a solution to Maxwell's equations then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential [...] is also a solution to Maxwell's equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation. Maxwell's equations have a gauge symmetry.|$|E

Each sensor had dual ranges of minus to plus 24 nT and 64 nT, with digitization resolutions of minus to plus 0.094 nT and 0.25 nT, respectively. <b>Zero</b> <b>level</b> drift was checked by periodic reorientation of the sensors until May 20, 1969, when the flipper mechanism failed.

Spacecraft interference was less than 0.125 nT. One vector measurement was obtained each 5.12 s.
