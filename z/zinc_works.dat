25|$|When he was 19, Wharton apprenticed with an {{accountant}} {{for two years}} and became proficient in business methods and bookkeeping. At 21, he partnered with his older brother Rodman to start a business manufacturing white lead. Wharton's chemistry mentor, Martin Boye, had developed a method to refine cottonseed oil and the Wharton brothers tried but failed to develop a profitable method to extract it. In 1849 Wharton started a business manufacturing bricks using a patented machine which pressed dry clay into forms. There was substantial competition in the brick business, which was affected by cyclical business swings, and after several trips to sell bricks and the brick-making machines, Wharton found the prospects for making good profits were dim. However, from the endeavor he gained valuable experience. In 1853, Wharton joined the Pennsylvania and Lehigh Zinc Company near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, first managing the mining operation and later the zinc oxide works. Wharton proved himself by negotiating a new charter for the works, and in the difficult financial environment of 1857–1858 he took over control of the <b>zinc</b> <b>works,</b> managing it carefully so that it turned a profit. In 1860 Wharton, after some challenging negotiations with the directors of the company, developed for Lehigh Zinc the first plant to manufacture metallic zinc in America. Looking into the next business cycle, he leased the plant for four years and eventually made a robust profit from the sale of metallic zinc, used in making brass, which picked up in the Civil War years.|$|E
2500|$|Wharton married Anna Corbit Lovering, {{a fellow}} Quaker {{and the younger}} sister of his brother Charles' wife, in 1854 in a Quaker ceremony. After living with Anna's family for several months the couple moved into a house {{belonging}} to his mother near 12th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia, but Anna often continued {{to stay with her}} parents while Joseph was out of town. She preferred a life of comfort but evidently did not wish to stifle his ambition. During this time Wharton lived a spartan life, boarding at a hotel and managing the <b>zinc</b> <b>works</b> in Bethlehem, and Anna cared for their first child Joanna at their home in Philadelphia. Although Joseph returned as often as possible and they communicated often by letter, they felt much stress during this period and their marriage suffered. Later, when Joseph was more secure in his job manufacturing zinc, Anna and Joanna came to live with him in Bethlehem, where they lived a happier life for two years, partaking in social events and exploring the local rivers and countryside. After Wharton sold his interest in zinc, they returned to Philadelphia, and although he often traveled to oversee his properties or develop business connections, he never again lived apart from the family. He purchased a country estate several miles north of Philadelphia, called [...] "Ontalauna", and bought a donkey for their three children, Joanna, Mary, and Anna, to ride along on horseback expeditions. Wharton often studied at night or played history games with the children.|$|E

50|$|Born March 5, 1835 in Altona, Hamburg, Matthiessen went on {{to attend}} {{university}} at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. It was here that he met Edward C.

After investigating several sites in the Northeast and Midwest of the country, they decided to set up their smelter {{on the banks of}} the Little Vermilion River, in LaSalle, IL.

50|$|The {{early years}} of Matthiessen and Hegeler <b>Zinc</b> <b>Works</b> were difficult, with the Civil War {{breaking}} out 2 years after the company's inception. A lack of demand for zinc very nearly ended the company, but troubles proved to be short lived. By 1862, a burgeoning arms industry injected much-needed business, greatly driving up demand for zinc products. Matthiessen would later add rolling mills, coal mines, machine shops, and the forerunner of Westclox to his diverse portfolio. Matthiessen served as the Mayor of LaSalle, IL between 1887-1897, elected to five consecutive terms.|$|E
