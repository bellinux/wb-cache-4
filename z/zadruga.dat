25|$|The peasants {{lived in}} rural {{communities}} known as <b>zadruga</b> and had collective responsibility. The majority of the peasantry were personally free under the direct rule of the central administration and the legislation introduced following the adoption of Christianity regulated their relations. The number of personally dependent peasants bound to nobility or ecclesiastical estates increased since the 10th century.|$|E
25|$|Following his mother's death, Kočić and his siblings, Milica and Ilija, {{were sent}} {{to live with their}} {{extended}} family in a peasant <b>zadruga.</b> Each member of the <b>zadruga</b> was assigned a particular role. Kočić was tasked with herding livestock. At the time, 90 percent of Bosnia's population was illiterate and storytelling took on a predominantly oral character, as exemplified by the tradition of the gusle, a one-stringed instrument used to accompany the recitation of epic poetry, which was the primary form of entertainment in Serb peasant communities. Kočić remained illiterate until the age of 11, when he was dispatched to Gomionica, where his father had since become abbot, to receive basic schooling. Kočić's stay at the monastery, during which he was taught Serbian history and became acquainted with Serbian tradition and lore, left an indelible impression on him, and was to influence his future writing. In 1888, around the time Kočić arrived at Gomionica, his father was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police for leading a demonstration against Crown Prince Rudolph during a state visit to Banja Luka, and sentenced to seven months' imprisonment.|$|E

40|$|Decisions of Serbian Court of Cassation {{regarding}} preserving so - called zadrugas (extended families, {{common among}} South Slavs) are {{subject of this}} paper. Although market economy and prevailing private property are {{in sharp contrast to}} nontransferable estate and collective character of <b>zadruga's</b> ownership, yet in second half of 19 th century patriarchal families had many advocates. Therefore, verdicts passed with aim to stop divisions of zadrugas and fragmentation of <b>zadruga's</b> property are scrutinized and critically analyzed. Namely, after enaction of Serbian Civil Code in 1844 divisions of zadrugas became increasingly common. Separation of traditional rural families had destructive impact on material status of former <b>zadruga's</b> members, such as excessive indebting and, as a result of overindebtedness, rapid pauperization and impoverishment of villagers. For that reason, many attempts to diminish widespread fragmentation of <b>zadruga's</b> estate and decrease frequency of dissolution of extended families were made in judicial practice. Those measures undertaken in practice of Serbian Court of Cassation are examined in this paper. Author also indicates in which aspects judicial practice regarding preservation of zadrugas was uniform...|$|R

2500|$|The medieval {{period in}} Bosnia lasted until the {{invasion}} of Ottoman Empire. The social organization of Bosnia of that time developed into a system known as <b>Zadruga.</b> In <b>Zadruga,</b> the community was organized such that a few families with common interests would live closely together in housing clusters. The leaders of the community were selected according to their age and high ethical standards. [...] The <b>Zadruga</b> system was primarily found a rural, agrarian communities, greatly dependent on natural resources. [...] As the community grew, segments of families would collectively move to another area forming a new cluster or a village. [...] The continuing links between these related clusters stimulated both trade and economy. [...] Individual families lived together in houses known as Dinaric houses. [...] These were simple structures build of natural materials (usually timber and wickerwork). Interior space was organized around the hearth in a central room with separate private quarters for men and women.|$|E

50|$|Because the <b>zadruga</b> {{was based}} on a patrilocal system, when a girl married, she left her parents' <b>zadruga</b> and joined that of her husband. Within the <b>zadruga,</b> all of the family members worked to ensure that the needs of every other member were met.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zadruga</b> {{eventually}} {{went into}} decline {{beginning in the}} late 19th century, as the largest started to become unmanageable and broke into smaller zadrugas or formed villages. However, the <b>zadruga</b> system continues to color life in the Balkans; the typically intense concern for family found among South Slavs even today is partly due to centuries of living in the <b>zadruga</b> system. Many modern-day villages in the Balkans have their roots in a <b>zadruga,</b> a large number of them carrying the name of the one that founded them.|$|E
