40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> {{is widely}} used in Italian rabbit farms to control both Epizootic Rabbit Enteropathy (ERE) and clostridiosis, and field results {{demonstrate}} useful activity. Nevertheless, data regarding the in vitro efficacy of <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> against clostridia of rabbit origin are not available. In this study, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> were evaluated in 123 C. perfringens strains isolated from rabbits in Italian fattening units. The agar dilution method was performed in Brucella Agar supplemented with laked sheep blood, haemin and vitamin K 1, as recommended in NCCLS document M 11 -A 6. Most strains (94. 3 %) had low MIC values (≤ 0. 5 µg/ml), and a few strains (4 %) were inhibited by a concentration of 1 µg/ml. Two isolates (1. 6 %) had a MIC value of 16 µg/ml. The MIC values of ATCC reference strains showed a good fit between each batch. MIC required to inhibit the 90 % of organisms was 0. 5 µg/ml {{and the presence of}} only two strains with MIC= 16 µg/ml revealed the susceptibility to <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> of Italian isolates of C. perfringens from rabbit and the absence of acquired resistance.

40|$|BackgroundAcquired {{yellow hair}} (xanthotrichosis) {{can result from}} the {{deposition}} of pigmented compounds on the hair shaft or from chemical modification of hair pigment and protein molecules. PurposeA white-haired 77 -year-old woman who developed xanthotrichosis of her scalp hair following the sequential application of <b>bacitracin</b> <b>zinc</b> ointment and selenium sulfide 2. 5 % lotion is described and the causes of yellow hair discoloration are reviewed. Materials and methodsThe clinical features {{of a woman with}} acquired yellow hair discoloration are presented. Using PubMed and Google Scholar, the following terms were searched and relevant citations were assessed: <b>bacitracin</b> <b>zinc,</b> hair discoloration, selenium sulfide, xanthotrichosis, and yellow hair. ResultsYellow hair was observed on the scalp in areas treated with the following regimen: prior to bedtime, several areas of the scalp were treated with a single application of <b>bacitracin</b> <b>zinc</b> ointment. The next morning, selenium sulfide 2. 5 % lotion was applied and then rinsed from the scalp during showering. Yellow hair discoloration was apparent in co-treated areas immediately following rinsing; the discoloration gradually faded over 2 - 5 days with regular shampooing.

40|$|Genetic {{development}} of broiler is growing rapidly. Nowadays, broiler is slaughtered at {{the ages of}} 29 days rather than 35 days. Rapid growth is usually coupled by an immune deficiencies of broiler, therefore such feed additives as antibiotics is necessary to promote growth and improve endurance of the broiler. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the amount of residue of <b>Zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> antibiotics in the thigh meat, breast meat, liver, and kidney of the broilers; and to determine the withdrawal time between the discontinuation of the antibiotic of the <b>Zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> and the slaughter of the broiler to eliminate or to reduce that residue so that the product of the broiler was safe for human consumption. The research was conducted at Sekolah Tinggi Penyuluhan Pertanian (STPP) Gowa. The broilers used in this study was strain Cobb SR 707, aged 29 days (unsexed), and were obtained from the local broiler farm. The ration containing the antibiotics of the <b>Zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> was terminated at day 0, 3, 6, and 9 before slaughtering. The bacteria used to test the dilution sensitivity was Staphylococcus aureus (105 - 108 colony mL- 1).

40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to reveal the effect of watercress oil on skin burns in rabbits. Twenty-four male rabbits were used in this study and divided into eight groups. Four groups were burned by concentrated hydrochloric acid and the others by a hot glass rod (80 °C) for three times. These groups were divided into two controls: two treated by the antibiotic Baneocin (<b>Bacitracin</b> <b>zinc</b> 250 IU and Neomycin 5000 IU); two treated by watercress oil and two treated by watercress and Nigella sativa oils, 1 : 1). The epithilialization, the contracting ability of wounds, the closure time and the time necessary for hair to grow were recorded in all groups. A histological examination was processed to test the peripheries of wounds; their thickness, their growth, the hair follicle repairing and the inflammatory cell response. Watercress acted as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and initiated the epithelialization from the peripheries of the wounds. The contracting ability and closure time in both antibiotic and watercress groups were significantly different from those of controls. It was concluded that watercress oil could be an effective therapy in healing skin burns in rabbits, whatever the cause of the burn may be. However, watercress oil and Nigella sativa oils (1 : 1) had no effect on healing these types of burns under these circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Unravelling the {{mechanisms}} of how antibiotics influence growth performance through changes in gut microbiota {{can lead to the}} identification of highly productive microbiota in animal production. Here we investigated the effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> and avilamycin on growth performance and caecal microbiota in chickens and analysed associations between individual bacteria and growth performance. Two trials were undertaken; each used 96 individually caged 15 -day-old Cobb broilers. Trial 1 had a control group (n = 48) and a <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> (50 ppm) treatment group (n = 48). Trial 2 had a control group (n = 48) and an avilamycin (15 ppm) treatment group (n = 48). Chicken growth performance was evaluated over a 10 -day period, and caecal microbiota was characterised by sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene amplicons. Avilamycin produced no effect on growth performance and exhibited little significant disturbance of the microbiota structure. However, <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> reduced the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in treated birds, changed the composition and increased the diversity of their caecal microbiota by reducing dominant species. Avilamycin only produced minor reductions in the abundance of two microbial taxa, whereas <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> produced relatively large shifts in a number of taxa, primarily Lactobacillus species. Also, a number of phylotypes closely related to lactobacilli species were positively or negatively correlated with FCR values, suggesting contrasting effects of Lactobacillus spp. on chicken growth performance.

50|$|The {{three main}} active {{ingredients}} in Neosporin are neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate, and <b>bacitracin</b> <b>zinc.</b> One {{of the main}} components of Neosporin is Neomycin Sulfate which is a type of antibiotic discovered in 1949 by microbiologist Selman Waksman at Rutgers University. Neomycin is a type of aminoglycoside antibiotic that fights against Gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Neomycin is often used in order to prevent risk of bacterial infections. Aminoglycosides such as Neomycin are known for their ability to bind to RNA and to change the proteins being produced by the bacteria with little to no effect on DNA. Neomycin kills bacteria as a result of irregular protein production in the bacterial cell. When the cell can no longer produce the correct proteins, its membrane will be damaged. Like Neomycin, Polymyxin B is an antibiotic. Polymyxin B alters the bacterial cell wall causing the cellular insides to leak out resulting in cell death. This antibiotic also interferes with the production of tetrahydrofolic acid by altering an enzyme. Without the tetrahydrofolic acid, the bacteria can no longer produce proteins necessary for survival. Pramoxine is used to temporarily reduce pain from burns, insect bites, and minor cuts. It works like an anesthetic by decreasing the permeability of neuron membranes. This blocks the ability of pain neurons in the area to send signals which results in numbness.|$|R

Eighty (Danbread x Agroceres) pigs were used, that is, 40 males and 40 females, with initial weight of 7. 1 ± 0. 0175 kg. A randomized block design was used with four treatments and five replicates: 1 - Control; 2 - Prebiotic; 3 - Probiotic; 4 - Antibiotic. The variables evaluated were average daily gain (ADG), daily feed intake (DFI), feed conversion (FC) fecal consistency and leukocyte count. At 43 days of age, the animals presented the same weight gain   (P> 0. 05); however, there was increased intake of the diet containing prebiotic (P> 0. 05), and feed conversion was better for control diet (P 0. 05), daily feed intake (P> 0. 05) and feed conversion (P> 0. 05), and also no differences in fecal consistency (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to examine shifts in the {{composition}} of the bacterial population in the intestinal tracts (ITs) of weaning piglets by antibiotic treatment using high-throughput sequencing. Methods Sixty 28 -d-old weaning piglets were randomly divided into two treatment groups. The Control group was treated with a basal diet without antibiotics. The Antibiotic group’s basal diet contained colistin sulfate at a concentration of 20 g per ton and <b>bacitracin</b> <b>zinc</b> at a concentration of 40 g per ton. All of the pigs were fed for 28 days. Then, three pigs were killed, and the luminal contents of the jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon were collected for DNA extraction and high-throughput sequencing. Results The results showed that the average daily weight gain of the antibiotic group was significantly greater (p 0. 05), than the control group. A total of 812, 607 valid reads were generated. Thirty-eight operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were found in all of the samples were defined as core OTUs. Twenty-one phyla were identified, and approximately 90 % of the classifiable sequences belonged to the phylum Firmicutes. Forty-two classes were identified. Of the 232 genera identified, nine genera were identified as the core gut microbiome because they existed in all of the tracts. The proportion of the nine core bacteria varied at the different tract sites. A heat map was used to understand how the numbers of the abundant genera shifted between the two treatment groups. Conclusion At different tract sites the relative abundance of gut microbiota was different.

In this study SSCs in pre-pubescent animals were infected in vivo with recombinant lentiviruses expressing EGFP-f and mated with normal females. All male pre-founder mice produced transgenic pups with an overall success rate of over 60 %. The transgene was heritable and the pre-founder mice could be used in multiple mating experiments. This protocol could be extended to perform over-expression/knockdown screens in vivo using bar-coded lentiviruses, thus permitting the design of genetic screens in the mouse. Further, this technology could be adapted to other laboratory animals resulting in the generation of model systems that closely approximate human development and disease. ### Introduction The generation of genetically modified mice has spurred great advances in our understanding of various aspects of growth and development. Multiple technologies have used either injection into a one celled embryo followed by implantation into a pseudo pregnant mother 1, or used stem cell aggregation techniques to generate either knockout 2 or knockdown mice 3. These experiments are expensive, labor-intensive, time-consuming and require several female donors. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are responsible for the production of spermatozoa 4 and are an appropriate target for germline modification 5. Nagano et. al. have generated transgenic mice by infecting SSCs in vitro with recombinant retroviruses followed by xenogenic transplantation of the cells into the testes of a male mouse 6. In some cases the recipient mice were unreceptive to the donor SSCs 6 and the overall success rate was rather low. Similarly, in vivo transduction of SSCs with retroviral constructs carrying a lacZ gene, resulted in a poor success rate of 2. 8 % 7. The low success rates post implantation, however precluded these from replacing embryonic injection. Similar experiments using lentiviruses, resulted in better success rates 8. Other methods employed in the recent past have infected fertilized eggs in vitro with recombinant lentiviruses, followed by implantation of the embryo into pseudopregnant females 9. While these methods provided better success rates, the implantation experiments are technically cumbersome and require several female donors. A recent report has also described the generation of recombinant spermatozoa in organotypic cultures {{that could be used to}} generate transgenic mice 10. While this method generated transgenic animals at high efficiency, generating organotypic cultures is not trivial and is not performed in most laboratories. Recently, a report has described the generation of transgenic mice after electroporation of DNA into the testes of an adult mouse. 16 of 17 fore founder mice generated in that study were able to sire transgenic pups. However, the report did not mention the rate of transgenesis in the pups 11. This report describes a new cost effective, faster technique with a high success rate for generation of transgenic mice by in vivo viral transduction of the EGFP-f transgene into undifferentiated spermatogonia. These fore-founder male mice were mated with wild type female mice to generate transgenic pups. The rate of transgenesis was greater than 60 % and the transgene was inherited in the germ line. This rapid protocol for the generation of transgenic mice could be used to design and perform over-expressor/knockdown screens in the whole animal, thus enhancing our knowledge of disease and development. ### Reagents 1. Animals - Any strain of mice can be used. Thirty days old males are most suitable for better outcome of this protocol with the advantage that a large proportion of the testicular germ cells can be easily accessed from the interstitial side of the testis in this age group of mice. Routinely, we use 28 - 32 days old mice Crl:CFW(SW) weighing about 20 - 25 g. The same protocol may be tried with minor modifications for animals of different age and species. - Animal Housing conditions - The animals were housed in a controlled environment with the temperature and relative humidity being maintained at 23 ± 20 C and 40 - 70 % respectively and a day night cycle of 12 hrs each (7 : 00 to 19 : 00 light; 19 : 00 to 7 : 00 dark). The animals were received an autoclaved balanced diet prepared in-house as per the standard formula and sterile water ad libitum. Mice were housed in the Individually Ventilated Cage (IVC) system (M/S Citizen, India) provided with autoclaved rice husk bedding material available locally. - Lentiviruses - Lentivirus expressing gene of interest, we have used pLKO. 1 EGFP-f 12. The titer of lentivirus can vary from 105 to 106 TU/ml. - Anesthesia - For the purpose of anesthesia, use a mixture of Ketamine hydrochloride and Xylazine hydrochloride; we use stock solutions of 50 mg/ml and 20 mg/ml respectively. Mix these solutions and dilute with normal saline to get a final concentration of 160 µg of Xylazine hydrochloride and 900 µg of Ketamine hydrochloride per 100 µl. - Other Chemicals - Trypan blue dye (0. 03 %), Tris-HCl (pH 8. 0, 1 M), Sodium dodecyl sulphate (10 % SDS), Sodium Chloride (NaCl), EDTA, Proteinase K, Paraformaldehyde, Glycerol, Ampicillin (sodium salt) and Kanamycin monosulphate can be obtained from Sigma Chem. Co. (USA). dNTPs can be obtained from Promega (USA). Taq Polymerase and Molecular weight markers can be obtained from New England Biolabs (USA). ### Equipment 1. Anesthesia unit - Mobile Laboratory Animal Anesthesia System (LAAS), Model No. 901807, VetEquip, Inc., Pleasanton, California, USA - Light Source - Fibre optics illuminator of Stereomicroscope SMZ U, Nikon Corp., Tokyo Japan - PCR machine - Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC- 200 with heated lid (MJ Research, Minnesota, USA). - Spectrophotometer - UV- 2450, UV-VIS Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). ### Procedure **Preparation of high-titer pLKO. 1 EGFP-f Puro lentiviral vectors**. 1. LVs are produced as described previously 12. At the final step, the viruses are resuspended in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffer Saline (DPBS) solution. The biological titer of lentiviral vectors is determined by the infection of HEK- 293 cells with different virus dilutions. Usually a minimum titer of 105 – 106 TU/ml is required for efficient infection. - TIP: It is important that the viral particles are stored in small aliquots at – 80 ºC. The virus suspension can be stored at - 80 ºC for at least 1 year without significant change in virus titer. Do not re-freeze virus solution after thawing. The virus solution can be stored at 4 ºC if an experiment is planned within a week. - Caution: Lentiviruses are capable of infecting human cells including non-dividing cells through contact. Gloves and protective clothing are required for working with lentiviruses. Extra caution should be taken to avoid spill and splash when handling lentivirus-containing material. Lentiviruses are labile and easily decontaminated by ethanol, detergent or bleach. Working area should be decontaminated with ethanol or bleach after any spill and after any experiments involving virus handling are completed. **In vivo transduction of the desired gene in the testis** CAUTIONS All animal studies should be performed with relevant institutional guidelines, permissions and regulations. Handle animals with institutionally approved ethical procedures and avoid stress to the animals. All steps described below should be performed in a sterile laminar flow hood. 1. Inject 28 day old Crl:CFW(SW) male mice intra-peritoneally with Avertin (Sigma) (2, 2 tribromo-ethanol and t-amyl alcohol) at a dose of 0. 015 ml/gm body weight to. - CRITICAL STEP Care should be taken to prevent an overdose of the anesthetic as the animal may die due to an excess of the anesthetic [...] - Remove hair from inguinal area of mice and clean the area with betadiene. Anterior to the penis, make a single midline cutaneous incision of approx. 1 - 1. 5 cm length using sterile surgical scissors under aseptic conditions. A central incision is the preferred surgical approach to get adequate access to both testes with a single cut. - After making the incision in the muscles, pull the dorsal fat pad associated with the testis from the lower side of the abdominal cavity with the help of curved forcep (Fig. 1 b). - Use a 30 gauge needle to puncture outer covering of the testicular tissue to facilitate the insertion of syringe containing LV. Deliver solution of LV containing Trypan blue dye (0. 04 %) in the inter-tubular spaces of testis through 30 gauge syringe (Fig. 1 b). Trypan blue is added for monitoring the accuracy of the delivery in the testis. (Fig. 1 b). - Inject about 10 - 20 µl of lentiviral suspension per testis. - CRITICAL STEP After each injection, wait for 30 seconds before pulling out the syringe to prevent the back flow of the LV solution. The total volume of viral suspension injected into the testis should not be more than 20 µl. Injecting large volumes of lentivirus may rupture the testis as might injecting the testis more than once [...] - Replace the injected and surgically remove the contra-lateral testis by hemicastration. Both the internal and external wounds should be closed using sutures. - CAUTION During hemicastration, do not remove fat or any other tissue along with the testis. - CRITICAL STEP Tie the blood vessels with sterile nylon thread before hemicastration to prevent bleeding. Try to be careful when you handle the testis, so as to not crush it. - Apply Neosporin (Neomycin and Polymyxin B sulphates and <b>Bacitracin</b> <b>zinc</b> powder; Glaxo Smith Kline, India) at the site of sutures and place the mice on a thermal plate for about 1 h for easy revival of the animal from anesthesia. **Establishment of transgenic|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Day-old cockerels {{were used}} to examine the growth {{responses}} obtained when 50 ppm procaine penicillin, 25 ppm <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin,</b> or 20 ppm nitrovin were administered in a wheat-based diet. The birds were fed ad libitum from one day of age a plain or supplemented diet in a series of 10, 21, and 56 -day tests conducted between 1971 and 1974. Growth responses, measured by improvement in the live weight gain and feed conversion, were obtained with each treatment, consistently over each annual period. The penicillin and <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> gave maximal differences in live weight gain compared with the controls before 14 days of age and, possibly, before 7 days of age, whereas the maximal response to treatment with nitrovin occurred after 14 days of age. 1980 Poultry Science 59 : 412 - 41...|$|E
30|$|Ruminococcus spp. and Oscillospira spp. {{have been}} {{detected}} in the rumen of several herbivores such as cattle, sheep and reindeer (Mackie et al. 2003). The members of the two genera {{are involved in the}} degradation of cellulose, the intestinal fermentation and the promotion of host growth (Gulino et al. 2013; Tims et al. 2013), and Oscillospira spp. have been demonstrated to be associated with fermentation caecum of rex rabbits (Zeng et al. 2015). In our experiment, the addition of antibiotics increased the proportions of Ruminococcus spp. and Oscillospira spp. Especially, colistin sulfate and <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> significantly increased R. albus. According to the results we assumed that colistin sulfate and <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> were more likely to accelerate the caecum fermentation, improve feed conversion and promote energy absorption of rex rabbits than chlortetracycline. We speculated that this change may improve the growth of rex rabbits.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract A {{microbiological}} {{screening method}} (three-plate) for detection of the antimicrobial growth promoters tylosin, spiramycin, virginiamycin, <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> and avoparcin in animal feed {{has been developed}} and validated successfully. A collaborative study involving 18 laboratories receiving 172 samples was carried out to verify the performance characteristics. The detection level for tylosin/virginiamycin/spiramycin, expressed in microbiological activity, was 1 mg kg - 1 (false positives 2 %, false negatives 3, 0, and 6 % respectively). Avoparcin could be detected at 1 mg/kg in feed in general (false positives 2 %, false negatives 0 %). However, in calf feed, the sensitivity is lower. The percentage of false negatives {{was found to be}} 12 %, 7 %, 0 % at 1, 3 and 5 mg kg- 1 respectively (false positives 4 %). Limit of detection for <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> was 3 - 5 mg kg- 1 (false positives 5 - 10 %, false negatives 77 % at 1 mg kg- 1, 45 % at 2 mg kg- 1, 12 % at 3 mg kg- 1 and 4 % at 5 mg kg- 1. The method allowed for distinction between the groups of antibiotics: avoparcin/zinc bacitracin vs. tylosin/virginiamycin/spiramycin. This definitely gives an added value to the method in the frame of a follow up of positive screening results by post screening and confirmatory analysis.

30|$|The phylum Proteobacteria is {{unstable}} {{over time}} {{among the four}} main phyla (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria) in the gut microbiota {{and is likely to}} influenced by environment, such as diets (Faith et al. 2013). Proteobacteria include many pathogenic bacteria, for instance, diarrhea caused by Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Vibrio cholera etc. Previous studies endorse the concept that a bloom of Proteobacteria in the gut reflects dysbiosis or an unstable gut microbial community structure or a potential diagnostic criterion for disease (Shin et al. 2015). The decreased of Proteobacteria number may induced the amount of pathogenic bacteria in the body and the host morbidity to reduce (Faith et al. 2013), which was good for the animals’ health. Moreover, our studies showed that <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> significantly reduced rex rabbits caecum Proteobacteria. It can be seen that <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> may play a good role in the disease prevention and be superior to chlortetracycline and colistin sulfate.|$|E
30|$|Lactobacillus spp. are Gram-positive facultative {{anaerobic}} bacteria that grow better in richly nutritious environment. They are important probiotics that {{play an important}} role in the intestinal inflammation and the regulation of immune function, and they are widely used in animal production to prevent disease and improve digestion rate. Rodriguez and Nadra reported (Rodriguez and Nadra 1995), Lactobacillus spp. can cause low pH environments through the secretion of organic acid in the animal body, and can also secrete hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, butanedione to prevent and inhibit harmful bacterial invasion and colonization. Meanwhile they have a certain role in maintaining intestinal flora balance. Colistin sulfate has a strong inhibitory effect on Gram-negative bacteria (Velkov et al. 2010) and <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> has a strong inhibitory effect on Gram-positive bacteria (Injac et al. 2008), which may be one of the reasons that colistin sulfate significantly increased and <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> significantly decreased Lactobacillus spp. Lactobacillus spp. significantly increased in C group samples suggested that the antibiotic may promote rex rabbits towards a healthier growth, and it also showed that colistin sulfate may inhibit pathogenic bacteria invasion and colonization plays a certain role. A previous study showed that antibiotic treatment dramatically reduced the abundance of Lactobacillus spp. in the obese (ob/ob) mice (Cani et al. 2008), so <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> was probably positively correlated with the growth of rex rabbit’s body weight. However, relevant information in this area is very limited and further study is still needed to determine the antibiotics through regulating intestinal microflora to improve rabbit weight.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the effect of the cereal type in the diet on the susceptibility for Salmonella Enteritidis in broilers. In the first experiment, 40 newly hatched broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 4 different experimental treatment groups. Two treatment groups were fed a maize-soybean-based diet, of which one contained 100 mg/kg of the antibiotic growth promoter <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin.</b> The 2 other treatment groups were fed a wheat/rye-soybean-based diet, of which one was supplemented with 100 mg/kg of <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin.</b> The broilers were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis at d 11 and killed at d 15. When the nonantibiotic-and the antibiotic-treated birds were pooled, the Salmonella colonization in the spleen and ceca of the birds fed a maize-based diet was significantly lower in comparison to colonization of spleen and ceca in the wheat/rye groups. <b>Zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> did not affect Salmonella colonization. In a second experiment, which was a modified repetition of the first experiment, 120 newly hatched broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 2 experimental treatments. They were fed a maize-soybean or a wheat/rye-soybean based diet, inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis at d 11, and killed at d 15. A significantly lower Salmonella colonization was observed in the spleen, liver, and ceca of broilers given a maize-based diet in comparison to those given a wheat/rye-based diet. These data show that the cereal type in broiler feed can affect Salmonella colonization probably due to changes in intestinal health of the birds. Hence, altering the diet composition can be regarded as a simple tool to supplement other control measures against Salmonella in broilers...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} yeast {{cell wall}} extract derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Actigen(®)) has been {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} in-feed antibiotics. This experiment was conducted to investigate the efficacy of yeast cell extract as an alternative to <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> or salinomycin using a necrotic enteritis challenge model. A feeding study was conducted using 480 -day-old male Ross 308 chicks assigned to 48 floor pens. A 2 × 4 factorial arrangement of treatments was employed. The factors were: challenge (- or +) and feed additive (control, <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> at 100 / 50 mg/kg, yeast cell wall extract at 400 / 800 / 200 mg/kg, or salinomycin at 60 mg/kg in starter, grower, and finisher, respectively). Diets based on wheat, sorghum, soybean meal, meat and bone meal, and canola meal were formulated according to the Ross 308 nutrient specifications. Birds were challenged using a previously established protocol (attenuated Eimeria spp oocysts) on d 9 and 10 (8) to 10 (9) Clostridium perfringens (type A strain EHE-NE 18) on d 14 and 15). Challenged and unchallenged birds were partitioned to avoid cross contamination. Challenged birds had lower weight gain, feed intake and livability compared to unchallenged birds on d 24 and d 35 (P < 0. 05). Birds given <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin,</b> yeast cell wall extract, or salinomycin had improved weight gain and livability when compared to control birds given no additives. Challenge × additive interactions were observed for feed intake and weight gain on d 24 and d 35 (P < 0. 01). The additives all had a greater positive impact on feed intake, weight gain, and livability in challenged than unchallenged birds. All challenged birds showed higher necrotic enteritis lesion scores in the small intestine sections when compared to unchallenged birds (P < 0. 01). Birds fed yeast cell wall extract exhibited increased villus height, decreased crypt depth, and increased villus:crypt ratio when challenged. Yeast cell wall extract, <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin,</b> and salinomycin were effective in preventing performance decline from necrotic enteritis in the current study.

30|$|Subtherapeutic of {{antibiotics}} used as additives in livestock diets may shape {{a more complex}} intestinal microorganism and even accelerate the maturation of gut microflora structure. Our study found alpha diversity indices that the reflected antibiotics can improve the richness and diversity of rex rabbits caecum microorganism. While this was contradicted with the general view about antibiotics causing a reduction in bacterial diversity (Dubourg et al. 2014), Peng and Zeng et al. (2016) had found that antibiotics could increase the giant pandas faeces bacterial communities using PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technology analysis, which were consistent with our results. Furthermore, our experiments in represented C group had got a higher Observed species and Chao 1, which were suggested that chlortetracycline than colistin sulfate and <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> {{was more likely to}} increased rex rabbits caecum flora abundance. The results of beta diversity analysis indicated that B and C groups had a similarity caecum bacteria structure. Furthermore, they were different from B and S, and B and Z groups samples, suggested that the effect of colistin sulfate and <b>zinc</b> <b>bacitracin</b> on rex rabbits caecum microflora were greater than chlortetracycline, which was probably due to the high levels of chlortetracycline resistance.|$|E

30|$|Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia are {{associated}} with inflammatory immune regulation and the gut barrier (Kim et al. 2013; Furet et al. 2010; Louis and Flint 2007; Everard et al. 2013; Hippe et al. 2014). Faecalibacterium prausnitzii {{is one of the}} most abundant symbiotic anaerobic bacteria in GI tract and it is named after one of the main butyrate producers (Louis and Flint 2007). Butyrate may affect inflammatory process through the regulation of inflammatory genes (Andoh et al. 1999; Place et al. 2005). Akkermansia muciniphila is a Gram-negative mucin-degrading bacterium (Derrien et al. 2008). Akkermansia are known to feed on mucus and may indicate inflammatory processes (Everard et al. 2013). Furthermore, it has a positive correlation between A. muciniphila and health, and induced A. muciniphila expansion leds to metabolism improvement (Dao et al. 2016). Our study showed that F. Prausnitzii (B: 0.072  %, C: 0.058  %, S: 0.174  %, Z: 0.171  %) and A. Muciniphila (B: 0.071  %, C: 0.068  %, S: 1.16  %, Z: 0.066  %) increased through the addition of colistin sulfate in diets. F.
