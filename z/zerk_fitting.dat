5000|$|A grease fitting, grease nipple, <b>Zerk</b> <b>fitting,</b> or Alemite fitting is a {{metal fitting}} used in {{mechanical}} systems to feed lubricants, usually lubricating grease, into a bearing under moderate to high pressure using a grease gun.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patent for}} the <b>Zerk</b> <b>fitting</b> was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the {{assignee}} was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation (thus the eponymous {{names for the}} fittings). Alemite was already marketing ball check valves to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for OEM installations and for aftermarket upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock grease cups. But Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these grease fittings.|$|E

5000|$|Before <b>Zerk</b> <b>fittings</b> existed, {{bearings}} were lubricated {{in various}} other ways that {{tended to be}} more maintenance-intensive and often provided less effective lubrication. For example, a typical machinery bearing of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a plain bearing with a cross-drilled hole to receive oil or grease, with no clever fitting at its mouth, or at best a cap or cup. Often lubricant was delivered under no more pressure than gravity or a finger push might provide. For example, oil was gravity-fed into the hole, or grease was pushed in. Grease guns to feed the grease with higher pressure existed, but their pre-Zerk fittings were not as good for making clean, sealed contact easily, and they were less widely used than today.|$|R
