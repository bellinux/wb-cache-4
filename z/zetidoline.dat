50|$|Piquindone (Ro 22-1319) is an {{atypical}} antipsychotic with a tricyclic {{structure that}} {{was developed in the}} 1980s but was never marketed. It acts as a selective D2 receptor antagonist, though based on its effects profile its selectivity may be considered controversial. Unlike most other D2 receptor ligands, piquindone displays Na2+-dependent binding, a property it shares with tropapride, <b>zetidoline,</b> and metoclopramide.|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of experimental and theoretical methods {{were used to}} investigate the stereoelectronic structure of <b>zetidoline,</b> a dopamine D 2 receptor antagonist showing Na+-dependent binding. The solid-state conformation of <b>zetidoline</b> is characterized by synplanarity (coplanarity of the two rings with the chloro substituent and the carbonyl group on the same side). The side chain in the crystal adopts a folded conformation which places the azetidine nitrogen atom at about 8 A {{from the center of}} the aromatic ring. Quantum mechanical calculations indicate the synperiplanar and antiperiplanar conformations of the ring system to be of approximately equal energies. The molecular electrostatic potential of <b>zetidoline</b> in a nearly extended conformation shows a remarkable similarity with that of orthopramides (e. g. metoclopramide) and indolones (e. g. piquindone), i. e. two groups of drugs displaying the same D 2 selectivity and Na+-dependent binding. We postulate that the close stereoelectronic similarity between <b>zetidoline,</b> orthopramides, and indolones accounts for their identical mechanism of action in the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>zetidoline,</b> a new neuroleptic, in the rat {{and the dog}} {{has been}} studied. From the urine of rats and dogs given 5 mgI kg of [2 - 1 C] <b>zetidoline</b> orally, unchanged drug and five metabolites were isolated and the structures of four of them assigned by physi-cochemical analysis. They are: metabolite B, 4 ’-hydroxy- 3 ’-chloro-phenyl zetidoline; metabolfte D, <b>zetidoline</b> without the aryl group; metabolite E, the 6 ’-hydroxy- 4 ’-i-o-glucuronide of metabolite B, and metabolite F, the 4 ’-fl-D-glucuronide of metabolite B. The plasma levels of <b>zetidoline</b> and its metabolites after iv administration show that the drug is rapidly excreted and/or metabolized In both animal species. The plasma radioactivity in the dog consists mainly of the pharmacologically active (neuroleptic) metabolfte B, whereas in the rat it consists of the more polar metabolites. After oral administration, elimination in both species occurs mostly via the kidneys. In the dog, within a 24 -hr period, 6. 2 ± 0. 4 % of the dose is accounted for a...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} found that dopaminergic {{transmission}} could be involved in some aspects of anxiety. The present study aims to explore this hypothesis further, using specific DA 1 (SKF 38393) and DA 2 (bromocriptine) agonists or DA 1 (SCH 23390), and DA 2 (<b>zetidoline)</b> antagonists in the open-field test. The results confirm previous studies indicating that DA 1 and DA 2 agonists predominantly increase locomotor activity, while DA 1 and DA 2 antagonists predominantly decrease it. However, at low doses, the four drugs increase the peripheral ambulation score significantly and, with the exception of <b>zetidoline,</b> also increase the central ambulation score. The observations made with <b>zetidoline</b> confirm the hypothesis that a specific presynaptic DA 2 antagonism could be determinant for the disinhibitory effects of low doses of neuroleptics. A collateral action on 5 HT transmission is also suggested to explain an hypothetic anxiolytic action of DA agonists and SCH 23390 at lower doses. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{synaptic}} plasma membranes of rat striatum, {{activation of}} dopamine receptors stimulates a high affinity GTPase activity. The rank order of potency of various dopamine receptor agonists in increasing GTP hydrolysis is the following: (-) -propylnorapomorphine greater than (-) -apomorphine = (+/-) - 2 -amino- 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene [(+/-) -A- 6, 7 -DTN] greater than dopamine = LY 171555 greater than noradrenaline. The selective D- 1 dopamine receptor agonist, SKF 38393, {{does not produce}} {{a significant increase in}} GTP hydrolysis. Moreover, the dopamine-stimulated GTPase activity is completely reversed by the D- 2 receptor antagonists, 1 -sulpiride and <b>zetidoline,</b> but not by the selective D- 1 antagonist SCH 23390. Na+ modulates the dopamine receptor-regulated GTP hydrolysis by increasing the percentage of stimulation and decreasing the agonist potency. Intrastriatal injection of pertussis toxin, which impairs the function of the inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (Ni) of adenylate cyclase, significantly reduces the dopamine stimulation of striatal GTPase activity and the dopamine inhibition of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, cholera toxin, which blocks the stimulation of GTPase activity by hormones which increase adenylate cyclase activity, does not modify the dopamine-stimulated GTPase activity. These data indicate that the stimulation of GTPase activity elicited by dopamine results from activation of the D- 2 type of dopamine receptors and is expression of the increased turnover of GTP at the level of Ni. The results are consistent with the idea that Ni is involved in the inhibitory coupling of striatal D- 2 receptors to adenylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|Three {{compounds}} {{with differing}} pharmacological properties {{have been studied}} {{with respect to their}} effects on gastric emptying, BP, pulse rate and sedation in comparison with placebo in three groups of normal male volunteers. BRL 20627 (10 mg i. v.), a benzamide without dopamine antagonist activity, increased gastric emptying rate (t 0. 5 BRL 20627 8. 3 +/- 0. 87 min, placebo 13. 8 +/- 2. 29 min, P less than 0. 005). <b>Zetidoline</b> (20 mg orally), a dopamine D 2 -receptor antagonist had no significant effect on gastric emptying parameters. BK 34 / 530 (50 and 100 mg orally) a compound with mixed dopamine agonist and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, impaired gastric adaptive relaxation as measured by the volume 5 min after the drink and at the higher dose delayed gastric emptying (placebo [...] 5 min volume 256 +/- 44. 3 ml, t 0. 5 15. 3 +/- 1. 32 min: 50 mg BK 34 / 530 - 5 min volume 247 +/- 38 ml, t 0. 5 14. 2 +/- 1. 94 min: 100 mg BK 34 / 530 - 5 min volume 228 +/- 43. 7 ml, t 0. 5 21. 1 +/- 3. 82 min). All three drugs resulted in small but significant falls in blood pressure, {{and in the case of}} BK 34 / 530 the 100 mg dose caused significant tachycardia. These studies suggest that dopamine antagonist activity is not a prerequisite for 'gastrokinetic' effects in man, and that there is no inhibitory dopaminergic tone on gastric emptying in normal subjects...|$|E
