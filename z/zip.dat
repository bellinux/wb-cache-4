5|$|Adding to the problems, the <b>zip</b> fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use <b>zip</b> only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the <b>zip</b> program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make {{up some of the}} difference. Most of the range lost in the change from <b>zip</b> fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a North Shore Towers {{resident}} {{noticed a}} <b>zip</b> code error when making an online purchase. After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four <b>zip</b> codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the <b>zip</b> codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{genome-wide}} <b>ZIPs</b> identification in Arabidopsis {{and rice}} was performed with rigorous evolutional analysis. A comparative examination of genome-wide expression profile of <b>ZIPs</b> in Arabidopsis and rice {{in response to}} Cd stress were carried out. Their role in Cd uptake of typical <b>ZIPs</b> responding to Cd stress was further tested by expressing them in yeast. As expected, most identified <b>ZIPs</b> gene expression responded remarkably to Cd stress, while unexpectedly {{it was found that}} Arabidopsis and rice showed a distinct pattern in <b>ZIPs</b> genes expression profile. These results may help to elucidate the plants’ genetic basis for Cd translocation via a ZIPs-dependent pathway.|$|R

5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the <b>zip</b> code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any <b>zip</b> code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

30|$|We chose a sum {{expression}} {{because when}} one of these terms is significantly high, the others are less significant. This consideration arises from the experimental evidence {{of the behavior of}} different demosaicing algorithms. A strong low pass filtering adopted to reduce the <b>zips</b> produces a blurred image, and thus in this case the blur measure B is dominant with respect to the others. In case of more conservative filtering, the image sharpness is preserved, but the <b>zips</b> still remain as a defect. Different CI algorithms produce <b>zips</b> with different levels of saturation, ranging from achromatic to highly saturated <b>zips.</b>|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{this study}} {{revealed}} a distinct pattern in <b>ZIPs</b> family genes expression between Arabidopsis and rice {{in response to}} Cd stress. Arabidopsis mainly up-regulated root <b>ZIPs</b> genes, while rice mainly up-regulated shoot <b>ZIPs</b> genes. Three genes, AtIRT 1, OsZIP 1 and OsZIP 3, conferred an increased Cd accumulation and sensitivity to Cd stress when expressed in yeast cells, further implying their roles in Cd uptake in plants.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the force generation by polymerizing bundles of filaments, which form because of short-range attractive filament interactions. We show that bundles can generate forces by a <b>zipping</b> mechanism, {{which is not}} limited by buckling and operates in the fully buckled state. The critical <b>zipping</b> force, i. e. the maximal force that a bundle can generate, is given by the adhesive energy gained during bundle formation. For opposing forces larger than the critical <b>zipping</b> force, bundles undergo a force-induced unbinding transition. For larger bundles, the critical <b>zipping</b> force depends on the initial configuration of the bundles. Our results are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
