40|$|Visuospatial {{attention}} {{can either}} be "narrowly" focused on (<b>zooming</b> in) or "widely" distributed to (<b>zooming</b> out) different locations in space. In the current {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study, we investigated the shared and differential neural mechanisms underlying the dynamic "zooming in" and "zooming out" processes while potential distance confounds from visual inputs between <b>zooming</b> in and <b>zooming</b> out were controlled for. When compared with <b>zooming</b> out, <b>zooming</b> in differentially implicated left anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), which may reflect the functional specificity of left anterior IPS in focusing attention on local object features. By contrast, <b>zooming</b> out differentially activated right inferior frontal gyrus, which may reflect higher demands on cognitive control processes associated with enlarging the attentional focus. A conjunction analysis between <b>zooming</b> in and <b>zooming</b> out revealed significant shared activations in right middle temporal gyrus, right superior occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal cortex. The latter result suggests that the right posterior temporal-occipital-parietal system, which is known to be crucial for the control of spatial attention, is involved in updating the internal representation of the spatial locations that attentional processing is associated with...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel architecture for integrating digital stabilizer {{with the camera}} <b>zooming</b> process. The proposed architecture scheme allows integration for both optical and digital <b>zooming</b> operation scenarios. The stabilizer adjusts its operational parameters from the current optical <b>zooming</b> status for a refined local motion estimation. Subsequently, the global motion compensation vectors, produced by the digital stabilizer, are sent to the digital <b>zooming</b> system, where the image compensation is merged within the interpolation process. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} proposed architecture can improve not only the quantitative performance of digital stabilization but also the computational efficiency when <b>zooming</b> is employed 1 Index Terms — Camera <b>zooming,</b> digital video stabilization, motion estimation, image interpolation...|$|R

5|$|The lens {{features}} a hypersonic <b>zoom</b> motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic <b>zoom</b> mechanics. The lens is capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel single-frame image <b>zooming</b> {{technique}} based on so-called “self-examples”. Our method combines the ideas of fractal-based image <b>zooming,</b> example-based <b>zooming,</b> and nonlocal-means image denoising in a consistent and improved framework. In Bayesian terms, this example-based <b>zooming</b> technique targets the MMSE estimate by learning the posterior directly from examples taken from the image itself at a different scale, similar to fractal-based techniques. The examples are weighted according to a scheme introduced by Buades et al. to perform nonlocal-means image denoising. Finally, various computational issues are addressed and some results of this image <b>zooming</b> method applied to natural images are presented. ...|$|R

By incorporating semantic <b>zooming</b> techniques the user can smoothly access a global overview of the document during rate-based scrolling. We implemented several prototype systems, including a web browser, map viewer, image browser, and dictionary viewer. An informal usability study suggests that for a document browsing task, most subjects prefer automatic <b>zooming</b> and the technique exhibits approximately equal performance time to scroll bars, suggesting that automatic <b>zooming</b> is a helpful alternative totraditional scrolling when the <b>zoomed</b> out view provides appropriate visual cues.

40|$|Optical <b>zooming</b> is an {{important}} feature of imaging systems. In this paper, we investigate a low-cost signal processing alternative to optical zooming&# 8212;synthetic <b>zooming</b> by super-resolution (SR) techniques. Synthetic <b>zooming</b> is achieved by registering a sequence of low-resolution (LR) images acquired at varying focal lengths and reconstructing the SR image at a larger focal length or increased spatial resolution. Under the assumptions of constant scene depth and <b>zooming</b> speed, we argue that the motion trajectories of all physical points are {{related to each other}} by a unique vanishing point and present a robust technique for estimating its D coordinate. Such a line-geometry-based registration is the foundation of SR for synthetic <b>zooming.</b> We address the issue of data inconsistency arising from the varying focal length of optical lens during the <b>zooming</b> process. To overcome the difficulty of data inconsistency, we propose a two-stage Delaunay-triangulation-based interpolation for fusing the LR image data. We also present a PDE-based nonlinear deblurring to accommodate the blindness and variation of sensor point spread functions. Simulation results with real-world images have verified the effectiveness of the proposed SR techniques for synthetic <b>zooming.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A unified camera image {{processing}} system that performs <b>zooming</b> and full color image reconstruction for single-sensor digital cameras is introduced. Compact and low-cost single-sensor solutions often lack optical <b>zooming</b> capabilities and thus depend on digital techniques. However, the computational power required for high-quality output using traditional techniques is generally too prohibitive to implement in such devices. The proposed scheme employs {{a small number}} of reusable, low-complexity operations and a consistent color model throughout to achieve high-quality <b>zoomed</b> output that is practical for hardware implementation. The high-level system components are color filter array (CFA) <b>zooming,</b> CFA interpolation (demosaicking) and demosaicked image postprocessing. The resulting output is consistently superior to other methods. 1 Index Terms — Camera {{image processing}}, Bayer pattern, color filter array interpolation, color image restoration, image <b>zooming,</b> demosaicked image postprocessing.
