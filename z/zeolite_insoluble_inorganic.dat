40|$|ABSTRACT. The work {{presented}} {{here was to}} determine the transformation of phosphorus (P) between different forms in the process of intermittent and continuous aeration. According to this study, aeration, at an airflow rate of 1. 0 L/min, resulted in an increase in the manure pH of about one unit, from 6. 5 to 7. 5, within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in soluble ortho–P of 76 %. This reduction in soluble P was apparently caused by the chemical precipitation that was indicated by a reduction in organic P and a simultaneous increase in <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> P. The analysis of mass balances between the P fractions showed a large transformation of <b>inorganic</b> <b>insoluble</b> P into organic forms during the aeration period, which could overshadow the efficiency of soluble P removal by microbes. Because the manure contained about 73. 5 % <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> P, it is suggested that solid–liquid separation should be performed prior to aeration to increase the efficiency of soluble P removal. In addition, continuous aeration did not show an advantage over intermittent aeration in terms of soluble P removal...|$|R

The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence modes in coal are CaF 2, MgF 2 and AlF 3. The fluorine in fly ash can be captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or a bag filter. In contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The occurrence mode of fluorine in bottom ash and slag is inorganic villiaumite (e. g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF 2) which is difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> mineral fluoride content in fly ash is also high, but the gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by physical adsorption. Fluorine in the coal-fired power plant discharges mostly as solid products; however, very little fluorine emitted into the environment as gas products (HF, SiF 4) cannot be captured.

The first aim continued the identification, separation, and characterization of the cellular components necessary for aerobic respiration on iron. An electrochemical apparatus for the large scale cultivation of chemolithotrophic bacteria that respire aerobically on ferrous ions was perfected.

Most phosphorus (P) compounds exist as either <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> phosphate (Pi) or organic phosphate; however, the availability of Pi and the use efficiency of P fertilizers applied to the crops are extremely low in most of soils. The use of P fertilizer is unsustainable and causes soil and water pollution. Phosphorus is also a nonrenewable resource. By some estimates, world resources of inexpensive P may be depleted by 20501. Consequently, improvement of Pi uptake and use by crops is critical for economic, humanitarian, and environmental reasons. Plants have developed many physiological and biochemical systems of adaptation to Pi-deficiency stress. Thousands of genes, including many transcription factors, can simultaneously be regulated by Pi-deficiency stress in rice 2, indicating that plant adaptation to Pi-deficiency is systemic. Based on biochemical and transcriptional analysis, several adaptation systems have been revealed, including enhanced uptake ability through activation of high affinity transporters and adaptative root development; induction of phosphate scavenging and recycling enzymes; induction of alternative pathways of cytosolic glycolysis; induction of tonoplast H+-pumping pyrophosphatase; and alternative pathways of respiratory electron transport.

Various <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> phosphates, including tri-calcium phosphate [Ca 3 (PO 4) 2], iron phosphate (FePO 4), aluminum phosphate (AlPO 4), and Rock Phosphate (RP) were tested as sole sources of P for bacterial growth.

Even though gluconic acid (GA) was detected on culture supernatants of strain MMB 051, a consequence of the direct oxidation pathway of glucose, inorganic-P solubilization seemed also to be related to other processes dependent on active cell growth. Among these, proton release by ammonium (NH 4) fixation appeared to be of paramount importance to explain inorganic-P solubilization mediated by strain MMB 051.

The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.9 using 1  N NaOH or HCl {{and then it was}} autoclaved (121  °C, 20  min). After cooling the solution to 60  °C, 10  g D (+) Glucose monohydrate (6887.1, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) dissolved in 110  mL deionized water and 1  g l-asparagine monohydrate (11160, Fluka, Buchs, Germany) dissolved in 50  ml deionized water were added (Solution A). To precipitate non-soluble Ca–P in the medium, 2.2  g CaCl 2 · 2 H 2 O (2461.1000 Chem Solute Th.Geyer, Renningen, Germany) dissolved in 20  mL deionized water and 3.8  g Na 3 PO 4 · 12 H 2 O (6578, E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) also dissolved in 20  ml deionized water, each autoclaved (121  °C, 20  min) and cooled down to 60  °C. CaCl 2 and Na 3 PO 4 solutions were simultaneously added to solution A under continuous stirring resulting in immediate clouding of the medium through the formation of Ca–P (Ca 3 (PO 4) 2) (Eq.  1): [...]...|$|R
3000|$|As {{discussed}} by Garcia et al. ([1997]) and also {{mentioned in the}} previous section, the uptake of sodium ions by the bypass flow possibly involves direct apoplastic leakage occurring at the root apices (Enstone and Peterson [1992]) and the sites of secondary root emergence (Peterson et al. [1981]; Ranathunge et al. [2005]) (Figure 4 a). On the other hand, experiments using pressure probes have indicated a possibility of some passage of water and perhaps also of solutes bypassing protoplasts (Steudle and Frensch [1996]). With regard to the outer part of the root (OPR), Ranathunge et al. ([2005]) performed experiments introducing precipitates of <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> salts to block apoplastic pores and suggested existence of predominant apoplastic bypass flow of water as well as high permeability of ions of the OPR, supporting at least a possibility of apoplastic bypass flow of solutes in the OPR. Although it may appear somehow controversial about the mechanism of the bypass flow of solutes, a fascinating model called [...] "composite transport" [...] of both water and solutes is proposed. This model assumes that a switching between the apoplastic and cell-to-cell pathways occurs depending on given circumstances and explains how plants optimize water uptake according to demands from the shoot (Steudle and Frensch [1996]; Steudle and Peterson [1998]; Miyamoto et al. [2001]). The composite transport model may also be applied even to rice roots in which aerenchyma extensively develop (Ranathunge et al. [2005]).|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Different {{phosphate}} solubilizing bacteria; as biofertilizer; solubilize <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> phosphate {{compounds and}} rock phosphate to improve soil fertility and increase crop production. This research was aimed in evaluation of isolate’s efficiency in liquid medium and at greenhouse level with CRD design. All isolates showed progressive increase in Phosphorous as incubation dates increased. However, {{in most cases}} maximum value for all isolates detected at 5 days incubation in Pikovskaya’s broth. Consequently, maximum Phosphorous released by isolate HUPSB- 57 (0. 51 %/day) from TCP, HUPSB- 35 (0. 41 %/day) from ERP and HUPSB- 27 (0. 53 %/day) from bone meal. Inverse relationship between released Phosphorous and medium pH observed. Isolates HUPSB- 35 and HUPSB- 57 reduced pH to 3. 57 units in ERP, HUPSB- 45 to 3. 7 units in bone meal, and HUPSB- 57 to 4. 0 units in TCP. Significant difference observed between negative control and isolates inoculation on white lupin shoot height. Highest shoot height (99. 67 cm) recorded by isolate HUPSB- 35 inoculated with ERP at green house. Maximum shoot phosphorus (0. 3 %) recorded by HUPSB- 45 inoculated with ERP. In general, isolates HUPSB- 27, HUPSB- 35, HUPSB- 45 and HUPSB- 57 {{were found to be}} effective phosphate solubilizers both on media and at green house and them can be recommended as bio-inoculants by testing them on different crops.
