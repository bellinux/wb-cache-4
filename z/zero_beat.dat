40|$|The {{research}} results of oscillator internal parameters influence {{the features of}} dynamic autodyne characteristics formation {{in the case of}} external oscillator signal influence are presented. The equivalent circuit with a single-circuit oscillating system is considered as a model of the autodyne oscillator. Abbreviated equations are obtained by an averaging method and then they are linearized for small disturbances in a vicinity of the steady-state mode. The obtained characteristics for the beating mode are compared with characteristics of autodynes for short-range radar technology. The essential differences in behavior of the oscillator with acting the external oscillator and the oscillator with acting the own reflected signal have been found. The physical sense of the frequency dispersion phenomenon for the autodyne frequency deviation in the vicinity of hypothetical ?<b>zero?</b> <b>beating</b> is discovered. The {{research results}} of dynamic autodyne characteristics in the frequency conversion mode of signals modulated on amplitude or frequency are given. It is shown that to suppress the spurious harmonics of the beating frequency, it is advisable to take additional measures for generated frequency stabilization in autodyne frequency converters, for instance, using the external feedback in the oscillator or using the external high-Q resonator. The adequacy of theoretical conclusions is confirmed by results of experimental investigations of the hybrid-integrated module of 8 mm-range {{made on the basis of}} the planar two-meza Gunn diode. Oscillator characteristics obtained by the beating method are compared with results of investigation fulfilled with the help of modulation characteristics. It is shown that errors in experimental determination of dynamic characteristics of autodyne oscillators caused by frequency limitations of a pin-diode typical for the modulation characteristic method can be eliminated. Problems of practical application of obtained results in real radar systems using autodyne oscillators are discussed...|$|R
50|$|After the 1896-97 season, {{based on}} a lack of {{material}} and disinterest by participants, the University suspended it's men's basketball program and promoted the women's program instead. Finally, in 1903 the program was reinstated and, with the Western Conference backing a conference champion, a varsity schedule was developed by athletic director Stagg. Wilfred Childs became the {{head coach of the}} Maroons for this newly developed team that finished the season with seven wins and <b>zero</b> losses, <b>beating</b> teams by an average score of 45 to 11. Childs would coach the Maroons through the 1905-06 season, turning the position over to Joseph Raycroft who would guide the team to four Big Ten Conference championships (then known as the Western Conference), and the 1907, 1908, and 1909 teams were all retroactively named national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation; his 1909 team was also retroactively named the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.|$|R
50|$|This {{group was}} {{played in the}} Kreuzbleichhalle, St. Gallen (capacity: 4,500). Poland {{qualified}} first, winning the first match and then drawing the second against Switzerland despite an equaliser with 15 seconds to go from Pascal Jenny, and two hours later {{they were joined by}} Slovenia, who came back from a two-goal deficit in the last ten minutes to beat Ukraine by 33-31. Switzerland and Ukraine thus played off for the last place in the main round, and the Swiss got behind from the start, trailing by 21-14 at half time. Ten minutes into the second half, Ukraine were 28-16 up, before allowing Switzerland somewhat back into it near the end. They still won 37-30, however, qualifying for the second round with <b>zero</b> points. Slovenia <b>beat</b> Poland 33-29 to carry forward four points, while Poland got two.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} and how {{corporate}} life cycle significantly influences meeting or beating earnings benchmarks (MBE). We find that corporate life cycle {{plays a significant role}} in a firm's meeting or beating earnings benchmarks behaviour. Developing strategies that fit into the stage of corporate life cycle is crucial for corporate success. MBE is an important financial goal that requires strategies. In this study, we examine {{whether and how}} corporate life cycle significantly influences MBE. Specifically, we focus on the incentives of MBE in growth and mature firms. We find that corporate life cycle significantly influences a firm's tendency to meet or <b>beat</b> <b>zero</b> earnings, prior earnings and analysts’ earnings forecasts. Based on logit regressions for the period from 1988 to 2008, the results indicate that growth firms are more likely to meet or beat all three earnings benchmarks. Overall, {{the results of this study}} indicate that a firm's MBE behaviour should be examined in the context of its life cycle stage. clos...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the extent to which French and British firms manage their {{earnings}} in order to avoid losses, decreases in earnings and earnings below the forecasts of analysts. Further, this study aims to investigate the factors that potentially influence earnings management to exceed thresholds with reference to the Anglo-Saxon and continental accounting models. Britain and France, correspondingly, belong to those different socio-economic environments. Based on a panel data of 1771 French and 2057 British firm-year observations during the period 2002 – 2012, we show that all firms considered manage earnings to <b>beat</b> <b>zero</b> and last year’s earnings. However, earnings management in order to meet analysts’ forecasts appears to be more prevalent in British firms. Considering earnings management incentives, we find that firm size has a positive effect for all thresholds considered. Similarly, the signaling hypothesis is more evident for British firms for all thresholds examined. The corporate governance structure is also found to impact the extent of earnings management...|$|R
50|$|The story {{deviates}} slightly {{depending on}} whether or not the player collects all three of Zero's parts before heading to the X-Hunter fortification in the North Pole. If the player gathers all the parts, Dr. Cain states he will attempt to reassemble and reactivate Zero using his original control chip. If the player does not succeed, X is informed by Dr. Cain that the X-Hunters have attacked Maverick Hunter headquarters and stolen any collected parts and the control chip. Just as X annihilates the last of the X-Hunters, Sigma reveals himself to have been behind the plot. X leaves the exploding compound and tracks Sigma to the Central Computer, one of the eight locations he visited earlier. If the player fails to collect all of Zero's parts, X finds both Sigma and the newly rebuilt Zero waiting for him halfway through the stage. X must then <b>beat</b> <b>Zero</b> in combat. If the player does manage to collect all of the parts, a gray-armored clone of Zero accompanies Sigma instead; the real Zero will then appear at X's side and destroys the clone. The outcome of either event has Sigma retreating and Zero creating a passageway in the floor to allow X pursuit. When the villain is defeated, X evacuates the facility to rendezvous with Zero outside, and the two watch as the facility self-destructs.|$|R
5000|$|After Ageha Yoshina beats up a bully for 10,000 yen, {{he heads}} home anticipating a scolding from his sister for {{breaking}} curfew. On his way there, {{a pay phone}} nearby starts ringing, and {{he picks it up}} only to hear his own echo. Shrugging it off, he places the receiver back only to find a mysterious calling card with the word [...] "Psyren" [...] written on it. Curious about the sudden appearance of the card, he goes to his school's Occult Club and asks about it. It turns about Psyren was an urban myth, and whoever found out what it really was would get a reward of 500 million yen. The same day, he find his classmate's (Sakurako Amamiya's) wallet, which some other girls hid, and notices she has the same card. After he returns it to her, she runs off and disappears. The last thing he hears is [...] "Save me". The next day she isn't at school and soon she is declared missing. Ageha calls the number on the card in hopes of finding her. After answering a long and detailed quiz on a pay phone, he is asked if he wants to go to Psyren. The next day, while he is being chased by two mysterious people pretending to be police officers; ironically his phone rings. In a panic, he picks up and is suddenly drawn into the world of Psyren, which is a wasteland inhabited by monsters called Taboo. It is later revealed that the Taboo were once humans that were turned into Taboo by an organization known as the W.I.S.E. The voice from the phone, dubbed Nemesis Q, assigns missions which people must complete if they wish to return home. While in Psyren for the first time newcomers are informed of the rules, which basically state that if you tell anyone about Psyren you die; when the number on your card hits <b>zero</b> you <b>beat</b> the game and can't come back; never lose your card, you can't go home if you do; and don't go near the towers. The Psyren Drifters (as they come to be called) breathe in the polluted air from this world of Psyren and it alters their brains, allowing them to surpass human limits and use all their brain cells, at the cost of serious damage. This lets them use a power called PSI, which usually lies dormant, and is usually never awakened. PSI consists of three categories, Enhance (use of PSI to enhance their physical abilities), Blast (external usage of PSI to create power blasts or creatures), and Trance (the ability to affect someone's mental state).|$|R
