60|$|Before them {{stretched}} the gray-white {{expanse of the}} lake, and on either side the glistening white shores, now receding as they passed a deep bay, again creeping out in a long point. There was no sound save the sharp ring of the skates and the soft grate of the smoothly slipping toboggan. Past two big summer hotels with blank staring windows, past shuttered and deserted summer camps they sped until all sign of man's handiwork disappeared. The keen air was like wine in their veins {{and it was hard}} to believe that the thermometer had registered eighteen below zero that morning, for the air was dry and did not penetrate as would the moisture laden air at home at a temperature many degrees above the <b>zero</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pervasive <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> is very rare, but {{instances}} of <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> {{in various forms}} occur in {{quite a number of}} languages. Vietnamese and Indonesian are two national languages listed in the World Atlas of Language Structures as having zero-marking. Pirahã is another language having zero-marking among its other very rare features.|$|R
50|$|Time nouns are {{distinguished}} from other nouns grammatically {{on the basis}} that they can only be in the oblique or relative case. Like location nouns they come in two delicious flavours. The first can only receive a <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> in the oblique case while the second can marked with either a <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> or with the prepositions eni or teni.|$|R
5000|$|Some languages, such as Arabic, use {{a similar}} process, called [...] "juxtaposition" [...] in {{linguistic}} jargon, to indicate possessive relationships. In Arabic, two nouns {{next to each}} other could indicate a possessed-possessor construction: [...] "Maryam's books" [...] (literally [...] "books Maryam"). The rarity of pervasive <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> is due to languages with juxtaposition having more of inflection than languages with <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> in noun phrases so the two almost never overlap.|$|R

Slightly before the needle reaches the <b>zero</b> <b>mark,</b> the plant operator returns the generator to the grid frequency {{in order to stop}} the needle when it reaches the <b>zero</b> <b>mark.</b> When the needle is at zero and is not moving, the two systems are synchronized.|$|E

5000|$|Points {{per inch}} (25 mm): The most common {{measurement}} of the frequency of teeth on a saw blade. It is taken by setting the tip (or point) of one tooth at the zero point on a ruler, and then {{counting the number of}} points between the <b>zero</b> <b>mark</b> and the one-inch mark, inclusive (that is, including both the point at the <b>zero</b> <b>mark</b> and any point that lines up precisely with the one-inch mark). There is always one more point per inch than there are teeth per inch (e.g., a saw with 14 points per inch will have 13 teeth per inch, and a saw with 10 points per inch will have 9 teeth per inch). Some saws {{do not have the same}} number of teeth per inch throughout their entire length, but the vast majority do. Those with more teeth per inch at the toe are described as having incremental teeth, in order to make starting the saw cut easier.|$|E

First, the inner structure, the position within a clause and possible controllers are addressed, then structural and semantic constraints on the choice of subject vs. object controller are discussed. While topicality and telicity exert some influence, pragmatic factors can override the tendencies thus induced. Instrumental case marking on the adjective, on the other hand, still allows for two interpretations, but object-related readings seem {{to be caused by}} the interpretation of the accusative-marked noun phrase as subordinate clause subject. The contrasting <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> seems to be neutral, while the dative marking is not discussed. Adjective resultatives are restricted to <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> and predictable results of transitive predications, but are not the primary means to express resultative meaning...|$|R

This paper {{argues for}} the {{necessity}} of zero pronoun annotations in Korean treebanks and provides an annotation scheme {{that can be used}} to develop a gold standard for testing different anaphor resolution algorithms. Relevant issues of pronoun annotation will be discussed by comparing the Penn Korean Treebank with zero pronoun mark-up and the newly developing Sejong Teebank without zero pronoun mark-up. In addition to supportive evidence for <b>zero</b> <b>marking,</b> necessary morphosyntactic and semantic features will be suggested for zero annotation in Korean treebanks. ...|$|R
5000|$|In many {{microarray}} {{gene expression}} experiments, an underlying {{assumption is that}} most of the genes would not see any change in their expression; therefore, the majority of the points on the y-axis (M) would be located at 0, since Log(1) is 0. If this is not the case, then a normalization method such as LOESS should be applied to the data before statistical analysis. (On the diagram below see the red line running below the <b>zero</b> <b>mark</b> before normalization, it should be straight. Since it is not straight, the data should be normalized. After being normalized, the red line is straight on the zero line and shows as pink/black.) ...|$|E
50|$|Réaumur’s {{thermometer}} contained diluted alcohol (ethanol) and {{was constructed}} {{on the principle}} of using 0° for the freezing temperature of water, and graduating the tube into degrees, each of which was one-thousandth of the volume contained by the bulb and tube up to the <b>zero</b> <b>mark.</b> He suggested that the concentration of alcohol employed be such that it began boiling at 80 °Ré — that is, when it had expanded in volume by 8%. He chose alcohol instead of mercury because it expands more visibly, but this posed problems: his original thermometers were very bulky, and the low boiling point of alcohol made them unsuitable for many applications. Instrument-makers generally chose different liquids, and then used 80 °Ré to signify the boiling point of water, causing much confusion. During 1772 Jean-André Deluc studied the several substances then used in thermometers and concluded that mercurial thermometers were the best for practical use; for example, if two equal amounts of water at x and y degrees were mixed, the temperature of the result was then the average of x and y degrees, and this relationship was only reliable when mercury was used. From the late 18th century mercury was used almost without exception.|$|E
5000|$|A {{gyroscope}} {{is mounted}} in a sphere, lined with Mu-metal to reduce magnetic influence, {{connected by a}} spindle to the vertical axis of the theodolite. The battery-powered gyro wheel is rotated at 20,000 rpm or more, until it acts as a north-seeking gyroscope. [...] A separate optical system within the attachment permits the operator to rotate the theodolite and thereby bring a <b>zero</b> <b>mark</b> on the attachment into coincidence with the gyroscope spin axis. By tracking the spin axis as it oscillates about the meridian, {{a record of the}} azimuth of a series of the extreme stationary points of that oscillation may be determined by reading the theodolite azimuth circle. A midpoint can later be computed from these records that represents a refined estimate of the meridian. Careful setup and repeated observations can give an estimate that is within about 10 arc seconds of the true meridian. [...] This estimate of the meridian contains errors due to the zero torque of the suspension not being aligned precisely with the true meridian and to measurement errors of the slightly damped extremes of oscillation. These errors can be moderated by refining the initial estimate of the meridian to within a few arc minutes and correctly aligning the zero torque of the suspension.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{location}} nouns, relative and absolute. The relative nouns are a closed class of 10 words with meanings like above or nearby. The absolute nouns are an open class and refer to some specific location. Location nouns generally occur in the spatial case. Unlike all other nouns, in this case they take a <b>zero</b> <b>marking</b> rather than the preposition ‘eni’. Relative location nouns are distinguished grammatically from the absolute location nouns on the basis that they can freely enter into prepositionally linked complex nominal phrases while the absolute nouns cannot.|$|R
