The bundles consist of uniform nanotubes with diameters in the range 11. 0 < D (A) < 18. 1, arranged in the usual close-packed hexagonal lattice.

The MD simulations show that the <b>zero-loading</b> diffusivity (Đi(0)) is consistently lower, by up to a factor of 10, than the Knudsen diffusivity (Di,Kn) values. The ratio Đi(0) /Di,Kn is found to correlate with the isosteric heat of adsorption, which, in turn, {{is a reflection of}} the binding energy for adsorption on the pore walls: the stronger the binding energy, the lower the ratio Đi(0) /Di,Kn. The diffusion selectivity, which is defined by the ratio D 1,self/D 2,self for binary mixtures, was determined to be significantly different from the Knudsen selectivity (M 2 /M 1) 1 / 2, where Mi is the molar mass of species i. For mixtures in which component 2 is more strongly adsorbed than component 1, the expression (D 1,self/D 2,self) /(M 2 /M 1) 1 / 2 has values in the range of 1 - 10; the departures from the Knudsen selectivity increased with increasing differences in adsorption strengths of the constituent species.

Venous blood samples were drawn 24, 48, and 72 h after CFES LE for measurement of ET and CK. The CK response was largest (peak CK) 72 h after baseline tests (28. 2 Â± 6. 0 to 895. 7 Â± 345. 9 ktals/l) and was no different from baseline by weeks 3, 6, and 12. After DT, CK was similar before and after CFES LE (153. 8 Â± 19. 0 and 189. 7 Â± 34. 5 ktals/l, respectively). CFES LE also significantly increased peak ET after baseline (from 11. 7 Â± 1. 5 to 18. 0 Â± 2. 5 pg/ml). During the subsequent training, peak ET remained significantly higher than the baseline value at weeks 3, 6, and 12 (20. 2 Â± 1. 8, 18. 0 Â± 1. 1, and 16. 9 Â± 2. 2 pg/ml, respectively). After DT, peak ET increased significantly from 9. 3 Â± 1. 2 to 15. 4 Â± 2. 0 pg/ml. During training, a significant relationship (r = 0. 44) existed between ln peak CK activity and peak ET. In summary, the increase in circulating ET in spinal cord-injured individuals may have implications for baroreceptor function and therefore blood pressure control in SCI.

On {{the basis of}} information available in the published literature, it appears that MgMOF- 74 has significant advantages over other MOFs, with respect to its uptake capacity for CO 2. The primary objective of the present communication is to investigate the performance of MgMOF- 74 membranes in separating CO 2 /H 2, CO 2 /N 2, CO 2 /CH 4, and CH 4 /H 2 mixtures, {{that are important in}} carbon capture. To achieve this objective all the parameters required for modeling MgMOF- 74 membrane permeation were obtained using molecular simulations. Specifically, Configurational-Bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations were used to determine pure component adsorption isotherms, and isosteric heats of adsorption. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to determine the self-diffusivities, Di,self, and the Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) diffusivities, Ði, of guest molecules. The MD simulations show that the <b>zero-loading</b> diffusivity Ði(0) is consistently lower, by up to a factor of 10, than the values of the Knudsen diffusivity, Di,Kn. The ratio Ði(0) /Di,Kn is found to correlate with the isosteric heat of adsorption, which in turn {{is a reflection of the}} binding energy for adsorption at the pore walls. The stronger the binding energy, the lower is the ratio Ði(0) /Di,Kn.

The model calculations show that increased upstream pressures lead to significant enhancement in permeation selectivities; this enhancement is directly traceable to diffusional correlations within the 1 D channels. Such correlations have the effect of slowing-down the more mobile partner species in the mixtures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{calculation}} of ventricular {{stress and strain}} is critical for cardiovascular investigations. Sarcomere shortening in active contraction leads to change of ventricular zero-stress configurations during the cardiac cycle. A new model using different <b>zero-load</b> diastole and systole geometries was introduced to provide more accurate cardiac stress/strain calculations with potential to predict post pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) surgical outcome. METHODS: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data were obtained from 16 patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot prior to and 6 months after pulmonary valve replacement (8 male, 8 female, mean age 34. 5 years). Patients were divided into Group 1 (n = 8) with better post PVR outcome and Group 2 (n = 8) with worse post PVR outcome based on their change in RV ejection fraction (EF). CMR-based patient-specific computational RV/LV models using one <b>zero-load</b> geometry (1 G model) and two <b>zero-load</b> geometries (diastole and systole, 2 G model) were constructed and RV wall thickness, volume, circumferential and longitudinal curvatures, mechanical stress and strain were obtained for analysis. Pairwise T-test and Linear Mixed Effect (LME) model {{were used to determine}} if the differences from the 1 G and 2 G models were statistically significant, with the dependence of the pair-wise observations and the patient-slice clustering effects being taken into consideration. For group comparisons, continuous variables (RV volumes, WT, C- and L- curvatures, and stress and strain values) were summarized as mean +/- SD and compared between the outcome groups by using an unpaired Student t-test. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify potential morphological and mechanical predictors for post PVR surgical outcome. RESULTS: Based on results from the 16 patients, mean begin-ejection stress and strain from the 2 G model were 28 % and 40 % higher than that from the 1 G model, respectively. Using the 2 G model results, RV EF changes correlated negatively with stress (r = - 0. 609, P = 0. 012) and with pre-PVR RV end-diastole volume (r = - 0. 60, P = 0. 015), but did not correlate with WT, C-curvature, L-curvature, or strain. At begin-ejection, mean RV stress of Group 2 was 57. 4 % higher than that of Group 1 (130. 1 +/- 60. 7 vs. 82. 7 +/- 38. 8 kPa, P = 0. 0042). Stress was the only parameter that showed {{significant differences between the two}} groups. The combination of circumferential curvature, RV volume and the difference between begin-ejection stress and end-ejection stress was the best predictor for post PVR outcome with an area under the ROC curve of 0. 855. The begin-ejection stress was the best single predictor among the 8 individual parameters with an area under the ROC curve of 0. 782. CONCLUSION: The new 2 G model may be able to provide more accurate ventricular stress and strain calculations for potential clinical applications. Combining morphological and mechanical parameters may provide better predictions for post PVR outcome...|$|E

We develop a channel occupancy detector to apply universal globally adaptive load-balancing (UGAL) rout-ing to load balance traffic in networks using EBs. Using EBs results in up to 12 % (17 % for low-swing channels) improvement in peak throughput per unit power compared to a network using VC flow control. The power saved by eliminating VCBs is used to make channels wider, providing increased throughput that more than offsets the degradation caused by increased blocking without VCs.

With {{a large number}} of cores, Network-On-Chip (NOC) provides a scalable communication method for CMPs. NOC must be carefully designed to provide low latencies and high throughput in the resource-constrained environment. To improve the network throughput, we propose the Very Long Packet Window (VLPW) architecture for the NOC router design that tries to close the throughput gap between state-of-the-art on-chip routers and the ideal interconnect fabric. To improve throughput, VLPW optimizes Switch Allocation (SA) efficiency. Existing SA normally applies Round-Robin scheduling to arbitrate among the packets targeting the same output port.

This coincides with the phenomenological Gutenberg-Richter behavior observed in Seismology for the cumulative statistics of earthquakes at the regional or global scale. The key point of the model is the <b>zero-load</b> state of the system after the occurrence of any relaxation, no matter what its size. This leads to an equipartition of probability between all possible load configurations in the system during the successive loading cycles. Each cycle ends with the occurrence of the greatest –or characteristic – relaxation in the system. The duration of the cycles in the model is statistically distributed with a coefficient of variation ranging from 0. 5 to 1. The predictability of the characteristic relaxations is evaluated by means of error diagrams. This model illustrates the value of taking into account the refractory periods to obtain a considerable gain in the quality of the predictions...|$|E
40|$|Human placental stem villi (PSV) present {{contractile}} properties. In vitro mechanics {{were investigated}} in 40 human PSV. Contraction of PSV was induced by both KCl exposure (n =  20) and electrical tetanic stimulation (n =  20). Isotonic contractions were registered at several load levels ranging from <b>zero-load</b> up to isometric load. The tension-velocity relationship {{was found to}} be hyperbolic. This made it possible to apply the A. Huxley formalism for determining the rate constants for myosin cross-bridge (CB) attachment and detachment, CB single force, catalytic constant, myosin content, and maximum myosin ATPase activity. These molecular characteristics of myosin CBs did not differ under either KCl exposure or tetanus. A comparative approach was established from studies previously published in the literature and driven by mean of a similar method. As compared to that described in mammalian striated muscles, we showed that in human PSV, myosin CB rate constants for attachment and detachment were about 103 times lower whereas myosin ATPase activity was 105 times lower. Up to now, CB kinetics of contractile cells arranged along the long axis of the placental sheath appeared to be the slowest ever observed in any mammalian contractile tissue...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) need a {{scalable}} communication structure {{characterized by}} low cost, low power, and high performance {{to meet their}} on-chip communication requirements. This paper presents a hybrid circuit-switched (HCS) network for on-chip communication in the large-scale CMPs. The HCS network, which is Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) compatible, is composed of bufferless switches, pipeline channels, and network interfaces. Furthermore, packets are transferred in a hybrid transmission scheme. If a message has only one packet, the transmission scheme for this message is packet switching. Conversely, if a message contains multiple packets, the transmission scheme for this message is circuit switching. We evaluate HCS networks with different channel depths and then compare the HCS network with the Stanford elastic buffer (EB) network. Our {{results show that the}} HCS network with two-depth channel requires 83 % less power and occupies 32 % less area compared with the EB network. Furthermore, under maximum frequency and single traffic, the HCS network with two-depth channel provides 37 % lower <b>zero-load</b> latency, 390 % higher maximum throughput per unit power, and 19 % higher maximum throughput per unit area compared with the EB network. ? 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract—Several {{interesting}} topologies emerge {{by incorporating}} the third dimension in networks-on-chip (NoC). The {{speed and power}} consumption of 3 -D NoC are {{compared to that of}} 2 -D NoC. Physical constraints, such as the maximum number of planes that can be vertically stacked and the asymmetry between the horizontal and vertical communication channels of the network, are included in speed and power consumption models of these novel 3 -D structures. An analytic model for the <b>zero-load</b> latency of each network that considers the effects of the topology on the performance of a 3 -D NoC is developed. Tradeoffs between the number of nodes utilized in the third dimension, which reduces the average number of hops traversed by a packet, and the number of physical planes used to integrate the functional blocks of the network, which decreases the length of the communication channel, is evaluated for both the latency and power consumption of a network. A performance improvement of 40 % and 36 % and a decrease of 62 % and 58 % in power consumption is demonstrated for 3 -D NoC as compared to a traditional 2 -D NoC topology for a network size of aIPVand aPSTnodes, respectively.

40|$|Recognizing various driving {{conditions}} {{in real time}} and adjusting control strategy accordingly in automatic transmission vehicles are important to improve their adaptability to the external environment. This study defines a generalized load concept which can comprehensively reflect driving condition information. The principle of a gearshift strategy based on generalized load is deduced theoretically, adopting linear interpolation between the shift lines on flat and on the largest gradient road based on recognition results. For the convenience of application, normalization processing is used to transform generalized load results into a normalized form. Compared with the dynamic three-parameter shift schedule, the complex tridimensional curved surface is not needed any more, so it would reduce demands of memory space. And it has a more concise expression and better real-time performance. For the target vehicle, when driving uphill with gradient 11 %, the vehicle load is about 280 ~ 320 [*]Nm; when driving downhill, the value is around − 340 ~− 320 [*]Nm. Road tests show that generalized vehicle load keeps near 0 in <b>zero-load</b> condition after calibration, and an 11 % grade can be estimated with less than 1. 8 % error. This method is convenient and easy to implement in control software and can identify the driving condition information effectively...|$|E
