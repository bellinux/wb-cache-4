25|$|Loveland {{has seen}} several controversies over <b>zoning</b> <b>regulation.</b> After the city {{acquired}} the White Pillars property in 1996, it began plans {{to develop the}} land, which is situated on State Route 48. Prior to being elected councilman, Paul Elliot participated in {{a lawsuit against the}} city over attempting to rezone the property for commercial use without voter approval. In 2003, Mike Showler led a successful referendum to block the rezoning. An earlier attempt to develop a YMCA location on a section of Phillips Park also failed, when a group of residents protested the city's development plans, prompting the YMCA to abandon the location. In December 2006, Loveland announced a plan to build a Loveland Recreation Center on land adjacent to Phillips Park. The city planned to enter into an operating agreement with the YMCA once the center was built; however, the Recreation Center tax referendum was defeated in May 2007. The Recreation Center plan was later revised, but Loveland residents again rejected an income tax levy to fund the center on November 6, 2007.|$|E

Many municipalities have recognized the benefits that urban agriculture can bring to their residents, including economically down-trodden cities that view urban agriculture as a way to revitalize their neighborhoods. Unfortunately, <b>zoning</b> <b>regulations</b> often unintentionally prohibit even the most basic farming activities.

Instead, the parcel becomes subject to the applicable <b>zoning</b> <b>regulations</b> thereby ending the nonconforming use's reprieve from the <b>zoning</b> <b>regulations.</b> In others, by statute usually allowed to rebuild within a limited period.

Further examination of the evolution of form-based codes reveals the guiding principles and elements of more modern codes. When compared to traditional <b>zoning</b> <b>regulations,</b> form-based codes can assist in designing a better quality built environment by creating more conscious, significant and sustainable places and spaces within our communities. By looking at current ways in which form-based codes are implemented we can begin to define best management practices and speculate on the future of form-based codes...|$|R

In the masterplan the city extended over an area of 760 ha and was spatially divided into several functional zoning schemes. The Functional <b>Zoning</b> <b>Regulation</b> and The Functional Zoning Map of 2007 divided the city into the following: 1)Inhabited Zone, 2)City Center Zone, 3)Economic Zone, 4)Green Zone, 5)Sports Zone, 6)Hospital Zone, 7)Cemetery Zone.|$|E

The Court held that a municipal <b>zoning</b> <b>regulation</b> against signs on residential properties could not include federal election signs. The reading down of the municipal by-law to not include Federal election signs evidences an early stage {{in the evolution of}} the Interjurisdictional immunity legal doctrine.|$|E
50|$|A Form-Based Code (FBC) is a {{means of}} {{regulating}} land development to achieve a specific urban form. Form-Based Codes foster predictable built results and a high-quality public realm by using physical form (rather than separation of uses) as the organizing principle, with a lesser focus on land use, through municipal regulations. A FBC is a regulation, not a mere guideline, adopted into city, town, or county law and offers a powerful alternative to conventional <b>zoning</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|E

Through <b>zoning</b> <b>regulations,</b> historic districts, and other special zoning districts, including overlay districts, are well established.

50|$|Paseo Bulnes is a {{pedestrian}} street in downtown Santiago. It runs from Alameda Avenue {{in the north}} to the Almagro Park in the south. The street is lined by buildings of uniform height and similar facades, which were built under an urban plan approved in 1937 and whose main purpose was {{the development of a}} government district around the La Moneda Palace. In 1939, the first <b>zoning</b> <b>regulation</b> plan for Santiago proposed the southward extension of the then Avenida Central (now known as Paseo Bulnes).|$|E
50|$|At {{three levels}} the Lipstick Building's wall is set back in {{response}} to Manhattan's <b>zoning</b> <b>regulation,</b> which requires the building to recede from the street within its spatial envelope, to increase the availability of light at street level. The result is a form that looks as though it could retract telescopically. The shape, which is unusual in comparison to surrounding buildings, uses less space at the base than a regular skyscraper of quadrilateral footprint would use. This provides more room for the heavy pedestrian traffic along Third Avenue.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower is}} {{exceptionally}} slender with only 1400 m2 of {{gross floor area}} per floor, because of a <b>zoning</b> <b>regulation</b> limiting the total building floor area to twelve times the property area. Its façade is more ornamental {{than that of the}} average International style tower, with horizontal strips of glass curtain wall alternating with spandrels of various types of stone, including green slate that was quarried in Wales. The building was fully renovated in 1991, and the highly visible CIBC logo at the top was redesigned in 2004 and again in 2013.|$|E

50|$|Zoning {{also has}} been implicated as a primary driving factor in the rapidly {{accelerating}} lack of affordable housing in urban areas. One mechanism for this is zoning by many suburban and exurban communities for very large minimum residential lot and building sizes {{in order to preserve}} home values by excluding poorer people. This shifts the market toward more expensive homes than ordinarily might be built. According to the Manhattan Institute, as much as half of the price paid for housing in some jurisdictions is directly attributable to the hidden costs of restrictive <b>zoning</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|E

Alma Gates, chair of the Committee of 100's zoning subcommittee, noted that committee members opposed such zoning changes because their neighborhoods have poor Metrobus service and high-density development would create a parking crisis in these areas.|$|E
