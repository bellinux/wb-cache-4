25|$|The {{chemical}} potential is explained here {{since it is}} the true driving force for the transport of water in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the {{chemical potential}} (Skaar, 1933). The chemical potential of unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium will occur at the equilibrium moisture content (as defined earlier) of wood when the chemical potential of the wood becomes equal to that of the surrounding air. The chemical potential of sorbed water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of activity, is accompanied by a gradient of chemical potential under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until the chemical potential is uniform throughout, resulting in a <b>zero</b> <b>potential</b> gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential, and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey et al., 2000).|$|E

The second equation of state also comes from lattice QCD and is a recent parametrization of the QGP at finite chemical potential. The third one is similar to the MIT equation of state with chemical potential and includes nonperturbative effects through the gluon condensates. We conclude that at finite chemical potential cavitation in the QGP occurs earlier than at <b>zero</b> chemical <b>potential.</b> We also consider transport coefficients from a holographic model of a non-conformal QGP at <b>zero</b> chemical <b>potential.</b> In this case cavitation does not occur...|$|R
