5000|$|The {{depletion}} of petroleum sources and increase in {{greenhouse gas emissions}} in the twenty and twenty-first centuries has been the driving factor behind the development of biofuels from microorganisms. E. coli is currently regarded as the best option for biofuel production because {{of the amount of}} knowledge available about its genome. The process converts biomass into fuels, and has proven successful on an industrial scale, with the United States having produced 6.4 billion gallons of bioethanol in 2007. Bioethenol is currently the front-runner for alternative fuel production and uses S.cerevisiae and <b>Zymomonas</b> mobilis to create ethanol through fermentation. However, maximum productivity is limited {{due to the fact that}} these organisms cannot use pentose sugars, leading to consideration of E.coli and Clostridia. E.coli is capable of producing ethanol under anaerobic conditions through metabolizing glucose into two moles of formate, two moles of acetate, and one mole of ethanol. While bioethanol has proved to be a successful alternative fuel source on an industrial scale, it also has its shortcomings, namely, its low energy density, high vapor pressure, and hygroscopicity. Current alternatives to bioethanol include biobutanol, biodiesel, propanol, and synthetic hydrocarbons. The most common form of biodiesels is fatty acid methyl esters and current synthesis strategies involve transesterification of triacylglycerols from plant oils. However, plant oils have a major limitation in availability of oil-seed supplies at competitive prices, leading to an interest in direct synthesis of fatty acid methyl esters in bacteria. This process bypasses transesterification, leading to higher energy yields and lower production cost. One of the principal obstacles in production of viable biofuels is that the maximum blend ratio of biofuel to petroleum is between 10% and 20%, Current biofuels are not compatible with high-performance, low-emission engines and costly changes in infrastructure and engine remodeling would be required. A University of Exeter study sought to overcome this obstacle through production of biofuels that can replace current fossil fuels through sustainable means, namely, the production of n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, and n-alkenes, as these are the hydrocarbons that compose current retail transport fuels. The study found suitable substrates for production of the aforementioned hydrocarbons by means of the P. luminescens fatty acid reductase (FAR) complex. A study published in Biotechnology for Biofuels used S. cerevisiae to produce short- and branched-chain alkyl esters biodiesel through metabolic engineering. Negative regulators for the INO1 gene, Rpd3 and Opi1 were deleted to boost S. cerevisiae's ability to produce fatty acid esters. To increase the production of alcohol precursors, five isobutanol pathway enzymes were overexpressed.|$|E

IHTRODUCTION The study of the fermentation process has until recent years been largely confined to that employed by yeast. The possibility of using ethanol as a renewable and less environmentally expensive energy source has been partially responsible for the interest shown in other fermenting organisms (1). <b>Zymomonas</b> mob 11 is has been reported as having some advantages over yeast as a possible producer of industrial ethanol (2), notably a high tolerance to ethanol levels and a higher yield from fermentable substrates.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} the experimental inhibitory effects of added and produced ethanol on <b>Zymomonas</b> mobilis from a mathematical point of view. A parabolic relationship {{was used to}} express the kinetics of ethanol inhibition on <b>Zymomonas</b> mobilis. The exponent n in parabolic model is less than one for inhibition exerted by added ethanol and is larger than one by produced ethanol. The added ethanol exhibits a smaller inhibitory effect than the produced ethanol. The inhibitory effect of ethanol on the biomass yield is correlated to a mathematical equation. The predictions of cell concentration using the model derived from inhibition kinetic analysis of added ethanol deviate from experimental results. The higher the ethanol level, the larger the deviation will be. However, the model developed from inhibition kinetic analysis of produced ethanol will predict the cell, glucose and ethanol profile of batch experiments with <b>Zymomonas</b> mobilis over a range of substrate concentration from 20 to 160 g/L. ^ The continuous culture studies revealed oscillations in cell concentration, glucose consumption and ethanol production. The oscillatory phenomenon {{can be attributed to}} the dynamic response of <b>Zymomonas</b> mobilis to ethanol inhibition. The current experiments suggest that the lower biomass yield of <b>Zymomonas</b> mobilis may not be an advantage for its use in ethanol production. This study indicates that it is not feasible to continuously produce ethanol by <b>Zymomonas</b> mobilis using conventional methods if a higher ethanol concentration is required. ^ The three stage continuous system with cell recycle was used to solve the oscillation problem encountered in conventional continuous fermentation.
