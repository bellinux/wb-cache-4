30|$|Within {{the more}} general context of {{magnetic}} data inversion, AFM would {{be considered to be}} “parametric inversion” (Li and Oldenburg 1996). Parametric inversion requires simple causation and “a great deal of a priori knowledge.” In the case of auroral <b>zone</b> <b>currents,</b> desirable physical quantities would be, for example, the current strength and latitudinal location of the auroral electrojets. These are useful parameters to allow computation of a model, and they clearly correspond, at least at some level of approximation, to physical quantities, based on long-standing (Boström 1964) knowledge. Here, we describe a new method of optimizing a simple forward model involving auroral <b>zone</b> <b>currents,</b> including field-aligned currents (FACs), for inversion of magnetic data alone, without the use of electrodynamic quantities such as conductivity. We give examples of use of this technique for simple models of electrojets over meridians and refer to this restricted form of use as automated meridian modeling (AMM). Connors et al. (2014) used a similar approach (the same computer code with a more general forward model and constraints) to deduce parameters for the substorm current wedge, using data from the North American region, and compare them to those inferred using an independent space-based dataset. We usually refer to the technique used and cursorily described in supplemental material, by Connors et al. (2014) as automated regional modeling (ARM), and explain below its relation to the present work.|$|R

On intermediate states with pronounced bar-trough (straight or crescentic) topographies, incident wave orbital velocities are generally dominant but significant roles are also played by subharmonic and infragravity standing waves, longshore currents, and rips.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a model of the two dimensional shallow water equations to the growth of instabilities of the longshore current at Superduck on October 18 th. Simulations are carried out using two initial current profiles. In the first case the initial longshore current profile results from a balance between bottom friction, the radiation stress gradient and lateral mixing due to turbulence. In the second case lateral mixing is neglected. The shear wave climates resulting from both simulations are analyzed and compared to data. In the first case the energy in the shear wave band is underpredicted whereas in the second case, it is overpredicted. In both cases, the initial longshore current profile changes due to lateral mixing induced by the shear instabilities. The resulting longshore current profile after shear instabilities have reached finite amplitude is found to be very similar for both cases.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{intelligent}} {{guidance and}} control laws are developed for an {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} to engage underwater targets. The engagement of underwater targets is suffered from uncertainties of the complicated underwater environment, short detecting range of the sonar seeker, the low speed ratio between vehicle and target, and longtime operations but no accurate positioning technique. Uncertainties of underwater environment includes temperature-dependent sound propagation path, sound shadow <b>zone,</b> <b>current</b> flowing direction, current flowing noise and self-noise of the vehicle. The first object {{is to find the}} target. The second object is to track the target and to re-track the target after the target lost. Seven guidance laws are developed and switched by an intelligent selecting logic for target engaging. Six control modes for yawing and pitching channel are developed. Mode selections are dependent on the guidance laws selected. Those seven guidance laws and six control laws are well tested by digital simulation verifications of four scenarios. Simulation results give the proposed method can cope with the complicated underwater environment to engage the target.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of material between the surf zone and continental shelf can {{be driven by}} pulsations in rip current velocities. However, there is a poor {{understanding of the relationship}} of these pulsations to surf zone morphology and material exchange. Moreover, understanding of rip current dynamics has focused mainly on single-barred beaches in an intermediate state, and there have been few studies on high energy beaches. Therefore, this paper undertakes preliminary research on surf <b>zone</b> <b>current</b> velocity pulsations, on a high energy beach in New Zealand. This initial analysis presents results from two days of measurements using Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters and Lagrangian GPS drifters. Drifters revealed pulsations in current velocities on the order of ? 0. 5 – 2 m s? 1 throughout the surf zone, whether inside a rip current circulation cell or not. More infragravity wave energy was associated with constant pulsations in current velocity, and lower infragravity energy with pulsation bursts, lasting 5 – 10 minutes, interspersed with periods of relatively constant velocity lasting 15 – 25 minutes. However, higher wave conditions also reduced the exit rate from the surf zone...|$|R
