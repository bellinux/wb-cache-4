40|$|Forty-six {{patients}} with refractory solid malignancies received the new platinum complex [2, 2 -bis(aminomethyl) - 1, 3 -propanediol-N-N'] [1, 1 -cyclobutanedicarboxylato] [(2 -) 0, 0 ') ] platinum (<b>zeniplatin).</b> <b>Zeniplatin</b> was given, without hydration or mannitol, as a 60 - to 90 -min i. v. infusion every 3 weeks at doses ranging from 8 to 145 mg/m 2. The {{maximum tolerated dose}} of <b>zeniplatin</b> was 145 mg/m 2. The dose-limiting toxicity of <b>zeniplatin</b> was dose-related leukopenia and neutropenia, with the nadir usually observed between 1 and 2 weeks after therapy and recovery usually occurring by 3 weeks after therapy. Thrombocytopenia was rare. The most prominent non-hematological side-effect of <b>zeniplatin</b> was nausea and vomiting. Other non-hematological side-effects were mild or absent. <b>Zeniplatin</b> did not induce significant neurological or auditory toxicity. <b>Zeniplatin</b> was not nephrotoxic at doses {{less than or equal}} to 120 mg/m 2. At 145 mg/m 2, the clearance decreased by a mean of 40 % after 2 cycles of therapy. Two patients, one with malignant melanoma and one with renal cell cancer, achieved a partial response. Pharmacokinetics of free (plasma ultrafiltrates) and total platinum in plasma were determined in 5 patients. An in vitro study of the rate and extent of <b>zeniplatin</b> binding to protein in human plasma was also performed. Free and total platinum were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectrometry; free <b>zeniplatin</b> was measured in ultrafiltrate by HPLC. Total and free plasma platinum concentrations were co-modelled using the information from the in vitro study.

40|$|The role of {{glutathione}} (GSH) in {{the effectiveness}} of and resistance to 7 platinum compounds [5 Pt(II) and 2 Pt(IV) drugs] was evaluated in a 8. 6 -fold cisplatin (CDDP) -resistant human small cell lung cancer cell line (GLC 4 /CDDP), the parent GLC 4 line, a 3. 7 -fold CDDP-resistant human embryonal carcinoma cell line (Tera-CP), and the parent Tera line (NTera 2 /D 1). Resistance factors for both CDDP-resistant cell lines were determined after continuous incubation (4 days) with CDDP. Continuous incubation with the other studied platinum drugs revealed complete cross-resistance for carboplatin (CBDCA) and <b>zeniplatin</b> but less for enloplatin (ENLO) and iproplatin in both models. Tetraplatin and lobaplatin showed, respectively, partial and complete cross-resistance in GLC 4 /CDDP but no cross-resistance in Tera-CP. GSH level, but not glutathione S-transferase activity, of the 4 cell lines correlated with platinum drug concentrations inhibiting cell survival by 50 % after continuous incubation (r = 0. 86, P < 0. 05). GSH depletion by DL-buthionine-SR-sulfoximine (BSO) increased sensitivity, as measured after a 4 -h exposure to the drugs, of GLC 4 /CDDP for CDDP 2. 0 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 7 -fold, for <b>zeniplatin</b> 1. 7 -fold, and almost {{to the level of}} the sensitive GLC 4 for ENLO, whereas no effect was observed for lobaplatin and the Pt(IV) compounds iproplatin and tetraplatin. BSO-modulating effect was higher in the sensitive GLC 4 line for most compounds; therefore reduction of resistance could be achieved only for CDDP and ENLO. In contrast to GLC 4, no modulation occurred in Tera. In Tera-CP BSO increased sensitivity for CDDP 1. 5 -fold, for CBDCA 1. 9 -fold, and for <b>zeniplatin</b> 1. 2 -fold; no effect was observed for ENLO, lobaplatin, and the Pt(IV) compounds. Reduction of CDDP resistance by BSO was known to occur with identical cellular platinum levels and higher Pt-DNA binding in GLC 4 /CCDP. However, pretreatment with BSO followed by 4 h ENLO incubation increased cellular platinum levels in both GLC 4 and GLC 4 /CDDP while Pt-DNA binding remained unchanged. In conclusion, GSH reflected sensitivity to platinum-containing drugs. However, since the involvement of GSH differed between the models and the various platinum drugs, the effect of modulation with BSO was unpredictable...|$|E
