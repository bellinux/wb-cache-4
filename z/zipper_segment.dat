40|$|Human ryanodine {{receptor}} 2 (hRyR 2) mediates calcium {{release from}} the sarcoplasmic reticulum, enabling cardiomyocyte contraction. The N-terminal region of hRyR 2 (amino acids 1 – 606) is the target of > 30 arrhythmogenic mutations and contains a binding site for phosphoprotein phosphatase 1. Here, the solution and crystal structures determined under near-physiological conditions, {{as well as a}} homology model of the hRyR 2 N-terminal region, are presented. The N-terminus is held together by a unique network of interactions among its three domains, A, B and C, in which the central helix (amino acids 410 – 437) plays a prominent stabilizing role. Importantly, the anion-binding site reported for the mouse RyR 2 N-terminal region is notably absent from the human RyR 2. The structure concurs with the differential stability of arrhythmogenic mutations in the central helix (R 420 W, I 419 F and I 419 F/R 420 W) which are owing to disparities in the propensity of mutated residues to form energetically favourable or unfavourable contacts. In solution, the N-terminus adopts a globular shape with a prominent tail that is likely to involve residues 545 – 606, which are unresolved in the crystal structure. Docking the N-terminal domains into cryo-electron microscopy maps of the closed and open RyR 1 conformations reveals C� atom movements of up to 8 A ° upon channel gating, and predicts the location of the leucine– isoleucine <b>zipper</b> <b>segment</b> and the interaction site for spinophilin and phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 on the RyR surface...|$|E
30|$|We {{calculated}} the median of DL(x,y) {{with respect to}} the whole set of <b>zipper</b> <b>segments</b> in both directions and averaged them. We performed the same calculations for DC(x,y), obtaining two indicators labeled as DL and DC in what follows. These two indicators, together with the average edge spread (Es) and the percentage of zipper pixel in the image (ZpA), were used to calculate the overall metric.|$|R
40|$|Basic region {{leucine zipper}} (bZIP) {{proteins}} represent {{a class of}} transcription factors that bind DNA using a simple, dimeric, α-helical recognition motif. The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) {{is a member of}} the CREB/ATF subfamily of bZIP proteins. CREB discriminates effectively in vivo and in vitro between the 10 bp cAMP response element (ATGACGTCAT, CRE) and the 9 bp activating protein 1 site (ATGACTCAT, AP- 1). Here we describe an alanine scanning mutagenesis study designed to identify those residues within the CREB bZIP element that control CRE/AP- 1 specificity. We find that the preference of CREB for the CRE site is controlled in a positive and negative way by acidic and basic residues in the basic, spacer and <b>zipper</b> <b>segments.</b> The CRE/AP- 1 specificity of CREB is increased significantly by four glutamic acid residues located at positions 24, 28, 35 and 41; glutamic acid residues at positions 10 and 48 contribute in a more modest way. Specificity is decreased significantly by two basic residues located at positions 21 and 23; basic residues at positions 14, 18, 33 and 34 and V 17 contribute in a more modest way. All of the residues that influence specificity significantly are located on the solvent-exposed face of the protein–DNA complex and likely participate in interactions between and among proteins, not between protein and DNA. The finding that the CRE/AP- 1 specificity of CREB is dictated by the presence or absence of charged residues has interesting implications for how transcription factors seek and selectively bind sequences within genomic DNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} protein misfolding and {{self-assembly}} into various, polymorphic aggregates {{is associated with}} a number of important neurodegenerative diseases. Only recently, crystal structures of several short peptides have provided detailed structural insights into b-sheet rich aggregates, known as amyloid fibrils. Knowledge about early events of the formation and interconversion of small oligomeric states, an inevitable step in the cascade of peptide self-assembly, however, remains still limited. We employ molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent to study the spontaneous aggregation process of steric <b>zipper</b> peptide <b>segments</b> from the tau protein and insulin in atomistic detail. Starting from separated chains with random conformations, we find a rapid formation of structurally heterogeneous, b-sheet rich oligomers, emerging from multiple bimolecular association steps and diverse assembly pathways. Furthermore, our study provides evidence that aggregate intermediates as small as dimers can be kinetically trapped and thus affect the structural evolution of larger oligomers. Alternative aggregate structures are found for both peptide sequences in the different independent simulations, some of which feature characteristics of the known steric zipper conformation (e. g., b-sheet bilayers with a dry interface). The final aggregates interconvert with topologically distinct oligomeric states exclusively via internal rearrangements. The peptide oligomerization was analyzed through the perspective of a minimal oligomer, i. e., the dimer. Thereby all observed multimeric aggregates can be consistently mapped onto a space of reduced dimensionality. This novel method o...|$|R
40|$|Fibrous {{proteins}} in the amyloid state are found both associated with numerous diseases {{and in the}} normal functions of cells. Amyloid fibers contain a repetitive spine, commonly built {{from a pair of}} -sheets whose -strands run perpendi-cular to the fiber direction and whose side chains interdigitate, much like the teeth of a zipper. In fiber spines known as homosteric <b>zippers,</b> identical protein <b>segments</b> sharing iden-tical packing environments make the two -sheets. In previous work based on atomic resolution crystal structures of homosteric zippers derived from a dozen proteins, the symmetries of homosteric zippers were categorized into eight classes. Here, it is shown through a formal derivation that each homosteric zipper class corresponds to a unique set of symmetry groups termed ‘zipper groups’. Furthermore, the eight previously identified classes do not account for all of the 15 possible zipper groups, which may be categorized into the complete set of ten classes. Because of their foundations in group theory, the 15 zipper groups provide a mathematically rigorous classification for homosteric zippers...|$|R
40|$|I {{began my}} {{research}} in the Eisenberg laboratory by studying the polymorphic nature of amyloid proteins Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP), a protein whose plaques are implicated in Type II Diabetes, and Amyloid-beta (Abeta), whose aggregates were implicated in Alzheimer's Disease. Both polypeptides are cleavage products of precursor proteins, are intrinsically disordered, and contain a highly amyloidogenic C-terminus. Later, I expanded the study of polymorphism to tumor suppressor protein p 53, whose aggregation has recently been associated with tumor progression. The last part of my dissertation involves the studies on what may constitute the toxic species of amyloid, involving work with segments from alpha-B-crystallin, IAPP, and paralogs of 53. This dissertation begins with work on structural and kinetic characterization of IAPP using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thioflavin T dye-binding assays. Here, I worked under Jed Wiltzius, who had solved several crystal structures of segments of the polypeptide each of which formed in-register steric zippers. I aided in his studies by performing EM on several of the segments and confirmed they indeed formed fibrils in vitro. I also performed EM and kinetic assays on full-length mutant and wild-type human IAPP, providing evidence that IAPP is capable of forming two distinct fibril polymorphs originating from two different steric zipper spines. These results that illustrate the molecular basis for fibril polymorphism of IAPP suggests a mechanism of protein-only encoded information transfer of different prion strains. To further understand the polymorphic nature of amyloid proteins, I then focused on structural characterization of Abeta. To elucidate Abeta polymorphism in atomic detail, my colleagues Jacques-Philippe Colletier, Arthur Laganowsky, Meytal Landau and I determined eight new micro-crystal structures of fibril-forming segments of Abeta. These structures, all of various forms of steric zippers, reveal a variety of modes of self-association of Abeta. Combining these atomic structures with previous nuclear magnetic resonance and electron tomography studies, we propose several fiber models, offering molecular models that further illustrate the polydispersity of Abeta assemblies. These structures and molecular models contribute fundamental information for understanding Abeta polymorphic nature and pathogenesis. We furthermore suggest that steric zipper interactions are also the core of protafilaments binding together, explaining the immense heterogeneity in fibril morphologies as visualized under EM and various other characterization methods. Structural characterization of fibril formation was carried to a third protein, tumor suppressor p 53. It had recently been suggested that amyloid aggregation of mutant p 53 may account for its gain of toxic function in cancer cells. Working with Alice Soragni, we elucidated the atomic details of the spine of p 53 fibrils by identifying the aggregation-prone region and crystallizing two overlapping segments within the region. I also characterized a third segment that appears to exhibit {{a different type of}} steric zipper packing than other two segments. Results show that this short region within p 53 displays the amyloid fibril polymorphism exhibited by Abeta and IAPP. In addition, these structures provide the basis for structure-based design of inhibitors of p 53 aggregation as a potential cancer therapeutic. A recent structure of a toxic amyloid oligomer, termed cylindrin, led me to also focus on a preliminary analysis of the mechanism of toxicity of this segment from alpha-B-crystallin. This was work done in collaboration with Arthur Laganowsky. I performed liposome disruption assays on the peptide, which suggests that the mechanism of toxicity of cylindrin may not be through membrane disruption. In addition, in collaboration with Professor Alex Van der Bliek, I attempted to transgenically express the peptide in C. elegans, as an in vivo model to examine toxicity. It appears cylindrin expression in C. elegans may induce slight toxicity, as it induces autophagosome accumulation and a slightly longer lifespan and larger brood size in the worms. Finally, motivated by the extreme difficulty in crystallizing segments of amyloid proteins longer than eight residues, I helped in developing a methodology that has the potential to improve the chances of crystallizing proteins whose structure has remained elusive. In collaboration with Arthur Laganowsky, Minglei Zhao and Professor Todd Yeates, we developed a new crystallization approach, termed metal-mediated synthetic symmetrization, that introduces pairs of histidine or cysteine mutations onto the surface of target proteins, and, upon coordination with metal, generates novel crystal lattice contacts or oligomeric assemblies, thus producing a variety of new crystal forms, and increasing the chances of growing diffraction-quality crystals. We examined the method on two model fusion proteins, T 4 lysozyme (T 4 L) and maltose-binding protein (MBP), and the approach resulted in 16 new crystal structures displaying a variety of oligomeric assemblies and packing modes, representing new and distinct crystal forms for these proteins. The results suggest this method has potential utlility for crystallizing target proteins of unknown structure through either direct mutations on the target protein or fusion of the target protein to metal-site mutants of T 4 L or MBP, which could serve as crystallization chaperones. Current work involves exploring non-typical steric zipper interactions. I have recently solved 3 more crystal structures of various segments of IAPP, one of which forms an out-of-register steric zipper. I have also solved 2 more out-of-register <b>zipper</b> structures of <b>segments</b> within p 63 and p 73, both paralogs of p 53 and suggested to co-aggregate with mutant p 53. Analysis of these out-of-register structures show that there is no weak interface among the hydrogen bonding interactions, unlike other structures that have displayed out-of-register packing. Interestingly, cell viability assays showed that these peptides are not very toxic, suggesting the importance of these weak interfaces in amyloid toxicity. This work further confirms the polymorphic nature of amyloids. The results embodied in this dissertation have assisted in advancing our understanding of molecular basis for amyloid fibril polymorphism and provides a preliminary characterization of the potential toxic amyloid oligomer cylindrin. In addition, the new crystallization methodology described in this work has the potential to improve the chances of crystallizing longer amyloid segments and additional proteins of unknown structure. Greater comprehension of the structural details of amyloid proteins not only can shed light into amyloid-aggregation mechanisms, but can also offer insight into the mechanisms of toxicity and aid in the development of therapeutics that target amyloid fibrillization and block aggregation...|$|R
