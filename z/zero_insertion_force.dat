25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b> When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E

50|$|Socket 1 was a 169-pin low {{insertion}} force (LIF) or <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) 17×17 {{pin grid array}} (PGA) socket suitable for the 5-volt, 16 to 33 MHz 486 SX, 486 DX, 486 DX2 and 486 OverDrive processors.|$|E
30|$|In phase II, {{the total}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> {{waveforms}} exhibited several peaks. On the other hand, the needle tip force remained constant at 0.5  N while the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increased. The total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> decreased with needle tip force.|$|R
30|$|In phase II, {{the total}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force,</b> the {{friction}} force, and the needle tip force repeatedly increased and decreased. This {{can be explained}} by the fact that muscle tissue consists of fibers and bundles [13]. The needle <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increased while the muscle fibers deformed, and then fell as the muscular tissue ruptured. The needle tip force was a constant 0.5  N while the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increased.|$|R
30|$|In phase I, {{the total}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> {{increased}} non linearly until the needle penetrated the tissue surface. Fung et al.[12] {{stated that the}} <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> present until the instant at which the needle punctures the tissue surface was generated by the viscoelasticity of the tissue.|$|R
5000|$|Socket 479 has 479 pin holes. Pentium M {{processors}} in PGA package have 479 pins that {{plug into}} this <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket. Only 478 pins are electrically connected (B2 is reserved and [...] "depopulated on the Micro-FCPGA package").|$|E
50|$|Socket 2 was a 238-pin low {{insertion}} force (LIF) or <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) 19×19 {{pin grid array}} (PGA) socket suitable for the 5-volt, 25 to 50 MHz 486 SX, 486 DX, 486 DX2, 486 OverDrive and 63 or 83 MHz Pentium OverDrive processors.|$|E
50|$|Socket 604 was {{designed}} by Intel as a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket intended for workstations and server platforms. While the socket contains 604 pins, it only has 603 electrical contacts, the last being a dummy pin.

40|$|Needle {{insertion}} into {{soft tissue}} {{is one of}} the most common medical interventions. This study provides macroscopic and microscopic observations of needle–gel interactions. A gelatin mixture is used as a soft-tissue simulant. For the macroscopic studies, system parameters, such as insertion velocity, needle diameter, gel elasticity, needle tip shape (including bevel angle) and insertion motion profile, are varied, while the maximum <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> and maximum needle deflection are recorded. The needle tip and gel interactions are observed using confocal microscopic images. Observations indicate that increasing the insertion velocity and needle diameter results in larger <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and smaller needle deflections. Varying the needle bevel angle from 8 ° to 82 ° results in the <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> increasing mono- tonically, while the needle deflection does not. These variations are due to the coupling between gel rupture and tip compression interactions, which are observed during microscopic studies. Increasing the gel elasticity results in larger <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and needle deflections. Varying the tip shapes demonstrates that bevel-tipped needles produce the larg- est deflection, but <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> does not vary among the tested tip shapes. Insertion with different motion profiles are performed. Results show that adding 1 Hz rotational motion during linear insertion decreases the needle deflection. Increasing the rotational motion from 1 Hz to 5 Hz decreases the <b>insertion</b> <b>force,</b> while the needle deflection remains the same. A high-velocity (250 mm/s and 300 mm/s) tapping during insertion yields no significant decrease in needle deflection and a slight increase in <b>insertion</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R

At that instant, the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> was {{equivalent to the}} needle tip force, and the friction force was zero. Also, the test piece surface was deformed by about 5  mm by the needle.|$|R

Materials and Methods. Temporal bones have been mounted on a 6 -axis force sensor to record <b>insertion</b> <b>forces.</b> Each temporal bone has been inserted, with a lateral wall electrode array, in random order, {{with each of the}} 3 techniques. Results. Forceps manual and commercial tool insertions generated multiple jerks during whole length insertion related to fits and starts. On the contrary, <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> with the motorized tool only rose {{at the end of the}} <b>insertion.</b> Overall <b>force</b> momentum was 1. 16 ± 0. 505 [*]N (mean ± SD, n= 10), 1. 337 ± 0. 408 [*]N (n= 8), and 1. 573 ± 0. 764 [*]N (n= 8) for manual insertion with forceps and commercial and motorized tools, respectively. Conclusion. Considering force momentum, no difference between the three techniques was observed. Nevertheless, a more predictable force profile could be observed with the motorized tool with a smoother rise of <b>insertion</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|R
50|$|Socket 3 was a 237-pin low {{insertion}} force (LIF) or <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) 19×19 {{pin grid array}} (PGA) socket suitable for the 3.3 V and 5 V, 25-50 MHz Intel 486 SX, 486 DX, 486 DX2, 486 DX4, 486 OverDrive and Pentium OverDrive processors as well as AMD Am486, Am5x86 and Cyrix Cx5x86 processors.|$|E
50|$|The FC-PGA was {{introduced}} by Intel with the Coppermine core Pentium III and Celeron processors based on Socket 370, and was later used for Socket 478-based Pentium 4 and Celeron processors. FC-PGA processors fit into <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) Socket 370 and Socket 478-based motherboard sockets; similar packages have also been used by AMD. It is still used today for mobile Intel processors.|$|E
50|$|Video game {{cartridges}} typically {{take the}} form of a PCB with an edge connector: the socket is located within the console itself. The Nintendo Entertainment System was unusual in that it was designed to use a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> edge connector: instead of the user forcing the cartridge into the socket directly, the cartridge was first placed in a bay and then mechanically lowered into position.|$|E
30|$|The forces {{acting on}} the needle tip include those {{generated}} by cutting the tissue and the reactive force from the tissue [1]. Therefore, the needle tip force {{has been difficult to}} estimate simply by considering the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b> Rather, the needle tip force should be obtained by subtracting the estimated friction force from the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b>|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The primary {{stability}} of dental implants {{is related to}} the bone in contact with the latter, and can be evaluated by resonance frequency analysis. Material and methods: Measurements were made in 133 implants (62 in the upper jaw and 71 in the mandible) of resonance frequency and <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> to determine implant stability on the day of surgery, with an evaluation of its relationship to different variables. Results: The stability quotient of the implants on the day of surgery was 62. 1, with an <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> of 35. 7 N. The <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> was proportional to the resonance frequency, with an increasing stability quotient with growing <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b> The stability quotient was greater in the larger diameter implants, shorter implants, in mandibular placement and in areas of more compact bone.

50|$|DIPs can {{be mounted}} either by {{through-hole}} soldering or in sockets. Sockets allow easy replacement of a device and eliminates {{the risk of}} damage from overheating during soldering. Generally sockets were used for high-value or large ICs, which cost {{much more than the}} socket. Where devices would be frequently inserted and removed, such as in test equipment or EPROM programmers, a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> socket would be used.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the LIF {{connectors}} {{were designed}} as a cheaper alternative compared to <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) connectors, to facilitate programming and testing of equipment. Compared with standard IC sockets, they have a lower friction force between the contacts of the device and the socket, making insertion and removal of the device easier, {{while at the same}} time eliminating the need for the complex mechanism that is used in ZIF sockets.|$|E
50|$|Programmers for EPROMs like 2716 - 27256 using common {{programming}} voltages (Vpp) of 12.5, 21, and 25 V {{were available}} by connecting {{a device to}} the user port of the C64. These devices could cost 100 USD in 1985. The device often included a <b>zero</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (ZIF) socket and a LED indicating when the EPROM chip was being programmed. The cartridge port was also used by some programmer devices.|$|E
50|$|A normal {{integrated}} circuit (IC) socket requires the IC {{to be pushed}} into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded. Low <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> (LIF) sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections.|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Trocar {{insertion}} injury {{has a high}} morbidity, mortality, and cost. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare standard trocar entry with our reduced-force closed trocar entry technique by measuring trocar <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> using a mechanical force gauge. Methods: In the operating room, the force gauge was inserted into a sterile glove and connected to the proximal portion of the trocar to measure <b>insertion</b> <b>force.</b> Through one incision, we used a standard closed trocar entry, while through the other incision, we used our reducedforce closed trocar entry technique. After making the skin incision and before trocar entry, we spread and dilated the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle with a hemostat. Results: Twenty-five patients entered the trial and none were excluded. Median trocar <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> was 3. 3 lb (range, 1. 6 to 5. 4) with our reduced-force trocar entry technique versus 6. 5 lb (range, 2. 0 to 14. 0) with the standard trocar entry (P�. 001). No complications occurred with the reduced-force trocar entry technique. Conclusion: Our reduced-force trocar entry technique decreases trocar <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> by 50 %, requires no additional instruments or cost and is fast and safe. Reducedentry force pressure may decrease the risk of trocar insertion injury...|$|R

50|$|Common sockets have {{retention}} clips {{that apply}} a constant force, {{which must be}} overcome when a device is inserted.

40|$|AbstractInsertion of {{needle into}} tissue is {{influenced}} by the cutting edges and the needle tip geometry. In this paper, we aimed at investigating the relationship between the <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> and cutting edge geometry and general mathematical models of included and inclination angles for two different needle configurations. Two new geometries, one with parabolic cut and other with parabolic surface, cut with two bevel planes have been proposed along with the corresponding mathematical models to improve the cutting edge properties. Results show that parabolic needles after cutting with bevel planes have significantly improved cutting edge properties and are better than the other common needle configurations such as bevel cut. Simulation studies predicted that the deformation and stresses are slightly higher for proposed needle tip geometries than currently available topologies.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a pilot study evaluating the efficacy of robotic assistance using novel steerable electrode arrays for cochlear implant surgery. The current surgical setup of cochlear implant surgery is briefly re-viewed and its limitations are highlighted. In {{an effort to reduce}} trauma to the structure of the cochlea, the kinematics and path planning for novel cochlear steerable electrodes are developed to minimize the interaction forces between the electrode and the cochlea. An experimental robotic system is used to com-pare the electrode <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> of steerable implants with those of non-steerable electrodes. The results of these experiments show about 70 % reduc-tion in the <b>insertion</b> <b>forces</b> when steerable electrodes are used with our pro-posed path planning and control. A distance metric explaining this reduction in the <b>insertion</b> <b>force</b> is defined and experimentally validated. Although this is only a preliminary study, we believe that these results provide a strong indica-tion to the potential of robot-assisted cochlear implant surgery to provide a sig-nificant reduction in trauma rates during cochlear implant surgery. ...|$|R
