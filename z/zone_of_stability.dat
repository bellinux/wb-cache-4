The {{stability}} {{model was}} established and the two-dimensional and three-dimensional lobes were plotted for the milling of lateral walls {{in order to}} avoid chatter occurring in the milling of lateral walls. The combination of milling parameters of free chatter can be selected in the stable <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> lobes. The stability of milling lateral walls influenced by radial depth of cut and teeth number of the milling cutter was analyzed. It is shown that the stable <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> lobes expands gradually as the spindle speed increases. The stable zone become wider as the radial depth of cut increases. The axial depth of cut limits is increased and higher productivity can be obtained as the teeth of the milling cutter decreases. Nowadays, thin-walled parts are commonly used in aeronautical and electronic industry due to their homogeneity and excellent strength to weight ratio. Thin-walled parts are made of lateral walls and webs shown in figure 1.

A pair of microphones, perpendicular to each other, is used to acquire the acoustic cutting signal resulting from milling chatter. A real-time feedback control loop is constructed for spindle speed compensation so that the milling process can be ensured to be within the stability <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> lobe diagram. Acoustic Chatter Signal Index (ACSI) and Spindle Speed Compensation Strategy (SSCS) are proposed to quantify the acoustic signal and actively tune the spindle speed respectively. By converting the acoustic feedback signal into ACSI, an appropriate Spindle Speed Compensation Rate (SSCR) can be determined by SSCS based on real-time chatter level or ACSI. Accordingly, the compensation command, referred to as Added-On Voltage (AOV), is applied to increase/decrease the spindle motor speed. By inspection on the precision and quality of the workpiece surface after milling, the efficacy of the real-time chatter prevention strategy via acoustic signal feedback is further assured...|$|E

It was found that exposure of amphipods under increased temperatures resulted in increase of HSP 70 content and lactate, activating of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and peroxidase), as well as reduction of lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase activities. Exposure of E. verrucosus at low temperatures resulted in decrease of HSP 70 content, increase of lactate level, peroxidase and lactate dehydrogenase activation, and reduction of glutathione S-transferase activity. It was noted that the most expressed changes of metabolism markers in the species observed when temperature threshold was exceeded 11 °C or then temperature dropped below 4 °C.

Here, we aimed to identify whether surpassing the thermal preference zones is correlated with shifts in universal cellular stress markers of protein integrity, responses to oxidative stress and lactate content, as indicators of anaerobic metabolism. Exposure of the Lake Baikal endemic amphipod species Eulimnogammarus verrucosus (Gerstfeldt, 1858), Ommatogammarus flavus (Dybowski, 1874) and of the Holarctic amphipod Gammarus lacustris Sars 1863 (Amphipoda, Crustacea) to increasing temperatures resulted in elevated heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) and lactate content, elevated antioxidant enzyme activities (i. e., catalase and peroxidase), and reduced lactate dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase activities. Thus, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> (absence of any significant changes) of the studied molecular and biochemical markers correlated with the behaviorally preferred temperatures.

This relationship between species-specific behavioral reactions and stress response metabolism may have significant ecological consequences that result in a thermal zone-specific distribution (i. e., depths, feed spectrum, etc.) of species.

The vibration of a free tube, surrounded by rigid tubes, is a common model used to simplify the problem. In this paper, a numerical simulation of this experiment is carried out and a database of the results is created. Some assumptions have been introduced in the simulation. The flow is considered incompressible, monophasic and non-turbulent. The tubes are fixed, except for the central one, which has a mass, a damping ratio and a frequency in vacuum. At the initial time, it is displaced from its static equilibrium. Variables of the simulation include {{the parameters of the}} tube in vacuum, the water velocity, the separation between tubes and their diameters. The results are the frequency and the damping ratio that enable the characterization of the the dimensionless mass-damping parameter. Many results have been collected, by changing these parameters. The results include a Rogers’ formula review. This formula is used to obtain the mass and damping factor from the tubes’ diameter-pitch ratio, when there is no flow. In this manuscript the influence of the water velocity on those factors is explained. When water velocity grows, the damping ratio of the central tube becomes negative, therefore, the tube becomes instable. Increasing the velocity further makes this instability disappear, generating a new <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability.</b> This initial instability is compared to other authors experimental results...|$|E

The main focus of the cruise were gas vents and seeps in the north-western Black Sea below 700 m water depth which is the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> gas hydrate <b>stability.</b> The main target area was the deep Dnepr Canyon west of the Crimea Peninsula where previous investigations had indicated the occurrence of gas seepage...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} argued that {{economic}} and monetary union (EMU) was created {{due to the}} efforts and interests of larger Member States. This article argues that the Belgian and Dutch contributions indicate that small countries {{played a significant role}} in the creation of EMU. Both countries wanted to create a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> monetary <b>stability</b> in Europe and as such have led the process by example. However, their conceptions <b>of</b> monetary <b>stability</b> were different. Belgium, as a close ally of the Commission, played a pace-setting role, especially through creative and diplomatic proposals, whilst the Netherlands played the role of gate-keeper and important ally of the Germans. Following a framework developed by Helen Wallace, the article analyses how, and under what conditions, Belgium and the Netherlands played a role in the creation of EMU.

40|$|We {{consider}} ray propagation in a waveguide with a designed sound-speed profile perturbed by a range-dependent perturbation {{caused by}} internal waves in deep ocean environments. The Hamiltonian formalism {{in terms of}} the action and angle variables is applied to study nonlinear ray dynamics with two sound-channel models and three perturbation models: a single-mode perturbation, a random-like sound-speed fluctuations, and a mixed perturbation. In the integrable limit without any perturbation, we derive analytical expressions for ray arrival times and timefronts at a given range, the main measurable characteristics in field experiments in the ocean. In the presence of a single-mode perturbation, ray chaos is shown to arise as a result of overlapping nonlinear ray-medium resonances. Poincaré maps, plots of variations of the action per a ray cycle length, and plots with rays escaping the channel reveal inhomogeneous structure of the underlying phase space with remarkable <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>stability</b> where stable coherent ray clusters may be formed. We demonstrate the possibility of determining the wavelength of the perturbation mode from the arrival time distribution under conditions of ray chaos. It is surprising that coherent ray clusters, consisting of fans of rays which propagate over long ranges with close dynamical characteristics, can survive under a random-like multiplicative perturbation modelling sound-speed fluctuations caused by a wide spectrum of internal waves.
