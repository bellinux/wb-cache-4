40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} {{a method for}} tracking particles in three dimensions designed for a two-photon microscope, which holds great promise to study cellular processes because of low photodamage, efficient background rejection, and improved depth discrimination. During a standard cycle of the tracking routine (32 ms), the laser beam traces four circular orbits surrounding the particle in two <b>z</b> <b>planes</b> {{above and below the}} particle. The radius of the orbits is half of the x,y-width of the point spread function, and the distance between the <b>z</b> <b>planes</b> is the z-width of the point spread function. The z-position is adjusted by moving the objective with a piezoelectric-nanopositioner. The particle position is calculated on the fly from the intensity profile obtained during the cycle, and these coordinates are used to set the scanning center for the next cycle. Applying this method, we were able to follow the motion of 500 -nm diameter fluorescent polystyrene microspheres moved by a nanometric stage in either steps of 20 – 100 nm or sine waves of 0. 1 – 10 μm amplitude with 20 nm precision. We also measured the diffusion coefficient of fluorospheres in glycerol solutions and recovered the values expected according to the Stokes-Einstein relationship for viscosities higher than 3. 7 cP. The feasibility of this method for live cell measurements is demonstrated studying the phagocytosis of protein-coated fluorospheres by fibroblasts...|$|R

The nonzero elements, namely ±1, ±2, ±3, are located on the horizontal axis, in the right or left side, according if they are, respectively, quadratic residues (QR) or quadratic non-residues (NQR) of p = 7. There are three circles, of radius 1, 2 and 4, corresponding to the (p &minus; 1)/2 = 3 elements {{of the group of}} modules Gr. A similar situation occurs for the elements of GI(7) of the form jb. The 16 elements on the unit circle correspond to the elements of Gs and are obtained as powers of ε.

The domains of Bilateral Laplace and z transforms are shown to extend to two-sided exponentials and fast-rising functions, which, without such generalized impulses have no transform.
