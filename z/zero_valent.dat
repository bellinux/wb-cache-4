50|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>Valent</b> Metals are {{the main}} reductants used in ISCR. The most common metal used is iron, {{in the form of}} ZVI (<b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron), and it is also the metal longest in use. However, some studies show that <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> zinc (ZVZ) could {{actually}} be up to ten times more effective at eradicating the contaminants than ZVI. Some applications of ZVMs are to clean up Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). ZVMs are usually implemented by a permeable reactive barrier. For example, iron that has been embedded in a swellable, organically modified silica creates a permanent soft barrier underground to capture and reduce small, organic compounds as groundwater passes through it.|$|E

50|$|When {{applied in}} the field, persulfate must first be {{activated}} (it must be turned into the sulfate radical) {{to be effective in}} the decontamination. The catalyst that is most commonly used is ferrous iron (Iron II). When ferrous iron and persulfate ions are mixed together, they produce ferric iron (iron III) and two types of sulfate radicals, one with a charge of −1 and the other with a charge of −2. New research has shown that <b>Zero</b> <b>Valent</b> Iron (ZVI) can also be used with persulfate with success. The persulfate and the iron are not mixed beforehand, but are injected into the area of contamination together. The persulfate and iron react underground to produce the sulfate radicals.

This Term paper focuses the attention on two reactive materials, <b>Zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron and Apatite, employed in the PRB system, giving {{an overview of the}} reactions and types of pollutants treated to date. The pollutants removal from groundwater by these two reactive materials is based on different processes, that is, reduction of organic or inorganic contaminants in the case of <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron and immobilization of inorganic pollutants in the case of Apatite. <b>Zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron acts as reductant either reducing directly the contaminants in a less harmful form or also reducing pollutants which can subsequently precipitate. At the moment, <b>Zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron is the material most frequently used in the field installations and it is particularly effective in the chemical degradation of persistent chlorinated compounds into non-toxic and harmless by-products. In general perhalogenated hydrocarbons tend to be reduced faster than hydrocarbons less halogenated and also the dechlorination is more rapid at saturated carbons (e. g.

Nitrate can be eliminated using either adsorbtion or reduction. In this study, we investigated the adsorption of nitate on zeolite and the feasibility of removal improvement using supported  <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> nano iron on zeolite via the reduction process. Materials and Methods: The study was done in two phases; investigation the zeolite and modified zeolite with <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> nano iron in nitrate removal from water. First, we determined the optimum pH and time then the effect of adsorbent and nitrate concentration was investigated in one factor at the time. The adsorption isotherm was calculated according to the optimum condition. The physical characteristics of adsorbents were determined using SEM and TEM. Results: The morphology investigation of adsorbent showed that the particle size of supported <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> nano iron on zeolite was approximately 30 - 50 nm in diameter. The best conditions were; pH 5, contact time of 120 min and 15 g/L for zeolite, while pH 3, contact time of 50 min and 7. 5 g/L for supported  <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> nano iron on zeolite. The isotherm equations revealed that nitrate adsorption follows Langmiur in both cases.

The results support the hypothesis that phenols are converted by ZVI and ZVC to products that are oxidised more rapidly by Fenton’s reagent. Experimental data shows that with ZVI, when the reaction was subjected to 300 kHz, complete phenol removal and 37 % TOC mineralization was achieved within 25 min, whereas, in the case of 20 kHz US treatment no phenol was detected after 45 min and 39 % TOC mineralization was observed. This novel study also investigated the use of <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> copper (ZVC) and results showed that with 20, 300 and 520 kHz ultrasonic rectors, phenol removal was 10 – 98 %, however, the maximum TOC mineralization achieved was only 26 %.

Five different zero-valent iron nanoparticle types comprising of bare and stabilized ZVINs with poly acrylamide(PAM), polyvinyl pyrrolidone(PVP), polystyrene sulfonate(PSS) and guar gum(GG) were synthesized and employed in this study. The sizes of zero-valent iron nanoparticles were found to be 40, 14, 17, 29 and 34 nm, using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), corresponding to bare <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron nanoparticles(ZVINs), poly acrylamide(PAM), guar gum(GG), poly styrene solfunate(PSS) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone(PVP) stabilized <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron nanoparticles (ZVINs) respectively. The trend in the sizes of ZVINs with various stabilizers in the decreasing order was found to be bare ZVIN > PVP-ZVIN >PSS-ZVIN> GG-ZVIN> PAM-ZVIN respectively.

When the ZVINs concentrations increased from 2 to 10 gr/L(0. 1 to 0. 5 g per 50 mL), the Cr(VI) removal efficiency enhanced. The most effective treatments of ZVINs and Cr(VI) for hexavalent chromium removal from solutions were 10 gr/lit (0. 5 g per 50 mL) and 20 mg/L respectively, so the efficiency of bare and polymer stabilized-ZVINs on Cr(VI) removal from solutions was found to be in the following order:  bare ZVINs < PVP-ZVIN...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{characterization}} and soot oxidation activity of Ag-based catalysts deposited on alumina, ceria and zirconia have been investigated.

Presence of silver in a positive oxidation state is favoured with CeO(2), while <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> silver dominates over alumina and zirconia. This is likely attributed to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria which stabilizes silver in an oxidized form. Soot oxidation starts at low temperature (around 500 K for Ag on ZrO(2)) with a T(50) in the range of 600 - 640 K.

Hence, {{it is necessary to}} use a suitable method for its removal. The aim of this study was synthesize and efficiency evaluation of magnetic nanocomposite of activated carbon powder-zero valent iron/silver (PAC-Feo/Ag) in the removal of phenol from aqueous solution. Material & Methods: Reduction method was used for converting bivalent iron to <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron and co-precipitation method for depositing of iron on activated carbon. For coating silver on nano <b>zero</b> <b>valent</b> iron, rapid mixing at high temperature was used. The adsorbent was characterized using SEM, TEM, and XRD techniques. Then, the impact of pH, contact time, agitation speed, temperature, adsorbent, and initial phenol concentration were evaluated and optimized by one factor at the time method. Reaction kinetics and isotherms were also determined. Results: It was found that PAC-Feo/Ag has cubic and intertwined structure and has a diameter in the range from 40 to 100 nm. The optimum conditions for phenol removal by PAC-Feo/Ag were as pH= 3, 90 min contact time, 200 rpm agitating speed and adsorbent concentration equal to 1 g/l. Isotherm and kinetic equations showed that the experimental data of phenol adsorption onto PAC-Feo/Ag are correlated to the Langmuir (R 2 > 0. 969) and pseudo-second order (R 2 < 0. 965) models, respectively.
