Filters will be optimized {{with respect to}} the following quality criteria: a) maximum coding gain of subband coding over PCM; b) minimum approximation error for <b>zonal</b> <b>sampling.</b> Only in the special case of paraunitary systems both criteria are nearly equivalent. As an example for more general systems, the design of linear phase lters (including linear phase lters with unequal even or odd lengths) will be considered (parametrizations will be brie y shown). ...|$|E

40|$|To study {{nuclear and}} {{mitochondrial}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis during the cell cycle, a 15 N-labeled log-phase population of Saccharomyces cervisiae was shifted to 14 N medium. After one-half generation, {{the cells were}} centrifuged on a sorbitol gradient in a zonal rotor to fractionate the population according to cell size and age into fractions representing the yeast cell cycle. DNA samples isolated from the <b>zonal</b> rotor cell <b>samples</b> were centrifuged to equilibrium in CsC 1 in an analytical ultracentrifuge to separate the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA components. The amount of 14 N incorporated into each 15 N-labeled DNA species was measured. The extent of nuclear DNA replication per sample was obtained by measuring the amount of hybrid DNA. The percentage of hybrid nuclear DNA increased from 6 to 68 % and then decreased to 44 % during the cell cycle. Upon ultracentrifugation, mitochondrial DNA banded as a unimodal peak in all <b>zonal</b> rotor <b>samples.</b> Mitochondrial DNA replication could be ascertained only by the 14 N level in each mitochondrial peak and not, as with nuclear DNA, by hybrid DNA level. In contrast to the nuclear incorporation pattern, the 14 N percentage in mitochondrial DNA remained effectively constant during the cell cycle. Comparison of the data to theoretical distributions showed that nuclear DNA was replicated discontinuously during the cell cycle, whereas mitochondrial DNA was replicated continuously throughout the entire mitotic cycle...|$|R

The Standard ISO 11816 - 2 /IDF 155 - 2 describes the analysis of ALP in cheese. However, the method has been questioned in the past because there have sometimes been ambiguous results. The critical operations of the analytical procedure are more precisely defined and a <b>zonal</b> cheese <b>sampling</b> adopted. ALP inactivation is firstly evaluated in the relevant steps of controlled cheese makings of hard (Emmental), semi-hard (Raschera) and soft (Chaource) cheeses. Application of the improved procedure in over 700 samples of typical cheeses from France, Italy and Switzerland proved the applicability of the method. Based on this large study, a limit for ALP activity in cheese from pasteurized milk is proposed at 10  mU/g...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{integration}} is advanced {{as a means}} of making data meet particular needs and ad value to the whole statistical data collection and management system. At the data collection level it can produce significant benefits by reducing the cost of statistical collection and the burden placed on respondents, whilst also increasing the value of outputs in terms of achieving consistency and accuracy. At the data processing level, integration enables the benefits of common technology, analytical methods, tools and processes to be fully exploited. Data from different sources and different times can be consolidated to allow for richer databases to be developed and meaningful comparative analysis and interpretation of results to be achieved. Integration implies that common statistical frames, definitions and classification are promoted and used in all statistical surveys to achieve harmony in enumeration units such as enterprise, holdings or individual. However, flexibility which may be necessary at times is lost. For instance agricultural data may require <b>zonal</b> based <b>sample</b> frames than household agricultural holdings. The periods for data collection may be agricultural seasons rather than calendar months. Thus integrating general household survey data with agricultural data may be complicated. This paper examines the issues of statistical integration from the African perspective and discusses the challenges, opportunities and the desirability of pursuing and achieving such integrated systems.

40|$|The Karhunen-Loeve {{transformation}} (KLT) is {{the best}} one among all orthogonal transformations of a given size {{from the point of}} view of the coding gain. When bits have been optimally allocated to transform coefficients, the distortion is only a function of the product of the transform coefficient variances. The KLT minimizes this product under the constraint of a given sum of these variances. It is optimum from both points of view of coding pin maximization and <b>zonal</b> <b>sampling.</b> The same objective can be pursued with subband systems. The analysis filter bank can be chosen so as to minimize the product of subband variances. That question will be dealt with in the case of a 2 -band system.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [79]) Wavelet transform {{has recently}} been used in many applications, including speech and image compression as well as multiresolution image analysis. The work presented in this thesis is an application of Harr wavelet transform to monochrome and color image compression. In this thesis, wavelet basis functions, Harr wavelet transform and its fast computational algorithm are introduced. Furthermore, the schemes for efficient monochrome and color image compression using Harr Wavelet Transform (HWT) are proposed and described. Based on these schemes, the monochrome and color image compression algorithms are developed and implemented on the existing image processing system. In each algorithm, two kinds of coefficient sampling strategies are applied: <b>zonal</b> <b>sampling</b> and adaptive threshold sampling. The color image compression method is the extension of a monochrome image compression technique on the three monochrome components called Y, I, and Q. In order to achieve high rates of compression for a color image, more coefficients on I and Q components are discarded in this study because I and Q components contain much less energy than Y component. The results show that higher rates of compression on I and Q components do not cause serious distortion on the reconstructed color image. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{explicitly}} estimate {{the short term}} variability of the migrating diurnal tide {{on a global scale}} is presented and analyzed. The method employs a least squares approach on temperature data from two satellite instruments (EOS Aura-MLS and TIMED-SABER) to estimate the daily zonal mean, migrating diurnal amplitude and migrating diurnal phase on a daily basis. The main objective of the study is to analyze the feasibility and scientific validity of this method. Biases between the instruments, revealed through a comparative analysis, are removed to reduce potential error. Effects of other tides and waves are reduced by <b>zonal</b> averaging and <b>sampling</b> at different local times. Comparisons to theory and past observation indicate that the final estimates are sufficient for scientific analysis near the equatorial-mesosphere where the solar local time sampling is well-spaced and the amplitude of the migrating diurnal tide is large compared to the un-modeled effects...|$|R
40|$|A fast, eastward signal in {{the surface}} zonal winds of the {{equatorial}} Pacific ocean is identified in ERS- 1 data that coincide with an intraseasonal tropical oscillation during the intensive observing period of TOGA COARE. The fast eastward event is compared with observations for {{the same time period}} from the TAO moorings at the equator. Similar events are identified in longer records of the ERS- 1 and TAO data. A composite event is constructed and a lag-correlation analysis is used to infer basin-scale propagation speed. The fast eastward events in the ERS- 1 data are consistent with signals in station surface pressure and station profile data quantified by MilliV and Madden and connected with first-baroclinic mode equatorial Kelvin wave propagation. 1.

40|$|The Duffy (Fy) antigens act as receptors for chemokines {{as well as}} for Plasmodium vivax {{to invade}} human RBCs. A recent study has {{correlated}} the occurrence of the FY*A allele of Duffy gene with decreased susceptibility to vivax malaria, but no epidemiological correlation between the distribution of FY*A allele and incidences of vivax malaria has been established so far. Furthermore, if such correlations exist, whether natural selection has mediated the association, is an important question. Since India is highly endemic to P. vivax malaria with variable eco-climatic and varying vivax malaria epidemiology across different regions, such a question could well be answered in Indians. For this, we have genotyped the FY gene at the - 33 (rd) and the 125 (th) nucleotide positions in 250 Indians sampled from six different zonal plus one tribal population covering the whole of India and studied possible correlations with eco-climatic and vivax malaria incidences. No FY*O allele was found, however, both the FY*A and FY*B alleles forming FY*A/FY*A, FY*A/FY*B and FY*B/FY*B genotypes were widely distributed among Indians. Five out of seven population samples significantly deviated from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectation, and two alleles (FY*A and FY*B) and the homozygote genotype, FY*B/FY*B were clinically distributed over the population coordinates. Furthermore, vivax malaria incidences {{over the past five years}} were significantly negatively and positively associated with the frequencies of the FY*A and FY*B alleles, respectively. The Northern Indians were highly differentiated from the other <b>zonal</b> population <b>samples</b> at the FY gene, as evidenced from the reconstructed Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree. The results specify the role of natural selection in the distribution of FY gene polymorphism in India. Furthermore, the hypotheses on the part of the FY*A allele in conferring protection to vivax malaria could be validated following population genetic studies in a vivax malaria epidemiological setting, such as India...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis investigates {{different}} approaches to data compression on common types of signals {{in the context of}} localization by estimating time difference of arrival (TDOA). The thesis includes evaluation of the compression schemes using recorded data, collected as part of the thesis work. This evaluation shows that compression is possible while preserving localization accuracy. The recorded data is backed up with more extensive simulations using a free space propagation model without attenuation. The signals investigated are flat spectrum signals, signals using phase-shift keying and single side band speech signals. Signals with low bandwidth are given precedence over high bandwidth signals, since they require more data in order to get an accurate localization estimate. The compression methods used are transform based schemes. The transforms utilized are the Karhunen-Loéve transform and the discrete Fourier transform. Different approaches for quantization of the transform components are examined, one of them being <b>zonal</b> <b>sampling.</b> Localization is performed in the Fourier domain by calculating the steered response power from the cross-spectral density matrix. The simulations are performed in Matlab using three recording nodes in a symmetrical geometry. The performance of localization accuracy is compared with the Cramér-Rao bound for flat spectrum signals using the standard deviation of the localization error from the compressed signals...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{method for}} {{classification}} of Ultrasound Kidney images using texture properties based on Logical operators is presented. Different regions {{of an image}} are identified based on texture properties. This algorithm mainly deals with operators and that are constructed from logical building blocks. The different classes of images are convolved by these operators and the resulting responses are converted to standard deviation matrices computed over a sliding window. Features for classification of images are extracted from these standard deviation matrices using zonal masks. Feature selection process is applied to these <b>zonal</b> <b>sampling</b> features and new set of features are used for classification. This work proposes an algorithm for classification of textures of three different categories namely Fine, Coarse and Rough. Based on this texture classification, this algorithm applied to medical images. Three kinds of Ultrasound kidney images namely Normal (NR), Medical Renal Diseases (MRD) and Cortical Cysts (CC) images are classified based on texture properties. This algorithm involves only convolution and simple arithmetic in various stages which leads faster implementation. The efficient feature space is created for textures as well as US kidney image classification. For classification, zonal mask sum features gives efficient classification for texture images. For kidney images difference features gives better results. This algorithm has higher classification accuracy and computational superiority...|$|E
40|$|Climatologies of {{atmospheric}} observations are often produced by binning measurements according to latitude and calculating zonal means. The uncertainty in these climatological means is characterised {{by the standard}} error of the mean (SEM). However, the usual estimator of the SEM, i. e., the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, holds only for uncorrelated randomly sampled measurements. Measurements of the atmospheric state along a satellite orbit cannot always be considered as independent because (a) the time-space interval between two nearest observations is often smaller than the typical scale of variations in the atmospheric state, and (b) the regular time-space sampling pattern of a satellite instrument strongly deviates from random sampling. We have developed a numerical experiment where global chemical fields from a chemistry climate model are sampled according to real sampling patterns of satellite-borne instruments. As case studies, the model fields are sampled using sampling patterns of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) satellite instruments. Through an iterative subsampling technique, and by incorporating information on the random errors of the MIPAS and ACE-FTS measurements, we produce empirical estimates of the standard error of monthly mean zonal mean model O 3 in 5 ° latitude bins. We find that generally the classic SEM estimator is a conservative estimate of the SEM, i. e., the empirical SEM is often less than or approximately equal to the classic estimate. Exceptions occur only when natural variability {{is larger than the}} random measurement error, and specifically in instances where the <b>zonal</b> <b>sampling</b> distribution shows non-uniformity with a similar zonal structure as variations in the sampled field, leading to maximum sensitivity to arbitrary phase shifts between the sample distribution and sampled field. The occurrence of such instances is thus very sensitive to slight changes in the sampling distribution, and to the variations in the measured field. This study highlights the need for caution in the interpretation of the oft-used classically computed SEM, and outlines a relatively simple methodology {{that can be used to}} assess one component of the uncertainty in monthly mean zonal mean climatologies produced from measurements from satellite-borne instruments...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} program {{has dealt with}} two projects {{in the field of}} planetary atmosphere dynamics and radiative energy transfer, one theoretical and one experimental. The first project, in radiative energy transfer, incorporated the capability to isolate and quantify the contribution of individual atmospheric components to the Venus radiative balance and thermal structure to greatly improve the current understanding of the radiative processes occurring within the Venus atmosphere. This is possible by varying the mixing ratios of each gas species, and the location, number density and aerosol size distributions of the clouds. This project was a continuation of the work initiated under a 1992 University Consortium Agreement. Under the just completed grant, work has continued on the use of a convolution-based algorithm that provided the capability to calculate the k coefficients of a gas mixture at different temperatures, pressures and spectral intervals from the separate k-distributions of the individual gas species. The second primary goal of this research dealt with the Doppler wind retrieval for the Successful Galileo Jupiter probe mission in December, 1995. In anticipation of the arrival of Galileo at Jupiter, software development continued to read the radioscience and probe/orbiter trajectory data provided by the Galileo project and required for Jupiter <b>zonal</b> wind measurements. <b>Sample</b> experiment radioscience data records and probe/orbiter trajectory data files provided by the Galileo Radioscience and Navigation teams at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, respectively, were used for {{the first phase of the}} software development. The software to read the necessary data records was completed in 1995. The procedure by which the wind retrieval takes place begins with initial consistency checks of the raw data, preliminary data reductions, wind recoveries, iterative reconstruction of the probe descent profile, and refined wind recoveries. At each stage of the wind recovery consistency is checked and maintained between the orbiter navigational data, the radioscience data, and the probe descent profile derived by the Atmospheric Instrument Team. Preliminary results show that the zonal winds at Jupiter increase with depth to approximately 150 m/s...|$|R
