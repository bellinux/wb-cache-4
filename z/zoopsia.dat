50|$|A 52-year-old woman {{suffered}} from a lifelong history of seeing faces morph into dragon-like faces and reported hallucinating similar faces several times a day. Initially she would recognise the actual faces {{but after a while}} they would become black, grew long pointy ears and a protruding snout, displayed reptile-like skin and had large protruding eyes in bright colours. She would see these faces coming towards her several times in a day from objects like electric sockets. She has also had these hallucinations in the dark. She had previously {{suffered from}} recurrent headaches, passage hallucinations (to see movements {{in the corner of the}} eyes) and <b>zoopsia</b> (she saw large ants crawling over her hands). A MRI of the brain showed minor white-matter abnormalities near the lentiform nucleus and in the semioval center. The visual perceptions she had experienced were attributed to unusual electrophysiological activity in the regions of the brain that are specialised for face and colour in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{symptomatology}} {{in childhood}} often presents diagnostic difficulties. Recurrent paroxysmal visual complaints, although {{typically associated with}} migraine, may also signal other disorders. We describe a 9 -year-old partially sighted male with paroxysmal <b>zoopsias</b> resulting from Charles Bonnet syndrome. This condition is characterized by paroxysmal visual hallucinations occurring in patients with chronic visual impairment, akin to the phantom-limb phenomenon. This pediatric case is the fourth report of this condition. We have reviewed the other cases. Case ReportsJournal ArticleSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
