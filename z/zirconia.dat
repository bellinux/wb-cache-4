5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic <b>zirconia</b> is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic <b>zirconia.</b> Both are produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zirconia</b> is a {{component}} in some abrasives, such as grinding wheels and sandpaper.|$|E
5|$|Currently under {{development}} is yttrium-stabilized <b>zirconia</b> as a solid electrolyte {{and as an}} oxygen sensor in automobile exhaust systems.|$|E
5|$|Electrodes {{containing}} {{zirconium oxide}} (or <b>zirconia)</b> increase the current capacity while improving arc stability and starting and increasing electrode life.|$|E
5|$|High {{temperature}} parts such as combustors, blades, and vanes in {{jet engines}} and stationary gas turbines {{are increasingly being}} protected by thin ceramic layers, usually composed of a mixture of <b>zirconia</b> and yttria.|$|E
5|$|Klaproth also {{discovered}} zirconium in the mineral zircon in 1789 and named {{it after the}} already known Zirkonerde (<b>zirconia).</b>|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{can be used}} to deoxidize {{vanadium}} {{and other}} non-ferrous metals. Yttria stabilizes the cubic form of <b>zirconia</b> in jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride {{ceramics}} improves the thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and <b>zirconia,</b> borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|The zirconium-containing mineral zircon {{and related}} {{minerals}} (jargoon, hyacinth, jacinth, ligure) were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral {{was not known}} to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He named the new element Zirkonerde (<b>zirconia).</b> Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed. Zirconium metal was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} burglaries by a cat burglar {{take place in}} Springfield, even {{striking}} the Simpsons' house. Among the stolen items include Lisa's saxophone, Marge's pearl necklace, Bart's stamp collection, and the handheld television. In response, the residents of Springfield arm themselves and install security devices. A neighborhood watch group is formed, and the members elect Homer as their leader. The group patrols the streets, but its members only end up violating laws further than catching criminals, turning into vigilantes. When Homer is interviewed on news anchor Kent Brockman's Smartline, the cat burglar calls the show and informs Homer that he will steal the world's largest cubic <b>zirconia</b> from the Springfield museum.|$|E
5|$|Boisbaudran {{named his}} element samaria after the mineral samarskite, {{which in turn}} honored Vassili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870). Samarsky-Bykhovets, as the Chief of Staff of the Russian Corps of Mining Engineers, had granted access for two German mineralogists, the {{brothers}} Gustav Rose and Heinrich Rose, to study the mineral samples from the Urals. In this sense samarium was the first chemical element to be named after a person. Later the name samaria used by Boisbaudran was transformed into samarium, to conform with other element names, and samaria nowadays is sometimes {{used to refer to}} samarium oxide, by analogy with yttria, <b>zirconia,</b> alumina, ceria, holmia, etc. The symbol Sm was suggested for samarium; however an alternative Sa was frequently used instead until the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his group}} begin {{guarding}} the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to intervene and catch them, but immediately ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the <b>zirconia.</b> Homer is blamed and pelted with vegetables by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat burglar is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the natural}} form of cubic <b>zirconia</b> is so rare, all cubic <b>zirconia</b> used in jewelry has been synthesized, or created by humans.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{earliest}} research into controlled single-crystal growth of cubic <b>zirconia</b> occurred in 1960s France, much work being done by Y. Roulin and R. Collongues. This technique involved molten <b>zirconia</b> being contained within a thin shell of still-solid <b>zirconia,</b> with crystal growth from the melt: The process was named cold crucible, an allusion to the system of water cooling used. Though promising, these attempts yielded only small crystals.|$|E
25|$|Specific gravity: {{the density}} of cubic <b>zirconia</b> is about 1.7 times that of diamond.|$|E
25|$|The high {{melting point}} of <b>zirconia</b> (2750°C or 4976°F) hinders {{controlled}} growth of single crystals. However, stabilization of cubic zirconium oxide had been realized early on, with the synthetic product stabilized <b>zirconia</b> introduced in 1929. Although cubic, {{it was in the}} form of a polycrystalline ceramic: it was used as a refractory material, highly resistant to chemical and thermal attack (up to 2540°C or 4604°F).|$|E
25|$|Thermal conductivity: Cubic <b>zirconia</b> is {{a thermal}} {{insulator}} whereas diamond {{is a very}} good thermal conductor.|$|E
25|$|Refractive index: cubic <b>zirconia</b> has a {{refractive}} index of 2.15–2.18, {{compared to a}} diamond's 2.42.|$|E
25|$|Hardness: cubic <b>zirconia</b> has {{a rating}} of {{approximately}} 8 on Mohs hardness scale vs. {{a rating of}} 10 for diamond.|$|E
25|$|It is a dense substance, with a {{specific}} gravity between 5.6 and 6.0 — at least 1.6 times that of diamond. Cubic <b>zirconia</b> is relatively hard, 8–8.5 on the Mohs scale— slightly harder than most semi-precious natural gems. Its refractive index is high at 2.15–2.18 (compared to 2.42 for diamonds) and its luster is adamantine. Its dispersion is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding that of diamond (0.044). Cubic <b>zirconia</b> has no cleavage and exhibits a conchoidal fracture. Because of its high hardness, it is generally considered brittle.|$|E
25|$|Along with <b>zirconia</b> and {{aluminium}} oxynitride, synthetic sapphire is {{used for}} shatter resistant windows in armored vehicles and various military body armor suits, in association with composites.|$|E
25|$|Other {{applications}} include use in refractories and {{foundry casting}} {{and a growing}} array of specialty applications as <b>zirconia</b> and zirconium chemicals, including in nuclear fuel rods, catalytic fuel converters and in water and air purification systems.|$|E
25|$|Some gems, for example, amethyst, {{have become}} less valued as methods of extracting and {{importing}} them have progressed. Some man-made gems can serve {{in place of}} natural gems, such as cubic <b>zirconia,</b> {{which can be used}} in place of diamond.|$|E
25|$|Because of its low cost, durability, {{and close}} visual {{likeness}} to diamond, synthetic cubic <b>zirconia</b> {{has remained the}} most gemologically and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976. Its main competitor as a synthetic gemstone is a more recently cultivated material, synthetic moissanite.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet-perfected skull {{crucible}} {{is still}} used today, with little variation. Water-filled copper pipes provide a cup-shaped scaffold {{in which the}} <b>zirconia</b> feed powder is packed, the entire apparatus being wrapped with radio frequency induction coils running perpendicular to the copper pipes. A stabilizer, typically calcium oxide, is mixed with the feed powder.|$|E
25|$|Yttrium {{aluminium}} garnet (YAG), Y3Al2(AlO4)3, is {{used for}} synthetic gemstones. Due to its fairly high refractive index, YAG {{was used as a}} diamond simulant in the 1970s until the methods of producing the more advanced simulant cubic <b>zirconia</b> in commercial quantities were developed. When doped with neodymium (Nd3+), these YAl-garnets may be used as the lasing medium in lasers.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} {{majority}} of grown diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic <b>zirconia</b> arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in lasers and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier synthetics, such as synthetic strontium titanate, synthetic rutile, YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) and GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet).|$|E
25|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) use a solid material, most {{commonly}} a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized <b>zirconia</b> (YSZ), as the electrolyte. Because SOFCs are made entirely of solid materials, {{they are not}} limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes. They require high operating temperatures (800–1000°C) and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, German mineralogists M. V. Stackelberg and K. Chudoba {{discovered}} {{naturally occurring}} cubic <b>zirconia</b> {{in the form}} of microscopic grains included in metamict zircon. This was thought to be a byproduct of the metamictization process, but the two scientists did not think the mineral important enough to give it a formal name. The discovery was confirmed through X-ray diffraction, proving the existence of a natural counterpart to the synthetic product.|$|E
25|$|Cubic <b>zirconia</b> is crystallographically isometric, an {{important}} attribute of a would-be diamond simulant. During synthesis zirconium oxide would naturally form monoclinic crystals, its stable form under normal atmospheric conditions. A stabilizer {{is required for}} cubic crystals to form, and remain stable at ordinary temperatures; this may be typically either yttrium or calcium oxide, the amount of stabilizer used depending on the many recipes of individual manufacturers. Therefore, the physical and optical properties of synthesized CZ vary, all values being ranges.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} diamond simulants are high-leaded glass (i.e., rhinestones) and cubic <b>zirconia</b> (CZ), both {{artificial}} materials. A {{number of other}} artificial materials, such as strontium titanate and synthetic rutile have been developed since the mid-1950s, but these {{are no longer in}} common use. Introduced {{at the end of the}} 20th century, the lab-grown product moissanite has gained popularity as an alternative to diamond. The high price of gem-grade diamonds, as well as significant ethical concerns of the diamond trade, have created a large demand for diamond simulants.|$|E
25|$|The {{hardness}} (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low {{material cost}} make CZ {{the most popular}} simulant of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic <b>zirconia.</b> These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige. Most jewelers will use a thermal probe to test all suspected CZs, a test which relies on diamond's superlative thermal conductivity (CZ, like almost all other diamond simulants, is a thermal insulator). CZ is made {{in a number of}} different colors meant to imitate fancy diamonds (e.g., yellow to golden brown, orange, red to pink, green, and opaque black), but most of these do not approximate the real thing. Cubic <b>zirconia</b> can be coated with diamond-like carbon to improve its durability, but will still be detected as CZ by a thermal probe.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} fuel on Mars. Carbon monoxide/oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the atmosphere of Mars by <b>zirconia</b> electrolysis, without using any Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel. Likewise, blast furnace gas collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on Cowper stoves and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on open hearth steelmaking.|$|E
25|$|Holmium oxide {{is one of}} the {{colorants}} {{used for}} cubic <b>zirconia</b> and glass, providing yellow or red coloring. Glass containing holmium oxide and holmium oxide solutions (usually in perchloric acid) have sharp optical absorption peaks in the spectral range 200-900nm. They are therefore used as a calibration standard for optical spectrophotometers and are available commercially. As most other oxides of rare-earth elements, holmium oxide is used as a specialty catalyst, phosphor and a laser material. Holmium laser operates at wavelength of about 2.08 micrometres, either in pulsed or continuous regime. This laser is eye safe and is used in medicine, LIDARs, wind velocity measurements and atmosphere monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Later, Soviet {{scientists}} under V. V. Osiko at the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow {{perfected the}} technique, {{which was then}} named skull crucible (an allusion either {{to the shape of}} the water-cooled container or to the form of crystals sometimes grown). They named the jewel Fianit after the institute's name FIAN (Physical Institute of the Academy of Science), but the name was not used outside of the USSR. Their breakthrough was published in 1973, and commercial production began in 1976. In 1977 cubic <b>zirconia</b> begun to be mass-produced in the jewelry marketplace. By 1980 annual global production had reached 50 million carats (10 tonnes).|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusions}} seen in moissanite {{are also}} characteristic: most will have fine, white, subparallel growth tubes or needles oriented {{perpendicular to the}} stone's table. It is conceivable that these growth tubes could be mistaken for laser drill holes that are sometimes seen in diamond (see diamond enhancement), but the tubes will be noticeably doubled in moissanite due to its birefringence. Like synthetic rutile, current moissanite production is also plagued by an as yet inescapable tint, which is usually a brownish green. A limited range of fancy colors have been produced as well, the two most common being blue and green. Jewel-quality moissanite is produced by only one company, Charles & Colvard. Its limited availability makes moissanite about 120 times more expensive than cubic <b>zirconia.</b>|$|E
