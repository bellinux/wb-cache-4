40|$|Zinc is a {{recognised}} {{essential element}} {{for the majority}} of organisms, and is indispensable for the correct function of hundreds of enzymes and thousands of regulatory proteins. In aquatic photoautotrophs including cyanobacteria, zinc is thought to be required for carbonic anhydrase and alkaline phosphatase, although there is evidence that at least some carbonic anhydrases can be cambialistic, i. e. are able to acquire in vivo and function with different metal cofactors such as Co 2 + and Cd 2 +. Given the global importance of marine phytoplankton, zinc availability in the oceans is likely {{to have an impact on}} both carbon and phosphorus cycles. Zinc concentrations in seawater vary over several orders of magnitude, and in the open oceans adopt a nutrient-like profile. Most studies on <b>zinc</b> <b>handling</b> by cyanobacteria have focused on freshwater strains and zinc toxicity; much less information is available on marine strains and zinc limitation. Several systems for zinc homeostasis have been characterised in the freshwater species Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, but little is known about zinc requirements or <b>zinc</b> <b>handling</b> by marine species. Comparative metallo-genomics has begun to explore not only the putative zinc proteome, but also specific protein families predicted to have an involvement in zinc homeostasis, including sensors for excess and limitation (SmtB and its homologues as well as Zur), uptake systems (ZnuABC), putative intracellular zinc chaperones (COG 0523) and metallothioneins (BmtA), and efflux pumps (ZiaA and its homologues). The present review will focus on possible mechanisms for coping with zinc limitation, with a particular emphasis on marine cyanobacteria...|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} micronutrients for virtually all living organisms, and hence, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms for its homeostasis. Besides proteins involved in transmembrane transport, both extra- and intracellular zinc-binding proteins play important roles in the respective metabolic networks. Important examples for extracellular zinc transporters are mammalian serum albumins, and for intracellular <b>zinc</b> <b>handling,</b> certain metallothioneins are of relevance. The availability of protein structures including relevant metal binding sites is a fundamental prerequisite to decipher the mechanisms that govern zinc binding dynamics in these proteins, but their determination can prove to be surprisingly challenging. Due to the spectroscopic silence of Zn 2 +, combinations of biophysical techniques including electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and multinuclear NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modelling have proven to be valuable approaches to understand not only the zinc-binding properties of metallothioneins and albumins, but also the influence of other physiologically relevant competing agents. These studies have demonstrated why the bacterial metallothionein SmtA contains a site inert towards exchange with Cd 2 +, why the plant metallothionein EC from wheat is partially unfolded in the presence of Cd 2 +, and how fatty acids impact on the zinc-binding ability of mammalian serum albumins...|$|E
40|$|AbstractZinc {{dyshomeostasis}} can induce cell death. However, {{the mechanisms}} involved {{have not been}} fully elucidated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, which differ dramatically from normal cells in their <b>zinc</b> <b>handling</b> ability. Here, we studied {{the effects of the}} ionophore Zn-pyrithione (ZP) and the chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2 -pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN). Both compounds induced cell death at micromolar concentrations when incubated with androgen-dependent (LNCaP), androgen-independent (PC 3, DU 145) and androgen-sensitive (C 4 - 2) PCa cell-lines. Compared to PCa cells, RWPE 1 prostate epithelial cells were less sensitive to ZP and more sensitive to TPEN, but total cellular zinc levels were changed similarly. ZnSO 4 enhanced the toxicity of ZP, but inhibited the effects of TPEN as expected. The morphological/biochemical responses to ZP and TPEN differed. ZP decreased ATP levels and stimulated ERK, AKT and PKC phosphorylation. DNA laddering was observed only at low doses of ZP but all doses of TPEN. TPEN activated caspase 3 / 7 and induced PARP-cleavage, DNA-fragmentation, ROS-formation and apoptotic bodies. PKC and ERK-pathway inhibitors, and antioxidants protected against ZP-induced but not TPEN-induced death. Inhibitors of MPTP-opening protected both. Cell death in response to TPEN (but not ZP) was diminished by a calpain inhibitor and largely prevented by a caspase 3 inhibitor. Overall, the results indicated primarily a necrotic cell death for ZP and an apoptotic cell death for TPEN. The enhanced sensitivity of PCa cells to ZP and the apparent ability of ZP and TPEN to kill quiescent and rapidly dividing cells in a p 53 -independent manner suggest that ZP/TPEN might be used to develop adjunct treatments for PCa...|$|E
50|$|The knives of {{collectors}} may be antiques or even {{marketed as}} collectible. Antiques are knives at least 100 years old; collectible knives {{are of a}} later vintage than antique, and may even be new. Collectors and dealers may use the word vintage to describe older collectibles. Some knives which were once everyday objects may now be collectible since almost all those once produced have been destroyed or discarded, like certain WW2 era knives made with <b>zinc</b> alloy <b>handles</b> which are rapidly degrading due to the material's shelf life. Some collectors collect only in childhood while others {{continue to do so}} throughout their lives and usually modify their collecting goals later in life.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} the steel used for most {{galvanizing}} (and tinplate) applications makes scrap derived from their production and use a premier solid charge material for steelmaking. In 1989 the AISI created a Task Force to define the issues and to recommend technologically and economically sound approaches to assure continued, unhindered recyclability of the growing volume of galvanized scrap. The AISI program addressed the treatment of full-sized industrial bales of scrap. The current, on-going MRI (US) [...] Argonne National Laboratory program is focused on ``loose`` scrap from industrial and post-consumer sources. Results from these programs, issues of scrap management from source to steel melting, the choices for <b>handling</b> <b>zinc</b> in iron and steelmaking and the benefits/costs for removal of zinc (and lead) from scrap prior to melting in BOF and foundry operations are reviewed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Urban cemeteries {{were more}} {{sanitary}} (a place to safely dispose of decomposing corpses) {{than they were}} aesthetically pleasing. Corpses were usually buried wrapped in cloth, since coffins, burial vaults, and above-ground crypts inhibited the process of decomposition. Nonetheless, urban cemeteries which were heavily used were often very unhealthy. Receiving vaults and crypts often needed to be aired before entering, as decomposing corpses used up so much oxygen that even candles could not remain lit. The sheer stench from decomposing corpses, even when buried deeply, was overpowering in areas adjacent to the urban cemetery. Decomposition {{of the human body}} releases significant pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses which can cause disease and illness, and many urban cemeteries were located without consideration for local groundwater. Modern burials in urban cemeteries also release toxic chemicals associated with embalming, such as arsenic, formaldehyde, and mercury. Coffins and burial equipment can also release significant amounts of toxic chemicals such as arsenic (used to preserve coffin wood) and formaldehyde (used in varnishes and as a sealant) and toxic metals such as copper, lead, and <b>zinc</b> (from coffin <b>handles</b> and flanges).|$|R
40|$|The {{activation}} {{process of}} secretory or membrane-bound zinc enzymes {{is thought to}} be a highly coordinated process involving zinc transport, trafficking, transfer and coordination. We have previously shown that secretory and membrane-bound zinc enzymes are activated in the early secretory pathway (ESP) via zinc-loading by the zinc transporter 5 (ZnT 5) -ZnT 6 hetero-complex and ZnT 7 homo-complex (zinc transport complexes). However, how other proteins conducting zinc metabolism affect the activation of these enzymes remains unknown. Here, we investigated this issue by disruption and re-expression of genes known to be involved in cytoplasmic zinc metabolism, using a zinc enzyme, tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), as a reporter. We found that TNAP activity was significantly reduced in cells deficient in ZnT 1, Metallothionein (MT) and ZnT 4 genes (ZnT 1 (-/-) MT(-/-) ZnT 4 (-/-) cells), in spite of increased cytosolic zinc levels. The reduced TNAP activity in ZnT 1 (-/-) MT(-/-) ZnT 4 (-/-) cells was not restored when cytosolic zinc levels were normalized to levels comparable with those of wild-type cells, but was reversely restored by extreme zinc supplementation via zinc-loading by the zinc transport complexes. Moreover, the reduced TNAP activity was adequately restored by re-expression of mammalian counterparts of ZnT 1, MT and ZnT 4, but not by zinc transport-incompetent mutants of ZnT 1 and ZnT 4. In ZnT 1 (-/-) MT(-/-) ZnT 4 (-/-) cells, the secretory pathway normally operates. These findings suggest that cooperative <b>zinc</b> <b>handling</b> of ZnT 1, MT and ZnT 4 in the cytoplasm is required for full activation of TNAP in the ESP, and present clear evidence that the activation process of zinc enzymes is elaborately controlled...|$|E
