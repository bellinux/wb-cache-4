Dill, IBM Journal of R&D, Vol 28, No. 4, July 1984, pp. 379-393. To use the <b>video</b> <b>port,</b> the controller first uses the DRAM port to select the row of the memory array {{that is to be}} displayed. The VRAM then copies that entire row to an internal row-buffer which is a shift register. The controller can then continue to use the DRAM port for drawing objects on the display. Meanwhile, the controller feeds a clock called the shift clock (SCLK) to the VRAM's <b>video</b> <b>port.</b> Each SCLK pulse causes the VRAM to deliver the next data bit, in strict address order, from the shift register to the <b>video</b> <b>port.</b> For simplicity, the graphics adapter is usually designed so that the contents of a row, and therefore the contents of the shift-register, corresponds to a complete horizontal line on the display.|$|R

This metric is calculated as normalized number of transition between states at macroblock level. Based on a threshold in mean square error, this is been calculated that the macroblock got updated or not. The measure {{of the status of}} macro block updation across a window of frames provides the jerkiness artifacts (JR). This is computed as the maximum over time f the standard deviation over space of all the frames. More motion in adjacent frames will result in more value for JR.|$|R

The proposed method requires a few arithmetic operations, such that it is suitable for real time image <b>zoom,</b> <b>video</b> up-scaling and video transcoding applications in HDTV systems. Subjective evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional method in terms of edge sharpness and edge smoothness. I...|$|R
