The attachments tested on the MaxEmerge planter included: free-rolling coulter, powered coulter and trash-whipper. The functional {{performance of a}} planter (including population control, spacing control, depth control, and seedbed preparation) was evaluated;Buffalo Till-planter made a cleanly tilled seedbed with strips of residue windrowed between the rows. But the slippage of gauge wheel which powers the metering system may change with different soil and residue conditions. No trouble was encountered when operating the MaxEmerge planter in a no-till ridge field. A lower emergence rate, however, was found when compared with MaxEmerge planter with an attachment. The trash may affect the function of power coulter, when the field is under wet and heavy residue conditions. The rotary-tiller slot planter was a trouble-free planter under heavy trash conditions, but the planter needs to be redesigned for a better seed metering system;The effect of residue quantity on planter function, corn growth and yield was not significant in 1983 season. There are larger average corn grain yield differences between years than between planter treatments. This shows the overriding importance of temperature and rainfall on corn production...|$|R

A field manipulative experiment was conducted to elevate canopy temperature by 2. 08 degrees C, on average. We found that experimental warming {{had little effect on}} stomatal density, but significantly increased stomatal index due to the {{reduction in the number of}} epidermal cells under the warming treatment. Warming also significantly decreased stomatal aperture length and increased stomatal aperture width. As a result, warming significantly increased the average stomatal aperture area and stomatal aperture circumference. In addition, warming dramatically changed the stomatal spatial distribution pattern with a substantial increase in the average nearest neighbor distance between stomata on both adaxial and abaxial surfaces. The spatial distribution pattern of stomata was scale dependent with regular patterns at small scales and random patterns at larger scales on both leaf surfaces. Warming caused the stomatal distribution to become more regular on both leaf surfaces with smaller L (t) values (Ripley's K-function, L(t) is an expectation of zero for any value of t) in the warming plots than the control plots...|$|R
40|$|Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and expensive medicinal spice products in the world. Because of its high market value and premium price, saffron is often adulterated through the incorporation of other materials, such as Carthamus tinctorius L. and Calendula officinalis L. flowers, Hemerocallis L. petals, Daucus carota L. fleshy root, Curcuma longa <b>L.</b> rhizomes, <b>Zea</b> <b>may</b> <b>L.,</b> and Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. stigmas. To develop a straightforward, nonsequencing method for rapid, sensitive, and discriminating detection of these adulterants in traded saffron, we report here the application of a barcoding melting curve analysis method (Bar-MCA) that uses the universal chloroplast plant DNA barcoding region trnH-psbA to identify adulterants. When amplified at DNA concentrations and annealing temperatures optimized for the curve analysis, peaks were formed at specific locations for saffron (81. 92 °C) and the adulterants: D. carota (81. 60 °C), C. tinctorius (80. 10 °C), C. officinalis (79. 92 °C), Dendranthema morifolium (Ramat.)

Four of them could detect polymorphism between the male parents and the female parents of the two hybrids, which could be used for purity assessment of the hybrids. Moreover, the purity of seed samples of the two F 1 hybrids was identified using the SSR analysis with the four pairs of primer and isozyme analysis respectively. For one hybrid, the results obtained using the two methods are consistent, but for the other one, isozyme analysis failed to detect any polymorphism between the parental lines because they are closely related.

Organonitrofos Plus fertilizer is an enhancement of Organonitrofos fertilizer enriched with microbes {{at the beginning of the}} manufacturing process. Research was conducted in the greenhouse of Integrated Agricultural Laboratory of Lampung University. Treatment applied was a factorial of 4 × 2 × 3 with three replications in a randomized block design. The first factor was the dose of OP fertilizer (0, 10, 20, 30 Mg ha- 1), the second factor was the dose of inorganic fertilizers (without inorganic fertilizers, and with inorganic fertilizers, namely Urea 0. 44, 0. 28 SP- 36 and KCl 0. 16 Mg ha- 1), and the third factor was the dose of biochar (0, 10, 20 Mg ha- 1). By a single OP fertilizers, inorganic fertilizers, and the interaction between the OP and the inorganic fertilizers increased the weight of dry stover, cob length, cob diameter, cob with husk and cob without husk of corn. OP fertilizers which are applied in Ultisols can improve soil fertility and increase corn production so that OP fertilizer can lessen the use of inorganic fertilizer and can be used as a substitute for inorganic fertilizer. RAE values were highest in treatment of O 4 K 2 B 2 (30 Mg OP ha- 1, with inorganic fertilizer, 10 Mg biochar ha- 1) that was equal to 181 %, followed by O 2 K 2 B 3 (10 Mg OP ha- 1, with inorganic fertilizer, 20 Mg biochar ha- 1) with the difference in RAE value of 0. 5 %.

Compared with traditional plastic film mulching during entire growing stages (FM), plastic film removal at the silking stage (RM) resulted in a 6. 3 % higher average maize yield. Under the RM treatment, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen significantly increased after the 5 -yr cultivation in the 0 - to 20 -cm layer. Significant increases in extractable organic C (EOC), KMnO 4 -oxidizable C (KMnO 4 -C) and C management index (CMI) in the 0 - to 20 -cm layer, and light fraction organic C and EOC in the 20 - to 40 -cm layer were observed in response to plastic film removal after the 1 -yr treatment; the responses were more significant after 5 yr. Under the RM treatment, significant increases in microbial biomass C, light fraction organic N, extractable organic N, KMnO 4 -C and CMI were also observed after five years in the 20 - to 40 -cm layer. Moreover, KMnO 4 -C and EOC were much more sensitive than other labile SOM fractions to the application of RM, even after only 1 yr of cultivation. Therefore, compared with mulching for the whole growing season, plastic film removal at the maize silking stage is an effective option for increasing yields and enhancing SOM concentration and soil sustainability in the regions with semiarid monsoon climates that have sufficient rainfall during maize reproductive stages...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{compares the}} effect of five {{different}} direct seeding methods to the conventional tillage on the emerging and yield of silage corn (<b>Zea</b> <b>may</b> <b>L.)</b> in two different pedo-ecological conditions of Slovenia. Design/methodology/approach: A randomly selected 4 x 6 block designed field test was carried out; gliphosat treatment 1 week before seeding (V 1), mowing+focus ultra on the whole plot 3 weeks later (V 2), mowing+focus ultra in bands 3 weeks later (V 3), mowing+focus ultra in bands 3 weeks later+mowing the inter-row after emergence (V 4), conventional tillage (V 5), focus ultra on the whole plot 3 weeks after seeding (V 6). Findings: The highest emergence was on parcels with treatment V 5; 98. 99 % in Noršinci and 82. 75 % in Pohorski dvor. The (V 1) treatment influenced lowest emergence in Noršinci (82. 48 %) and Pohorski dvor (63. 25 %). The number of emerged seedlings affected the highest yield of fresh silage on V 5 (50. 590 kg ha- 1 - Nošinci and 45. 661 kg ha- 1 - Pohorski dvor) and dry matter (20. 228 kg/ha). However, {{there was no difference}} to V 1 and V 4. The penetrometer measurements showed the highest soil resistance (119. 78 N cm- 2) in Noršinci on V 3 and (185. 31 N cm- 2) in Pohorski dvor on V 4. Research limitations/implications: The experiment presented herein can be applied under similar pedo-climatical condition. Practical implications: Alternative seeding methods can reduce the fuel consumption and CO 2 emission by decreasing the number of passes on the field. Originality/value: By implementing the findings from our experiments a high intensity of soil engagement and inversion of the soil by using of mouldboard plough can be omitted on the majority of sandy and silty-loam soils.

40|$|Sap flow is a {{key process}} for water {{transfer}} in the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum (SPAC). To increase understanding of sap flow in the SPAC context, in a corn (<b>Zea</b> <b>May</b> <b>L.)</b> field, we investigated relationships between sap flow and environmental influentials at three locations. The results suggested that environmental effects on soil-plant-water relations had spatial variability. For moisture factor in environment, saturation deficit and air water potential within plant canopy had higher correlation to the sap flow, {{as compared to the}} corresponding ones outside the canopy. In plant water potential, water potentials of the upper leaves were with higher determination coefficient than those of the lower leaves and the roots, when they were related to sap flow rate. In the profile of soil water potential, soil water potentials at depths 0. 1 - 0. 3 m were correlated weakly to the sap flow rate as compared to those at depths 0. 4 and 0. 5 m, and this, we deem, should be attributed to sensitivity of plowed soil layers to changes of the above-ground environment, and the complex relations between the sap flow and soil evaporation as well as heterogeneity of stomatal behavior. This result warned us that in natural experimental conditions the response of the sap flow to soil water status in profile had great spatial differences. As regards environmental energy factors, solar net radiation just above canopy was showed having relatively closer link to the sap flow than solar radiation and photosynthetic photon flux density. Concerning temperature effect of the sap flow, soil temperature was correlated better than air and leaf temperatures to the sap flow rate. Moreover, a negative correlation to canopy resistance was seen for the sap flow rate. Potential evapotranspiration, as a comprehensive index representing some of the above environmental factors, was statistically shown having a power relation to the sap flow rate. The above results support the proposition that modeling exercise of the sap flow can not be conducted in the absen根による吸水は, 土壌-植物-大気連続体(SPAC) における水移動の重要な過程の 1 つである. 本研究では, SPAC内での根の吸水に密接に関連しでいる蒸散流の理解を深めることを目的とした. そこで本研究では, トウモロコシ(Zea <b>May</b> <b>L.)</b> 畑内の 3 地点において, 蒸散流と環境誘因との関係について研究を行った. その結果, 土壌-植物-水分の関係に対する環境影響は, 空間的不均一性を持つことが示された. 大気中の水分要因では, キャノピー内の大気の飽差や水ポテンシャルがキャノピー外のそれらに比べ, 蒸散流との高い相関関係を示した. 植物体の水ポテンシャルについては, 植物上部の葉の水ポテンシャルが下部の葉や根の場合よりも高い決定係数を示した. 土壌の水ポテンシャルのプロファイルでは, 深さ 0. 1 - 0. 3 mでの土壌の水ポテンシャルが深さ 0. 4, 0. 5 mのものよりも相関が低くなったが, これは, 耕土層は様々な地上環境の変化の影響を受けやすいことや, 根の吸水と土壌面蒸発や気孔反応の不均一性などとの複雑な関係に起因するためと考えられる. この結果は, 野外における, 土壌プロファイル内の土壌水分状態に対する根の水分吸収の応答には, 大きな空間的差異が生ずることを警告している. 環境エネルギー要因の面では, キャノピー上部の純放射量と蒸散流との相関性が, 日射量や光量子束密度よりも密接な結び付きを示した. 温度が根の吸水に及ぼす影響については, 気温や葉温よりも, 土壌温度との相関が高くなった. さらに, キャノピー抵抗と蒸散流との間には負の相関が認められた. また, 地上部の環境要因のいくつかを蒸発散能の指標として組み合わせることにより, 蒸散流とその指標との間に累乗関系が成り立った. 以上の結果は...|$|R

50|$|Doubled haploid (DH) {{plants have}} the {{potential}} to save much time in the development of inbred lines. This is achieved in a single generation, as opposed to many, which would otherwise occupy much physical space/facilities. DHs also express deleterious recessive alleles otherwise masked by dominance effects in a genome containing more than one copy of each chromosome (and thus more than one copy of each gene). Various techniques exist to create DHs. The in vitro culture of anthers and microspores is most often used in cereals, including triticale. These two techniques are referred to as androgenesis, which refers to the development of pollen. Many plant species and cultivars within species, including triticale, are recalcitrant in that the success rate of achieving whole newly generated (diploid) plants is very low. Genotype by culture medium interaction is responsible for varying success rates, as is a high degree of microspore abortion during culturing.(Johansson et al. 2000) The response of parental triticale lines to anther culture is known to be correlated to the response of their progeny. Chromosome elimination is another method of producing DHs, and involves hybridisation of wheat with maize (<b>Zea</b> <b>mays</b> <b>L.),</b> followed by auxin treatment and the artificial rescue of the resultant haploid embryos before they naturally abort. This technique is applied rather extensively to wheat. Its success is in large part due to the insensitivity of maize pollen to the crossability inhibitor genes known as Kr1 and Kr2 that are expressed in the floral style of many wheat cultivars. The technique is unfortunately less successful in triticale. However, Imperata cylindrica (a grass) was found to be just as effective as maize with respect to the production of DHs in both wheat and triticale.|$|E

Tests for selection were applied to all loci, and deviations from neutrality were detected in three loci. Sequence diversity was heterogeneous among loci, but there was no pattern of diversity along the genetic map of chromosome 1. Nonetheless, diversity was correlated (r = 0. 65) with sequence-based estimates of the recombination rate. Recombination in our sample was sufficient to break down linkage disequilibrium among SNPs.

This article evaluates change in farmer knowledge about crop genetic resources in highland Guatemala between 1927 / 37 and 2004. It concentrates on maize (<b>Zea</b> <b>mays</b> ssp. <b>mays</b> <b>L.)</b> in one Guatemalan township, Jacaltenango, {{an area with}} much ecological and maize diversity. It relies on {{a particular type of}} baseline information: lists of farmer-defined cultivars drawn up by ethnographers {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. A questionnaire format based on two independent lists of local farmer cultivars dating from 1927 and 1937 was used to assess changes in maize diversity. Comparisons between attributes given to each cultivar in the past and in 2004 were used as a partial test of the stability of cultivar identity. In farmers' perceptions, cultivar loss was low and limited to certain cultivars adapted to the warmer environments. Crop production problems were mentioned as the main motives for change. No evidence for a loss of cultivars due to the political violence of the 1980 s was found. In the lower areas many newly introduced cultivars were found, which reportedly provide solutions for the production problems the older cultivars have. The article contrasts these findings with those of an earlier study which suggested much cultivar loss due to political violence, and draws conclusions about the methodological implication...|$|R
