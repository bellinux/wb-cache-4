5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the water were allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel</b> control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|Some {{freshwater}} bivalves have very restricted ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell mussel, Villosa arkansasensis, is known {{only from the}} streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other freshwater mussel species from the southeastern US, it {{is in danger of}} extinction. In contrast, a few species of {{freshwater bivalves}}, including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, the <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel</b> (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E
40|$|General EcologyThe {{possible}} commensal {{relationship between}} benthic algae and <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> occupying the same rocky substrate was studied at Douglas Lake in Pellston, Michigan. Chlorophyll a tests {{were used to}} analyze benthic algae concentrations on three different treatments: rocks with live <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels,</b> rocks with dead <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels,</b> and rocks with no <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> with expectations to find that rocks with <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> have higher benthic algae concentrations than rocks with no <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels,</b> and rocks with live <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> have higher benthic algae density than rocks with dead <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels.</b> The study was divided into field survey, field study and laboratory study. In the field survey, I observed a trend that showed higher benthic algae concentration on rocks with zebra mussels; however, it was statistically insignificant. I compared the chlorophyll a concentration found on rocks with live and dead <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> with rocks without <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> for the field and laboratory studies, and found {{a significant difference in}} the field study, which showed that rocks with <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> had higher benthic algae concentration. Finally, I compared rocks with live <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> and dead <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> and found an insignificant difference between the two treatments for the field and laboratory study, even though the trends showed a higher concentration of benthic algae on rocks with dead <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels.</b> Since rocks with <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> showed a higher concentration of benthic algae in general, a commensal relationship between the two organisms is possible...|$|R
40|$|Rivers, Lakes, & WetlandsThe {{invasion}} of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> (Dreisenna polymorpha) {{has had a}} tremendous impact on lake habitats ever since their arrival in 1986 (O’Neill 1994). They live on the hard surfaces in the lake, which includes native mussels (unionids) and rocks. Within this study, we examined surface preferences of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> by looking at living and dead native mussel shells and rocks. We constructed a plot area on the South Fishtail Bay area of Douglas Lake and counted the number of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> we found on both living and dead unionids. After the removal of these <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels,</b> we waited seven days for recolonization to occur and recounted the number of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> that were present upon the unionids shells and a transect of rocks that were placed in the water. After collecting this data, we found there to be no preference between the three surfaces we studied. However, by examining our plot data, we discovered the recolonization rate of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels,</b> which is approximately 0. 074 <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> per native mussel per day. This data shows there is a possibility of creating a refuge for native mussels along the Douglas Lake shoreline by removing the <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> every three months...|$|R
50|$|Crayfish {{could have}} a {{significant}} impact on the densities of 1- to 5-mm-long <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels.</b> An adult crayfish consumes around 105 <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> every day, or about 6000 mussels in a season.

Smallmouth bass are a predator in the zebra mussels' adopted North American Great Lakes habitat.|$|R
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel</b> (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E
25|$|Introductions {{into the}} Great Lakes include the <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel,</b> which was first {{discovered}} in 1988, and quagga mussel in 1989. The mollusks are efficient filter feeders, competing with native mussels and reducing available food and spawning grounds for fish. In addition, the mussels {{may be a}} nuisance to industries by clogging pipes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that {{the economic impact of}} the <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel</b> could be about $5billion over the next decade.|$|E

40|$|General EcologyZebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an {{invasive}} species that {{is having a}} negative effect on the native clams (unionids) of Douglas Lake, Michigan, USA. We wanted to test if humans are helping clam fitness by cleaning off attached <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels.</b> We surveyed South Fishtail Bay, North Fishtail Bay, and around Douglas Lake Bar in Maple Bay, taking the percent coverage and mass of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> on each clam, along with the mass, length, thickness, and species of the clams found. We also built a pen in Douglas Lake with cleaned off clams in it to calculate a reattachment rate of the <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels.</b> Only two clams were found around Douglas Lake Bar, which we did not include in our statistics. However, for South and North Fishtail Bay we found significant differences for the mass of clams and the mass of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels,</b> South Fishtail Bay having heavier clams with a smaller mass of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> attached. We concluded that humans are having a positive mpact on clam fitness when they remove <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> from the shell of the clam.

25|$|There {{are also}} many {{invasive}} {{species that are}} primarily brought in the ballast water of foreign ships, usually from the ocean bordering Northeastern Asia.

40|$|Student PaperZebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an {{invasive}} species in Douglas Lake that have disrupted the aquatic community, such as decreasing {{the abundance of}} food for native bivalves. They have major consequences on the population of native mussels and fish species, such as decreased abundance and possibly extinction. To understand how to control the increasing population of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels,</b> the preference of substrate for colonization and the recolonization rate of the species must be determined. To determine this rate we measured, marked, and removed <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> off of live and dead native mussels. In addition, we introduced clean rocks to observe the colonization rate of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> on them. We then recollected the substrates and determined recolonization. Our results showed that <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> have no preference for the substrate that they recolonize. The average recolonization rate of each substrate was 0. 08 mussels per day. From our observations, we suggest a protocol for controling the population of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussels</b> and the impacts that they cause on the aquatic community. The protocol may help us create a refuge for native mussels to sustain the population in Douglas Lake...|$|R

25|$|The {{species was}} accidentally {{introduced}} into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast water transfer in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact; the consequences are quite complex as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them while consuming other invasive species. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many important to the angling industry. The goby's robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species. Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby's ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and quagga), may result in greater bioaccumulation of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because {{even though they do}} not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large scale spread of the <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel,</b> which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes.|$|E
500|$|<b>Zebra</b> <b>mussel</b> infestations in the Mississippi River, [...] Great Lakes {{and other}} Midwest rivers are also {{negatively}} affecting American paddlefish populations. [...] Zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth {{as a result}} of high rates of fecundity and recruitment. [...] As filter feeders, zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the water, altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native unionidae. [...] A few days after the fertilization of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel</b> eggs, a microscopic larva emerges called a veliger. [...] During this initial stage of development, which usually lasts a few weeks, veligers are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton. [...] Veligers are poor swimmers, making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton. However, natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long-term reduction of <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel</b> populations.|$|E
500|$|A {{monotypic}} {{habitat is}} one in which a single species of animal or plant is so dominant as to virtually exclude all other species. An example would be sugarcane; this is planted, burnt and harvested, with herbicides killing weeds and pesticides controlling invertebrates. The monotypic habitat occurs in botanical and zoological contexts, and is a component of conservation biology. In restoration ecology of native plant communities or habitats, some invasive species create monotypic stands that replace and/or prevent other species, especially indigenous ones, from growing there. A dominant colonization can occur from retardant chemicals exuded, nutrient monopolization, or from lack of natural controls such as herbivores or climate, that keep them in balance with their native habitats. The yellow starthistle, Centaurea solstitialis, is a botanical monotypic-habitat example of this, currently dominating over [...] in California alone. The non-native freshwater <b>zebra</b> <b>mussel,</b> Dreissena polymorpha, that colonizes areas of the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed, is a zoological monotypic-habitat example; the predators that control it in its home-range in Russia are absent and it proliferates abundantly. Even though its name may seem to imply simplicity as compared with [...] habitats, the monotypic habitat can be complex. Aquatic habitats, such as exotic Hydrilla beds, support a similarly rich fauna of macroinvertebrates to a more varied habitat, but the creatures present may differ between the two, affecting small fish and other animals higher up the food chain.|$|E
