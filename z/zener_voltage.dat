A thyristor is used in conjunction with a Zener diode attached to its gate, and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage,</b> the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground (in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse). This kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar, and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered.|$|E
2500|$|At {{very large}} reverse bias, beyond the {{peak inverse voltage}} or PIV, a process called reverse {{breakdown}} occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., {{a large number of}} electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The avalanche diode is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the Zener diode, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is [...] "clamped" [...] to a known value (called the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage),</b> and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-20th century, {{prior to}} the {{development}} of solid state components such as <b>Zener</b> diodes, <b>voltage</b> regulation in circuits was often accomplished with voltage-regulator tubes, which used glow discharge.|$|R
50|$|A {{subsurface}} Zener diode, {{also called}} 'buried Zener', is a device {{similar to the}} Surface Zener, but with the avalanche region located deeper in the structure, typically several micrometers below the oxide. The hot carriers then lose energy by collisions with the semiconductor lattice before reaching the oxide layer and cannot be trapped there. The Zener walkout phenomenon therefore does not occur here, and the buried <b>Zeners</b> have <b>voltage</b> constant over their entire lifetime. Most buried <b>Zeners</b> have breakdown <b>voltage</b> of 5-7 volts. Several different junction structures are used.|$|R
50|$|The emitter-base {{junction}} of a bipolar NPN transistor behaves as a Zener diode, with {{breakdown voltage at}} about 6.8 V for common bipolar processes and about 10 V for lightly doped base regions in BiCMOS processes. Older processes with poor control of doping characteristics had the variation of <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage</b> up to ±1 V, newer processes using ion implantation can achieve no more than ±0.25 V. The NPN transistor structure can be employed as a surface Zener diode, with collector and emitter connected together as its cathode and base region as anode. In this approach the base doping profile usually narrows towards the surface, creating a region with intensified electric field where the avalanche breakdown occurs. The hot carriers produced by acceleration in the intense field sometime shoot into the oxide layer above the junction and become trapped there. The accumulation of trapped charges can then cause 'Zener walkout', a corresponding change of the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage</b> of the junction. The same effect {{can be achieved by}} radiation damage.|$|E
5000|$|A Zener diode, when {{reverse biased}} (as {{shown in the}} circuit) has a {{constant}} voltage drop across it irrespective of the current flowing through it. Thus, {{as long as the}} Zener current (...) is above a certain level (called holding current), the voltage across the Zener diode (...) will be constant. Resistor, R1, supplies the Zener current and the base current (...) of NPN transistor (Q1). The constant <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied across the base of Q1 and emitter resistor, R2.|$|E
5000|$|The image shows {{a simple}} shunt voltage {{regulator}} that operates {{by way of the}} Zener diode's action of maintaining a constant voltage across itself when the current through it is sufficient to take it into the Zener breakdown region. The resistor R1 supplies the Zener current [...] as well as the load current IR2 (R2 is the load). R1 can be calculated as , where [...] is the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage,</b> and IR2 is the required load current.|$|E
50|$|Power mode {{rejection}} ratio (PMRR) {{is a term}} used in electronics and defines how much noise or voltage variations in the power supply will affect the output signal(s). This also relates to series resistors for <b>zener</b> diode <b>voltage</b> references that is affected by input voltage and temperature.|$|R
50|$|Other {{modifications}} were Amal alloy (aluminium) control levers with click-stop cable adjusters, {{production of}} which BSA took over from Amal, marketed under their 'Motoplas' accessories branding, and the <b>Zener</b> diode <b>voltage</b> regulator {{was installed in}} an aluminium heat-sink mounted high on the front frame tubes {{to benefit from the}} cooling airstream.|$|R
40|$|New automatic-level-control circuit {{protects against}} signal "overshoot. " Zener diodes and series {{capacitors}} prevent voltage spikes (caused by sudden increase in input level) from appearing at output. When spike voltage drops below breakdown <b>voltage</b> of <b>Zener</b> diodes, they turn off. Initial output level {{is determined by}} <b>Zener</b> breakdown <b>voltage</b> and capacitance of series capacitor...|$|R
50|$|The emitter-base Zener diodes {{can handle}} only smaller {{currents}} as the energy is dissipated {{in the base}} depletion region which is very small. Higher amount of dissipated energy (higher current for longer time, or a short very high current spike) causes thermal damage to the junction and/or its contacts. Partial damage of the junction can shift its <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage.</b> Total destruction of the Zener junction by overheating it and causing migration of metallization across the junction ("spiking") can be used intentionally as a 'Zener zap' antifuse.|$|E
5000|$|This circuit {{has much}} better {{regulation}} than the simple shunt regulator, since the base current of the transistor forms a very light {{load on the}} Zener, thereby minimising variation in <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage</b> due to variation in the load. Note that the output voltage will always be about 0.65V less than the Zener due to the transistor's VBE drop. Although this circuit has good regulation, it is still sensitive to the load and supply variation. This can be resolved by incorporating negative feedback circuitry into it. This regulator is often used as a [...] "pre-regulator" [...] in more advanced series voltage regulator circuits.|$|E
50|$|By using {{a voltage}} source and resistor, the clamper can be biased to bind the output voltage to a {{different}} value. The voltage supplied to the potentiometer will be equal to the offset from zero (assuming an ideal diode) {{in the case of}} either a positive or negative clamper (the clamper type will determine the direction of the offset). If a negative voltage is supplied to either positive or negative, the waveform will cross the x-axis and be bound to a value of this magnitude on the opposite side. Zener diodes can also be used in place of a voltage source and potentiometer, hence setting the offset at the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|E
40|$|Zener diodes {{are found}} to show {{breakdown}} properties at much lower bias voltages compared to the so called <b>Zener</b> breakdown <b>voltages.</b> The soft breakdown becomes conspicuous from the occurrence of a point of inflexion near {{the origin of the}} I-V characteristics. The phenomenon has been explained by interband tunneling of carriers taking place under small reverse bias voltages...|$|R
50|$|A simple {{modification}} of the previous schematic replaces the LED with three components to create a simple <b>zener</b> diode based <b>voltage</b> regulator. A better solution {{is shown in the}} next schematic example.|$|R
50|$|The BSA {{development}} team {{decided to}} keep costs down by re-using the well proven single sided front brake from the BSA Gold Star and the same full race camshaft as the BSA Lightning. Fitted with 12 volt electrics, a <b>Zener</b> diode <b>voltage</b> regulator and twin coil ignition, the Thunderbolt sold well in the important US import market and with the 3.5 imp gal fuel tank gave a range of 210 mi.|$|R
5000|$|This {{regulator}} is {{used for}} very simple low-power applications where the currents involved are very small and the load is permanently connected across the Zener diode (such as voltage reference or voltage source circuits). Once R1 has been calculated, removing R2 will allow the full load current (plus the Zener current) through the diode and may exceed the diode's maximum current rating, thereby damaging it. The regulation of this circuit is also not very good because the Zener current (and hence the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage)</b> will vary depending on [...] and inversely depending on the load current. In some designs, the Zener diode may be replaced with another similarly functioning device, especially in an ultra-low-voltage scenario, like (under forward bias) several normal diodes or LEDs in series.|$|E
50|$|In this bipolar {{junction}} transistor (BJT) implementation (Figure 4) of the general idea above, a <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage</b> stabilizer (R1 and DZ1) drives an emitter follower (Q1) loaded by a constant emitter resistor (R2) sensing the load current. The external (floating) load of this current source {{is connected to the}} collector so that almost the same current flows through it and the emitter resistor (they {{can be thought of as}} connected in series). The transistor, Q1, adjusts the output (collector) current so as to keep the voltage drop across the constant emitter resistor, R2, almost equal to the relatively constant voltage drop across the Zener diode, DZ1. As a result, the output current is almost constant even if the load resistance and/or voltage vary. The operation of the circuit is considered in details below.|$|E
5000|$|They {{can also}} be found in power {{supplies}} for digital circuits, where they are used as a sort of [...] "enhanced circuit breaker" [...] to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components.

50|$|A Zener diode can {{be applied}} to a circuit with a {{resistor}} to act as a voltage shifter. This circuit lowers the output voltage by a quantity that is equal to the <b>Zener</b> diode's breakdown <b>voltage.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{output voltage}} of the {{stabilizer}} {{is equal to}} the <b>Zener</b> diode <b>voltage</b> minus the base–emitter voltage of the transistor, UZ − UBE, where UBE is usually about 0.7V for a silicon transistor, depending on the load current. If the output voltage drops for any external reason, such as an increase in the current drawn by the load (causing a decrease in the Collector-Emitter junction voltage to observe KVL), the transistor's base–emitter voltage (UBE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again.|$|R
50|$|One {{method is}} to add {{electronic}} components such as: capacitors, snubbers, diodes, <b>Zener</b> diodes, transient <b>voltage</b> suppressors (TVS), resistors, varistors, in-rush current limiters PTC resistors, NTC resistors, voltage-dependent resistors. However, this is the least effective method as these do neither significantly influence the creation nor suppress the arc between the contacts of the electromechanical power switches, relays and contactors.|$|R
50|$|A {{conventional}} solid-state diode allows significant current {{if it is}} reverse-biased {{above its}} reverse breakdown voltage. When the reverse bias breakdown voltage is exceeded, a conventional diode is subject to high current due to avalanche breakdown. Unless this current is limited by circuitry, the diode may be permanently damaged due to overheating. A Zener diode exhibits almost the same properties, except the device is specially designed so as to have a reduced breakdown voltage, the so-called <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage.</b> By contrast with the conventional device, a reverse-biased Zener diode exhibits a controlled breakdown and allows the current to keep the voltage across the Zener diode close to the Zener breakdown voltage. For example, a diode with a Zener breakdown voltage of 3.2 V exhibits a voltage drop of very nearly 3.2 V across {{a wide range of}} reverse currents. The Zener diode is therefore ideal for applications such as the generation of a reference voltage (e.g. for an amplifier stage), or as a voltage stabilizer for low-current applications.|$|E
5000|$|Adding an emitter {{follower}} stage {{to the simple}} shunt regulator forms a simple series voltage regulator and substantially improves the regulation of the circuit. Here, the load current IR2 is supplied by the transistor whose base is now connected to the Zener diode. Thus the transistor's base current (IB) forms the load current for the Zener diode and is {{much smaller than the}} current through R2. This regulator is classified as [...] "series" [...] because the regulating element, viz., the transistor, appears in series with the load.R1 sets the Zener current (IZ) and is determined as [...] where, VZ is the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage,</b> IB is the transistor's base current, K = 1.2 to 2 (to ensure that R1 is low enough for adequate IB) and [...] where, IR2 is the required load current and is also the transistor's emitter current (assumed to be equal to the collector current) and hFE(min) is the minimum acceptable DC current gain for the transistor.|$|E
50|$|When a more {{constant}} {{output voltage}} is desired, the Joule Thief {{can be given}} a closed-loop control. In the example circuit, the Schottky diode D1 blocks the charge built up on capacitor C1 from flowing back to the switching transistor Q1 when it is turned on. A 5.6 Volt Zener diode D2 and transistor Q2 forms the feedback control: when the voltage across the capacitor C1 {{is higher than the}} threshold voltage formed by <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage</b> of D2 plus the base-emitter turn-on voltage of transistor Q2, transistor Q2 is turned on diverting the base current of the switching transistor Q1, impeding the oscillation and prevents the voltage across capacitor C1 from rising even further. When the voltage across C1 drops below the threshold voltage Q2 turns off, allowing the oscillation to happen again. If the load requires even lower ripple, in this example some delicate digital circuitry like a microcontroller, a linear regulator can be used after this to smooth the ripple out.|$|E
50|$|The stabistor (also {{called a}} forward {{reference}} diode) is the technical {{term used to}} designate a special type of semiconductor silicon diode featuring extremely stable forward voltage characteristics. These devices are specially designed for low-voltage stabilization applications requiring a guaranteed voltage over a wide current range and highly stable over temperature. In these applications, stabistors offer improved dynamic impedance (voltage change vs. current) than low <b>voltage</b> <b>zener</b> diodes where tunneling instead of avalanche current is dominant. Other typical applications include bias stabilization in class-AB output stages, clipping, clamping, meter protection, etc.|$|R
50|$|The large {{voltage drop}} and {{possibly}} large current during breakdown necessarily {{leads to the}} generation of heat. Therefore, a diode placed into a reverse blocking power application will usually be destroyed by breakdown if the external circuit allows a large current.In principle, avalanche breakdown only involves the passage of electrons and need not damage to the crystal. Avalanche diodes (commonly encountered as high <b>voltage</b> <b>Zener</b> diodes) are constructed to break down at a uniform voltage and to avoid current crowding during breakdown. These diodes can indefinitely sustain a moderate level of current during breakdown.|$|R
2500|$|A {{semiconductor}} diode's current–voltage characteristic can {{be tailored}} by selecting the semiconductor {{materials and the}} doping impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture. These techniques are used to create special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions. [...] For example, diodes are used to regulate <b>voltage</b> (<b>Zener</b> diodes), to protect circuits from high voltage surges (avalanche diodes), to electronically tune radio and TV receivers (varactor diodes), to generate radio-frequency oscillations (tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, IMPATT diodes), and to produce light (light-emitting diodes). Tunnel, Gunn and IMPATT diodes exhibit negative resistance, which is useful in microwave and switching circuits.|$|R
5000|$|The simple {{transistor}} {{current source}} from Figure 4 {{can be improved}} by inserting the base-emitter junction of the transistor in the feedback loop of an op-amp (Figure 7). Now the op-amp increases its output voltage {{to compensate for the}} [...] drop. The circuit is actually a buffered non-inverting amplifier driven by a constant input voltage. It keeps up this constant voltage across the constant sense resistor. As a result, the current flowing through the load is constant as well; it is exactly the <b>Zener</b> <b>voltage</b> divided by the sense resistor. The load can be connected either in the emitter (Figure 7) or in the collector (Figure 4) but in both the cases it is floating as in all the circuits above. The transistor is not needed if the required current doesn't exceed the sourcing ability of the op-amp. The article on current mirror discusses another example of these so-called gain-boosted current mirrors.|$|E
50|$|An example {{crowbar circuit}} {{is shown to}} the right. This {{particular}} circuit uses an LM431 adjustable zener regulator to control {{the gate of the}} TRIAC. The resistor divider of R1 and R2 provide the reference voltage for the LM431. The divider is set so that during normal operating conditions, the voltage across R2 is slightly lower than VREF of the LM431. Since this voltage is below the minimum reference voltage of the LM431, it remains off and very little current is conducted through the zener and cathode resistor. If the cathode resistor is sized accordingly, very little voltage will be dropped across it and the TRIAC gate terminal will be essentially at the same potential as MT1, keeping the TRIAC off. If the supply voltage increases, the voltage across R2 will exceed VREF and the zener will begin to regulate voltage, drawing more current through it. The voltage at the gate terminal will be pulled down to VZ (the <b>zener</b> <b>voltage),</b> exceeding the gate trigger voltage of the TRIAC and latching it on.|$|E
