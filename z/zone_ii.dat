30|$|Zone I {{falls in}} a rock-domain, while <b>zones</b> <b>II</b> to VI are {{observed}} from a domain of evaporation. The rock-water interaction arises due to dissolved ions in zone I. The change of chemical composition from domain of rock towards evaporation domain causes {{an increase of}} Na+ and Cl ^ -, and consequently a higher TDS. This {{is a result of}} influences of geogenic, anthropogenic and marine sources on groundwater body. Thus, the chemical composition of groundwater samples (<b>zones</b> <b>II</b> to VI) increases towards domain of evaporation from rock domain (zone I).|$|R

The eastern third of the park is classified as <b>zone</b> <b>II,</b> the high-activity zone. In this zone you can find most of the trails and cabins, as well as the most popular sites. Finally, a very small part (...) is classified zone III, being that zone in immediate proximity to the entrances. This zone can accommodate a great number of visitors before channeling them towards the main trails.|$|E
2500|$|Bagalkot is {{devoid of}} large canopy tree vegetation; {{the region is}} semi-arid. [...] The Krishna River, Ghataprabha River and Malaprabha River flow through the region but are non perennial. Soil in the area can be {{categorised}} as either the majority black or minority red. Black soil retains moisture and is often used for the cultivation of cotton. Rabi and jowar are primarily cultivated in Bagalkot, as are groundnut, cotton, maize, bajra, wheat, sugarcane and tobacco. The district is also rich in mineral wealth. The village of Kaladgi, located 24km {{from the town of}} Bagalkot, harbours copper. Iron ore also exists {{in the southern part of}} the district. Like much of Karnataka, the gneiss is the most common rock family. Common rock types in the region include greenstone, quartzite, sandstone and limestone. The dry climate makes the region susceptible to drought and crop failure. [...] Bagalkot has not been affected by major seismic activity due to it being located in the stable <b>Zone</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E
