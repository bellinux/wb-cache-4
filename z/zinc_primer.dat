These were, according to an owner written article in the TR Driver's Club Magazine from 1991,(http://www.trdrivers.com/tr7_sprint_article_-_1991.html) used for reliability testing. While there are no reliable details for BL's use of these actual cars, according to one source the procedure used with the TR7 and TR8 was to run a test car on the Belgian pavé track at MIRA for 1000 miles, [...] "effectively providing wear harder than a vehicle might experience in a lifetime of normal use". The same source also states that [...] "A related assessment exercise for the TR7 was the '90 day corrosion test', for which a prototype was built without the usual <b>zinc</b> <b>primer</b> or anti-corrosion treatments and the body painted white, the best colour to show up any rust streaks."

30|$|A Missouri Department of Transportation report (Myers et al. 2010) on {{structural}} steel coatings for corrosion mitigation mentions that drainage {{of water from}} the deck onto the superstructure was the primary factor leading to service failures of the coating. It was reported that inorganic zinc primers were effective at hindering corrosion; however, organic <b>zinc</b> <b>primer</b> had higher adhesive strengths. The document also reported that overcoating provides an alternative maintenance option that reduces cost and disruption of the highway system; however, it comes with an increased level of risk of early failure of the newly applied system (as opposed to the full blast and repaint approach). Additionally, polyurea type coatings were reported to be effective at producing bond strength, but the salt-induced corrosion inhibition was not as strong as the systems with a high solid <b>zinc</b> <b>primer.</b> Organic <b>zinc</b> <b>primer</b> was reported to be more effective due to higher adhesive strengths and a lower probability of the primer peeling off. A promising review of the application of micaceous iron oxide <b>zinc</b> <b>primer</b> with aliphatic polyurea polyaspartic topcoat system was reported to have almost equal performance in terms of salt-fog resistance when compared to blast cleaning and application of a zinc rich primer.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effectiveness}} of innovative polymeric coatings, polyurea and polyaspartic polyurea, to protect structural steel from corrosion was investigated through standard laboratory tests. The coating evaluation tests included salt fog test, QUV weathering test, adhesion test, and freeze-thaw stability test. These tests {{were used to}} assess the long-term performance of coating technologies compared to the conventional polyurethane type coatings, i. e. coating systems with inorganic <b>zinc</b> <b>primer,</b> epoxy intermediate coat and polyurethane topcoat. This paper presents part of results in the aforementioned evaluation tests. The results illustrate that polyaspartic coating systems are very promising for corrosion mitigation and can provide long-term adhesion strength for transportation steel structures. In addition, compared with the coating systems currently used by Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s), the polyaspatic coating systems performed equally well with even higher bond strength...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{concentrates on}} the thermal ageing of a full 3 -coat system with sacrificial pigment (<b>zinc</b> rich) <b>primer</b> on mild steel where the temperature dependence test is conducted to explore {{the correlation between the}} coating resistances with the corrosion rate underneath the coating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is introduced over a range of temperature to extract activation energies for the rate of controlling processes in the corrosion reactions. It is expected that the <b>zinc</b> rich <b>primer</b> does not form a barrier coating for the metal substrate rather it will be the most active component of the substrate in the electrochemistry. Full 3 -coat system with <b>zinc</b> rich <b>primer</b> show the extracted activation energy from coating resistance is significantly lower than the activation energy extracted from the charge transfer resistance. This suggested that the coating resistance from EIS cannot be controlling the corrosion reaction. The activation energies generated for the corrosion process here (78 – 97 kJmol- 1) are very much higher than those of ion transport through the coating (19 – 37 kJmol- 1) during early immersion. Further interesting findings come from the activation energy trends over time particularly for the corrosion process which shown that the value is decreasing where at the end of exposure, the activation energy values for coating and charge transfer resistance become quite similar. It is suggested that at this stage ion transport in the coating might be controlling the corrosion process unlike at the beginning; the activation energy is getting smaller due to coating degradation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{determine}} a suitable method for applying zinc based corrosion protection to steel fabricated in a remote area. The various methods for applying the zinc have been researched to determine their requirements and their relative advantages and limitations. The application methods identified were: *Hot-dip Galvanising *Electro-Galvanising *Metal Spray *Sherardizing *Organic <b>Zinc</b> Rich <b>Primers</b> *Inorganic <b>Zinc</b> Rich <b>Primers</b> The methods were researched to find the following information: *Application Process *Required Inspections *Known Advantages and Disadvantages *Health, Safety, and Environmental Factors *Required Infrastructure The results of the research {{were used to determine}} which of the coatings could be performed by the business. A criteria matrix was developed and used to determine this. Zinc thermal spray and both organic and inorganic <b>zinc</b> rich <b>primers</b> were deemed the most viable. The corrosion and abrasion resistance of these coatings were tested and compared with the performance of hot dip galvanising due to it being an industry standard. The results highlighted zinc thermal spray as the highest performer with greatest corrosion resistance and superior abrasion resistance over the painted coatings. The costs of the coatings were also compared with the cost of having an external supplier performing hot dip galvanising. It was found that the cost of transport made this uneconomical as expected. The cost of zinc thermal spray again proved to be the highest performer being 25 % less to apply than the painted zinc rich coatings. The net present value for acquiring the infrastructure to perform zinc thermal spray was calculated and proved that the project is worth pursuing. This has provided assurance that the application of zinc thermal spray would not only provide the customer with a cost effective alternative to hot dip galvanising, but also that it will provide a positive investment for the business. ...|$|R

40|$|During severe {{nuclear reactor}} {{accidents}} such as Chernobyl or Fukushima {{large amounts of}} radioactive iodine can be released in form of inorganic and organic iodine species into the environment. Volatile radioactive iodine species are harmful to human health when inhaled. The radioactive iodine species are concentrated in the thyroid gland where their beta particles may disturb the function to regulate the metabolism and may even induce cancer. Significant amounts of volatile organic iodides can be formed from released iodine and organic molecules which are released from paint coatings (epoxy paint top coatings, <b>zinc</b> <b>primer)</b> applied on containment surfaces, {{as well as from}} cable insulation materials. These reactions are caused by the pyrolysis and radiolysis during a severe accident scenario in light water reactors (LWR). In this work the formation and behaviour of organic iodides was investigated together with the formation of volatile and semivolatile organic substances from paints. Methyl iodide, the most feasible volatile alkyl iodide in the containment, is distributed between the water pools and the containment gas phase {{in such a way that}} significant amounts remain in the gaseous phase for potential release into the environment. Some countries like Sweden use wet-scrubber filter to reduce potential iodine release. The currently used wet-scrubber solutions are very efficient for removing elemental iodine but assumed to be less reactive towards organic iodides, such as methyl iodide. Thus these highly volatile short-chained organic iodides are likely to be released. Alternatively the release of iodine and organic iodides from the containment in case of a containment failure could be limited by sorption of those species on paint films. To be able to improve current used filter systems and paint types the reactivity of the relevant iodine species with the paint ingredients needs to be understood. Paint ingredients, such as solvents, of different paint types, with main focus on Teknopox Aqua VA paint used at Ringhals 2 nuclear power plant in Sweden, were identified and their reactions with iodine were studied. It was shown that the composition of different paint types varies significantly both qualitative and quantitative. Paints have a complex, heterogeneous chemical matrix that changes its properties with time, temperature, humidity and under the influence of irradiation. The impact on the volatile source term of iodine of the same type of paint was shown to be site and paint film age specific. Thus, freshly painted paint coatings will have a different contribution on the volatile, organic iodides chemistry during a severe nuclear accident than a paint which was for longer time exposed to reactor conditions or which is of different type...|$|E

40|$|The floors, {{concrete}} walls {{and many of}} the metal surfaces in nuclear power plant containments are coated with <b>zinc</b> <b>primers</b> or paint films to preserve the metal surfaces and simplify decontamination in the containment after the occurrence of a severe nuclear incident or accident. A chemical examination of paint films from different nuclear installations out of operation, as well as current operating ones, reveals that different types of paints are used whose composition can vary significantly. Results obtained for one type of paint at a certain nuclear site are in most cases unlikely to be comparable with sites painted with another type of paint. During normal operation and particularly during nuclear accidents, the paints will degrade under the high temperature, steam and irradiation influence. As paint and its degradation products can act as sources and depots for volatile iodine compounds, the type and aging conditions of the paint films will {{have a significant impact on}} the source term of the volatile fission product iodine. Thus, great care should be taken when extrapolating any results obtained for the interaction of radioactive iodine with one paint product to a different paint product. The main focus of the study is a comparison of the chemical profile of paint films applied in Swedish nuclear power plants. Teknopox Aqua V A, an epoxy paint recently used at Ringhals 2, and an emulsion paint used in the scrubber buildings of Ringhals 1 - 4 are compared with a paint film from Barseback nuclear power plant unit 1 that had been aged under real reactor conditions for 20 years.

25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} to avoid contact, an effective method of material separation is required.

In areas with severe exposure, lead or similar gasketing materials should be used, except between copper and aluminum.

Zincrometal(2 ̆ 7 R) is a zinc-rich-organic-coated steel product used in the automotive industry. The Zincrometal coating consists of: (1) a pretreatment layer, called Dacromet(2 ̆ 7 R), comprised primarily of zinc dust and chromic acid; and, (2) a zinc- rich organic primer, called Zincromet(2 ̆ 7 R), comprised of approximately 50 v/o zinc dust in a phenoxy resin binder. ^ In this thesis, the protective mechanisms of the Zincrometal coating were studied as a function of: (1) the pigment volume concentration of <b>zinc</b> in the <b>primer,</b> (2) the Dacromet pretreatment layer, and (3) electrical post-treatment by corona discharge. Electrochemical corrosion experiments were conducted in non-deaerated solutions of 0. 5 N NaCl in distilled water at pH = 6. ^ DC and AC electrochemical experiments showed that a 50 v/o zinc-rich primer on Dacromet (i. e., the laboratory version of the Zincrometal coating) was an effective barrier for steel, but the coating was not galvanically active. However, the 50 v/o primer applied directly to steel, with no Dacromet layer, was galvanically active. Auger electron spectroscopy showed that the Dacromet layer consists of zinc particles randomly distributed on the steel, with a thin ((DBLTURN) 1000 (ANGSTROM)) chromium oxide film covering the entire surface. The chromium oxide film is non-conducting, {{and it is a}} good barrier.

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of laser welding {{technology has been}} considered to shipbuilding structure. However, when this technology is applied to primer-coated steel, good quality weld beads are not easily obtained. Because the primer-coated layer caused the spatter, humping bead and porosity which are {{main part of the}} welding defect attributed to the powerful vaporizing pressure of zinc. So we performed experiment with objectives of understanding spatter and porosity formation mechanism and producing sound weld beads in 6 t primer coated steels by a CO 2 CW laser. The effects of welding parameters; defocused distance, welding speed, coated thickness and coated position; were investigated in the bead shape and penetration depth on bead and lap welding. Alternative idea was suggested to suspend the welding defect by giving a reasonable gap clearance for primer coated thickness. The <b>zinc</b> of <b>primer</b> has a boiling point that is lower than melting point of steel. Zinc vapor builds up at the interface between the two sheets and this tends to deteriorate the quality of the weld by ejecting weld material from lap position or leaving porosity. Significant effects of primer coated position were lap side rather than surface. Therefore introducing a small gap clearance in the lap position, the zinc vapor could escape through it and sound weld beads can be acquired. In conclusion, formation and suspension mechanism of the welding defects was suggested by controlling the factors...|$|R

40|$|A {{great deal}} of work has been {{undertaken}} throughout the world over the past 50 years to increase the corrosion resistance of plain carbon steel (PCS) or mild steel (MS), and many successful techniques were developed. For example, chemical inhibitors, modified alloys, barrier coatings, various pretreatment processes and conversion coatings. However, there are drawbacks associated {{with some of these}} practices such as acute toxicity and pollution, factors that are now strictly regulated by modern Governments throughout the world. Even though conversion coatings such as chrornate and non-chromate types (phosphates) work well for corrosion protection of certain structural materials they will be phased out in the near future due to acute toxicity to living things, environmental pollution and the cost of by-product(s) detoxification from such practices. Thus, these conventional methods need to be substituted. As many novel materials, and their derivatives, are now in existence and the prospect of substituting, soon to be, 2 ̆ 7 outdated 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 outlawed 2 ̆ 7 technology shows potential. One such group of novel materials under consideration is conductive polymers (CP 2 ̆ 7 s) and intrinsically conducting polymers (ICP 2 ̆ 7 s) or active coatings. These novel materials are believed to stabilise the metal potential in the 2 ̆ 7 passive region 2 ̆ 7 and produce and maintain the protective oxide layer(s) on the metal. Due to their low toxicity, these polymers may offer an alternative to chrornate or <b>zinc</b> containing <b>primer</b> coatings for corrosion protection...|$|R
