50|$|Systematic errors which {{change during}} an {{experiment}} (drift) {{are easier to}} detect. Measurements indicate trends with time rather than varying randomly about a mean. Drift is evident if a measurement of a constant quantity is repeated several times and the measurements drift one way during the experiment. If the next measurement {{is higher than the}} previous measurement as may occur if an instrument becomes warmer during the experiment then the measured quantity is variable and it is possible to detect a drift by checking the <b>zero</b> <b>reading</b> during the experiment {{as well as at the}} start of the experiment (indeed, the <b>zero</b> <b>reading</b> is a measurement of a constant quantity). If the <b>zero</b> <b>reading</b> is consistently above or below zero, a systematic error is present. If this cannot be eliminated, potentially by resetting the instrument immediately before the experiment then it needs to be allowed by subtracting its (possibly time-varying) value from the readings, and by taking it into account while assessing the accuracy of the measurement.|$|R

5000|$|Negative {{zero error}} {{refers to the}} fact that when the jaws of the vernier caliper are just closed, the reading is a {{negative}} reading away from the actual reading of 0.00mm. If the reading is 0.08mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.08mm.If positive,the error is subtracted from the mean <b>reading</b> the <b>instrument</b> <b>reads.</b> Thus if the <b>instrument</b> <b>reads</b> 4.39 cm and the error is +0.05, the actual length will be 4.39-0.05=4.34 cm.If negative, the error is added from the mean <b>reading</b> the <b>instrument</b> <b>reads.</b> Thus if the <b>instrument</b> <b>reads</b> 4.39 cm and as above the error is -0.05 cm, the actual length will be 4.39+0.05=4.44 cm.(Considering that, the quantity is called zero correction which should always be added algebraically to the observed reading to the correct value.) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A {{study is}} {{described}} on the Standardization of the determination of neonatal total bilirubin. A wide Variation in results was shown in surveys held in The Netherlands and Germany {{and the reasons for}} this Variation were sought. The suitability of commercial bilirubin Standards and direct <b>reading</b> <b>Instruments,</b> widely used in the neonatal field, was tested by comparing all measurements with those obtained with the candidate reference method. We found differences between the stated^values and those obtained by the reference method. However, a bias was also shown to exist between the results measured with the direct <b>reading</b> <b>Instruments</b> and those obtained with the reference method, explaining at least qualitively, the Variation seen in the surveys. In addition, problems in the calibration of the DuPont ACA are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Aviators {{commonly}} wear red lensed glasses or goggles {{prior to}} taking {{off in the}} dark {{to ensure that they}} are able to see outside of the aircraft.

50|$|The Split S, being a {{descending}} manoeuvre, {{means that}} the pilot must always ensure that he/she is starting high enough to complete the half-loop; the exact altitude needed depends on factors like the aircraft's speed, weight and manoeuvrability, likewise the terrain below the plane.

50|$|Under {{conditions}} {{where it}} is desirable to have both the photopic and scotopic systems active, red lights provide a solution. Submarines are well lit to fascilitate {{the vision of the}} crew members working there, but the control room must be lit differently to allow crew members to <b>read</b> <b>instrument</b> panels yet remain dark adjusted. By using red lights, or wearing red goggles, the cones can receive enough light to provide photopic vision (namely the high-acuity vision required for reading). The rods are not saturated by the bright red light because they are not sensitive to long-wavelength light, so the crew members remain dark adapted.Similarly, airplane cockpits use red lights so pilots can <b>read</b> their <b>instruments</b> and maps while maintaining night vision to see outside the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{additional}} hazards when diving in darkness, such as dive light failure. This {{can result in}} losing vertical visual references and being unable to control depth or buoyancy, being unable to <b>read</b> <b>instruments</b> such as dive computers and diving cylinder contents gauges, and potential separation {{from the rest of}} the diving group, boat, or shore cover. Even with a functioning light, these hazards are still present in night diving. Backup lights are recommended.|$|R

50|$|Babinet was {{interested}} in the optical properties of minerals throughout his career. He designed and created many scientific instruments utilized to determine crystalline structure and polarization properties, including the polariscope and an optical goniometer to measure refractive indices. The Babinet compensator, an accessory useful in polarized light microscopy, was built with twin, opposed quartz wedges having mutually perpendicular crystallographic axes, and is still widely employed in microscopy. This design avoids the problems inherent in the basic quartz wedge, where the <b>zero</b> <b>reading</b> coincides with the thin end of the wedge, which is often lost when grinding the plate during manufacture.|$|R
50|$|The {{galvanometer}} {{does not}} need to be calibrated, as its only function is to <b>read</b> <b>zero</b> or not zero. When measuring an unknown voltage and the galvanometer <b>reads</b> <b>zero,</b> no current is drawn from the unknown voltage and so the reading is independent of the source's internal resistance, as if by a voltmeter of infinite resistance.|$|R
50|$|As World War II began, women became {{involved}} in combat. In the United States, prior to the war, pilots typically flew only in good weather, {{so that they could}} judge ground position. Flying in combat required pilots to fly in varying conditions, and a push for instrument training began. By 1944 around 6,000 women had been trained as Link Trainer operators and were teaching male pilots how to <b>read</b> <b>instruments.</b> WAVES like Patricia W. Malone transitioned after the war to commercial flight simulation instruction, where women dominated the industry of flight training operators.|$|R

50|$|Not all {{instruments}} used {{to detect}} aerosols are suitable for monitoring occupational nanomaterial emissions because {{they may not be}} able to detect smaller particles, or may be too large or difficult to ship to a workplace. Particle counters should be able to detect a wide range of particle sizes, as nanomaterials may aggregate in the air. Adjacent work areas should be simultaneously tested to establish a background concentration, as direct <b>reading</b> <b>instruments</b> will identify the real-time quantity of all nanomaterials including incidental background particles from motor or pump exhaust or heating vessels.|$|R

It is independent of both the Earth's rotation and the direction of motion. For example, when an aeroplane carrying gravimetric <b>reading</b> <b>instruments</b> cruises {{over one of the}} poles at constant altitude, the aeroplane's trajectory follows the curvature of the earth. The first term in the formula is zero then, due to the cosine of the angle being zero, and the second term then represents the centripetal acceleration to follow the curvature of the Earth's surface.|$|R

40|$|The Department of Energy has {{constructed}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) {{to develop the}} technology for the disposal of radioactive waste from defense programs. Sandia National Laboratories had {{the responsibility for the}} experimental activities at the WIPP and fielded several large-scale Thermal/Structural Interactions (TSI) in situ tests to validate techniques used to predict repository performance. The instrumentation of these tests involved the placement of over 4, 200 gages including room closure gages, borehole extensometers, stress gages, borehole inclinometers, fixed reference gages, borehole strain gages, thermocouples, thermal flux meters, heater power gages, environmental gages, and ventilation gages. Most of the gages were remotely <b>read</b> <b>instruments</b> that were monitored by an automated data acquisition system, but manually <b>read</b> <b>instruments</b> were also used to provide early deformation information and to provide a redundancy of measurement for the remote gages. Instruments were selected that could operate in the harsh environment of the test rooms and that could accommodate the ranges of test room responses predicted by pretest calculations. Instruments were tested in the field prior to installation at the WIPP site and were modified to improve their performance. Other modifications were made to gages as the TSI tests progressed using knowledge gained from test maintenance. Quality assurance procedures were developed for all aspects of instrumentation including calibration, installation, and maintenance. The instrumentation performed exceptionally well and has produced a large quantity of quality information...|$|R

50|$|While {{the use of}} a {{barometric}} altimeter setting that provides a <b>zero</b> <b>reading</b> on the ground of the airport is a reference available to pilots, in commercial aviation it is a country-specific procedure that is not often used (it is used, e.g., in Russia, and a few other countries). Most countries (Far East, North and South America, all of Europe, Africa, Australia) use the airport's AMSL (above mean sea level) elevation as a reference. During approaches to landing, there are several other references that are used, including AFE (above field elevation) which is height referencing the highest point on the airfield, TDZE (touchdown zone elevation) or TH (threshold height) which both refer to the elevation of the landing end of the runway measured AMSL and AGL respectively.|$|R
