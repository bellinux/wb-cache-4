The averages size ZnO nanoparticle is 23. 5 nm on silicon and 17. 7 nm on porous silicon. Based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) topology analysis, surface of ZnO thin films on porous silicon was rougher compared to ZnO thin films on silicon due to substrate surface effect.

Films were deposited in the temperature range of [370 - 500 degrees C] on Si (1 1 1) substrate. Nano-disk shaped grains were grown {{on the top of}} the film surface. The morphology of the as-deposited films was found to be dependent on the substrate temperature. After annealing in air atmosphere, XRD patterns revealed a highly oriented c-axis Er:ZnO films with hexagonal wurtzite structure without any second phase. Under 488 nm excitation, the intra 4 f- 4 f green emission (H- 2 (11 / 2), S- 4 (3 / 2) -> I- 4 (15 / 2) transitions) gradually increased with increasing annealing temperature. Also, the local structure of Er changes to a pseudo-octahedral structure with C- 4 v symmetry. The ZnO film with 2. 504 at. % Er 3 + doping has the best crystalline structure and the best resolved PL spectra. Using 325 nm excitation, all the samples showed an ultraviolet emission centered at 380 nm originating from a near band EDGE emission and a broad band green emission centered at 520 nm from deep levels.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Acute {{diarrhoea}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} health challenges globally, causing millions of child deaths every year. A continued effort is made by the WHO, in collaboration with other institutions, to successfully combat diarrhoea. A new formulation for ORS (with a reduced osmolarity), in combination with zinc supplementation, was proposed to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea (WHO, 2006 : 1). Appropriate zinc supplementation for the treatment of diarrhoea includes: zinc sulfate, <b>zinc</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> and zinc gluconate. With no monographs available in The Ph. Int. for <b>zinc</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> and zinc gluconate APIs, the development thereof has become a priority to the WHO. During this study, suitable methods according to The Ph. Int. for the quality control testing of <b>zinc</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> and zinc gluconate APIs were investigated and proposed. The following monograph requirements were proposed for <b>zinc</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> API: * Identification of zinc by means of a precipitation reaction of zinc hydroxide and zinc sulfide, * Identification of acetate by means of a precipitation reaction of ferric acetate, * Clarity and colour of a 0. 05 g/ml solution, * pH value of a 0. 05 g/ml solution, * Assay by means of a complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing substances by means of a reduction reaction with potassium permanganate, o chlorides by means of a precipitation reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates by means of a precipitation reaction of barium sulfate, o arsenic by means of reaction between arsine and bromide, o aluminium, cadmium, copper, iron and lead by means of atomic absorption spectrometry. The following monograph requirements were proposed for zinc gluconate API: * Identification of zinc by means of a precipitation reaction of zinc ferrocyanide, * Identification of gluconate by means of a thin layer chromatographic separation method, * Clarity and colour of a 0. 01 g/ml solution, * pH value of a 0. 01 g/ml solution, * Water by means of the Karl Fischer method, * Assay by means of a complexometric titration with disodium EDTA, * Impurities / Limit tests: o reducing sugars by means of a reduction reaction with cupri–tartaric test solution, o chlorides by means of a precipitation reaction with silver nitrate, o sulfates by means of a precipitation reaction of barium sulfate, o heavy metals by means of a precipitation reaction of sulfides in acidic solutions, o cadmium by means of atomic absorption spectrometry, and o microbial testing if required by The Ph.

Once the methods were proven to be fit for purpose, they were assembled into the respective monographs for inclusion in The Ph. Int.
