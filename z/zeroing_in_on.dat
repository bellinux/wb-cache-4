25|$|The American {{consulate}} {{building was}} designed by Burk, Lebreton and Lamantia of New Orleans, combining the American architecture of the 1960s and features of traditional South Indian architecture. The architecture of the consulate building was inspired from the traditional houses of Thanjavur and Karaikudi. The American architect hired to design the building traveled around South India in search of inspiration before <b>zeroing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the final theme. As quoted by S. Krishnan, who accompanied Lamantia on his architectural quest in Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, Lamantia, whose roots were in Don Quixote's village, chose {{the architecture of the}} traditional houses of Thanjavur and Chettinad to blend with the American style in his design plan. Thus, the rectangular Consulate General building was built around a roofless central courtyard, with verandahs running around it and rooms opening out of them. In addition, inspired by the South Indian temple architecture, the four exterior walls were studded with chips of Pallavaram granite.|$|E

Cumberland expected a trick play when Fritz Furtick simply ran up the middle for a touchdown. One account of the play reads [...] "Heisman saw his chance to exploit a weakness in the Cumberland defense: run the ball where the ubiquitous Red Smith wasn't. So the next time Sitton started out on one of his slashing end runs, at the last second he tossed the ball back to the fullback who charges straight over center (where Smith would have been except that he was <b>zeroing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the elusive Sitton) and went all the way for the tying touchdown." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said on 4 March that {{he could}} not rule out {{involvement}} of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the Lahore attacks. Some European intelligence sources supported this suspicion. Sri Lankan military officials, on the other hand, were skeptical of LTTE involvement, and an LTTE spokesperson labelled reports of LTTE connection as 'not true'. A junior Pakistani cabinet minister said that the government had evidence that the attackers came from India, but Information Minister Sherry Rehman denied any government knowledge of Indian involvement. On 6 March 2009, government officials had ruled out the involvement of Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing and LTTE and were <b>zeroing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Lashkar-e-Taiba.

2500|$|One of Hathcock's {{most famous}} accomplishments was {{shooting}} an enemy sniper through the enemy's own rifle scope, hitting {{him in the}} eye and killing him. Hathcock and John Roland Burke, his spotter, were stalking the enemy sniper in the jungle near Hill 55, the firebase from which Hathcock was operating, southwest of Da Nang. The sniper, known only as the [...] "Cobra," [...] had already killed several Marines and was believed to have been sent specifically to kill Hathcock. When Hathcock saw a flash of light (light reflecting off the enemy sniper's scope) in the bushes, he fired at it, shooting through the scope and killing the sniper. Surveying the situation, Hathcock concluded that the only feasible way he could have put the bullet straight down the enemy's scope, through his eye, would have been if both snipers were <b>zeroing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> each other at the same time, which gave him only a few seconds to act, and Hathcock fired first. Given the flight time of rounds at long ranges, the snipers could have simultaneously killed one another. Hathcock took possession of the dead sniper's rifle, hoping to bring it home as a [...] "trophy", but after he turned it in and tagged it, it was stolen from the armory.|$|E
