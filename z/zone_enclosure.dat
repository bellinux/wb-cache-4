40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} Air {{pressurisation}} When outdoor air {{is the main}} source of pollutants indoors, mechanical air ventilation can be viewed as having two fronts of action in controlling indoor air quality. The first is its capacity to remove indoor air pollutants by dilution, and the second is its capability to prevent, through its pressurisation effect, the pollutant source (i. e. untreated outdoor air) from infiltrating, through the building envelope, to the occupied space. This paper discusses the impact of combined dilution and pressurisation potentials of ventilation air on indoor contaminant concentration when outdoor air is {{the main source of}} pollutants. Utilising an airflow model in conjunction with a one-compartment indoor air quality model, contaminant concentration behaviour within a single <b>zone</b> <b>enclosure</b> is predicted at various enclosure air leakage, system characteristics and pressurisation levels. Results from this study are indicative of the appreci-able impact of the pressurisation effect of ventilation air which needs to be considered for a better assessment of ventilation air effectiveness and further enhancement of indoor air quality control...|$|E

In several application scenarios, users define their own proximity zones of interest (typically {{in the form of}} polygonal regions, such as a collection of city blocks), and want to find other users with whom they are in a mutual enclosure relationship with respect to their respective proximity zones.

However, users may be reluctant to share their whereabouts with their friends and with social media service providers, as location data can help one infer sensitive details such as an individual 2 ̆ 7 s health status, financial situation or lifestyle choices.

40|$|Knowledge of how animals utilize {{their space}} can be {{important}} {{when they are}} held in captivity. This {{is especially true for}} animals that are on the edge of extinction as such knowledge can possibly help to improve their captive breeding programs. One of these animals is the dhole, Cuon alpinus. The aim for this study was to assess how the dholes at Kolmården zoo utilize their space, if they share space and if they prefer to use specific pathways. The study took place at Kolmården zoo during 12 days and included a total of 72 hours of visual observation. A summarized map, with subdivision into 14 zones, of the dholes’ enclosure was used when recording the dholes’ location. For location recordings scan sampling was used. The dholes showed marked differences in utilization of zones ranging from the most popular zone with 1341 markings to the least popular zone with 71 markings. There was a clear preference for three zones during the whole observation period. No marked differences for utilization of zones were found between feeding vs. non-feeding days and morning vs. afternoon. Furthermore, the dholes showed a tendency for sharing space and utilization of two pathways. This project makes it evident that the dholes at Kolmården zoo prefer certain <b>zones</b> within their <b>enclosure.</b> This is probably due to that the zones preferred provides locations with access to resting, lookout possibilities etc that is important for the dholes to express a natural behavior...|$|R

The principal difficulty in this project is the quantity of useful data-processing resources, especially in the used frequencies range. The developed method is a hybridization using the FDFD/Waveguide mode expansion. The interest of hybridization is to net only part of the interior <b>zone</b> of the <b>enclosure.</b> In the diffraction zone, the finite difference in frequency domain (FDFD) is applied, whereas the electromagnetic field is expanded on a basis of functions in the measurement zone. We define a scalar product utilizing only the longitudinal component of the field, in a cross-section of the cavity. We show that the basic functions then define an orthogonal basis. The originality lies in obtaining the basic functions by numerical calculation (in opposition to analytical), in cases of section of an unspecified form. The validations are carried out by comparison with the analytical ones (without stirrer) and by rebuilding of field cartographies, this for enclosures with rectangular and circular section. The carried out code makes it possible to obtain the weights of the various modes.

Zoos are being encouraged to improve the animal’s physical and social surroundings. Environmental enrichment is a term used for such improvements. In this behavioural study, the enrichment introduced to two Pallas cats (Felis manul) at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna, Sweden, consisted of a fishing rod and a clothes peg with a dead mouse or chick attached. The intention was to see if the feeding enrichment could increase activity levels and how the cats were using their enclosure. The enclosure was divided into seven zones which have a varying degree of opportunities for the animals to climb, hide and rest above ground level. The environmental enrichment effects on the Pallas cats´ behaviour, activity levels and use of the enclosure were measured and recorded using instantaneous scan sampling, and the mean value was calculated for each individual. The behavioural and enclosure results proved that enrichment benefits the cats activity levels. The behaviours that showed a variation when presented with enrichment were: walking, climbing, grooming, aggressive behaviour, out of sight behaviour, crouching position, sitting and standing still.   The results showed that the cats preferred the <b>zones</b> in the <b>enclosure</b> that offered a larger view of the nearby enclosures.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} and air flow through an attic space into {{or out of}} buildings is a key issue for attic-shaped houses in different seasons. One of the main objectives for designers and builders is to provide thermal comfort for dwellers. In the present energy-conscious society, {{it is also a}} requirement for houses to be energy-efficient, that is, the energy usage for heating or cooling houses must be reduced. Relevant to these objectives, research into heat transfer in attics has been conducted for more than two decades. Numerical simulation is carried out for flow behavior of natural convection in an isosceles triangular enclosure partitioned in the center by a vertical wall with an infinite conductivity. A sudden temperature difference between two <b>zones</b> of the <b>enclosure</b> has been imposed to trigger the natural convection. As a result, heat is transferred between both sides of the cavity through the conducting vertical wall with natural convection boundary layers forming on the middle partition and two inclined surfaces.

40|$|The dhole (Cuon alpinus) is {{a highly}} social species that lives in groups and {{communicates}} through a broad repertoire of sounds both in captivity and in the wild. The dhole is classified as endangered since 2004 by the IUCN red list. Animals in captivity always experience some sort of behaviour limitations due to containment and limited space which can affect animal welfare. Enclosure design is therefore of great importance to meet the behavioral needs of the specific species and provide adequate welfare. Behavioral studies and space utilization studies are two good methods to investigate animal welfare in captive animals. To investigate behaviour and space utilization of dholes, behaviour observations of seven group held dholes were carried out in Eskilstuna Parken Zoo during the 3 rd to 16 th of April. Vocalization and other behaviors in relation to triggers were recorded and space utilization were also recorded. A comparison of space utilization between this study and a previous study was made. The results from the behaviour study show that the behaviour low vocalization was the behaviour performed the most and occurred the most in relation to nothing outside. The behaviour unaffected was the behaviour shown the most in relation to triggers and in relation to performed behaviour. The behaviour observant was performed towards most triggers and most often towards the staff´s, which handled the predators, car but also the staff. The behaviour low vocalization was also performed towards the staff´s car and the staff. The behaviour eating was performed the least both in relation in performed behaviour and in relation to triggers. So the dholes do show interest in their environment and they vocalize the most when there is nothing outside their enclosure but also in relation to some triggers such as the staff´s car and the staff members as well {{and they are a}} very observant species that shows attention to most of the triggers. The results from the space utilization study show that the dholes spent most time unseen followed by zone 12 that was close by the enclosures perimeter and visitors as well as staff members. Zone 10 was used the least and contained an empty pound. All <b>zones</b> in the <b>enclosure</b> were used, but to varying degree. There had also been a shift in utilization from the previous study.

40|$|The {{main concern}} with welding {{processes}} {{has in the}} past, generally, concentrated on productivity and quality. However, the occupational health of the welder {{has become a major}} focal area in the last decade, and the working environment of the welder is becoming a more important area of investigation. One particular area of interest is the amount of fume present in the operator’s breathing zone. With the potentially hazardous material present in the breathing environment of the welder, an effective method of controlling this airborne contaminant must be adopted to limit exposure levels to within occupational health and safety limits and to ensure the well being of the worker. This investigation examines the distribution of fume and breathing zone concentration within a controlled space using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. The controlled working environment provided the basis for quantifying breathing zone exposure concentrations, and the ability to predict operator exposure. The initial evaluation focused on determining the breathing zone concentration and the welding fume plume dispersal within a confined enclosure. Within a sealed environment GMA welding was performed for approximate 100 % duty cycle with two types (copper and non-copper coated) of ER- 70 S filler wire. The breathing <b>zone</b> and background <b>enclosure</b> concentrations were measured. The purpose of this initial investigation was to evaluate the breathing zone concentration within a confined environment, and to determine a fundamental concentration for direct evaluation of control procedures. The inclusion of the non-copper (low-fuming) coated electrode was to validate the measurements obtained during the study. The low-fuming electrode provided the expected reduction in exposure concentrations in comparison with the copper coated wire, however the concentrations measured over a 15 minute welding cycle were substantial higher than Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) exposure limits. To aid the evaluation of fume control effectiveness, various ventilation strategies were incorporated into the controlled environment. Utilising various modes of general and local extraction enabled an evaluation of the measured breathing zone concentration to be compared with the non-ventilated situation, as well as indicating their relationship with the occupational exposure limits for welding fume. This enabled the breathing zone exposure concentration to be effectively reduced to meet the OHS exposure limits. Although all techniques significantly reduced the exposure concentration, in direct comparison with the confined ‘fundamental’ concentrations, only an appropriately installed local extraction technique provided the required reduction. As well as the breathing zone evaluation, a model to predict the initial dispersion of GMAW fume was developed, aiding in better determining welding fume plume flow behaviour characteristics. This analysis, in addition with classical plume theories, enabled a model of the fume plume characteristics to be developed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Botany)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{deforestation}} of riparian {{areas is}} a major concern in southern Africa. These areas are characterized as fragile ecosystems which contribute largely to the regional and global biodiversity of the world. It is therefore important to restore these degraded areas along the natural rivers of South Africa to ensure the sustainability and biodiversity of riparian corridors. Riparian areas inside the National Parks of South Africa, and especially in Mapungubwe National Park, have a high esthetical value and should be preserved for future generations. The study was conducted in the Mapungubwe National Park, which is listed as a cultural world heritage site. Plans are in place to convert it into one of Africa's biggest Transfrontier Parks, called the Limpopo/Shashe Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA), which will be situated between neighbouring countries Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. The main purpose of this project was to establish a demonstration site for the restoration of degraded, previously cultivated lands in the deforested riparian areas in the Mapungubwe National Park, Limpopo Province. Another aim of the project was to evaluate the theoretical assumption that the growth of trees on so called "activity lines" in the environment due to geological and soil characteristics is enhanced. "Activity lines" were identified by Mr. Lynn van Rooyen of South African National Parks (SANParks) and trees of which the growth was tested, were planted both on and off "activity lines". The selection of the right type of trees for the restoration of the deforested riparian areas during active restoration applications is very important and depends on a multitude of factors. These factors include aspects such as the location with its specific vegetation, soil type and climatic conditions, the historical background of the management practices such as previous land uses, as well as other environmental impacts that previously occurred in the area to be restored. The latter can be gained through interviews with previous and present managers of the area, as well as maps, reports and aerial photographs. Ten different indigenous tree species that previously occurred in the area were planted in an experimental demonstration site of approximately 70 ha, which was enclosed by an electrical game fence. The ten tree species that were evaluated included: Faidherbia albida (Ana tree), Acacia nigrescens (Knob thorn), Acacia tortilis (Umbrella thorn), Schotia brachypetala (Weeping boer-bean), Acacia xanthophloea (Fever tree), Lonchocarpus capassa, recently renamed Philenoptera violacea (Apple-leaf), Salvadora australis (Narrow-leaved mustard tree), Adansonia digitata (Baobab), Combretum imberbe (Leadwood) and Xanthocercis zambesiaca (Nyala tree). With the aid of aerial photographs, phytosociological studies, interviews with previous and present land users and managers, as well as existing surrounding vegetation, four different <b>zones</b> within the <b>enclosure</b> were identified according to ecotones. The establishment, growth and survival rate of the different tree species were monitored using morphological and physiological vegetation sampling techniques, as well as leaf component analyses on individuals of selected species. Soil physical and chemical analyses were carried out in the four different blocks identified within the experimental site. Data analysis was carried out on both the soil and leaf component analyses using the CANOCO-package. The establishment of the experimental site was successful, and important information was collected on various aspects of restoration activities. Positive growth effects were also observed in certain indigenous tree species concerning the "activity line" effect, especially with regard to Acacia tortilis and Combretum imberbe. However, the preliminary results obtained through this pilot study showed no conclusive evidence to what exactly stimulated the enhanced growth phenomena observed in certain individual tree species planted on "activity lines". Additional watering was identified as the most important factor contributing to successful establishment and growth of indigenous tree species in this semi-arid area. Various results showed a multiplying effect when a combination of additional watering and "activity lines" was applied. It was concluded that, should any further restoration work be conducted in the degraded areas of the Mapungubwe National Park, the planting of trees should be done on "activity lines" and with the addition of water. This will result in higher establishment rates of transplanted trees and speed up the succession processes involved in the natural "healing process" of degraded areas. Parameters that should be used for monitoring tree growth include the trunk thickness at the base, trunk thickness at 30 cm from the base, and the length of the tree in its natural growth form. Recommendations were also made as reference for future restoration practices to ensure better and more successful and sustainable outcomes in the planting of trees. These include the use of nurse plants such as Acacia tortilis and Salvadora australis to establish a more favourable microclimate for climax species, as well as the establishment of a preferred herbaceous layer. Care should be taken in the period required for the cultivation of indigenous trees before they are transplanted into the field, as a prolonged cultivation period could lead to a circular growth form of the root system, preventing sufficient penetration ability of the roots into deeper, more nutrient rich soils. Before trees can be planted into the field, a hardening period must be applied to all seedlings for at least a three week period. This entails the exposure to more direct sunlight for longer periods as well as a reduction in the water applied weekly. Special attention should be paid to the stresses caused by herbivory, especially that of termites and porcupines. The maintenance of the exclosure is a critical factor contributing to the successful outcomes of this particular restoration project. Problem animals, especially elephants, should be kept out of the exclosure at all costs. The results of this project can be used in this ongoing restoration program, as well as in other related projects in semi-arid, degraded savannah areas over the long-term. Master...|$|R
40|$|Predation by exotic predators (cats Felis catus and foxes Vulpes vulpes) is {{believed}} {{to be one of the}} factors that has contributed to the decline of medium-sized mammals in arid Australia. Other factors include habitat degradation by introduced herbivores (rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and grazing stock) and altered fire regimes after Aboriginal people moved into permanent settlements. In general, the impact of exotic predators on arid zone mammals {{is believed}} to be significant only when predator numbers have been elevated by increased food availability from exotic prey species (rabbits, house-mice Mus domesticus, cattle carcasses) or when native prey populations have already been dramatically reduced by competition from introduced herbivores. In much of the spinifex grasslands of the central Australian deserts, pastoralism never occurred, rabbit colonisation was extremely patchy and in some areas, traditional burning was still being practised when the extinctions commenced. None of the current models of mammalian extinctions adequately explain the declines in this environment. In this study I examined predator-prey interactions in two areas of the Tanami Desert to investigate whether predation by exotic predators may be a primary agent of extinction in its own right, capable of causing mass declines even in the absence of other human-induced perturbations. If this were the case then the following would be expected: (i) cats and foxes would eat medium-sized mammals when they are available, but be able to survive on alternative prey when mammals are scarce; (ii) populations of cats and foxes would be buffered against the declines of mammals during droughts, or would be able to recover more quickly than medium-sized mammals after droughts; (iii) medium-sized mammals would be more vulnerable to predation by cats and foxes than by dingoes Canis lupus dingo and other native predators, and (iv) there would be a correlation between the timings of the extinctions and the colonisation (or sudden increase) of cats and foxes. These predictions were investigated by monitoring the diets and relative abundance of cats, foxes and dingoes in relation to fluctuating prey availability in two areas of the Tanami Desert at latitudes separated by approximately 400 km. Mean annual rainfall is higher and more reliable in the northern study area which was situated in the centre of bilby Macrotis lagotis distribution within the Northern Territory, whereas the southern study area was located on the southern edge of the bilby�s range. Within each study area, monitoring occurred at three sites, approximately 20 km apart. Each site contained a sub-plot in each of two habitat types. Field work was conducted between September 1995 and December 1997. When the study began, the southern study area was experiencing drought conditions, however both study areas received significant rainfall in early 1997. The population dynamics of a variety of potential prey groups were monitored to examine their resilience during droughts, patterns of recolonisation after rainfall, and use of two habitat types: the ubiquitous sandplain, and the moister, nutrient enriched palaeodrainage habitat which {{is believed to}} have provided a refuge for medium-sized mammals during droughts. Native mammals were uncommon throughout the study period. Bilbies and macropods were significantly more abundant in the northern study area, and tended to occur more frequently in palaeodrainage habitat than sandplain. However, the palaeodrainage habitat did not appear to provide adequate refuge for the medium and large mammals during drought conditions in the southern study area, as they disappeared from the study sites altogether. Small mammals were significantly more abundant in the southern study area but densities remained low (less than 2 % trap success) throughout the study, and showed little response to improved seasonal conditions. In contrast, the abundance and species richness of birds showed a marked increase following rainfall in the southern study area. Flocks of nomadic birds arrived within several months of drought-breaking rains, increasing the relative abundance of birds from 9. 3 per km of transect in December 1996 to 49 /km in July 1997. Reptiles were the most resilient prey group during the drought conditions. Both varanids and smaller reptiles were equally abundant in the wet and dry years and showed no difference in abundance between study areas. However, reptiles showed marked temperature-related patterns in activity, with many species becoming inactive in the winter months. A total of 142 cat scats, 126 fox scats and 75 dingo scats were analysed to investigate predator diets in the two study areas. Unlike cat, fox and dingo diets elsewhere in Australia (and the world), mammalian prey did not dominate. Reptile was the prey category that was most frequently consumed by cats and foxes in �summer� (October-April) and by dingoes throughout the year, and was identified as a �seasonal staple� prey type for all three predators in the Tanami Desert. When biomass of prey was taken into account, the varanids (predominantly the sand goanna Varanus gouldii) were the most important prey sustaining predators in the two study areas. Birds were an important part of the diets of cats and foxes in winter when reptiles were less active. Small mammals were consumed by cats and foxes throughout the study, in proportion to their field abundances. Invertebrates were a major component of the diets of foxes, representing 31 % of prey items consumed. There was considerable overlap in the diets of the three predator species, but dingoes ate more medium (100 - 999 g) and large (greater than 1000 g) prey than cats and foxes did. The scarcity of medium-sized mammals in the study areas provided little opportunity to find evidence of predation events on such prey. However, bilby remains were found in two cat scats and one dingo scat in the northern study area, mulgara Dasycercus cristicauda remains occurred in several cat and fox scats from the southern study area, and there were fourteen occurrences of marsupial mole Notoryctes typhlops in predator scats during the study, primarily in fox scats. Elsewhere in Australia, there is ample evidence that cats and foxes regularly consume medium-sized mammalian prey (e. g. rabbits and ringtail possums Pseudocheirus peregrinus) when it is available. Overall cats were the most abundant eutherian predators in the two study areas, and they were significantly more abundant in the northern study area than the southern study area. Surveys revealed that cats can persist into droughts by feeding on reptilian prey. When the study commenced, cats occurred on five of the six sub-plots in the southern study area, despite six consecutive years of below-average rainfall. However, by the end of the first year, they could only be detected on one sub-plot. Recolonisation of the sites rapidly occurred after significant rainfall (260 mm in 2 months), when nomadic birds colonised the sites and provided a plentiful food source. Foxes also declined to very low densities during drought in the southern study area, but they had recolonised all sites by the winter of 1997. This coincided with the increase in abundance of birds, which became their most frequently consumed prey item. Overall, foxes were equally abundant in the two study areas, but statistical analyses revealed a significant interaction between latitude and habitat because in the southern study area foxes tended to utilise the palaeodrainage habitat more than the sandplain, whereas in the northern study area the majority of fox sign was detected in the sandplain habitat. This may have been due to the abundance of dingoes in the palaeodrainage habitat in the northern study area. Dingoes were significantly more abundant in the northern study area than the southern, where they were usually only present at one of the three sites. The northern study area had higher densities of macropods (supplementary prey for dingoes) and more reliable access to drinking water, which persisted in the palaeodrainage channels for up to 6 months after significant rain events. Dingo numbers were relatively stable throughout the study and did not increase in response to improved seasonal conditions in the southern study area in 1997. This study revealed that the distribution of foxes extends further north into the Tanami Desert than has previously been reported, and is not necessarily tied to the distribution of rabbits in the Northern Territory. Furthermore, discussion with Aboriginal people who lived a traditional lifestyle in the area until the 1940 s, revealed that foxes were already present in the northern Tanami desert at that time, before the disappearance of many medium-sized mammal species. The patterns of medium-sized mammalian extinctions in the northern and western deserts between 1940 and 1960 is thus consistent with the colonisation of the fox. Although cats had been present in central Australia for at least 50 years before the mammalian declines occurred, this does not discount them from contributing to the extinction process. It is postulated that during the early decades of their colonisation of the arid interior, cat populations may have been maintained at low levels by predation from dingoes and also Aboriginal people (for whom cats were a favoured food). But between 1920 and 1960 the western deserts were depopulated of Aboriginal people, and human hunting of cats diminished. This coincided with the introduction of the dingo bounty scheme, which encouraged many Aboriginal people to continue making regular excursions into the deserts to collect dingo scalps. In this study, cat remains occurred in 9 % of dingo scats, suggesting that dingoes may be an important predator of cats. Thus, there may have been an increase in the cat population between 1930 and 1960, producing a more significant impact on native mammal populations than had previously occurred. Information collected during this study was used to construct a new model of mammalian extinctions in the spinifex grasslands of central Australia that promotes predation by cats and foxes as the primary agent of extinction. The model proposes that cats and foxes will eat medium-sized mammals when they are available, but are capable of subsisting on naturally occurring alternative prey when mammals are scarce. Thus, cats and foxes can persist into drought periods by feeding on reptilian prey, which remains an abundant resource regardless of rainfall (at least during the warmer months). Predator populations eventually decline after a series of dry winters. When the drought breaks, the rapid response of nomadic birds provides a readily available food source for cats and foxes as they recolonise areas and commence breeding. Predation by cats and foxes thereby has the potential to exacerbate the declines of native prey populations during droughts and delay their recovery when seasonal conditions improve. In this way, introduced predators are capable of causing local extinctions of medium-sized mammals when populations contract during drought periods, even in the absence of introduced herbivores and altered fire regimes. Although dingoes also prey upon medium-sized mammals, dingoes did not cause extinctions of medium-sized mammals in the spinifex grasslands because (i) they are more reliant on drinking water than foxes and cats, thus waterless areas would have provided some degree of predation refugia, and (ii) their social structure and territoriality prevent high densities accumulating, even when resources are abundant. If further extinctions of medium-sized mammals (such as the bilby) are to be prevented, it may be necessary for wildlife managers to establish a series of predation refugia where fox and cat populations can be controlled without extinguishing local dingo populations. This could be achieved with a combination of predator-proof <b>enclosures,</b> <b>zones</b> in which foxes are killed through poison baiting and areas where Aboriginal people are employed to utilise traditional hunting methods to control introduced predators...|$|R
