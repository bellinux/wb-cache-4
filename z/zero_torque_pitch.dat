Through {{a design that}} aligns the wrist joint axes to the device DOFs and uses custom MR-compatible force-feedback actuation, the MR-SoftWrist can measure and support wrist movements during fMRI.

40|$|In an {{automated}} manual transmission it is desired to have <b>zero</b> <b>torque</b> in the transmission when disengaging a gear. This minimizes the oscillations in the driveline which increases the comfort and makes the speed synchronization easier. The {{automated manual transmission}} system in a Scania truck, called Opticruise, uses engine torque control to achieve <b>zero</b> <b>torque</b> in the transmission. In this thesis different control strategies for engine torque control are proposed {{in order to minimize}} the oscillations in the driveline and increase the comfort during a gear shift. A model of the driveline is developed in order to evaluate the control strategies. The main focus was to develop controllers that are easy to implement and that are robust enough to be used in different driveline configurations. This means that model dependent control strategies are not considered. A control strategy with a combination of a feedback from the speed difference between the output shaft speed and the wheel speed, and a feedforward with a linear ramp, showed very good performance in both simulations and tests in trucks. The amplitude of the oscillations in the output shaft speed after neutralengagement are halved compared to the results from the existing method in Scania trucks. The new concept is also more robust against initial conditions and time delay estimations...|$|R
5000|$|A {{gyroscope}} {{is mounted}} in a sphere, lined with Mu-metal to reduce magnetic influence, {{connected by a}} spindle to the vertical axis of the theodolite. The battery-powered gyro wheel is rotated at 20,000 rpm or more, until it acts as a north-seeking gyroscope. [...] A separate optical system within the attachment permits the operator to rotate the theodolite and thereby bring a zero mark on the attachment into coincidence with the gyroscope spin axis. By tracking the spin axis as it oscillates about the meridian, {{a record of the}} azimuth of a series of the extreme stationary points of that oscillation may be determined by reading the theodolite azimuth circle. A midpoint can later be computed from these records that represents a refined estimate of the meridian. Careful setup and repeated observations can give an estimate that is within about 10 arc seconds of the true meridian. [...] This estimate of the meridian contains errors due to the <b>zero</b> <b>torque</b> of the suspension not being aligned precisely with the true meridian and to measurement errors of the slightly damped extremes of oscillation. These errors can be moderated by refining the initial estimate of the meridian to within a few arc minutes and correctly aligning the <b>zero</b> <b>torque</b> of the suspension.|$|R

40|$|An {{asymptotically}} exact continuum dislocation {{theory of}} single crystal bars under torsion is proposed. The dislocation distribution minimizing {{energy of the}} bar with <b>zero</b> <b>torque</b> is shown to be uniform.

The non-uniform distribution of dislocations in equilibrium {{as well as the}} twist angle per unit length are found in terms of the given torque. With the energy dissipation being taken into account, there exists an elastic core region, while dislocation are concentrated in a ring between two dislocation-free zones.

40|$|Outward {{migration}} of low-mass planets {{has recently been}} shown to be a possibility in non-barotropic disks. We examine the consequences of this result in evolutionary models of protoplanetary disks. Planet migration occurs towards equilibrium radii with <b>zero</b> <b>torque.</b> These radii themselves migrate inwards because of viscous accretion and photoevaporation. We show that as the surface density and temperature fall, the planet orbital migration and disk depletion timescales eventually become comparable, with the precise timing depending on the mass of the planet. When this occurs, the planet decouples from the equilibrium radius. At this time, however, the gas surface density is already too low to drive substantial further migration. A higher mass planet, of 10 Earth masses, can open a gap during the late evolution of the disk, and stops migrating. Low mass planets, with 1 or 0. 1 Earth masses, released beyond 1 AU in our models, avoid migrating into the star. Our results provide support for the reduced migration rates adopted in recent planet population synthesis models. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures. Accepted by ApJ. In press...|$|R

This paper presents a method of decoupling the stator and rotor contributions to total cogging torque. Rotor causes are further decoupled into magnet placement and strength variation. Decoupling is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another. Magnet strength and position decoupling {{is based on the}} analysis of the cogging torque waveform generated by the rotor interaction with a single slot stator and utilizes the <b>zero</b> <b>torque</b> produced when a single magnet is directly over a slot. Superposition and least squares minimization is then used to determine strength variation and simulate cogging torque with and without placement and strength variation. Analysis of ten production stators and rotors is presented and discussed, with the overall findings confirming that for the motors tested, the largest contributors to manufacturing induced cogging torque were the stator, magnet placement inaccuracy and magnet strength variation. Eliminating stator variation would improve cogging torque by 45 %, perfect magnet placement would result in a 29 % reduction in cogging torque and eliminating magnet strength variations would achieve a 7 % reduction...|$|R
50|$|There is {{a second}} problem with this simple pole design. At the zero-torque position, both {{commutator}} brushes are touching (bridging) both commutator plates, resulting in a short-circuit. The power leads are shorted together through the commutator plates, and the coil is also short-circuited through both brushes (the coil is shorted twice, once through each brush independently). Note that this problem is independent of the non-starting problem above; {{even if there were}} a high current in the coil at this position, there would still be <b>zero</b> <b>torque.</b> The problem here is that this short uselessly consumes power without producing any motion (nor even any coil current.) In a low-current battery-powered demonstration this short-circuiting is generally not considered harmful. However, if a two-pole motor were designed to do actual work with several hundred watts of power output, this shorting could result in severe commutator overheating, brush damage, and potential welding of the brushes—if they were metallic—to the commutator. Carbon brushes, which are often used, would not weld. In any case, a short like this is very wasteful, drains batteries rapidly and, at a minimum, requires power supply components to be designed to much higher standards than would be needed just to run the motor without the shorting.|$|R

Line optical tweezers were used to manipulate simultaneously more than one red blood cell. After we have been manipulated a RBC with an elliptical laser beam profile in an isotonic or hypertonic buffer, we noticed that it rotates by itself when gets trapped by optical tweezers and undergoes folding.

By varying the saturation level of the magnetorotational instability that leads to angular momentum transport, we show that the dynamics of gas inside the radius of marginal stability varies depending upon the magnetic field strength just outside that radius. Weak fields are unable to causally connect material within the plunging region {{to the rest of}} the disk, and <b>zero</b> <b>torque</b> is an approximately correct boundary condition at the radius of marginal stability. Stronger fields, which we obtain artificially but which may occur physically within more complete disk models, are able to couple at least some parts of the plunging region {{to the rest of the}} disk. In this case, angular momentum (and implicitly energy) is extracted from the material in the plunging region. Furthermore, the magnetic coupling to the plunging region can be highly time dependent with large fluctuations in the torque at the radius of marginal stability. This implies varying accretion efficiencies, both across systems and within a given system at different times. The results suggest a possible link between changes in X-ray and outflow activity, with both being driven by transitions between weak and strong field states. Comment: 4 pages, 4 postscript figures.
