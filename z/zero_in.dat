Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able to <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> on him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E

Miller was a mediocre student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname.

5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed.

For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense.

5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E

5|$|The {{research}} into {{the reconstruction of the}} consonants of Middle Mongol has engendered several controversies. Middle Mongol had two series of plosives, but there is disagreement as to which phonological dimension they lie on, whether aspiration or voicing. The early scripts have distinct letters for velar plosives and uvular plosives, but as these are in complementary distribution according to vowel harmony class, only two back plosive phonemes, */k/, * (~ *, *) are to be reconstructed. One prominent long running disagreement concerns certain correspondences of word medial consonants among the four major scripts (UM, SM, AM, and Ph, which were discussed in the preceding section). Word medial /k/ of Uyghur Mongolian (UM) has, not one, but two correspondences with the three other scripts: either /k/ or zero. Traditional scholarship has reconstructed */k/ for both correspondences, arguing that */k/ got lost in some instances, which raises the question of what the conditioning factors of those instances were. More recently, the other obvious possibility has been assumed, namely that the correspondence between UM /k/ and <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> the other scripts points to a distinct phoneme, /h/, which would correspond to the word-initial phoneme /h/ that is present in those other scripts. /h/ (sometimes also called /x/) is sometimes assumed to derive from *, which would also explain <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> SM, AM, Ph in some instances where UM indicates /p/, e.g. debel > Khalkha deel.|$|E
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than <b>zero,</b> <b>in</b> which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E

With the score tied at <b>zero</b> <b>in</b> the first quarter, Tyler fumbled at the one-yard line; Michigan {{went on to win the}} game 23–6.

He played two seasons with the Saints, appearing in all 23 games over those two seasons. Before the 1983 NFL season, the Saints cut him in order to meet the limit on how many players a team may have.
