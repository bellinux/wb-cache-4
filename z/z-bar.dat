Some of the more common terms are shortened versions of the trade name [...] "Xanax", such as Xannies (or Xanies) and the phonetic equivalent of Zannies; references to their drug classes, such as benzos or downers; or remark upon their shape or color (most commonly a straight, perforated tablet or an oval-shaped pill): bars, ladders, Xanbars, <b>Z-bars,</b> footballs, planks, poles, blues, or blue footballs. While prices for a black market substance vary wildly in time and geography, this author's personal research of {{the past fifteen years}} throughout California bears out $2.00 prices for 1mg pills (often referred to as footballs or even more anecdotally, //ones//) and $4.00 for 2mg pills (often referred to as bars, spinners, and ladders). More recently (Summer, 2017) prices for 1mg and 2mg have risen to $3-$4 and $5-$8 respectively. This is an economic result of a prescription shortage created by an FDA crackdown on opioids that alprazolam was caught up in as well.|$|R

50|$|<b>Z-bar</b> and roll-inducing springs: Mercedes-Benz introduced, to {{help their}} low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring mounted transversally above the differential, which would {{transfer}} load {{from one side to}} the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up. This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness. A similar effect was achieved by VW's <b>Z-bar,</b> a roll-bar, as opposed to anti-rolling bar. Both devices increase the rolling tendency of the rear axles, thus reducing the oversteering tendency. Aftermarket roll-inducing springs, also called camber compensators, are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs, which reduce oversteering tendencies at the cost of increasing suspension harshness.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{assignment}} {{networks are}} networks with pseudo-static behavior: the network topology is constant {{but the cost}} of each edge changes in real-time. Extensive work has been completed in the literature to develop efficient traffic assignment algorithms in order to reduce traffic congestion. While some of these algorithms have proven to be effective, little {{attention has been paid to}} the matter of scalability in traffic networks. In this paper, we use zones to develop a hybrid approach to traffic assignment. We divide a traffic network into zones where the path within each zone is proactively stored, and paths between zones are reactively evaluated. This reduces the cost of route discovery. Using the Simulator of Urban MObility (SUMO), experiments were conducted to compare the zone-based system coined <b>Z-BAR</b> against a zone-free system. Between <b>Z-BAR</b> and a zone-free system, initial results showed <b>Z-BAR</b> introduces a speedup factor of up to 1. 22...|$|E

Six Mg I and 10 Mg II absorption lines are detected in 33 C IV clouds, and some peculiarities are noted. The complex or asymmetric line profiles reveal that multiple components are present and that {{variations in the}} C IV/Mg II and Mg II/Mg I ratio may occur often from one component to another with a velocity separation less than the velocity resolution of about 100 km/s. Comparison with the Mg II absorption-line statistics at <b>z-bar</b> = 0. 5 implies that, at <b>z-bar</b> = 1. 6, there are more strong absorbers per unit z with W(2796) greater than 0. 6 A and fewer weak absorbers. The evolutionary parameter gamma appears to depend on W(min) : its value drops as W(min) is reduced and is negative at W(min) = 0. 15 A. This suggests a different redshift evolution for the population of weak and strong Mg II absorbers...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: O "sweeping" ou eletrodifusão em quartzo sintético é um processo realizado à temperatura da ordem de 500 °C com a aplicação de um campo elétrico intenso. A eletrodifusão em quartzo sintético usando átomos de 'AG' em ar é de grande importância porque pode tornar o {{material}} altamente resistente à formação de "etch-channels", (canais "cavados" ao longo das linhas de discordâncias) por ataque químico. O material assim tratado encontra larga aplicação em tecnologia avançada, principalmente para a fabricação de ressonadores e filtros de altíssima freqüênci{{a process}}ados por microlitografia. Neste trabalho desenvolvemos um estudo da influência das condições de eletrodifusão (temperatura, campo elétrico e tempo) na eliminação dos "etch-channels" em quartzo sintético em barra Z. Para a observação dos resultados foram aplicadas as técnicas de microscopia e inspectoscopia óptica que revelam que a densidade de "etch-channels" diminui de 11 a 0 linhas/cm 2 para o campo elétrico variando de 125 a 1000 V/cm. Observou-se uma dependência da intensidade e forma das curvas de densidade de corrente com aplicação de diferentes campos elétricos e provavelmente devido à difusão de íons de 'AG' e íons alcalinos como o 'LI', 'NA' e K. Observou-se ainda a ocorrência de dois fenômenos de elevação da corrente de eletrodifusão, chegando à uma intensidade 10 vezes superior ao observado normalmente. Um destes fenômenos surge com a ocorrência de trincas no material, mesmo para campos elétricos baixos, que favorecem a movimentação dos íons de prata resultando num elevado pico de corrente. O outro fenômeno acontece para campos elétricos altos, da ordem de 1000 V/cm, devido à grande movilidade dos íons de prata nessas condições, mesmo sem a formação de trincasAbstract: The sweeping in synthetic quartz {{is a process}} of impurity diffusion performed at temperatures of about 500 °C with the application of an intense electrical field. The electrodiffusion in synthetic quartz (sweeping), by using for example 'AG' atoms in air, has an increasing technological interest as it makes the material highly resistant to the formation of etch-channels by chemical etching. The etch-channel free quartz is essential for advanced technology applications, such as, the very high frequency resonators and filters, which are processed by microlithography and etching techniques. In this work, we have developed a research work on studying the sweeping conditions (temperature, electric field magnitude and sweeping time) and their influence on the elimination of etch-channels in <b>Z-bar</b> synthetic quartz grown by Brazilian ABC Crystals. The characterization studies have been conducted by etching technique, optical inspectoscopy and microscopy. The result shows a sharp decrease of etch-channels density from 11 to 0 lines/cm 2 for the electric field varying in the interval 125 - 1000 V/cm. A dependence ofthe electrodifusion current density and curve shape were observed with the applied electrical field caused by the 'AG' diffusion and alkaline ions diffusion like 'LI', 'NA' and K. It was observed two phenomena on the electrodifusion current: {{one of them was a}} fast rising current density of the order of 10 times higher than usual that was observed to appear with the formation of microcracks inside the quartz block. Crystal, even under de application of low electrical fields. The other phenomena of high current density was observed to be associated with the applied high electrical field (~ 1000 V/cm), which may allow high mobility of 'AG' ion...|$|E
