40|$|Our {{purpose was}} to {{quantify}} 36 inorganic chemical elements in aerosols from disposable electronic cigarettes (ECs) and electronic hookahs (EHs), {{examine the effect of}} puffing topography on elements in aerosols, and identify the source of the elements. Thirty-six inorganic chemical elements and their concentrations in EC/EH aerosols were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and their source was identified by analyzing disassembled atomizers using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Of 36 elements screened, 35 were detected in EC/EH aerosols, while only 15 were detected in conventional tobacco smoke. Some elements/metals were present in significantly higher concentrations in EC/EH aerosol than in cigarette smoke. Concentrations of particular elements/metals within EC/EH brands were sometimes variable. Aerosols generated at low and high air-flow rates produced the same pattern of elements, although the total element concentration decreased at the higher air flow rate. The relative amount of elements in the first and last 60 puffs was generally different. Silicon was the dominant element in aerosols from all EC/EH brands and in cigarette smoke. The elements appeared to come from the filament (nickel, chromium), thick wire (copper coated with silver), brass clamp (copper, <b>zinc),</b> <b>solder</b> joints (tin, lead), and wick and sheath (silicon, oxygen, calcium, magnesium, aluminum). Lead was identified in the solder and aerosol of two brands of EHs (up to 0. 165 μg/ 10 puffs). These data show that EC/EH aerosols contain a mixture of elements, including heavy metals, with concentrations often significantly higher than in conventional cigarette smoke. While the health effects of inhaling mixtures of heated metals is currently not known, these data will be valuable in future risk assessments involving EC/EH elements/metals...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the study of {{interaction}} between Cu, Al substrates (purity 5 N) and ZnAl 4, ZnAg 6 Al 6 <b>zinc</b> <b>solders</b> for higher application temperatures. Soldering was performed with power ultrasound in the air without flux application at temperature 420 °C. Acting time of ultrasonic vibration was 3 s and ultrasound frequency was 40 kHz. Soldered joints were assessed by optical light microscopy and EDX microanalysis. Intermetallic layers (IM) CuZn 4 and Cu 5 Zn 8 were formed at the Cu/ZnAl 4 boundary. The βZn-αAl mechanical mixture was formed at the Al/ZnAl 4 boundary. AgZn 3 and Cu 5 Zn 8 IM layers were formed at the Cu/ZnAg 6 Al 6 boundary, and mechanical mixture of βZn-αAl and AgZn 3 intermetallic mixture were formed at the boundary Al/ZnAg 6 Al 6...|$|R
50|$|The {{surface of}} the tin-based solder is coated {{predominantly}} with tin oxides; even in alloys the surface layer tends to become relatively enriched by tin. Fluxes for indium and <b>zinc</b> based <b>solders</b> have different compositions than fluxes for ordinary tin-lead and tin-based solders, due to different soldering temperatures and different chemistry of the oxides involved.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>solder</b> materials, {{primarily}} <b>zinc</b> alloys, {{are used for}} soldering aluminium metal and alloys {{and to a lesser}} extent steel and <b>zinc.</b> This mechanical <b>soldering</b> is similar to a low temperature brazing operation, in that the mechanical characteristics of the joint are reasonably good and it can be used for structural repairs of those materials.|$|R
25|$|Volta's {{original}} pile models {{had some}} technical flaws, {{one of them}} involving the electrolyte leaking and causing short-circuits due to {{the weight of the}} discs compressing the brine-soaked cloth. A Scotsman named William Cruickshank solved this problem by laying the elements in a box instead of piling them in a stack. This was known as the trough battery. Volta himself invented a variant that consisted of a chain of cups filled with a salt solution, linked together by metallic arcs dipped into the liquid. This was known as the Crown of Cups. These arcs were made of two different metals (e.g., <b>zinc</b> and copper) <b>soldered</b> together. This model also proved to be more efficient than his original piles, though it did not prove as popular.|$|R
50|$|Each cell {{consisted}} of a wooden dowel with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc wires. The dowels were helically grooved like a screw thread to locate the wires precisely in position. This enabled the copper and zinc wires to be placed very {{close to each other}} without coming into electrical contact. Insulated wires could not be used as this would interfere with the operation of the electrolyte. Copper wires were inserted into the ends of the dowels to which the copper and <b>zinc</b> windings were <b>soldered.</b> These end wires were either attached to, or formed into, hooks and eyes for attaching to other cells. This arrangement is depicted in figure 2. These attachments provided the electrical connections as well as the mechanical linkages.|$|R

5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} known fluxes were carbonate of soda, potash, charcoal, coke, borax, lime, lead sulfide and certain minerals containing phosphorus. Iron ore was also used as a flux in the smelting of copper. These agents served various functions, the simplest being a reducing agent which prevented oxides from forming {{on the surface of}} the molten metal, while others absorbed impurities into the slag which could be scraped off the molten metal.As cleaning agents, fluxes facilitate soldering, brazing, and welding by removing oxidation from the metals to be joined. Common fluxes are: ammonium chloride or rosin for soldering tin; hydrochloric acid and <b>zinc</b> chloride for <b>soldering</b> galvanized iron (and other zinc surfaces); and borax for brazing, braze-welding ferrous metals, and forge welding.|$|R

30|$|Cadmium metal {{is used in}} steel, plastic, {{and battery}} {{industries}} (World Health Organization WHO 2010). Its presence in drinking water could be {{as a result of}} impurities from galvanized <b>zinc</b> pipes and <b>solder,</b> together with other metal fittings. Cadmium accumulates in the kidney being its target organ of toxicity (World Health Organization WHO 2010). Cadmium is potentially carcinogenic in humans; it is the cause of itai itai disease observed in Japan due to excess intake (Lauwerys 1979). It has long biological half-life of 10 – 35 years in humans (Orisakwe, et al. 2006) leading to chronic effects as a result of accumulation in the liver and renal cortex (Hammer and Hammer 2004). Although {{there is no evidence of}} its carcinogenicity, the WHO has a guideline value for Cadmium of 0.003  mg/L.|$|R
40|$|The microstructures of {{soldered}} joints made on gold using silver or <b>zinc</b> doped Pb-Sn <b>solder</b> {{have been}} studied in the scanning electron microscope before and after accelerated aging. Layers of Au-Sn intermetallic compounds form between the unreacted gold and the solder {{as a result of}} the diffusion of gold through the product layers. The reaction kinetics has been studied as a function of temperature for the silver doped system and, in the initial stages, was found to be parabolic with an activation energy of (0. 86 +/- 0. 03) eV. This is the same as for joints made using undoped Pb-Sn solder. As in the undoped system, the growth of the product layers subsequently fell below the t 1 / 2 dependence and loss of joint strength occurred only some time after all the gold had been converted...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{expression was}} assumed among the cooling time of liquid metal in mold t, the representative size of molding D, {{the ratio of}} volume and surface area of molding V/S, and specific heat s. t=k(D･W/S) ^n･. c^^n' (k : proportinal constant) The values of n and n' were calculated for many experimental cooling curves of <b>solder,</b> <b>zinc,</b> lead and tin. From the results of calculation, these values could be obtained n= 0. 953 and n'= 0. 418 respectively. By use of these values, the experimental cooling curves were normalized for each factor. These normalized curves were very much agreement, so the master cooling curves in solidification of liquid metal could be obtained. For the normalization of cooling curves in mold, the following expression was assumed too. x=kt^n (k : proportinal constant) Where x is {{the distance from the}} boundary between mold and molding, t is the cooling time and n is an experimental constant. The values of n, based on many experimental cooling curves, was 0. 508. The master cooling curves of mold can be obtained, when applying the values of n to experimental curves...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the method was to prove {{the concept of a}} novel waste PCBs recycling process which uses inert, stable molten salts as the direct heat transfer fluid and, simultaneously, uses this molten salt to separate the metal products in either liquid (<b>solder,</b> <b>zinc,</b> tin, lead, etc.) or solid (copper, gold, steel, palladium, etc.) form at the operating temperatures of 450 – 470  °C. The PCB recovery reactor is essentially a U-shaped reactor with the molten salt providing a continuous fluid, allowing molten salt access from different depths for metal recovery. A laboratory scale batch reactor was constructed using 316 L as suitable construction material. For safety reasons, the inert, stable LiCl–KCl molten salts were used as direct heat transfer fluid. Recovered materials were washed with hot water to remove residual salt before metal recovery assessment. The impact of this work was to show metal separation using molten salts in one single unit, by using this novel reactor methodology. • The reactor is a U-shaped reactor filled with a continuous liquid with a sloped bottom representing a novel reactor concept. • This method uses large PCB pieces instead of shredded PCBs as the reactor volume is 2. 2  L. • The treated PCBs can be removed via leg B while the process is on-going...|$|R
