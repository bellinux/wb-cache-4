As Superman and Lex attempt to fight the creature, Superman is troubled to realise that this Doomsday operates at a strength level similar to the creature he faced for the first time in his world, but also has some degree of strategic planning, attacking passing trains and civilians to distract Superman and Luthor. As Wonder Woman appears to assist, Doomsday departs, but Superman and Wonder Woman are able to intercept him before he reaches Superman's wife Lois and their son Jon. While Wonder Woman takes Lois and Jon to the JLA Watchtower for safety, Superman is confused when an unknown group appear to attack Doomsday, but they are swiftly defeated. He subsequently manages to lure Doomsday to his own makeshift Fortress and use the Phantom Zone projector to trap his foe, but he is unaware that the unknown group intercepted the Phantom <b>Zone</b> <b>beam</b> and have captured Doomsday for their own unknown future purposes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the recent}} years, many {{research}} {{efforts have been}} carried out on the bond strength between normal strength concrete (NSC) and reinforcing bars spliced in tension <b>zones</b> in <b>beams.</b> Many codes gave a minimum splice length for tension and compression reinforcement as a factor of the bar diameter depending on many parameters such as concrete strength, steel yield stress, shape of bar end, shape of bar surface and also bar location. Also, codes gave another restriction about the percentage of total reinforcement to be spliced at the same time. Comparatively limited attention has been directed toward the bond between high strength concrete (HSC) and reinforcing bars spliced in tension <b>zones</b> in <b>beams.</b> HSC has high modulus of elasticity, high density and long-term durability. This research presents an experimental study on the bond between high strength concrete (HSC) and reinforcing bars spliced in tension <b>zones</b> in <b>beams.</b> It reports the influence of several parameters on bond in splices.

40|$|Steel fibers are {{generally}} used as resistance of cracking and strengthening of concrete. According to previous research, {{it has been}} found that steel fiber (SF) reinforced concrete beam had higher flexural strength compared to conventional reinforced concrete beam. In this research, flexural performances of steel fiber reinforced concrete beams were studied for concrete grade 35. Optimum fiber content was found to be 1 % and this was determined using compressive strength test with different SF dosages (0 %, 1 % and 2 %). Mechanical properties of steel fiber reinforced concrete were determined through compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength. The result indicates that there is a slight increment in compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of SFRC of about 15 % and 30 %, respectively compared to control sample. The flexural strength shows a significant increase of more than 100 % at 28 days compared with the control sample. The flexural behavior of steel fiber reinforced concrete beams at 28 days were studied under four points loading and the results were compared with conventional reinforced concrete beam. Beam 1 and Beam 3 failed at almost the same ultimate load. This shows that reinforcing the tension zone only has the same effect to that of reinforcing in both tension and compression <b>zones.</b> <b>Beam</b> 2 with steel fiber has slightly higher ultimate load, although the area of reinforcement was reduced.

40|$|Cracking of {{different}} nature may {{occur in the}} process of construction of multi-storeyed reinforced concrete buildings. Usually, the diagnosis of their causes is not complicated. However, in some cases the diagnosis is a sophisticated problem due to the special distribution of rigidities over the building frame. The article focuses on the technique of the three-dimensional modeling and analysis of building frame elements based on shrinkage cracks using the finite element analysis in Abaqus. The concrete damaged plasticity model is used to describe reinforcement steel. Simulation of cracking process was made using the partial model of a building having solid elements (for the concrete) and membrane and beam elements (for the reinforcement). Two cycles of simulation were implemented. Firstly, the calculation of crack propagation due to the nominal load was made. Simulation showed no cracks in the mid-span <b>zones</b> of <b>beams.</b> The second step was the simulation of crack propagation in case of shrinkage deformation propagation. This evaluation showed the possibility of crack formation and growth inside beams and slabs. The first shrinkage cracks appeared 25 days after the concrete curing completion. The first shrinkage cracks appeared in the midspan <b>zone</b> of <b>beams</b> in the aftermath of 29 days. Simulation of shrinkage deformations in the floor structure has showed that formation and propagation of cracks in the floor beams is possible. As a result of calculations, cracks appeared in the bottom part of the beams. In some beams, formation of shrinkage cracks may occur solely in the supports.

The 25 kg/m 3 dosage of steel fibre from concrete mixing was tested on compression test. Two sets of simply supported of size of 150 mm x 250 mm x 1000 mm were tested under flexural test to determine the flexural strength behaviour.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the precipitation behaviour in the heat-affected <b>zone</b> of electron <b>beam</b> welds, taking as example two nickel-base whose precipitation characteristics are compared. The two materials differ {{with respect to}} the method of production and also their content of precipitation phase. The wrought alloy has up to 25 % precipitated phase, whereas the alloy produced by powder metallurgy has 45 % in the fully age-hardened condition. Investigations of these precipitates within the heat affected zone reveals a specific correlation between particle size and their distance from the fusion line. This correlation is different for both materials. In the wrought alloy, the precipiation phase dissolves and the heat-affected zone appears soft compared to the base material. In the case of the P/M-alloy, the particles become smaller with decreasing distance from the fusion line. Therefore, the hardness first decreases slightly and than rises sharply {{in the vicinity of the}} fusion line.
