40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of {{the digestive}} system of tardigrades was already described in some species, {{but it has}} never been studied in relationship to diet. We performed ultrastructural analyses of the midgut and hindgut of phytophagous Ramazzottius tribulosus and <b>zoophagous</b> Macrobiotus richtersi. In addition, the foregut of R. tribulosus was analyzed. New ultrastructural details have been observed. Among them are: (a) distinct transverse pillar-like structures, lacking in electron-dense and compact cuticle of the buccal tube; (b) a hole or groups of holes sometimes present in the buccal tube; (c) a large cavity within each of the salivary glands where secreted mucus accumulates; and (d) already found in <b>zoophagous</b> Isohypsibius prosostomus, one valve, formed by folds of the pharynx and located at the transition from pharynx to esophagus. In both analyzed species the increase of midgut surface is identified by two orders of folds of the gut wall and by microvilli. In R. tribulosus there are many first-order folds and few second-order folds, whereas in M. richtersi the opposite pattern is found. A peritrophic membrane and microvilli with a well developed glycocalyx are found only in the midgut lumen of R. tribulosus. The density of microvilli and the ratio between the real surface with microvilli and the hypothetical surface without microvilli is lower in <b>zoophagous</b> M. richtersi and I. prosostomus than in phytophagous R. tribulosus.

40|$|Hoverflies with <b>zoophagous</b> larvae {{are among}} the most common natural enemies of pests in Dutch arable fields. Their {{effectiveness}} is partly limited by the availability of nectar and pollen for the adults. In this study we examined the suitability of flowers of ca. 30 plant species as food source for the common Episyrphus balteatus, both with choice tests and with non-choice survival tests. Many common field margin flowers appear to be unsuitable, as they do not allow the hoverflies to survive up to their reproductive age. The results can well be explained by flower morphology: only flowers with nectar available at a depth of less than 2 mm are suitable. Choice tests indicate that the hoverflies mainly select flowers with accessible nectar. Moreover, field studies showed that field margins with a higher proportion of flowers with accessible nectar attract higher numbers of <b>zoophagous</b> hoverflies. These results stress the importance of laboratory bioassays for selecting the right plants for functional field margins...|$|E
40|$|In modern {{agricultural}} landscapes, many organisms providing {{ecosystem services}} such as pollination and natural pest control are likely constrained by shortage of nectar and/or pollen required for adult nutrition. More and more flower-rich field margin strips and other habitats are created to eliminate these constraints. For most target organisms, however, it is not well known which (types of) flowers are effective in providing suitable pollen and nectar. We studied the suitability {{of a wide range}} of flowers as a food source for <b>zoophagous</b> hoverflies (hoverflies with predatory larvae) at five different levels: nectar accessibility (based on flower morphology), realized adult fitness, flower choice (both based on cage experiments), flower visitation and hoverfly abundance in mixed vegetation (both based on field observations). Realized survival of Episyrphus balteatus is related to effective flower depth by a sigmoid function. The critical flower depth is 1 · 6 mm, which is less than the proboscis size of the hoverfly. For Asteraceae, the critical floret depth is even less than 1 · 0 mm, which – in contrast to common knowledge – rules out most species within this family. Both flower choice in the laboratory and flower visitation rates in the field are well correlated with nectar accessibility and realized adult survival. In mixed floral vegetation, the number of <b>zoophagous</b> hoverflies is highly correlated with the abundance of only those flowers that have accessible nectar for these hoverflies. Synthesis and applications. This comparative study demonstrates that nectar (and not pollen) accessibility is the main driver determining flower resource suitability, flower choice and abundance of <b>zoophagous</b> hoverflies in arable field margins.

40|$|In {{the face}} of ongoing habitat fragmentation, species–area {{relationships}} (SARs) have gained renewed interest and are increasingly used to set conservation priorities. An important question is how large habitat areas need to be to optimize biodiversity conservation. The relationship between area and species richness is explained by colonization–extinction dynamics, whereby smaller sites harbor smaller populations, which {{are more prone to}} extinction than the larger populations sustained by larger sites. These colonization– extinction dynamics are predicted to vary with trophic rank, habitat affinity, and dispersal ability of the species. However, empirical evidence for the effect of these species characteristics on SARs remains inconclusive. In this study we used carabid beetle data from 58 calcareous grassland sites to investigate how calcareous grassland area affects species richness and activity density for species differing in trophic rank, habitat affinity, and dispersal ability. In addition, we investigated how SARs are affected by the availability of additional calcareous grassland in the surrounding landscape. Beetle species richness and activity density increased with calcareous grassland area for <b>zoophagous</b> species that are specialists for dry grasslands and, to a lesser extent, for <b>zoophagous</b> habitat generalists. Phytophagous species and <b>zoophagous</b> forest andwet-grassland specialistswere not affected by calcareous grassland area. The dependence of species on large single sites increased with decreasing dispersal ability for species already vulnerable to calcareous grassland area. Additional calcareous grassland in the landscape had a positive effect on local species richness of both dry-grassland specialists and generalists, but this effect was restricted to a few hundred meters. Our results demonstrate that SARs are affected by trophic rank, habitat affinity, and dispersal ability. These species characteristics do not operate independently, but should be viewed in concert. In addition, species’ responses depend on the landscape context. Our study suggests that the impact of habitat area on trophic interactions may be larger than previously anticipated. In small habitat fragments surrounded by a hostile matrix, food chains may be strongly disrupted. This highlights the need to conserve continuous calcareous grassland patches of at least several hectares in size...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} seasonal water level changes on two foraging guilds of water-related bird species in a remnant coastal wetland of central Italy. Data were obtained by point count method. During the seasonal water-level decrease in wetland channels, the Diversity Index and Species Richness of the entire assemblage dropped significantly between May and July. A significant {{decrease in the number}} of species was observed in the middle of May, attributed to decreasing water levels related to natural (climatic) and anthropogenic (local fish farming) causes, and the subsequent drying of surrounding marshes and meadows. A first phenological threshold was observed in May, when the water level decreased to 70 cm in channels. A high species turnover occurred in the entire assemblage during this period. The herbivorous-omnivorous species (Anatidae and Rallidae) and <b>zoophagous</b> species (Ardeidae and Podicipedidae) during the study period exhibited opposite trends in the diversity index values. The diversity index progressively decreased for the herbivorous-omnivorous species in the late spring, while increasing for the <b>zoophagous</b> species, due to a greater availability of food (increased fish density due to decreased water level). These contrasting results are a consequence of ecological and phenological (sedentary vs. migrants) traits of the species belonging to these guilds. These data represent useful information for elaborating management strategies focused on the water level regime in Mediterranean small wetlands in which fish-farming activities also occur...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of the bucco-pharyngeal apparatus {{is correlated}} with the food utilized. Nevertheless, even though the ultrastructure of the digestive system of tardigrades was already described in some species, it was not studied in depth, and not {{in relationship to the}} feeding. Therefore, comparative utrastructural analyses of the digestive system of the phytophagous Ramazzottius tribulosus and the <b>zoophagous</b> Macrobiotus richtersi were made. In R. tribulosus within the cuticle of the buccal ring there are distinct transverse pillar-like structures. Posterior to the mouth, the cuticle of the buccal tube becomes electron-dense and compact, without pillar-like structures and vacuoles, even though holes or groups of holes are sometime present anterior to the stylet supports. At each side of the buccal tube there are thin processes of the salivary glands, which form a large reservoir where secreted mucous is accumulated, like in the salivary sac of arthropods. Under the reservoir wall there are thin muscle processes and neuromuscular contacts. Stylets and stylet supports are located in the salivary reservoirs. Each stylet has a basal cuticular part and an apical hard calcium part divided by a well visible border. The beginning of the pharynx is characterized by thin valves and cuticular apophyses; the latter are homogenous ultrastructure so as the posterior part of the buccal tube and placoids. The lumen of the pharynx is limited by a clearly tri-layered thin cuticle. At the transition from pharynx to oesophagus there is one valve formed by folds of the gut which hinder the food return. The increase of midgut surface is realized by both large folds of the gut wall and microvilli. Microvilli are relatively short and thick but have well developed glycocalyx and in cross section look disposed regularly forming very compact hexagons (111 per μm 2). Epithelial cells of the midgut have large and small vacuoles. In tardigrades fixed after feeding, the midgut lumen exhibits a perithrophic membrane. In the cross section the lumen of the rectum looks as a big heart-like cavity with some narrow cell evaginations. The lumen is lined by a thin cuticle. For M. richtersi, at this moment we have considered only the ultrastructure of midgut and hindgut. Microvilli of the midgut are shorter and thinner than those of R. tribulosus. They form less dense hexagons (73 per μm 2). Glycocalyx is present but not particularly developed. The ultrastructure of the midgut (epithelial cells, peritrophic membrane) and that of the rectum, is similar to what is found in R. tribulosus. Comparing these results among them and with published data on the <b>zoophagous</b> Isohypsibius prosostomus, several similarities has been found, such as valves, cuticle lining, ultrastructure of epithelial cells, and peritrophic membrane. They can be related to common feeding processes. The presence of peritrophic membrane indicates that in tardigrades extracellular digestion occurs. Nevertheless, we can identify differences that can be related to the food utilized. Mainly, there is more absorption surface of the midgut in the phytophagous R. tribulosus than in <b>zoophagous</b> M. richtersi and I. prosostomus.

40|$|Only {{the last}} {{subfamily}} includes gall-causing and plant-inhabiting species. For the family Cecidomyiidae, Europe {{is the most}} species-rich continent of the world. On average, each gall midge genus contains 6, 6 species. The most species-rich genus is Dasineura Rondani, 1840, with 230 species, followed by Contarinia Rondani, 1860, with 135 species. On {{the basis of the}} larval feeding habits, the family Cecidomyiidae may be divided into three biological groups: 51 % of species are phytophagous, 39 % mycophagous, 8 % <b>zoophagous</b> and the biology of about 2 % remains unknown. All species of the subfamilies Lestremiinae and Porricondylinae are mycophagous. Fundamental sources for evaluation of the family Cecidomyiidae in Europe are 40, 000 records about their occurrence and distribution gathered by the present authors at more than 1850 localities in 17 countries of mainland Europe and nine islands in the Mediterranean at altitudes from sea level up to 2645 m a. s. l. in the Alps in the period 1955 – 2009. All samples were obtained using the time and area unit collection method and results were enriched by data collected by earlier researchers. Evaluation was based on identified and valid species, not on unidentified and unnamed gall-inducing organisms. This abundant data enabled production of maps of occurrence of individual gall midge species of the Czec...|$|E
40|$|In a 2 -year {{study we}} {{investigated}} soil macro-arthropods (Opilionida, Araneida, Pseudoscorpionida, Isopoda, Diplopoda, Chilopoda, Coleoptera) {{in a forest}} where forestry management is nature oriented and includes the accumulation of about 10 m 3 deadwood per ha. We focused on soil arthropod density close to (c-CWD) or distant from coarse woody debris (d-CWD) in different locations of the forest stand (interior location versus edge zone) and in different seasons (summer versus winter). We found twice as many individuals of almost all taxa at c-CWD sites compared to d-CWD sites. The influence of CWD on most taxa of soil arthropods was more pronounced in the edge zone than in the interior location. In the edge zone c-CWD sites yielded significantly higher numbers of all taxa in both seasons. In the interior location seasonal effects occurred. For example, Pseudoscorpionida and Coleoptera-Larvae preferred c-CWD sites only in summer, whereas Araneida preferred c-CWD sites only in winter. A three-way ANOVA, regarding site, location and season as the main factors, emphasised the dominant influence of CWD on the density of all taxa. Consequently, CWD is an important structural component {{that serves as a}} habitat for many saprophagous species and thus locally improves the nutritional situation of a forest stand. CWD also may reduce the pest species problem because it harbours many <b>zoophagous</b> soil macro-arthropods as well...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} the seasonal changes in the number of saproxylic beetles connected with birch in the Kampinos National Park. The research was conducted for 12 consecutive months in research areas representing 10 different site types. The beetles were collected from wood using photoeclectors. The largest number of species was collected in April and the lowest in January. An increase in number occurred during spring and summer months for species associated only with rotting wood, fructifications of tree fungi, the subcortical environment and hollows. In the same period the number of species not associated or potentially associated with decaying trees and wood decreased. During winter months, the differences in the number of trapped specimens were the smallest. The proportion of <b>zoophagous</b> species amongst the collected specimen increased in autumn and winter. The share of saprophagous species was the highest during the summer-autumn period and the share of mycetophages (jointly with myxomycophages) was the highest during spring and summer. We distinguished two separate groups of Coleoptera with the first one (‘summer group’) including species trapped during late-spring and summer months, while the second one (‘winter group’) includes species found in autumn, winter and early-spring months. In the ‘summer group’, an average of 55. 8 species was trapped each month with 331. 2 specimen of Coleoptera, while in the ʻwinter group’ an average of 56. 1 species with 228. 4 Coleoptera specimen were caught...|$|E

En el año de muestreo (marzo 2008 -marzo 2009), capturamos 2. 588 individuos distribuidos en 63 especies, que representaron el 84 - 93 % de la riqueza estimada. La riqueza específica fue mayor en primavera y verano, en relación a otoño e invierno (p Our {{purpose was}} to perform a {{research}} on the peridomestic carabid diversity in a Celtis tala Guillies ex Planch forest, at Laguna Nahuel Rucá, Mar Chiquita district. A species inventory and the comparison of the seasonal variation of cumulative species richness, as well as community structure and functional groups were carried out. During one year (March 2008 -March 2009), 2588 carabids belonging to 63 species were collected, representing the 84 %- 93 % of the estimated richness. Cumulative species richness during spring and summer was higher than in autumn and winter (p< 0. 05). Two species, Argutoridius bonariensis (Dejean) and Pachymorphus striatulus (Fabricius), represented a total of 47 % of captures and were dominant in all seasons. Concerning trophic guilds, <b>zoophagous</b> represented more than 50 % of the assemblage in all seasons, while phytophagous and omnivorous remained at low percentages in autumn-winter (< 10 %); the former reached a peak in spring (20 %), and the latter in summer (34 %). Regarding humidity affinities, mesophilous species conformed more than 70 % of the assemblage and hygrophilous and xerophilous reached less than 20 %. We discuss the probable causes of such higher carabid diversity wandering through the talar stand and their simplified surroundings, {{as well as the}} influence that these factors exert on composition and structure of the ground beetle assemblage...|$|E
40|$|Feeding on phyto- and {{zooplankton}} by juvenile (< 1 year old) {{and adult}} sardines (Sardina pilchardus) was inferred from analyses of natural abundance of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in {{samples from the}} northwestern Iberian Peninsula (Spain) collected {{at the beginning of}} the upwelling season and peak spawning period of sardine. Plankton samples were fractionated through nets of 20, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 ?m mesh-size and the muscle protein of individual sardines was isolated before isotopic determinations. Up to six planktonic components and two sardine feeding types were identified from the modes in the frequency distributions of isotope abundance values. Also, the most probable pathways for carbon and nitrogen flows between compartments were analysed. The resulting food web revealed a relatively large degree of omnivory, both in plankton and sardine components, which confirms that complex trophic interactions could also occur in pelagic upwelling ecosystems. Young sardines had isotope abundance values clustered around a single mode in the frequency distribution, while adult sardines displayed two main modes. These modes are interpreted as representative of two extreme feeding types: one related to the individual capture of zooplankton prey and the other to unselective filter-feeding. Although both types of feeding could include micro- (20 - 200 ?m) and mesozooplankton (200 - 2000 ?m) prey, phytoplankton appears to be ingested mainly by filter-feeding. However, even adult sardines must be mainly <b>zoophagous</b> to achieve the observed isotopic abundance values, taking into account current assumptions on stable isotope enrichment through trophic levels. From the differences in the resulting pathways using either carbon or nitrogen isotopes, we interpreted that sardines acquire most of the protein nitrogen from zooplankton while a substantial fraction of their carbon would derive from phytoplankton. These interpretations agree with the information available for this species on the gut contents and the anatomy of the filtering apparatus...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern about the use of {{ecosystem}} services components (such as soil protection, conservation of water quality, pollination, biological control of pests) provided by landscape through the presence of semi-natural elements and the spatial arrangement of crop mosaic. The DYNAFOR Lab was firstly mostly involved in issues on biodiversity in small forests and rural landscape with a landscape ecology approach. Here we present our main conclusions from various projects dedicated directly or not to pest control by beneficial insects. First, we compared aphid and hoverfly abundance in wheat fields differing in woodlot density in their vicinity, from spring 2003 to spring 2007. In addition, the rate of survival of a hoverfly species (Episyrphus balteatus, De Geer, 1776) after overwintering was simulated in a multi-agent model and compared to field data in spring. Simulations with the winter survival model showed higher survival rates in wooded landscapes with floral resources, but these only matched the actual spring abundance of hoverflies in 2003. Although aphids and hoverflies were both present earlier in wheat fields in wooded than in less wooded contexts, the higher ratio of hoverflies to aphids in wheat fields in wooded contexts suggests that the latter offer better potential biological control. Emergence traps in wood border showed a high variability of the abundance of overwintering beneficial insects. The study of carabid beetle communities in emergence traps in wood edges, field borders (inside and outside fields) pointed out the drastic number of <b>zoophagous</b> carabid beetles overwintering in wood edges but also in field borders themselves even when ploughed. Our global conclusion is that even if wood edges, hedges have proved their beneficial effects to support beneficial species, the field itself and its management are worth to be studied in relation to the landscape context. The temporal window at which a landscape effect could be identified is sometimes very narrow...|$|E
