50|$|In Canada, {{governmental}} authorities may use restrictive covenants {{as well as}} zoning. For instance, {{the city}} of Calgary's requirement that buildings in the general vicinity of Calgary International Airport be under a certain height is registered against virtually every title in the northeast quadrant {{of the city as}} a restrictive covenant, not as a <b>zoning</b> <b>by-law.</b>|$|E
50|$|In any event, if the <b>zoning</b> <b>by‑law</b> {{did have}} the effect of prohibiting water aerodromes, it would be {{inapplicable}} to the extent it did so, under the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. A prohibition on aerodromes, even as part of a broad class of land uses, would result in an unacceptable narrowing of Parliament’s legislative options. This would {{have the effect of}} impairing the core of the federal power over aeronautics.|$|E
50|$|Until 1995, the municipality's <b>zoning</b> <b>by-law</b> did {{not allow}} for water {{aerodromes}} or aeronautics in general to be conducted on Lac Gobeil.

The municipality applied for an injunction ordering the company to cease its aviation activities on Lac Gobeil on the ground that operation of the aerodrome and the associated business in that zone violated the by‑law.|$|E

50|$|The City of Vancouver, {{the largest}} city in British Columbia, had also changed its <b>Zoning</b> <b>By-Law</b> to include roof {{overhangs}} {{in the amount of}} permitted (buildable and salable) floor area, known as floor space ratio or FSR. Roof overhangs were included in the calculation of FSR, and as this reduced the amount of permitted floor space, they were often removed from designs. The calculation of FSR from the outside of the building envelope, instead of from the centre or interior side of the wall, also tended to promote thinner walls and rainscreen systems. Open, uncovered walkways were excluded from the FSR, thus encouraging their inclusion in the design.|$|E
5000|$|The Government of Ontario first {{asserted}} {{its role}} in municipal land use planning through enactment of the City and Suburban Plan Act in 1912. [...] In the Post-World War II period, considerable urban and suburban growth pressures demanded increased provincial intervention in municipal planning through official plan and <b>zoning</b> <b>by-law</b> requirements, and specialized administrative bodies. The Ontario Municipal Board, an independent administrative board, acts as an adjudicative tribunal on all applications and appeals regarding municipal and planning disputes in the province. A legislative structure consisting of provincial statutes and policies, municipal official plans, and land use control instruments (e.g., subdivision control, zoning by-laws) exists in the province today.|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of secondary suites in Calgary are basement suites. The regulations concerning secondary suites are complex, as they derive {{from a number of}} land use and <b>zoning</b> <b>by-laws</b> and differ vastly from community to community and even from street to street. The basic requirements for legal basement suites are that they must only exist in fully detached single-family homes in specific land use districts, they must be 70 square metres in area or less, they must meet all regulations concerning habitability (they must be heated, have adequate kitchen and bathroom facilities, be insulated, etc.), and that each must have its own separate entrance and windows large enough to allow for escape in case of fire.|$|R

By 1969, the layout for the northern section was rezoned: what would be Priam and Ariel, one side of Cymbeline and Oberon, and two small parcels on Tarquin, were designated single or double homes on smaller lots (R4); the remaining parts of Oberon and Cymbeline, Tybalt and Tarquin, garden homes and townhouses (R5). Roadways were outlined for Westcliffe and the northern leg of Seyton. A parcel of land to the east of Oberon was still zoned R3, as was the rest of the area.

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, {{urban and}} peri-urban food {{production}} {{has been identified}} as an important resource for meeting the challenges of rapidly growing cities, and the positive aspects of such production have been well documented in the literature. This paper examines some of the health and environmental concerns associated with urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA). Empirical evidence from the city of Kano in northern Nigeria suggests that there is currently much reason for concern as industrial and domestic toxins are reaching dangerously high levels. As soils and water channels become increasingly polluted, the sustainability of urban and peri-urban food production is questioned. Since the health implications of long-term exposure to toxins are unclear, it is suggested that coordinated longitudinal research involving urban planners, agricultural scientists and health specialists is urgently needed. In addition, it remains crucial that government and institutional actors effectively monitor and enforce both environmental and <b>zoning</b> <b>by-laws,</b> if the health and environmental constraints of UPA are to be overcome, and the future sustainability of production is to be assured.
