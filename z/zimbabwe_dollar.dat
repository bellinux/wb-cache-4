5|$|The <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in Optically Variable Ink and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues {{and do not have}} a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.|$|E

Although the dollar was abandoned on 12 April 2009, exchange rates were maintained at intervals for some months.

25|$|In June 2015, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe {{began to}} {{formally}} demonetise the Zimbabwean dollar, to officially value the fiat currency at zero, {{in order to}} complete a switch to the US dollar {{by the end of}} September 2015. The Zimbabwean government stated that it would credit 5 US dollars to domestic bank accounts, with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars, and that it would exchange Zimbabwean dollars for US dollars at a rate of 1 USD to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars to accounts with balances above 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars. This move was meant to stabilise the economy and establish a credible nominal anchor under low inflation conditions. The exercise brought closure to the outstanding issue on the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar,</b> further confirming the government's position that the local unit will not return anytime soon. The Government has maintained that the return of the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> would only be considered when key economic fundamentals, such productivity in key sectors, have been achieved.|$|E
500|$|After the {{formation}} of the Unity Government and the adoption of several currencies instead of the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> in 2009, the Zimbabwean economy rebounded. GDP grew by 8–9% a year between 2009 and 2012. In November 2010, the IMF described the Zimbabwean economy as [...] "completing its second year of buoyant economic growth". By 2014, Zimbabwe had recovered to levels seen in the 1990s but between 2012 and 2016 growth faltered.|$|E
25|$|On 2 February 2009, the RBZ {{announced}} that a further 12 zeros were to {{be taken off the}} currency, with 1,000,000,000,000 third <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollars</b> being exchanged for 1 new fourth dollar. New banknotes were introduced with face values of Z$1, Z$5, Z$10, Z$20, Z$50, Z$100 and Z$500. The banknotes of the fourth dollar circulated alongside the third dollar, which remained legal tender until 30 June 2009. The new ISO currency code was ZWL.|$|R

50|$|Following {{independence}} under {{majority rule}} in 1980 as <b>Zimbabwe,</b> the Rhodesian <b>dollar</b> was withdrawn in late 1980 {{and replaced by}} the Zimbabwean dollar.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "dollar" [...] {{has also}} been adopted by other {{countries}} for currencies which do not share a common history with other dollars. Many of these currencies adopted the name after moving from a £sd-based to a decimalized monetary system. Examples include the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar, the Jamaican dollar, the Cayman Islands dollar, the Fiji dollar, the Namibian dollar, the Rhodesian dollar, the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar,</b> and the Solomon Islands dollar.|$|E
2500|$|The Zimbabwean dollar was {{introduced}} in 1980 to directly replace the Rhodesian dollar at par (1:1), at a similar value to the US dollar. Over time, hyperinflation in Zimbabwe reduced the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> {{to one of the}} lowest valued currency units in the world. It was redenominated three times (in 2006, 2008 and 2009), with denominations up to a $100 trillion banknote issued. The final redenomination produced the [...] "fourth dollar" [...] (ZWL), which was worth 1025 ZWD (first dollars).|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of the fourth dollar, the problems were not eliminated, and the economy continued to be almost completely dollarised. In his first budget, the Zimbabwe finance minister, Tendai Biti, stated [...] "the death of the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> is a reality we have to live with. Since October 2008 our national currency has become moribund". In late January 2009, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that all Zimbabweans would be allowed to conduct business with any currency, {{as a response to the}} hyperinflation crisis. On 12 April 2009, media outlets reported that economic planning minister Elton Mangoma had announced the suspension of the local currency [...] "for at least a year", effectively terminating the fourth dollar.|$|E
25|$|On 30 July 2008, {{the dollar}} was redenominated. After 1 August 2008, ZW$10 billion were worth ZW$1. The new {{currency}} code was ZWR. The denominations {{to be issued}} were coins valued Z$5, Z$10 and Z$25, and banknotes worth Z$5, Z$10, Z$20, Z$100, and Z$500. Due to frequent cash shortages and the apparently worthless Zimbabwean dollar, foreign currency was effectively legalised as a de facto currency on 13 September 2008 via a special program. This program officially allowed a number of retailers to accept foreign money. This reflected {{the reality of the}} dollarisation of the economy, with many shop keepers refusing to accept <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollars</b> and requesting US dollars or South African rand instead. Despite redenomination, the RBZ was forced to print banknotes of ever higher values to keep up with surging inflation, with ten zeros reappearing by the end of 2008.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2008 demand for cash tripled so that FPR could {{not keep up with}} the demand; they had to contract their technical partner Giesecke & Devrient to run a parallel production of a series of notes with different serial numbers to meet the ever-rising demand for cash. The notes were then flown to Harare overnight and delivered to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for distribution to banks and into circulation.Giesecke & Devrient would deliver 170 trillion <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollars</b> weekly to the RBZ. The economist John Robertson was quoted at that time saying [...] " [...] Cash shortages are an inevitable product of hyperinflation, Even at the official rate of inflation, it is stretching the central bank's ability to print new money to keep up with inflation and the subsequent rise in the cost of goods" ...|$|R
2500|$|In October 2005, {{the head}} of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Dr. Gideon Gono, {{announced}} that Zimbabwe would have a new currency the following year, and new banknotes and coins would be produced. However, in June 2006, it was decreed that, for a new currency to be viable, Zimbabwe had to first achieve macro-economic stability (i.e., double digit inflation). Instead, in August 2006, the first dollar was redenominated to the second dollar at the rate of 1000 first dollars to 1 second dollar (1000:1). At the same time, the currency was devalued against the US dollar, from 101000 first dollars (101 once revalued) to 250 second dollars, a decrease of about 60% (see exchange rate history table below). ISO originally assigned a new currency code of ZWN to this redenominated currency, but the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe could not deal with a currency change, so the currency code remained 'ZWD'. The revaluation campaign, which Gideon Gono named [...] "Operation Sunrise", was completed on 21 August 2006. It was estimated that some ten trillion old <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollars</b> (22% of the money supply) were not redeemed during this period.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} year, on 2 February 2007, the RBZ {{revealed that}} a new (third) dollar would be released. However, with inflation still exceeding 1000%, the banknotes were kept in storage. During the same month, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe declared inflation illegal, outlawing any raise in prices on certain commodities between 1 March and 30 June 2007. Officials arrested executives of some Zimbabwean companies for increasing prices on their products, and economists reported that [...] "chaos had started to reign {{and people in the}} public sector has becoming frantic". On 6 September 2007, the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> was devalued again by 92%, creating an official exchange rate of ZW$30,000 to US$1, although the black market exchange rate was estimated to be ZW$600,000 to US$1.|$|E

50|$|As {{hyperinflation}} accelerated, {{the value}} of the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> declined fast against other currencies, yet official exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe were infrequently updated; this made it impossible to tell from an official source how much the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> was really worth against other currencies on a particular day, which in turn disrupted international business transactions involving Zimbabwe dollars. Staff from WM/Reuters devised an indirect means of measurement that was termed the Old Mutual Implied Rate (OMIR). This took the daily price of shares in the insurance company Old Mutual that traded in the London and Harare stock markets and derived from it a notional daily exchange rate between the <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollar</b> and the pound. Shares had much less strict capital controls than through the Zimbabwe banking system, so the shares were used as a vehicle for moving capital between currencies by buying stock in either London or Harare and then selling in the other location.|$|E
40|$|The {{viability}} of pension funds in Zimbabwe was {{threatened by the}} hyper inflationary environment that prevailed in the period January 2000 â€“ January 2009. A multi â€“currency regime was introduced to curb hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, however it brought its own challenges {{to the survival of}} pension funds. The overall objective {{of the study was to}} investigate how pension funds managed to survive during the period of hyperinflation (January 2000 â€“ January 2009) and how they adjusted to a multi â€“ currency regime over the period February 2009 â€“December 2012. The researcher adopted a qualitative research methodology. Primary data collection involved collection of data from a sample of 74 respondents, with 42 respondents returning the self - administered questionnaire. This was triangulated by data collected through interviews with 18 key informants. Secondary data in the form of literature relevant to the topic as well as document review was utilised. The following were the major findings of the study; In order to survive during the period of hyperinflation pension funds changed portfolio composition and diversified investments into non core activities. Pension funds also adopted decentralisation of decision making in order to make faster decisions and allow for quick adaptation to changes in the economic environment. Retrenchment strategies, differentiation of services and short term planning horizons were adopted as survival strategies in the hyperinflation period. Conversion of <b>Zimbabwe</b> <b>dollars</b> to foreign currencies and speculation in commodities were also adopted as survival strategies. Under sudden currency change in the economy pension funds changed their costing structures through variation in the level of charges, employing innovation strategies and changing planning horizons to medium term and long term plans. The researcher made the following recommendations; To survive pension funds should consider investment portfolio composition to hedge against inflation and venture into non core activities offering higher returns above inflation; In a hyperinflation period pension funds should also adopt decentralised decision making, differentiated services and short term planning horizons. The researcher further recommended that the regulatory frameworkâ€™s adequacy during hyperinflation and upon sudden change of currency be investigated...|$|R

Inflation was steady before Robert Mugabe began confiscating land from the white farming community in 1998, resulting in a near total collapse in food production and the decline of foreign investment. The result was that to pay its expenditures Mugabe's government and Gideon Gono's Reserve Bank printed more and more notes with higher face values.|$|E
