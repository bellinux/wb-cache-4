25|$|In 1943, at {{the peak}} of World War II, <b>zinc-coated</b> steel cents were made for a short time because of war demands for copper. A few copper cents from 1943 were {{produced}} from the 1942 planchets remaining in the bins. Similarly, some 1944 steel cents have been confirmed. From 1944 through 1946, salvaged ammunition shells made their way into the minting process, and it was not uncommon to see coins featuring streaks of brass or having a considerably darker finish than other issues.|$|E
25|$|Life {{was founded}} January 4, 1883, in a New York City artist's studio at 1155 Broadway, as a {{partnership}} between John Ames Mitchell and Andrew Miller. Mitchell held a 75 per cent interest in the magazine with the remainder by Miller. Both men retained their holdings until their deaths. Miller served as secretary-treasurer of the magazine and was very successful managing {{the business side of}} the operation. Mitchell, a 37-year-old illustrator who used a $10,000 inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine, served as its publisher. Mitchell created the first Life name-plate with cupids as mascots; he later drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil. Mitchell took advantage of a revolutionary new printing process using <b>zinc-coated</b> plates, which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork. This edge helped because Life faced stiff competition from the best-selling humor magazines Judge and Puck, which were already established and successful. Edward Sandford Martin was brought on as Lifes first literary editor; the recent Harvard University graduate was a founder of the Harvard Lampoon.|$|E
500|$|With the US {{entry into}} World WarII in 1941, copper and tin, which were both {{used in the}} cent, were in short supply. [...] Experiments were carried out by several {{corporations}} under contract from the Mint; they tested various metallic and non-metallic substances, including fiber, tempered glass, and several types of plastic. [...] These experiments used various designs, since actual Lincoln cent dies could not leave government custody. [...] As the experiments proceeded, production of bronze cents was cut back drastically in , and ceased in December. [...] On , 1942, Congress gave the mint authorization to change {{the composition of the}} cent for a three-year period, and five days later, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau announced that the coin would be made out of <b>zinc-coated</b> steel. [...] Zinc and iron form an electromagnetic [...] "couple"; the two metals soon corrode when in contact with each other in a damp atmosphere. The public soon complained that the new coins were becoming spotted and stained. [...] Another common complaint was confusion with the dime, and some letters suggested that a hole be punched {{in the center of the}} new coins. Morgenthau responded that the new pieces would soon become darker, and that the Mint would be willing to darken them if it could figure out a suitable process.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Bakelite {{was used}} {{in a variety of}} wartime {{equipment}} including pilot's goggles and field telephones. [...] It was also used for patriotic wartime jewelry. In 1943, the thermosetting phenolic resin was even considered for the manufacture of coins, due to a shortage of traditional material. Bakelite and other non-metal materials were tested for usage for the one cent coin in the US before the Mint settled on <b>zinc-coated</b> steel.|$|E
2500|$|Due to wartime {{needs of}} copper {{for use in}} {{ammunition}} and other military equipment during World War II, the United States Mint researched various ways to limit dependence and meet conservation goals on copper usage. After trying out several substitutes (ranging from other metals to plastics) to replace the then-standard bronze alloy, the one-cent coin was minted in <b>zinc-coated</b> steel. This alloy caused the new coins to be magnetic and 13% lighter. They were struck at all three mints: Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. As with the bronze cents, coins from the latter two sites have respectively [...] "D" [...] and [...] "S" [...] mintmarks below the date.|$|E
5000|$|Barnaul Silver {{ammunition}} cartridges, with <b>zinc-coated</b> steel cases. Currently {{comes in}} 5.56×45mm NATO and 9×19mm Parabellum.|$|E
50|$|Stainless {{steel cable}} ties are also {{available}} for flameproof applications—coated stainless ties are available to prevent galvanic attack from dissimilar metals (e.g. <b>zinc-coated</b> cable tray).|$|E
50|$|The Cold Rolling Mill at Bokaro {{produces}} sheet gauge material, Tin Mill Black Plate and Galvanized Products.The Hot Dip Galvanizing Complex {{integrated with}} the CRM produces <b>zinc-coated</b> Cold Rolled strips resistant to atmospheric, liquid and soil corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The AEM (Automotive Engineering and Manufacturing) Scout was a Welsh-built Mini Moke type utility vehicle, with, <b>zinc-coated</b> {{bodywork}} {{and totally}} different styling {{not to mention}} the radically different method of production. It was made for only one year, 1987.|$|E
5000|$|The turn of {{the century}} would bring a host of {{innovations}} for AMERICAN's water works divisions, including <b>zinc-coated</b> ductile iron pipe, the AFC Mapper for utility asset management, gate valves up to 60 inches in diameter and AMERICAN's Earthquake Joint System.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, D’Angelico {{launched}} its first electric string since its reformation. In a collaboration with D’Addario, Electrozinc strings were developed based off of an original design {{from the two}} companies’ founders—John D’Angelico and John D’Addario. Electrozinc is a <b>zinc-coated</b> steel string built for loudness and longevity.|$|E
5000|$|Zinc, {{problematic}} for high vacuum and higher temperatures, present in some construction alloys, e.g. brass and some brazing alloys. Tends to poison hot cathodes and form conductive deposits on surfaces. [...] Any materials {{that have been}} <b>zinc-coated</b> by galvanization should be avoided, or the have the coating removed first.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} one-story, five-by-five-bay steel frame building on a poured concrete foundation faced in brick laid in English bond with a hipped slate roof pierced by two <b>zinc-coated</b> ventilators. The hipping is lower over the three central bays on the rear; a one-bay loading dock projects from that area.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to fixed installed drainage systems, pipes in mobile suction systems {{are on the}} surface. A central suction pipeline consisting of <b>zinc-coated,</b> fast-coupling pipes are connected in a regular spacing of 1.50 m and {{the ends of the}} hoses are pushed into the soil to the desired depth with a special tool.|$|E
50|$|The monumental U.S. Custom House is five bays {{wide and}} three bays deep, rising two stories above a full basement. The {{structure}} has granite-faced, masonry-bearing walls with floors supported by brick groin-vaults and a hipped roof carried by <b>zinc-coated</b> wood trusses. Four chimneys {{rise from the}} center of the building enclosing the original rooftop observatory.|$|E
50|$|Barbed wire for {{agriculture}} use is typically double-strand 12½-gauge, <b>zinc-coated</b> (galvanized) steel {{and comes in}} rolls of 1320 ft length. Barbed wire is usually placed on the inner (pasture) side of the posts. Where a fence runs between two pastures livestock could be with the wire on the outside or {{on both sides of}} the fence.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{inhabitants}} in Panama speak the native language, although the majority also know Spanish. Very few of the Naso tribes adhere to Roman Catholicism. The Seventh-day Adventist Church, is very important. The traditional God is Sbö, who is a supreme God and creator. Most Naso live in elevated wooden houses, with thatched or <b>zinc-coated</b> roofing.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} wire cutting EDM, wire burning EDM, or {{traveling}} wire EDM, this process uses spark erosion to machine or remove material from any electrically conductive material, using a traveling wire electrode. The wire electrode usually consists of brass or <b>zinc-coated</b> brass material. Wire EDM allows for near 90 degree corners and applys very little {{pressure on the}} material.|$|E
50|$|For many purposes, {{tinplate}} {{has been}} replaced by galvanised (<b>zinc-coated)</b> vessels, though not for cooking as zinc is toxic, where stainless steel is often used. Zinc protects iron electrolytically, that is, the zinc will oxidise and turn to a white powder to preserve the iron, whereas tin will only protect the iron if the tin-surface remains unbroken, as it electrolytically cannibalises unprotected iron to preserve itself.|$|E
50|$|Zinc oxide {{is used as}} a weak {{antiseptic}} (and sunscreen), and in paints as a white pigment and mold-growth inhibitor. Zinc chloride is {{a common}} ingredient in mouthwashes and deodorants, and zinc pyrithione is an ingredient in antidandruff shampoos. Galvanized (<b>zinc-coated)</b> fittings on roofs impede the growth of algae. Copper- and zinc-treated shingles are available. Zinc iodide and zinc sulfate are used as topical antiseptics.|$|E
5000|$|New water pipes, made of <b>zinc-coated</b> iron, {{were built}} {{too close to}} an {{existing}} steel gasoline pipeline. The underground humidity caused these materials to create an electrolytic reaction, akin to that which occurs inside a zinc-carbon battery. As the reaction proceeded it eventually caused the steel pipe to corrode, creating {{a hole in the}} pipeline that permitted gasoline to leak into the ground and into the main sewer pipe.|$|E

50|$|The static {{inverter}} {{of the plant}} is situated in a reinforced concrete building that is 29.8 meters long, 15.4 meters large, and 13.8 meters high; at both long sides, there are two bays for the {{static inverter}} transformers. For protection against fire, {{the walls of the}} static inverter hall, which have a thickness of 20 centimeters, were equipped with stone wool insulation. The entire building is covered with a <b>zinc-coated</b> sheet, which serves as an electrical shielding and enclosure.|$|E

50|$|On one {{summit is}} Barr Beacon Reservoir, a South Staffordshire Waterworks Company covered {{drinking}} water reservoir with radio masts {{and on the other}} a war memorial consisting of a raised dais, covered by a copper-clad wooden dome supported by eight columns. On the night of 5 March 2010, thieves stole some of the copper roofing, damaging much more in the process; this happened again twice in 2011. In early 2013, the copper sheeting was replaced using green <b>zinc-coated</b> panels, and CCTV was installed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zinc-coated</b> metals {{were first}} {{patented}} in 1837, separately by M. Sorel in France and H. W. Crawford in England. The methods employed a “hot dipping” process to coat sheet iron with zinc. By 1839 “galvanized” sheet iron roofing {{was being used}} in New York City. The Merchant's Exchange in Manhattan {{was one of the}} first buildings to have both a galvanized roof and galvanized gutters. Some galvanized sheet roofing was pressed with designs, a popular technique in the Victorian era.|$|E
50|$|Zinc is {{extracted}} from the purified zinc sulfate solution by electrowinning, which is a specialized form of electrolysis. The process works by passing an electric current through the solution {{in a series of}} cells. This causes the zinc to deposit on the cathodes (aluminium sheets) and oxygen to form at the anodes. Sulfuric acid is also formed in the process and reused in the leaching process. Every 24 to 48 hours, each cell is shut down, the <b>zinc-coated</b> cathodes are removed and rinsed, and the zinc is mechanically stripped from the aluminium plates.|$|E

5000|$|This U-shaped building, {{standing}} at 475 ft in height, fronts Chicago's Michigan Avenue and Grant Park. The 40 ft pyramid {{at the top}} of the building (which Schulze & Harrington, authors of Chicago's Famous Buildings, compare with the Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus), with its new <b>zinc-coated</b> stainless steel sheathing, is peaked by a 20 ft glass [...] "beehive" [...] ornament containing a blue glass box filled with six 1000-watt lightbulbs which emits a deep blue light, a prominent feature of Chicago's nighttime skyline. The beehive is supported by four limestone bisons. Because of this ornament, the building is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Beehive Building." ...|$|E
5000|$|The wheels were {{designed}} and manufactured by General Motors Defense Research Laboratories in Santa Barbara, California. Ferenc Pavlics was given special recognition by NASA {{for developing the}} [...] "resilient wheel". They consisted of a spun aluminum hub and a 32 in diameter, 9 in wide tire made of <b>zinc-coated</b> woven 0.033 in diameter steel strands attached to the rim and discs of formed aluminum. Titanium chevrons covered 50% of the contact area to provide traction. Inside the tire was a 25.5 in diameter bump stop frame to protect the hub. Dust guards were mounted above the wheels. Each wheel had its own electric drive made by Delco, a direct current (DC) series-wound motor capable of [...] at 10,000 rpm, attached to the wheel via an 80:1 harmonic drive, and a mechanical brake unit.|$|E
50|$|Improvements to the Rambler {{included}} a full-width die-cast grille while the body side gained an uninterrupted line. Rather than blending into the C-pillar, the belt line continued to the tailfins. Engineering changes included thicker brake linings and larger brakes for V8-powered cars, {{as well as}} fuel economy improvements with lower axle ratios and more efficient carburetor for the I6 engines. An electrically engaged overdrive unit behind the three-speed manual transmission was also available. The automatic transmission was operated by pushbuttons on the left-side of the instrument panel. To increase longevity, Rambler mufflers were aluminum-coated {{on the inside and}} <b>zinc-coated</b> on the outside. On cars with automatic transmission, engine starting was now incorporated into the neutral pushbutton, thus eliminating the ignition key start switch. Accidental starter engagement was prevented by a lockout when the engine was running.|$|E
5000|$|Alexander Glass (1858-1941) was a {{son-in-law}} of Nelson E. Whitaker. After {{working for}} both the LaBelle Iron Works in Steubenville, Ohio (which his father Andrew Glass had helped found) and Whitaker family steel plants, he started the Wheeling Corrugating Company, {{with the help of}} an investment from his father-in-law. It was the first firm in Wheeling to make <b>zinc-coated</b> steel, corrugated for strength, for building, and it was a success. In 1919 Glass' company, the La Belle Iron Works, the Whitaker-Glessner Company, and the Wheeling Steel and Iron Company combined to form the Wheeling Steel Corporation, which Glass later led until his death in 1941. Wheeling Steel merged with Pittsburgh Steel to form Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel in 1968. Glass incidentally made Wheeling, West Virginia famous by placing a large red [...] "Wheeling" [...] label on the company's garbage pails, which were widely used.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1895, {{hoping to be}} able to {{restrain}} the increased interest of foreigners in the Slovene mountains, Aljaž drew up with a chalk on the floor of his room in the Parish of Dovje plans for a solemn cylindrical tower with a flag on its top. In April that year, he purchased the summit of Triglav for the sum of one Austro-Hungarian gulden from the then Municipality of Dovje. Having done so, he secured himself the right to erect a building on his own real property. The tower was constructed from iron and <b>zinc-coated</b> sheet steel by Anton Belec from Šentvid near Ljubljana. He and four workers brought the parts of the tower to the summit of Triglav and put the tower together in only five hours on 7 August 1895. Its solemn opening and blessing took place in a small circle on 22 August that year.|$|E

50|$|In September 1986, Audi {{released}} a new Typ 89 Audi 80 for the 1987 model {{year on the}} European market and introduced it elsewhere within a year. It {{was based on a}} new platform which broke the relationship between the 80 and the Volkswagen Passat, the corresponding third generation of which used the transverse-engined Volkswagen B3 platform, whilst Audi stuck with the longitudinal front wheel drive layout for the B3-series 80. Although often called the typ 89 even among knowledgeable Audi enthusiasts, the official and correct nomenclature was its production code Typ 89 from 1987 to 1989, and Typ 8A from 1990 onwards (in line with a restructuring of many VW platform designations). It introduced a new aerodynamic look and a fully galvanised bodyshell. This was the first mid-sized car to feature a fully <b>zinc-coated</b> body, giving it longevity and durability against corrosion perforation. This protective shield proved to be so effective that Audi extended its corrosion perforation warranty from the originally offered ten years to twelve years (during early pre-production, the body was expected to be good for only eight years). Audi still uses zinc galvanisation for all current steel-bodied models.|$|E
