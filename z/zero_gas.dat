For {{a number}} of VOCs gaseous reference standards are available from specialty gas suppliers or national metrology institutes, either {{in the form of}} cylinders or dynamic generation methods. However, for many VOCs, such as oxygenated VOCs, monoterpenes, or formaldehyde, no standards are available at the appropriate amount of fraction due to the chemical reactivity or adsorption of these molecules. Currently, several national metrology institutes are working on the lacking standard gas mixtures at trace level concentration, minimising adsorption processes, and improving the <b>zero</b> <b>gas.</b> The final scopes are for the traceability and the long-term stability of the standard gases to be in accordance with the data quality objectives (DQO, maximum uncertainty of 20% in this case) required by the WMO/GAW program.|$|E

The tested gas purifiers included one adsorption cartridge with an inorganic media and two types of metal catalysts.

40|$|We {{present a}} sharp {{interface}} method for computing incompressible immiscible two-phase flows. It couples the level-set and volume-of-fluid techniques and retains their advantages while overcoming their weaknesses. It is stable and robust even for large density and viscosity ratios {{on the order}} of 1000 to 1. The numerical method is an extension of the second-order method presented by Sussman [M. Sussman, A second order coupled levelset and volume of fluid method for computing growth and collapse of vapor bubbles, Journal of Computational Physics 187 (2003) 110 – 136] in which the previous method treated the gas pressure as spatially constant and the present method treats the gas as a second incompressible fluid. The new method yields solutions in the <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> density limit which are comparable in accuracy to the method in which the gas pressure was treated as spatially constant. This improvement in accuracy allows one to compute accurate solutions on relatively coarse grids, thereby providing a speed-up over continuum or "ghost-fluid" methods...|$|E

40|$|The low {{frequency}} sensitivity of space-borne gravitational wave observatories will depend critically on the geodetic {{purity of the}} trajectories of orbiting test masses. Fluctuations in the temperature difference across the enclosure surrounding the free-falling test mass can produce noisy forces through several processes, including the radiometric effect, radiation pressure, and outgassing. We present here a detailed experimental investigation of thermal gradient-induced forces for the LISA gravitational wave mission and the LISA Pathfinder, employing high resolution torsion pendulum measurements of the torque on a LISA-like test mass suspended inside a prototype of the LISA gravitational reference sensor that will surround the test mass in orbit. The measurement campaign, accompanied by numerical simulations of the radiometric and radiation pressure effects, allows a more accurate and representative characterization of thermal-gradient forces in the specific geometry and environment relevant to LISA free-fall. The pressure dependence of the measured torques allows clear identification of the radiometric effect, in quantitative agreement with the model developed. In the limit of <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> pressure, the measurements are most likely dominated by outgassing, but at a low level that does not threaten the LISA sensitivity goals.

In a bid to improve and perfect this modern way of journeying this paper focuses on the optimization of the automobile, subject matter being the effective and proper maintenance of the tyre so as to curb the disappointment of failing to travel due to underinflated tyres. The design presented in the report herein functions to restore the tyre pressure on vehicles {{so that they are}} kept at optimum pressure levels, thus extending their life time at the same time saving the owner from fuel costs and maintenance cost incurred with underinflated tyres. It constitutes of a wind driven turbine-compressor unit which uses drag wind as source of drive to a turbine and quickly converts it to rotational energy which powers a small compressor that feeds the tyre with pressurized air whenever the need arises.

40|$|Models of {{gas bubble}} {{dynamics}} employed in probabilistic analyses of decompression sickness incidence in man must be theoretically consistent and simple, {{if they are}} to yield useful results without requiring excessive computations. They are generally formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations that describe diffusion-limited gas exchange between a gas bubble and the extravascular tissue surrounding it. In our previous model (Ann. Biomed. Eng. 30 : 232 - 246, 2002), we showed that with appropriate representation of sink pressures to account for gas loss or gain due to heterogeneous blood perfusion in the unstirred diffusion region around the bubble, diffusion-limited bubble growth in a tissue of finite volume can be simulated without postulating a boundary layer across which gas flux is discontinuous. However, interactions between two or more bubbles caused by competition for available gas cannot be considered in this model, because the diffusion region has a fixed volume with <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> flux at its outer boundary. The present work extends the previous model to accommodate interactions among multiple bubbles by allowing the diffusion region volume of each bubble to vary during bubble evolution. For given decompression and tissue volume, bubble growth is sustained only if the bubble number density is below a certain maximum...|$|E

The model comprises- a COD based kinetic part from which the % PSS COD and sulphate removals are calculated for given hydraulic and sludge retention times; a CHONS, COD and charge mass balance stoichiometry part from which the alkalinity generated (from both the HCO 3 - and HS-) are determined from the % COD and sulphate removals; and a mixed weak acid/base chemistry part from which the digester pH is calculated from the HCO 3 - and H 2 S/HS- species formed. From the stoichiometry, {{it was found that the}} PSS is carbon limited in that it does not generate sufficient HCO 3 - alkalinity for the sulphate reduction, i. e. its COD/C ratio is too high which accounts for the observed <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> (CO 2) generation. The H 2 S/HS- system provides the alkalinity shortfall and establishes the system pH. Once developed and calibrated, the model results were compared with experimental data from 2 lab-scale UASB reactors (operated at 35 oC and 20 oC respectively) fed PSS and sulphate.

40|$|We study local {{radiation}} magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in static, optically thick, vertically stratified media with constant flux mean opacity. We include {{the effects of}} vertical gradients in a horizontal background magnetic field. Assuming rapid radiative diffusion, we use the <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> pressure limit as an entry point for investigating the coupling between the photon bubble instability and the Parker instability. Apart from factors that depend on wavenumber orientation, the Parker instability exists for wavelengths longer than a characteristic wavelength lambda_{tran}, while photon bubbles exist for wavelengths shorter than lambda_{tran}. The growth rate in the Parker regime is independent of {{the orientation of the}} horizontal component of the wavenumber when radiative diffusion is rapid, but the range of Parker-like wavenumbers is extended if there exists strong horizontal shear between field lines (i. e. horizontal wavenumber perpendicular to the magnetic field). Finite gas pressure introduces an additional short wavelength limit to the Parker-like behavior, and also limits the growth rate of the photon bubble instability to a constant value at short wavelengths. We also consider the effects of differential rotation with accretion disk applications in mind. Our results may explain why photon bubbles have not yet been observed in recent stratified shearing box accretion disk simulations. Photon bubbles may physically exist in simulations with high radiation to gas pressure ratios, but higher spatial resolution will be needed to resolve the asymptotically growing unstable wavelengths.
