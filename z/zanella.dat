2500|$|At {{a lecture}} in New York in November 1968, {{given by the}} Veronese printer Giovanni Mardersteig {{operator}} of the private press Officina Bodoni, Rummonds met Mardersteig’s son, Martino, who introduced Rummonds to the iron handpress. From 1969 on Rummonds printed all of his books on iron handpresses. [...] The following year Rummonds moved his publishing venture and printing equipment to Verona, Italy, where he remained until 1982. Alessandro <b>Zanella</b> joined Rummonds at the Plain Wrapper Press in 1976, eventually becoming a partner in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|A 2006 {{study by}} <b>Zanella,</b> Gurioli, Pareschi, and Lanza used the {{magnetic}} characteristics of over 200samples of lithic, roof-tile, and plaster fragments collected from pyroclastic deposits {{in and around}} Pompeii to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the [...] The deposits were placed by pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) resulting from the collapses of the Plinian column. The authors argue that fragments over [...] {{were not in the}} current long enough to acquire its temperature, which would have been much higher, and therefore they distinguish between the depositional temperatures, which they estimated, and the emplacement temperatures, which in some cases based on the cooling characteristics of some types and fragment sizes of rocks they believed they also could estimate. Final figures are considered to be those of the rocks in the current just before deposition.|$|E

30|$|First, a {{validation}} {{was performed}} by comparing {{the findings of the}} model about oxygenation to those of <b>Zanella’s</b> model [11]. Input parameters were set to those in <b>Zanella’s</b> paper, and V̇_SWEEP adjusted to obtain PaCO 2 of 40  mmHg. The same output parameters were examined, enabling validation by reproducing the graphs from <b>Zanella’s</b> paper.|$|R
30|$|First, {{when the}} {{validation}} was performed with input parameters similar to <b>Zanella’s</b> model [11], the model produced almost identical graphical output (see the Additional file  3). This provided independent verification of <b>Zanella’s</b> model, and {{validation of the}} more complex mathematical approach that we have taken.|$|R

50|$|Both {{groups were}} playing opportunistically. The group of <b>Zanella</b> (the Associazione Autonoma) {{followed}} daily Hungarian politics, {{trying to cut}} all possible alliances. Vio appears to keep distance from <b>Zanella</b> openly condemning its conflicting stance towards the Hungarian authorities that “did much harm to the city”. <b>Zanella</b> attacked the leghisti as they were called because of their unabashed compromising attitude with the Hungarians.|$|E

Marinescu claimed pole position for the second race, but could not stop Bacheta taking his second win of the weekend; Fontana again completed the podium, behind Marinescu.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Zanella,</b> {{writing in}} 1905, claimed {{that there was}} a genuine Fiuman {{nationality}} and identity that comprised Italian, Croatian, and Hungarian elements as well, and that was loyal to the (multinational) State of the Crown of St. Stephen, not to Hungary (that was a nation). <b>Zanella</b> claimed that it was offensive for the Fiumani to be labelled as “Italians” by the Hungarian government. According to <b>Zanella,</b> the inhabitants of Fiume are called Fiumani but are themselves composed of “three nationalities”: the Italians that is the autonomists who were for centuries the “old dominators of the land” but also the Croats and the Hungarians.Zanella changed the paradigm: Hungary had its state right within the Empire since it was the land of the Magyar nation. Similarly, Croatia retained its autonomy and state right because of its historical and national specificity. The same applied to Fiume: as kossuthism and the Independence and 1848 Party proclaimed national independence as the ultimate political goal for Hungarians, in Fiume both Frano Supilo and <b>Zanella</b> started their policies of [...] "New Course". Both paths were basically secessionist and ready to look at new allies (Serbs for Supilo, with the resulting Resolution of Fiume) and Croats for <b>Zanella,</b> who helped Supilo providing him with the necessary contacts with the Kossuthian faction in Hungary.|$|E
