40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to {{demonstrate}} the direct link between the microbial ecosystem of drinking water distribution systems and animal health in pig breeding. Based on a survey over 18 months, a treatment using essential oils proved to be efficient in increasing piglet health and <b>zootechnical</b> <b>performance.</b> Water pipe biofilms were monitored by laser scanning confocal microscopy, while <b>zootechnical</b> <b>performance</b> and health cost {{data were collected from}} professional organisations. In two representative monitored herds, it was observed that the drinking water distribution pipes, initially fouled by fungi, were replaced by a bacterial film while both veterinary costs and the total feed conversion ratio decreased.

At weaning, 32 female pigs were distributed into 4 experimental groups and fed either a control diet without FA (C group) or diets supplemented with 1 of the 3 FA (FA 1, FA 2, FA 3 groups). The pigs received a starter‐ 1 diet from day 1 (weaning) to 15, and a starter‐ 2 diet from day 16 to 28. On days 16, 23 and 26, the animals were subjected to consecutive 1 ‐h and 22 ‐h 2 ‐choice feeding tests with the FA diet corresponding to their group and the C diet. No difference in the voluntary daily feed intake and growth was found between groups. During the 1 ‐h tests, the pigs of the FA 1 group preferred the FA 1 diet to the C diet on day 23, and the pigs of the FA 3 group preferred the FA 3 diet on day 26. However, preferences were influenced by a high inter‐individual variability and no consistent preference pattern was highlighted in these 2 groups.

Materials and Methods: Experimental group birds were administered with enrofloxacin at recommended therapeutic dose 10 mg/Kg body weight, through drinking water for five consecutive days from 43 rd to 47 th day of age. <b>Zootechnical</b> <b>performance</b> parameters, behavioural and humoral immune response in terms of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre were assessed at different time interval during pre-treatment, treatment, post-treatment period. Bursa of Fabricius and spleen tissues collected at each sampling point viz. 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 days post treatment were subjected to histopathological examination. Results: A significant reduction in HI titre was noticed in enrofloxacin administered birds. The decreased HI titre was further substantiated by the histopathological changes observed in bursa of Fabricius and spleen which showed a lymphocytic dispersion and depletion with several areas of lymphoblastic degeneration. Conversely, a down regulatory effect on humoral immunity was observed as evidenced by increased HI titre value noticed from 5 th day post treatment onwards and a congruent reversible trend in histopathological changes as indicated by repopulation with lymphocytes on 9 th day post treatment. However, {{there was no significant}} change in body weight, cumulative feed intake, feed efficiency and behaviour in enrofloxacin administered groups. Conclusion: The present study suggests that the immuno suppressive activity of enrofloxacin may alter the immune response to vaccines, if it is coadministered during vaccination of broilers. On the other hand, enrofloxacin, though it decreased the humoral immune response, it did not have any appreciable effect on broiler's performance. [Vet World 2013; 6 (6. 000) : 337 - 342...|$|E

Forty-eight female pigs at 21 days of age were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme (meal/pelleted diet vs. light-weight/heavy-weight piglets), with six replicates for the nursery phase and 12 replicates for the growing-finishing phases. Animals received the experimental diet from 21 to 41 days of age. Data were analyzed with ANOVA, setting the significance in 5 %. Feeding with the pelleted diet resulted in a 39 % greater daily weight gain and a 28 % greater feed conversion rate for piglets from weaning to 40 days of age. Pelleting also resulted in a decrease in feed wastage during the first week after weaning (9. 15 % for meal diet vs. 1. 68 % for pelleted diet) and; consequently, the results showed an increase in feed consumption.

The sex was not a significant effect on the pH of loin at 45 minutes post mortem (p > 0. 05). The fattening year had a significant effect (p < 0. 001) on all studied parameters however, without any particularly trend...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{effect of}} a {{specific}} combination (SC) of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and Capsicum oleoresin was investigated on productive performance and immune response in broiler chickens. Materials and Methods: Six hundred one-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated into two groups for 5 weeks. The SC was supplemented at 100 ppm of ration (presence or absence). Results: Treatment of broiler chickens with the SC improved productive performance variables {{as compared with the}} blank control birds. It decreased total mortality, increased final body weight, weight gain, production number and decreased final feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P< 0. 05). The SC had a positive effect on carcass quality and enhanced HI titer against Newcastle disease (ND) virus vaccine, as compared to their untreated control group (P< 0. 05). The SC treated birds had higher values of intestinal diameter than the control ones. Conclusion: It could be concluded that administration of a specific combination of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and Capsicum oleoresin to broiler chickens improved chicken <b>zootechnical</b> <b>performance</b> response variables, had a potent immuno-modulatory effect (potentiated immune response) and improved gut integrity. Eventually, this combination {{could be used as a}} replacement to the controversial feed additives (antibiotic growth promoters). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{adequate}} diet of Nile tilapia {{in their}} growth early stages {{is fundamental to}} the success of culture subsequent stages. The goal of the present work was to evaluate the Nile tilapia growth fed with different diets, and to morphometrically characterized the gastrointestinal tract of this species. The treatments consisted of three diets: (D 1) natural food, (D 2), commercial feed and (D 3) commercial feed + natural food. In the qualitative phytoplankton analysis, there was greater representation of the genus Chlorella, while zooplankton community analysis revealed greater number of Brachionus rotifer. Growth and survival in D 2 and D 3 did not reveal differences (p > 0. 05), while in D 1, the results were significantly lower (p < 0. 05). The gastro-somatic and entero-somatic indices, and the intestinal quotient revealed higher values when only natural food was available. Nile tilapia reached best <b>zootechnical</b> <b>performance</b> when commercial feed was included in the diet. The intake of natural and/or artificial food is related to the growth and development of the gastrointestinal indices, emphasizing that these indicators can be altered by the type of feeding. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} requirement of digestible protein (DP) for Nile tilapia fed with diets based on soybean meal and corn. Two hundred Nile tilapia juveniles, sexually reversed, were used for a trial period of 100 days. The animals were distributed in 20 boxes of 1000 L- 1 in a random design with five treatments and four replications, the boxes were connected to a water recirculation system. Five isoenergetic diets were tested with different levels of digestible protein (DP) : 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 %. At the end of the experimental period were evaluated the <b>zootechnical</b> <b>performance</b> data. A quadratic effect (p < 0. 05) was shown to parameters of final weight, weight gain, final length, fillet yield and visceral fat with the best points that ranged from 28. 3 to 29. 9 % of DP. The largest area of hepatocytes was found to the lowest levels of DP in the diet (20 and 25 %) compared to the other levels, which were similar. Thus, Nile tilapia has adequate performance for the consumption of diets based on soybean and corn meal and the recommended level is 28. 3 % of PD in these conditions...|$|E
40|$|Finding {{alternatives}} to antimicrobial growth promoters {{is part of}} the goal of improving sustainability in pig production. Dietary fibres are considered as health-promoting substances acting on pigs’ microbiota. This study aimed to investigate whether the enrichment of sows’ diet with high levels of wheat bran (WB) could impact the performances of sows and piglets’ health. Seven sows were fed a control diet (CON) and 8 sows a WB diet from day 43 of gestation (WB 240 g/kg DM) {{until the end of the}} lactation period (WB 140 g/kg DM). Diets were formulated to be iso-energetic and iso-nitrogenous by changing the proportions of some ingredients. Faeces were sampled at different time points (before treatment, during treatment: in gestation and lactation) to determine microbiota composition (sequencing with Illumina MiSeq). Milk was sampled weekly to determine lactose, fat and protein concentration by mid-infrared technology and IgA and IgG contents by ELISA. Before weaning (d 26 - 27), piglets were euthanized, intestinal contents and tissues sampled for further analyses. <b>Zootechnical</b> <b>performances</b> of sows and piglets were recorded. Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS MIXED procedure and repeated measurements. Treatment never impacted piglets’ weight (P= 0. 51). Sows’ ingestion during the lactation period was comparable between both treatments until the last 4 days of lactation where the percentage of target ingestion was significantly (P< 0. 001) lower for the WB (66 %) compared to the CON group (89 %). No effect on sows’ backfat and weight changes was observed. An increased abundance of Lactobacillus spp. in feces of the WB group was observed in gestation before and after diet change (8. 8 % vs 15. 1 % of total bacteria). However, for the overall genera changes between treatments, it only seems to occur for minor groups of bacteria. Milk protein, fat, IgG and IgA were not affected by treatment, but a time-effect (P< 0. 001) was observed while treatment impacted (P< 0. 05) lactose content. In conclusion, sows’ performances were not affected by the high WB diet and more research on the piglets’ samples is foreseen...|$|R
40|$|Decreasing broiler {{density in}} farms is {{foreseen}} by directive 2007 / 43 /EC [2], especially if mortality results {{are higher than}} a fixed threshold. The highest incidence of chicken mortality in industrial production occurs {{during the first week}} of rearing. In order to decrease mortality of broiler chickens during the first days of rearing, this experiment studied the effect of different transport durations on day-old chicks’ mortality. Also, dehydration and <b>zootechnical</b> <b>performances</b> such as feed intake and body weight gain were assessed during the rearing period. Just after hatching, 7800 chicks (ROSS PM 3) from breeders of 35 weeks old were transported to a poultry house in boxes of 100 chicks and distributed into three treatments: the first group was transported in a truck for 4 hours (T 4), the second was transported in the same truck for 10 hours (T 10) and the last group (T 0) was moved directly from the hatchery to the farm (few minutes). During transport air temperature in the truck was 28 °C to 29 °C with a relative humidity of 34 % to 36 %. After transport, chicks were reared in the same house and each treatment was divided into 4 pens of 35 m² with 650 chicks each. Hematocrit rates, used as an indication of dehydration status, were assessed by sampling chick blood before and after transport and at day 3. Chicks were weighed before and after transport, and once per week until slaughter (Day 35). Feed intake was measured weekly until slaughter age. No differences between treatments were observed in hematocrit rates, feed intake, or mortality. However, chicks’ weights just after transport and until day 21, were significantly lower in transported chicks for 4 (T 4) and 10 hours (T 10) than those moved directly to the farm (T 0), but no effect was observed at Day 28 until slaughter age (Day 35). In conclusion transport of chicks for 4 or 10 hours had no effect on mortality, dehydration, and feed intake but reduced chick body weight until 21 days. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{turns on}} the use of the phytase in aquaculture, its {{zootechnical}} interests and the possibilities of incorporation in the feed. The goal is to reduce the waste in phosphorus linked to the feeding of fishes, without any loss of <b>zootechnical</b> <b>performances</b> and with a decrease of feed costs. We have studied the bibliography data, in order to enhance the value of the raw materials (total phosphorus, phytate and available phosphorus) used Gouessant for the manufacturing of rainbow trout of feed; to determine the needs of phosphorus for aquaculture species; to determine the needs of phosphorus for aquaculture species, to determine the sings of lack of phosphorus for fishes; to study the antagonism between the phosphorus and the calcium and to study also the different forms of waste for the rainbow trout. The results found in the bibliography enable us test several Hypothesis of feed formulation for rainbow trout with different raw materials. This simulation and the calculation for wastes allowed to validate two formulation of feed: a control feed (0. 5 % of monocalcique phosphate) and a trial feed (supplementation with 0. 002 % of phytase Ronozyme PL and without inorganic phosphate). The feeds have been produced and sent to an experimental structure (agricultural college of Brehoulou). The result of the formulation give a decrease of the phosphorus waste of 28 % for the trial feed compared to the feed. The supplementation enables a gain of 2. 3 euro per ton. The partial results of the current test show no significant difference yet for the zootechnical parameters (growth rate, mortality, weight gain and obvious conversion rate) between control feed and the trial one. The waste measures do not show either significant difference between the control feed and the trial one, but however, the average difference would to decrease the wastes of 35. 6 % thanks to the use of phytase...|$|R
