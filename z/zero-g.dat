5|$|London {{spent the}} {{majority}} of 2014 wrestling abroad, including in Australia, Europe, and South America. In Scotland's Insane Championship Wrestling (ICW), London and Brian Kendrick won the ICW Tag Team Championship in October 2014. After a 28 day reign, they lost the championship to Polo Promotions (Mark Coffey and Jackie Polo) on November 2. Following this title loss, London would then unsuccessfully challenge Kenny Williams for the ICW <b>Zero-G</b> Championship.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 and January 2007, {{during the}} off-season, both <b>zero-G</b> rolls {{were removed from}} the ride. The rolls were a problem due to {{concerns}} of occasional stalling caused by a failure of the tower's LIMs. The rolls were replaced by a slightly banked inclined S-curve. Batman's train had its shells painted red so Robin could be ready to open first before Batman. This was done because Robin was more reliable than Batman and the track replacement for Robin was completed first on March 13. It re-opened on April 7. Batman's track was replaced between April 16 and April 20, while the park was closed. However, Batman never re-opened.|$|E
5|$|Kraken Unleashed (named for {{the fictional}} sea monster {{of the same}} name) is a steel floorless roller coaster located at SeaWorld Orlando in the United States. Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride {{features}} a total of seven inversions including two vertical loops, a dive loop, a spiraling camelback (<b>zero-g</b> roll), a cobra roll and a flat spin Kraken opened on June 1, 2000. It is also the world's second longest floorless coaster elongating up to 4,177 feet (1,273 m). The coaster was refurbished and renamed to Kraken Unleashed.

5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a <b>zero-g</b> {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in advance for the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E
5|$|Devitt {{is widely}} {{known for his}} tenure with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) as Prince Devitt, {{where he is a}} three-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion and six-time IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion, having held the title twice with Minoru and four times with Ryusuke Taguchi. He is also a two-time winner of the Best of the Super Juniors tournament, having won in 2010 and 2013, as well as being a {{founding}} member of the Bullet Club stable.

He also wrestled for numerous independent promotions, becoming a one-time ICW <b>Zero-G</b> Champion, one-time RPW British Cruiserweight Champion and a two-time NWA British Commonwealth Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, the <b>Zero-G</b> Rolls {{were removed}} from the ride and {{replaced}} with banked hills. Robin's hill was installed in March and Batman's in April. Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track. Because of all of the problems the coaster had and the numerous failed attempts to fix the coaster, Six Flags decided to cut their financial and technical losses and dismantle the ride.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} of 2010, Crypton Future Media {{produced}} a ranking of the VOCALOIDs they sold on their website. Prima was ranked the 9th most popular as they sold, and in the process, the second most popular of the imported VOCALOIDs that Crypton sold.According to a flyer for discounts on VOCALOID released in 2011, Prima was again ranked as <b>Zero-G's</b> 9th most popular product. In 2012, she was in 20th place.|$|R
2500|$|Vocaloids {{have also}} been {{promoted}} at {{events such as the}} NAMM show and the Musikmesse fair. In fact, it was the promotion of <b>Zero-G's</b> Lola and Leon at the NAMM trade show that would later introduce PowerFX to the Vocaloid program. These events have also become an opportunity for announcing new Vocaloids with Prima being announced at the NAMM event in 2007 and Tonio having been announced at the NAMM event in 2009. A customized, Chinese version of Sonika was released at the Fancy Frontier Develop Animation Festival, as well as with promotional versions with stickers and posters. Sanrio held a booth at Comiket 78 featuring the voice of an unreleased Vocaloid. AH Software in cooperation with Sanrio shared a booth and the event was used to advertise both the Hello Kitty game and AH Software's new Vocaloid. At the Nico Nico Douga Daikaigi 2010 Summer: Egao no Chikara event, Internet Co., Ltd. announced their latest Vocaloid [...] "Gachapoid" [...] based on popular children's character Gachapin.|$|R

25|$|The term micro-g {{environment}} (also µg, {{often referred}} to by the term microgravity) {{is more or less}} a synonym of weightlessness and <b>zero-G,</b> but indicates that g-forces are not quite zero, just very small.|$|E
25|$|Sleep is {{disturbed}} on the ISS regularly {{because of}} mission demands, such as incoming or departing ships. Sound {{levels in the}} station are unavoidably high; because the atmosphere is unable to thermosiphon, fans are required at all times to allow processing of the atmosphere which would stagnate in the freefall (<b>zero-g)</b> environment.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} was originally only available in English {{starting with the}} first Vocaloids Leon, Lola and Miriam by <b>Zero-G,</b> and Japanese with Meiko and Kaito made by Yamaha and sold by Crypton Future Media.

25|$|With {{regard to}} the English Vocaloid studios, Power FX's Sweet Ann was given her own MySpace page and Sonika her own Twitter account. In {{comparison}} to Japanese studios, <b>Zero-G</b> and PowerFX maintain {{a high level of}} contact with their fans. <b>Zero-G</b> in particular encourages fan feed back and, after adopting Sonika as a mascot for their studio, has run two competitions related to her. There was also talk from PowerFX of redoing their Sweet Ann box art and a competition would be included as part of the redesign. The Vocaloid Lily also had a competition held during her trial period. English Vocaloids have not sold enough to warrant extras, such as seen with Crypton's Miku Append. However, it has been confirmed if the English Vocaloids become more popular, then Appends would be an option in the future. Crypton plans to start an electronic magazine for English readers at the end of 2010 in order to encourage the growth of the English Vocaloid fanbase. Extracts of PowerFX's Sweet Ann and Big Al were included in Soundation Studio in their Christmas loops and sound release with a competition included.|$|E
25|$|The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Raffaello {{made up the}} {{majority}} of the payload. This was Raffaellos fourth trip to the International Space Station since 2001 and the 12th use of an MPLM. Unlike previous MPLM missions that delivered large compartments and devices to outfit the space station laboratories, STS-135 delivered only bags and supply containers. The MPLM was filled with 16 resupply racks, which is the maximum that it could handle. Eight Resupply Stowage Platforms (RSPs), two Integrated Stowage Platforms (ISPs), six Resupply Stowage Racks (RSRs) and one <b>Zero-G</b> Stowage Rack (ZSR), which sits above another rack during transport.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, the European Space Agency (ESA) {{partnered with}} Sony Pictures International {{to support the}} release of the film, stating that it shares common themes in the film of concern for Earth's future and educating the next generation. ESA and Sony are holding the After Earth {{competition}} to win the opportunity to go to Bordeaux, France and have a 'space experience' in weightlessness on a 'parabolic' flight on Novespace's <b>ZERO-G</b> aircraft. The winner will receive paid travel expenses to and from Bordeaux and one night's accommodation for two people, and will only be eligible to participate in the reduced gravity aircraft on October 25 following a medical exam.|$|E
25|$|According to Crypton, because {{professional}} female singers {{refused to}} provide voice samples, in {{fear that the}} software might create their singing voice's clones, Crypton changed their focus from imitating certain singers to creating characteristic vocals. This change of focus led to sampling vocals of voice actors and the Japanese voice actor agency Arts Vision supported the development. Similar concerns are expressed throughout the other studios using Vocaloid, with <b>Zero-G</b> refusing to release the names of several of their providers. PowerFX only hinted at Sweet Ann's voice provider, and Oliver's voice provider is still unknown. AH Software named the voice providers for Miki, Kiyoteru, Yukari, Zunko and Iroha, but for legal reasons cannot name Kaai Yuki's voice provider as a minor {{was the subject of}} the recordings.|$|E
