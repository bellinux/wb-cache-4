50|$|In {{spite of}} the other receptors cited as being {{responsive}} to CysLTs, CysLTR1 appears to be critical in mediating many of the pathological responses to CysLTs in humans. Montelukast, <b>Zafirlukast,</b> and Pranlukast are selective receptor antagonists for the CysLTR1 but not CysLTR2. These drugs are in use and/or shown to be effective as prophalaxis and chronic treatments for allergic and non-allergic diseases such as: allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma and rhinitis (see Aspirin-induced asthma); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see Acquired non-inflammatory myopathy#Diet and Trauma Induced Myopathy). However, responses to these lukast drugs vary greatly with the drugs showing fairly high rates of poor responses and ~20% of patients reporting no change in symptoms after treatment with these agents.

5000|$|The CysLT-induced {{activation}} of CysLTR2 induces {{many of the}} same in vitro responses of cells involved in allergic reactions as well as the in vivo allergic responses in animal models as that induced by CysLT-induced CysLTR1 (see Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1#Receptor. However, CysLT2 requires 10-fold higher concentrations of LTD4, the most potent cysLT for CysLTR1, to activate CysLTR2. Furthermore, the allergic and hypersensitivity responses of humans and animal models are significantly reduced by chronic treatment with Montelukast, <b>Zafirlukast,</b> and Pranlukast, drugs which are selective receptor antagonists of CysLTR1 but not CysLTR2. Models of allergic reactions in Cysltr2-deficient mice as well as in a human mast cell line indicate that mouse Cysltr2 and its human homolog CysLTR2 act to inhibit Cysltr1 and CysLTR1, respectively, and therefore suggest that CysLTR2 may similarly inhibit CysLTR1 in human allergic diseases.

40|$|<b>Zafirlukast</b> is a cysteinyl {{leukotriene}} type 1 receptor antagonist {{that causes}} bronchodilation and has anti-inflammatory properties. Clinical efficacy {{has been demonstrated}} when using oral doses of 20 to 40 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of <b>zafirlukast</b> are best described by a two-compartment model. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) were achieved 3 hours after a single oral dose of 20 or 40 mg to healthy volunteers. The absolute bioavailability of <b>zafirlukast</b> is unknown. However, coadministration of <b>zafirlukast</b> with food reduces bioavailability by approximately 40 %. The drug binds to plasma proteins (> 99 %), predominantly to albumin, and has a mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 10 hours in both healthy volunteers and patients with asthma. <b>Zafirlukast</b> undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Hydroxylation by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 C 9 is the major biotransformation pathway. The metabolites of <b>zafirlukast</b> contribute little to its overall activity. <b>Zafirlukast</b> is mainly eliminated in the faeces, while urinary excretion accounts for < 10 % of an orally administered dose. Because of its primarily hepatic metabolism, the clearance of <b>zafirlukast</b> is reduced in patients with hepatic impairment. In patients with stable alcoholic cirrhosis, Cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time curve for <b>zafirlukast</b> were increased by 50 to 60 % compared with healthy volunteers. Asymptomatic elevations of serum liver enzymes have been reported with high dosages of <b>zafirlukast</b> (80 mg twice daily), returning to normal after cessation of the drug. Inhibition of the CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A isoenzymes by <b>zafirlukast</b> {{has been reported in}} vitro. <b>Zafirlukast</b> interacts with warfarin and produces a clinically significant increase in the prothrombin time, but it does not alter the pharmacokinetics of terfenadine carboxylate, the active metabolite of terfenadine.

Theophylline metabolism is unchanged in most cases by <b>zafirlukast,</b> but there is a report of one patient with increased theophylline plasma concentrations when <b>zafirlukast</b> was coadministered.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disorder of the airways. The worldwide prevalence of asthma {{has increased in}} recent decades. There is an approximately 20 -fold variation (range 1. 6 % to 36. 8 %) in the prevalence of childhood asthma throughout the world. The highest prevalence rates are in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland and Canada. The indirect costs of asthma, which include absence from school, lost productivity and premature death, are substantial.

Identification and avoidance of factors that precipitate asthma attacks are important in achieving satisfactory control of asthma. A stepped-care approach to drug therapy, in which anti-inflammatory therapy is the cornerstone, is recommended. <b>Zafirlukast</b> is a cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptor antagonist that causes bronchodilation and has anti-inflammatory properties. Oral <b>zafirlukast</b> 20 mg twice daily was more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms, improving lung function, reducing requirements for as-needed beta 2 -agonists and preventing exacerbations in patients >= 12 years of age with mild to moderate asthma. <b>Zafirlukast</b> 20 mg twice daily produced improvements in symptoms and reductions in as-needed beta 2 -agonist rescue medication similar to inhaled sodium cromoglycate in patients with asthma. As an alternative to inhaled corticosteroids, <b>zafirlukast</b> 20 mg twice daily produced improvements in night-time wakenings, mornings with asthma and reductions in the use of beta 2 -agonist rescue medication in patients with mild to moderate asthma.

Study design: A cost-efficacy analysis using resource utilisation and clinical data obtained prospectively from a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled 12 -week clinical trial conducted in the US. Perspective: Third-party payor. Patients and methods: A total of 451 corticosteroid-naive patients with persistent asthma were treated with either fluticasone propionate 88 microg twice daily or <b>zafirlukast</b> 20 mg twice daily. All patients were given salbutamol (albuterol) {{to be used as}} rescue medication. Data were examined using intent-to-treat analysis. Results: Mean daily per person cost-efficacy ratios using improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) [>= 12 % increase from baseline] were $US 3. 47 for fluticasone propionate compared with $US 7. 81 for <b>zafirlukast</b> (1999 values). The mean daily per person cost-efficacy ratios for symptom-free days obtained were $US 5. 51 for fluticasone propionate compared with $US 14. 98 for <b>zafirlukast.</b> These cost-efficacy ratios remained in favour of fluticasone propionate after a robust sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Treatment with fluticasone propionate 88 microg twice daily was the most cost effective treatment compared with <b>zafirlukast</b> 20 mg twice daily in this 12 -week clinical trial.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>zafirlukast</b> on capsular contracture around silicone implants by measuring the pressure within the implant, using a rat experimental model. METHODS: Forty adult female Wistar rats were used. Each one received two silicone implants, one with smooth-surface {{and the other with}} textured-surface. They were randomly divided into four groups (n= 10). The rats of control group I were sacrificed after the implants. The remaining animals were subjected to a daily regimen of intra-peritoneal injection for a period of 90 days and they were distributed as follows: control group II received 0. 9 % physiological saline solution; experimental group I received <b>zafirlukast</b> 1. 25 mg/kg; and experimental group II received <b>zafirlukast</b> 5 mg/kg. The measurement of intra-implant pressure of control group I was determined on the surgery day and in other groups on the ninetieth day, after being sacrificed. RESULTS: In the evaluation of textured implants there was an increase of internal pressure in the control group II, and there was no increase in the experimental groups. Compared to the controls there were not significant differences in smooth implants. CONCLUSION: <b>Zafirlukast</b> reduced the risk of developing capsular contracture around silicone implants with textured surface.
