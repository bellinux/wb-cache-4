25|$|As {{a result}} of a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct after the touchdown, the Patriots’ kicked off from the 15-yard line. Giants wide {{receiver}} Domenik Hixon received it from the Giants' 26-yard line and proceeded to run for a 74-yard touchdown return, retaking the lead for the Giants. Starting from their own 33-yard line, the Patriots moved into Giants territory on a 13-yard Maroney rush and 8-yard Faulk reception. Brady's 8 passing yards on the play gave him 4,557 for the season, breaking Drew Bledsoe's 1994 franchise record of 4,555yards. After the drive stalled, Gostkowski’s recorded his second field goal for the game, making the score 14–13 in favor of the Giants. Following a Giants punt, the Patriots mounted a drive that resulted in Gostkowski’s third field goal of the night, from 37yards, after a 3rd down end <b>zone</b> <b>pass</b> to Moss ricocheted off of linebacker Gerris Wilkinson’s helmet. With 1:54 remaining the half and the Giants trailing 16–14, Manning completed five of his first seven passes to move from the Giants' 15-yard line to the Patriots' 3-yard line. On second down with 18seconds remaining, Manning threw his second touchdown pass of the game, this time to Boss, to take a 21–16 lead at the half.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A fluid tube forming {{procedures}} are applied towards optimization of techno-economical parameter production. A basic principle is utilisation {{of the material}} ductility in the stability range of a certain forming operation. Besides of the manufacturing optimization of tube forming, like this it is achieved: better quality, mechanical and structural properties of the work pieces, material and energy savings. During the process of tube hydroforming, and with {{an analysis of the}} stress-strain states, fig. 3., four characteristic zones have been determined to exist: principal tube <b>zone,</b> <b>passing</b> tube <b>zone</b> into the drainage, drainage zone (stresses of pressure and stretching) and top drainage zone (stresses of stretching and pressure). The areas of attrition functioning in the process of tube forming, fig. 2., can be separated in four different influential zones: a flow <b>zone,</b> <b>passing</b> <b>zone,</b> expansion zone and protraction zone. Knowing the attrition coefficient in the influential zones gives the opportunity of strategy development for its decrease. This paper provides a determining model of attrition coefficient in tube hydroforming. products is a very high level of quality, which implies even a product manufacturing with a lesser number of constituent elements and with a lesser material quality (thin-walled elements). The automobile manufacturers are faced with this problem, where besides functional, the securing and ergonomic product demands are placed. It explains a larger hydroforming application in automobile and aviation industry...|$|R
