40|$|Abstract Zonation affects liver parenchymal cell {{function}} and metabolism {{as well as}} nonparenchymal cell activation, but whether VLDL production is <b>zonated</b> {{has yet to be}} elucidated. Infection induces enhanced VLDL secretion by the liver. Ex vivo studies were undertaken to examine the liver heterogeneity for VLDL formation and secretion and their in vivo response to endotoxin. Highly pure periportal (PP) and perivenous (PV) hepatocytes were isolated from fasted lipopolysaccharide-treated, fasted, and fed rats. They were used to assess their capacity to release VLDL-apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipid classes in relation to de novo lipid synthesis and the expression of genes crucial to VLDL production. Despite the common superior ability of PP hepatocytes for lipid release and zonal differences in lipid synthesis, <b>zonated</b> secretion of VLDL particles was observed i...|$|R

5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. vinosus has a less clearly <b>zonate</b> cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors {{did not agree with}} the delimitation of these forms as distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The {{differential}} oxygenation of periportal and perivenous hepatocytes {{has been}} demonstrated as a major determinant in the <b>zonated</b> expression of certain metabolic pathways in the liver. We have searched for novel genes whose expression could be modulated by hypoxia in cultured rat hepatocytes. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes were incubated under normoxic (21 % oxygen) or hypoxic (3 % oxygen) conditions for 6 h. Differences in gene expression under both conditions were analyzed using the technique of differential display by means of PCR. RESULTS: We have identified the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) as being downregulated by hypoxia. ASL is a cytosolic protein which participates in urea metabolism. ASL expression was time-dependently reduced in hypoxia. Hypoxia modulated the responses of this gene to the two main hormonal signals which induce ASL mRNA: glucocorticoids and cAMP. ASL mRNA levels decreased in response to ATP-reducing agents. CoCl 2 mimicked the effect of hypoxia, suggesting the implication of a hemoprotein in this response. Hypoxia did not affect ASL mRNA stability, indicating that this effect occurs at the transcriptional level. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that differences in oxygen levels across the hepatic parenchyma could participate in the <b>zonated</b> expression of ASL...|$|R

This tomentum diminishes with age. The cap surface is at first similarly tomentose, but eventually the hairs wear off, leaving the surface more or less smooth. The surface starts off somewhat sticky with clear concentric rings of darker shade (a <b>zonate</b> pattern); these rings, especially the outer ones, usually fade in maturity. The cap color is pinkish-orange to pale dull pink, becoming orange to whitish toward the margin as the pink gradually fades. The white to flesh-colored flesh is firm and brittle, but becomes flaccid in age. The latex that is produced when the mushroom tissue is cut or injured is white to cream, and does not change color with prolonged exposure to air, nor does it stain the gills. It has an acrid taste, with a slight to pungent odor.|$|E

40|$|Many {{physiological}} {{processes and}} pathological conditions in livers are spatially heterogeneous, forming patterns at the lobular length scale or varying across the organ. Steatosis, a common liver disease characterized by lipids accumulating in hepatocytes, exhibits heterogeneity at both these spatial scales. The main {{goal of the}} present study was to provide a method for <b>zonated</b> quantification of the steatosis patterns found in an entire mouse liver. As an example application, the results were employed in a pharmacokinetics simulation. For the analysis, an automatic detection of the lipid vacuoles was used in multiple slides of histological serial sections covering an entire mouse liver.

The steatosis patterns were found to be predominantly periportal, with a notable organ-scale heterogeneity. The analysis provides a quantitative description of the extent of steatosis in unprecedented detail. The resulting steatosis patterns were successfully used as a perturbation to the liver as part of an exemplary whole-body pharmacokinetics simulation for the antitussive drug dextromethorphan.

40|$|Morphogenesis {{is crucial}} to {{initiate}} physiological development and tumor invasion. Here we show that a microRNA controls zonation morphogenesis by targeting hyaluronan receptor CD 44. We have developed a novel system to study microRNA functions by generating constructs expressing pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs. Using this system, we have demonstrated that expression of miR- 328 reduced cell adhesion, aggregation, and migration, and regulated formation of capillary structure. Protein analysis indicated that miR- 328 repressed CD 44 expression. Activities of luciferase constructs harboring the target site in CD 44, but not the one containing mutation, were repressed by miR- 328. Zonation morphogenesis appeared in cells transfected by miR- 328 : miR- 328 -transfected cells were present {{on the surface of}} <b>zonating</b> structures while the control cells stayed in the middle. MiR- 328 -mediated CD 44 actions was validated by anti-CD 44 antibody, hyaluronidase, CD 44 siRNA, and CD 44 expression constructs.

Immuno-histochemistry also exhibited CD 44 -negative cells on the surface layers of normal rat livers and the internal zones of Portal veins.

In rat liver, mdr transcripts {{have been shown to}} be expressed mainly in hepatocytes of the periportal region. Since gradients in oxygen tension (pO(2)) may contribute towards <b>zonated</b> gene expression, the influence of arterial and venous pO(2) on mRNA expression of the mdr 1 b isoform was examined in primary rat hepatocytes cultured for up to 3 days. Maximal mdr 1 b mRNA levels (100 %) were observed under arterial pO(2) after 72 h, whereas less than half-maximal mRNA levels (40 %) were attained under venous pO(2). Accordingly, expression of mdr protein and extrusion of the mdr 1 substrate rhodamine 123 were maximal under arterial pO(2) and reduced under venous pO(2). Oxygen-dependent modulation of mdr 1 b mRNA expression was prevented by actinomycin D, indicating transcriptional regulation. Inhibition of haem synthesis by 25 microM CoCl(2) blocked mdr 1 b mRNA expression under both oxygen tensions, whereas 80 microM desferrioxamine abolished modulation by O(2). Haem (10 microM) increased mdr 1 b mRNA levels under arterial and venous pO(2). In hepatocytes treated with 50 microM H(2) O(2), mdr 1 b mRNA expression was elevated by about 1. 6 -fold at venous pO(2) and 1. 5 -fold at arterial pO(2). These results support the conclusion that haem proteins are crucial for modulation of mdr 1 b mRNA expression by O(2) in hepatocyte cultures and that reactive oxygen species may participate in O(2) -dependent signal transduction. Furthermore, the present study suggests that oxygen might be a critical modulator for <b>zonated</b> secretion of mdr 1 substrates into the bile...|$|R
