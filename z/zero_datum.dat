50|$|The {{determination}} of the Rockwell hardness of a material involves {{the application of a}} minor load followed by a major load. The minor load establishes the zero position. The major load is applied, then removed while still maintaining the minor load. The depth of penetration from the <b>zero</b> <b>datum</b> is measured from a dial, on which a harder material gives a higher number. That is, the penetration depth and hardness are inversely proportional. The chief advantage of Rockwell hardness is its ability to display hardness values directly, thus obviating tedious calculations involved in other hardness measurement techniques.|$|E

5000|$|Flood {{stage is}} the water level, as read by a stream gauge or tide gauge, for {{a body of}} water at a {{particular}} location, measured from the level at which {{a body of water}} threatens lives, property, commerce, or travel. The term [...] "at flood stage" [...] is commonly used to describe the point at which this occurs. [...] "Gauge height" [...] (also referred to as [...] "stream stage", [...] "stage of the of water", or simply [...] "stage") is the level of the water surface above an established <b>zero</b> <b>datum</b> at a given location. The zero level can be arbitrary, but it is usually close {{to the bottom of the}} stream or river or at the average level of standing bodies of water. Stage was traditionally measured visually using a staff gauge, which is a fixed ruler marked in 1/100 and 1/10 foot intervals, however electronic sensors that transmit real-time information to the Internet are now used for many of these kind of measurements. The flood stage measurements are given as a height above or below the zero level. Levels below zero are reported as a negative value.|$|E
30|$|In the Zeeko process, the bonnet tooling is {{advanced}} {{towards the}} part prior to polishing, and first-contact is determined using feedback from a load {{cell in the}} polishing head. This gives the <b>zero</b> <b>datum</b> of bonnet compression. The tool is then advanced further towards the part (‘Z-offset’) to compress the bonnet, and so create a contact-spot (influence function) of the desired size. Any error in establishing first-contact directly disturbs the spot-size, and so affects volumetric removal rate by approximately a square law (see Section 3). This effect is therefore very sensitive, and is dominant in overshoot. It {{can be caused by}} movement of the part in its fixturing, thermal growth in the machine, residual hysteresis in the bonnet material, electrical noise in the load cell signal, or drift in the DC signal amplifier. The principal impact is an error in polishing-rate between acquiring influence function data and starting polishing.|$|E
40|$|Vibration is a {{physical}} phenomenon involving repeated oscillatory movements or fluctuations at certain frequency and typically undesirable in many applications since it may cause undue failure or damage to the system. In this paper, the vibration of a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) model representing a short length drive shaft has been effectively and robustly suppressed through {{the implementation of a}} novel Active Force Control (AFC) used in conjunction with a classic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The shaft vibration caused by its support and constraint during its operation was simulated using MATLAB and Simulink considering a number of operating and loading conditions. The results proved that when a pure PID controller was implemented, the vibration is indeed reduced but at the expense of longer execution time and producing noticeable frequency oscillation with slight offset. On the other hand, when the AFC loop was engaged by adding it directly in series with the PID controller (PID+AFC) to produce a 2 DOF controller without any need to further tune the PID controller gains, the vibration is significantly reduced with the amplitude hovering a <b>zero</b> <b>datum</b> without any offset and yielding an extremely low frequency trending...|$|E

40|$|The Second International Symposium on Cretaceous stage {{boundaries}} held in Brussels from September 8 - 14 1995 {{reached a}} preliminary {{agreement on the}} definition of the base of the Cenomanian stage as the first occurrence of the planktonic foraminiferan Rotalipora globotruncanoides Sigal, with a section at Mont Risou near Rosans, Drôme, SE France as the global reference section, where the first occurrence of R. globotruncanoides lies 36 m below the top of the Marnes Bleues as defined by a <b>zero</b> <b>datum</b> limestone {{at the base of the}} succeeding unit. The succession yields ammonites, inoceramid bivalves, nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera that provide a series of marker levels across the boundary, while an ornate δ 13 C curve provides a geochemical marker that can also be recognized in NE England and Italy. Proxies for R. globotruncanoides are: the first appearance of Mantelliceras mantelli and other ammonites of the mantelli Zone at - 30 m, the first occurrence of the nannofossil Calculites anfractus, the first occurrence of the planktonic foraminiferan Rotalipora gandolfii and the last occurrence of the planktonic foraminiferan Rotalipora ticinensis at - 40 m, and the last occurrence of the nannofossil Staurolithites glabra at - 12 m.

40|$|Interest in Mangala Valles {{remains high}} within the {{planetary}} science community. This is justified because the survey mission images {{provide us with}} nearly complete coverage of the system at high resolution. Upcoming high resolution topography from the Mars Observer Laser Altimeter will enable the application of flood discharge models with an unprecedented level of detail. Previous work on the Mangala Valles problem has relied on the available low resolution topography. This has limited the ability of workers to constrain discharge calculations to only within several-order-of-magnitude estimates. Local determinations of channel depths via shadow length measurements and photoclinometric profiling are much more accurate, but can only be applied to steep slopes (and/or low sun elevations) {{in the case of}} shadow measurements, or across relatively short distances (to avoid changes in albedo along asymmetric photoclinometric profiles). We are taking stereo parallax measurements from medium resolution Viking Orbiter images, which provide a valuable intermediate check of the topography between those measurements made thus far and the upcoming Mars Observer data. The images used are from orbits 034 A and 637 A, and cover Mangala Valles from the source graben in Memnonia Fossae {{to the beginning of the}} bifurcated reach (at 9. 5 deg lat., 151. 5 deg lon.). These images are about 300 m/pixel and 250 m/pixel, respectively. Both sets of images were orthographically projected to 250 m/pixel. The separation angle between left-right pairs is approximately 52 degrees. This results in a vertical accuracy on the order of plus or minus 260 m. Though this is still somewhat coarse, the channel relief is clearly resolved. Preliminary profiles across Mangala Valles and the large topographic ridge to the east are shown on the following page. An east-west regional tilt that resulted from slight scaling differences in the digital data has been 'removed' by visually estimating a regional datum on the stereo pairs. North-south variations in scale have not yet been adjusted for, so the <b>zero</b> <b>datum</b> for each profile was simply taken to be the high water line of the channel itself. Our depth measurement for the source breach of about 750 m agrees reasonably well with values of 700 - 1000 m determined from shadow measurements...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a variety}} of {{objectives}} for measuring deviations of flatness, size and mutual arrangement of flat surfaces, namely: processing accuracy control, machinery condition monitoring, treatment process control in terms of shape deviation, comparative analysis of machine rigidity. If for a processing accuracy control it is sufficient to obtain the flatness deviation, as the maximum adjoining surface deviation, {{the choice of the}} adjoining surface as a <b>zero</b> reference <b>datum</b> deviation leads to considerable difficulties in creating devices and in particular devices for measuring size and shape variations. The flat surface is characterized by mutual arrangement of its points and can be represented by equation in the selected coordinate system. The objective of this work is to provide analytical construction of the vector field F, which describes the real surface with an appropriate approximation upon modelling the face milling of the flat surfaces of body parts in conditions of anisotropic rigidity of technological system. To determine the numerical value of shape and size deviation characteristics the average surfaces can serve a basis for the zero reference values of vectors. A mean value theorem allows to obtain measurement information about deviations in shape, size and arrangement of processed flat surfaces in terms of metrology, as well as about the process parameters such as depth of cut, feed, cutting speed, anisotropic rigidity of technological system that characterize the specific processing conditions. The machining center MS 12 - 250 was used to carry out a number of experiments with processing the surfaces of the prism-shaped body parts (300 x 300 x 250) and the subsequent measurements of flatness on the IS- 49 optical line to prove the correlation between expected and observed values of the vectors of flatness deviations...|$|R
40|$|Sea surface height {{data from}} the Geosat {{altimeter}} are compared with island sea level data from 18 gages in the western and central tropical Pacific during December 1986 to November 1987. Care was taken {{to ensure that the}} two data sets are referenced to the same mean surface. This was done by requiring that both data sets have a zero mean sea level over the period April 1985 to April 1986. When the annual means are computed at each station in the later time period, it is found that the annual mean sea surface height values have drifted away from the corresponding sea level values by as much as 16 cm. Further, the pattern of differences that develop between the two data sets is not random but is spatially coherent with a strong east-west gradient. These observations illustrate the necessity for sea surface height data to be referred to a well-defined <b>zero</b> point, a <b>datum,</b> in order to reliably monitor interannual changes in the sea surface topography.

40|$|Most {{ecological}} work on rocky shores {{entails the}} quantification of species distributions and abundances relative to some convenient and accurate datum point. The {{most commonly used}} are tide Ievels and chart data. The problem arises when tides are virtually absent as {{in most of the}} Mediterranean Sea or when accurate chart data are not available. In the Maltese Islands there is only one datum point located in the Grand Harbour, Valletta. A number of bench marks and trigonometric stations of various orders are found scattered all over the Islands, but these are not always located very close to the shore so that levelling work from these stations to a particular study site may become quite a laborious task which may exceed the capabilities of most ecologists. Furthermore, some of these marks are old and location data for them are untraceable, while others {{have turned out to be}} inaccurate. In fact a project is currently underway by the Mapping Unit of the Planning Authority to recalibrate these stations and to establish new bench marks. A further complicating factor is that different charts make use of different datum points. Thus, while Admiralty Charts use a <b>zero</b> point (Chart <b>datum)</b> which is the level of lowest astronomical tide and the level to which all bathymetric soundings are referred, all heights shown on the official Government of Malta survey sheets use a datum point which is 0. 5859 m above the Admiralty Chart datum and which is taken to be mean sea level (MSL) for the Maltese Islands. Additionally, there is also a Public Works Department (PWD) datum which is 0. 4100 m above the AdmiraIty Chart datum. It is not always clearly stated which datum points charts and maps are based on. This state of affairs has resulted in field workers having to resort to some other datum point with which to relate all their data, including the so called “biological zero”. However, this also has its own set of problems. peer-reviewe...|$|R
