50|$|This type {{of attack}} is more {{difficult}} to defend against than a simple mass-mailing bomb because of the multiple source addresses and the possibility of each <b>zombie</b> <b>computer</b> sending a different message or employing stealth techniques to defeat spam filters.|$|E
5000|$|A botnet is {{a network}} of <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> {{that have been taken}} over by a robot or bot that {{performs}} large-scale malicious acts for the creator of the botnet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zombie</b> <b>computers</b> {{have been}} used {{extensively}} to send e-mail spam; as of 2005, an estimated 50 - 80% of all spam worldwide was sent by <b>zombie</b> <b>computers.</b> This allows spammers to avoid detection and presumably reduces their bandwidth costs, since the owners of zombies pay for their own bandwidth. This spam also greatly furthers the spread of Trojan horses, as Trojans are not self-replicating. They rely on the movement of e-mails or spam to grow, whereas worms can spread by other means. For similar reasons zombies are also used to commit click fraud against sites displaying pay-per-click advertising. Others can host phishing or money mule recruiting websites.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, IBM {{announced}} {{a service to}} bounce spam directly to the computers that send out spam. Because the IP addresses are identified in the headers of every message, {{it would be possible}} to target those computers directly, sidestepping the problem of forged email addresses. In most cases, however, those computers do not belong to the real spammer, but to unsuspecting users with unsecured or outdated systems, hijacked through malware and controlled at distance by the spammer; these are known as <b>zombie</b> <b>computers.</b> However, in most legal jurisdictions, ignorance is no defense, and many victims of spam regard the owners of <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> as willfully compliant accomplices of spammers.|$|R

50|$|Titan Rain was the U.S. government's {{designation}} {{given to}} a series of coordinated attacks on American computer systems since 2003. The attacks were labeled as Chinese in origin, although their precise nature (i.e., state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks) and their real identities (i.e., masked by proxy, <b>zombie</b> <b>computer,</b> spyware/virus infected) remain unknown.|$|E
50|$|This trend {{reduced the}} {{percentage}} of mail senders that were open relays from over 90% down to well under 1% over several years. This led to spammers adopting other techniques, {{such as the use}} of botnets of <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> to send spam.|$|R
50|$|The Bredolab botnet, {{also known}} by its alias Oficla, was a Russian botnet mostly {{involved}} in viral e-mail spam. Before the botnet was eventually dismantled in November 2010 through the seizure of its command and control servers, it was estimated to consist of millions of <b>zombie</b> <b>computers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 37 {{premises}} were searched, 39 servers were seized, 221 rented servers {{were removed}} from the network when their unwitting owners were notified, 500,000 <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> were freed from remote control, 17 families of malware were deprived of c/c, and the five people who ran the botnet were arrested.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} for a computer to run as an open proxy server without the computer's owner knowing it. This can result from misconfiguration of proxy software running on the computer, or from infection with malware (viruses, trojans or worms) designed for this purpose. If it is caused by malware, the infected computer {{is known as a}} <b>zombie</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Operation: Bot Roast is an {{operation}} by the FBI {{to track down}} bot herders, crackers, or virus coders who install malicious software on computers through the Internet without the ownersâ€™ knowledge, which turns the computer into a <b>zombie</b> <b>computer</b> that then sends out spam to other computers from the compromised computer, making a botnet or network of bot infected computers. The operation was launched because the vast scale of botnet resources {{poses a threat to}} national security.|$|E
50|$|Many large botnets {{tend to use}} domains {{rather than}} IRC in their {{construction}} (see Rustock botnet and Srizbi botnet). They are usually hosted with bulletproof hosting services. This {{is one of the}} earliest types of C&C. A <b>zombie</b> <b>computer</b> accesses a specially-designed webpage or domain(s) which serves the list of controlling commands. The advantages of using webpages or domains as C&C is that a large botnet can be effectively controlled and maintained with very simple code that can be readily updated.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, {{a prison}} term of {{nearly five years}} was handed down to Jeanson James Ancheta, who created {{hundreds}} of <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> to do his bidding via giant bot networks or botnets.

5000|$|The Metulji botnet, {{discovered}} in June 2011, is a botnet mainly involved in cyberscamming and {{denial of service}} attacks. Before the botnet itself was dismantled, it consisted of over 12 million individual <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> infected with the [...] "Butterfly Bot", making it, as of June 2011, the largest known botnet.|$|R
50|$|Internet {{initiatives}} to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose because spammers have created distributed botnets of <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> that contain malware with mail relaying capability.

5000|$|Titan Rain was the {{designation}} {{given by the}} federal government of the United States to a series of coordinated attacks on American computer systems since 2003; they were known to have been ongoing for at least three years. The attacks were labeled as Chinese in origin, although their precise nature, e.g., state-sponsored espionage, corporate espionage, or random hacker attacks, and their real identities - masked by proxy, <b>zombie</b> <b>computer,</b> spyware/virus infected - remain unknown. The activity known as [...] "Titan Rain" [...] is believed to be associated with an Advanced Persistent Threat.|$|E
50|$|Enforcing {{technical}} {{requirements of the}} Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) {{can be used to}} block mail coming from systems that are not compliant with the RFC standards. A lot of spammers use poorly written software or are unable to comply with the standards because they do not have legitimate control of the computer sending spam (<b>zombie</b> <b>computer).</b> So by setting restrictions on the mail transfer agent (MTA) a mail administrator can reduce spam significantly, such as by enforcing the correct fall back of Mail eXchange (MX) records in the Domain Name System, or the correct handling of delays (Teergrube).|$|E
50|$|Analysis of an email's {{conformation}} to RFC {{standards for}} the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) {{can be used to}} judge the likelihood of the message being spam. A lot of spammers use poorly written software or are unable to comply with the standards because they do not have legitimate control of the computer they are using to send spam (<b>zombie</b> <b>computer).</b> By setting tighter limits on the deviation from RFC standards that the MTA will accept, a mail administrator can reduce spam significantly, but all these techniques also run the risk of rejecting mail from older or poorly written or configured servers.|$|E
50|$|Machines that {{suddenly}} start sending lots of e-mail {{may well have}} become <b>zombie</b> <b>computers.</b> By limiting the rate that e-mail can be sent around what is typical for the computer in question, legitimate e-mail can still be sent, but large spam runs can be slowed down until manual investigation can be done.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, the Federal Trade Commission in {{conjunction}} with 35 government agencies organized an initiative to encourage Internet service providers to actively monitor, identify and quarantine customers whose computers {{appeared to have been}} compromised, transformed into zombies, or appear to be under the remote control of hackers. One of the largest botnet implementations around that time (2005) was found by Dutch Police where a botnet of over 1.5 million computers was under a crime ring's control. [...] These <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> were often employed as a response to anti-spam laws and spam filtering. Spammers started hiring virus writers and hackers to help them architect armies of <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> to send spam email from unsuspecting users' computers around the world. [...] In February 2012, the Federal Communications Commission unveiled yet another plan that calls on Internet service providers to take specific steps to combat online threats from botnets.|$|R
50|$|On June 28, 2006, IronPort {{released}} a study which found 80% of spam emails originating from <b>zombie</b> <b>computers.</b> The report also found 55 billion daily spam emails in June 2006, a large increase from 35 billion daily spam emails in June 2005. The study used SenderData which represents 25% of global email traffic and data from over 100,000 ISP's, universities, and corporations.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, a <b>zombie</b> <b>computer</b> is {{a computer}} connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse {{and can be used}} to perform malicious tasks {{of one sort or another}} under remote direction. Botnets of zombie computers are often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service attacks. Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to zombies. A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a zombie horde attack. Many computer users are unaware that their computer is infected with bots.|$|E
50|$|DULs serve several purposes. Their primary {{function}} is to assist an ISP in enforcement of its Acceptable Use Policy, most of which prohibit customers from setting up an email server. Customers are expected to use the email facilities of the service provider. This use of a DUL is especially helpful in curtailing abuse when a customer's computer has {{been converted into a}} <b>zombie</b> <b>computer</b> and is distributing email without the knowledge of the computer's owner. A second major use involves receivers who do not wish to accept email from computers with dynamically assigned email addresses. They use DULs to enforce this policy. Receivers adopt such policies because computers at dynamically assigned IP addresses so often are a source of spam.|$|E
50|$|An {{internet}} bot is {{a program}} that infects a computer and enables remote control of that computer. A security vulnerability in the computer system is exploited by the hacker in order to install and run the malware; {{in this case a}} worm. The program installs itself and is set up to run as a background process or daemon which remains undetectable to the computer user. The infected computer {{is often referred to as}} a <b>zombie</b> <b>computer</b> and was what Ancheta depended on as the building block of his botnet army. Ancheta engaged these computers to function in unison in a network formation; this is referred to as a botnet and the controller is called the bot herder. Ancheta's primary purpose of engaging large numbers of computers was to amplify the attack and reduce the time taken to execute it. Their greatest value is they provide a relatively high level of anonymity.|$|E
5000|$|The Mariposa botnet, {{discovered}} December 2008, is a botnet mainly {{involved in}} cyberscamming and denial-of-service attacks.

5000|$|A forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) {{verification}} {{can create}} a form of authentication showing a valid relationship between {{the owner of a}} domain name and the owner of the server that has been given an IP address. While not very thorough, this validation is strong enough to often be used for whitelisting purposes, since spammers and phishers usually cannot achieve forward validation when they use <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> to forge domain records.|$|R
50|$|Although many Operating Systems are now {{immune from}} {{being used in}} this attack, Some popular systems are still vulnerable; making the idle scan still very effective. Once a {{successful}} scan is completed there is {{no trace of the}} attacker's IP address on the target's firewall or Intrusion-detection system log. Another useful possibility is the chance of by-passing a firewall because you are scanning the target from the <b>zombie's</b> <b>computer,</b> which might have extra rights than the attacker's.|$|R
5000|$|A Forward Confirmed reverse DNS {{verification}} {{can create}} a form of authentication {{that there is a}} valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While reliant on the DNS infrastructure, which has known vulnerabilities, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually bypass this verification when they use <b>zombie</b> <b>computers</b> to forge the domains.|$|R
