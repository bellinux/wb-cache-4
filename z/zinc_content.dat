5|$|The {{helmet and}} visor were cast from an alloy {{consisting}} {{of an average}} of 82% copper, 10% zinc and 8% tin. This alloy was probably derived from melted-down scrap brass with a low <b>zinc</b> <b>content,</b> with which some tin had been added {{to improve the quality}} of the casting. Some of the fragments show traces of a white metal coating, indicating that the visor would originally have been tinned to give the appearance of silver. The griffin was cast separately from a different alloy consisting of 68% copper, 4% zinc, 18% tin and 10% lead. The visor would originally have been a silver hue and the helmet would have had a coppery yellow appearance. The helmet's creation can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd century from the use of a particular type of decorated rivet as well as some of its design features, such as its pierced eyes.|$|E
