The random sampling technique is used to determine the sample. Students from VIII 3 was selected as the experiment class and from VII 6 was selected as the control class. The results of data analysis show that RMAhas a significant influence on students' mathematical communication ability. The t-Test results are in the Ho attenuation region, where t-count = 2. 27 and t-table = 1. 6603 at 0. 05 level of significant. Depth analysis is conducted {{to determine the effect}}iveness of RMA on mathematical communication ability by using proportion test (z-test) in each observed indicator, the result shows that similar conclusion with result of t-test analysis. The value of <b>z-count</b> is greater that z-table for each indicator. It indicates that RME has a significant influence on students’ mathematical communication ability at 95 % level of confidence. Based on the results of hypothesis testing using t-test and z-test above, it can be concluded that, PMR has a significant influence on students' mathematical communication ability...|$|E

As implementation in giving saving protection to children, by traffic calming concept is thereby Schoolyard Secure Zone program (ZoSS),that is; location on the road side which time based velocity road to manage vehicle speed around elementary school especially on school rush hour, to protect pedestrian walker mainly toward elementary school student and the danger of traffic accident. ZoSS implementation is effort to optimize road function as city facilitation by managerial on road operation as effort in administering movint system on road link to increase movement efficiency and safety of traffic user, which dependently toward road’s function classification. This observation is aimed to study the implementation of ZoSS at 3 (three) different locations in Bogor City, that are; SDN 1 Cibuluh, SDN I Batutulis and SD Mardiwaluyo, toward pedestrian walker, the walker perception and traffic performance. The observation method which used is quantitative descriptive, and the sample collection technique is Simple Random Sampling by Z-test statistics analysis for pedestrian user, and Accidental Sampling by descriptive analysis for traffic user, then traffic performance analysis toward service quality (V/C ratio), Level Of Service (LOS) and the velocity (V). The analysis yielded that ZoSS as conditional learning stated can change traffic user behavior, which the user is prone to do in save manner (value <b>Z-count</b> > Z-table) with error is 5...|$|E
40|$|Providing {{play therapy}} {{is an effort}} to reduce stress levels {{hospitalization}} of children in hospital. But many hospitals are less concerned about it. According Supartini (2004) by making a game children will escape from the tension and stress they experienced due to play a game, children can divert the pain experienced during in hospital. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the effect of play therapy to stress hospitalization in children. This is a pre-experimental research using pre-post test design in a group. The population in this study were patients at the Children Hospital Room Kanjuruhan Kepanjen. The sample size in this study were 10 children, adjusted for sample criteria, sampling technique used was purposive sampling. Analysis of the effect by using the Wilcoxon Test Match pairs. The results obtained prior to therapy to play the majority of respondents (60 %) had moderate levels of stress hospitalization, whereas the results after therapy play therapy the majority of respondents (80 %) experienced mild levels of stress hospitalization. Based on the results of analysis of data and matched with significance level α = 0. 05 was obtained the <b>Z-count</b> = - 2. 000 (a), which means that H 1 is accepted or there is significant influence between play therapy to stress hospitalization. Based on these results we can conclude that there is a decrease in hospitalization stress on preschool children after play therapy. Therefore, the land is expected to develop research facilities and playing space facilities as well as providing play therapy to improve the welfare of pediatric patients who were treated in hospital...|$|E

Besides the hitherto known smallest pair of n = 6, four and twenty seven pairs of n = 7 and 8, respectively, were first reported. Inspection of these results revealed several new features of IS tree graphs, i. e., appearance of two pairs of endospectral vertices in a tree graph and existence of several families of IS pair graphs whose Z-indices systematically grow up to infinity. Further several IS pairs {{were found to be}} closely related with each other topologically and called “intrinsic” IS pairs. Important role of the Z-index for analyzing the IS graphs is demonstrated.

Thesis, English Education Department, Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teachers Training. Advisors: (1) Dr. Ridha Fadhillah, M. Ed, (II) Raida Asfihana, M. Pd Keywords: Reading Comprehension, Test, Cloze Test, C-Test 	This {{research}} {{is intended to}} investigate two kinds of testing techniques for measuring students’ reading comprehension achievement particularly focuses of using cloze test and C-test. This study investigates: (1) {{the result of the}} students’ reading comprehension tested by using cloze test, (2) the result of the students’ reading comprehension tested using C-test and (3) the comparison between cloze test and C-test for testing students’ reading comprehension at sixth semester STKIP PGRI Banjarmasin. This {{research is}} a comparative research which the data is analyzed quantitatively. The population of the research is 59 students on the sixth semester of English Department STKIP PGRI Banjarmasin. Then, 59 students become the samples because the population is less than 100 people. To investigate, two kinds of instruments are used, which are cloze test and C-test. To collect the data, the researcher uses two techniques such as observation and test. Data analysis is inferential analysis to compare two kinds of instruments, which are cloze test and C-test by using non parametric research. Then, all the data are analyzed descriptively and quantitatively by using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Z test in order to find out the comparison between cloze test and C-test for testing students’ reading comprehension.. The result of this study shows that (1) The result of cloze test for testing students’ reading comprehension is in fair category with mean score 63. 02, (2) The result of C-test for testing reading comprehension averagely are in fair category with mean score 64. 34. (3) There is no any significant difference between the result of cloze test and C-test for testing reading comprehension which the value of “z” is 0. 057 0. 05.

Pd. Key Words: Effectiveness, Diary practice, Recount text Many students of {{senior high school}} felt difficult when the teacher asked them to write a text. It happened because many teachers still use same method in teaching each text. Diary practice {{can be used as}} a teaching strategy to help teachers in teaching text, especially in teaching writing Recount text, because diary and Recount text are almost the same. The main objective of this study is to find out the extent to which the teaching of writing recount text is effective with the use of diary practice. The problems of this study are: (1) How is students’ ability in writing recount text before being taught by using diary practice?, (2) How is students’ ability in writing recount text after being taught by using diary practice?, (3) Is there any significant difference scores between the students’ ability in writing recount text before and after being taught by using diary practice? The purpose of this study is intended to find out: (1) The students’ ability in writing recount text before being taught by using diary practice. (2) The students’ ability in writing recount text after being taught by using diary practice. (3) The significant difference scores between the students’ ability in writing recount text before and after being taught by using diary practice. In the present study, the researcher used population research, because the population of the first grade was only 78 students. The researcher divided them into two classes, experimental group (class A) and control group (class B). The method of collecting data that used is writing test. The analysis technique of quantitative data used is Z-test formula. Research findings: (1) The result of computation using Z-test formula shown that <b>z-count</b> is 5. 76. (2) The value of distribution with degree of freedom (N 1 + N 2 – 2) = 39 + 39 – 2 = 76 and in the level of significance 0, 05 (5...|$|E
