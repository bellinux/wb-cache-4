40|$|Burkina Faso is {{the fifth}} tourist {{destination}} in western Africa. A country enclosed and endowed with few economic resources has decided to make tourism, one of the poles of its development. The province of Léraba {{is one of the}} tourist <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> of the country, which consists of important archaeological and historic remains, but those making policies aimed at the promotion of tourism do not take this value into account. The goal, of this study, is to bring to recognition these values and the importance of its integration in the policy for the promotion of tourism. By doing this, the study shows, the role which archaeology can play {{in the development of the}} country. It draws up the state of management of cultural heritage and tourism in Léraba and it makes, propositions, which would help to promote tourism in the province of Lérab...|$|E
40|$|The Handbook of Soil Terminology, Correlation and Classification {{provides}} an excellent insight to our current understanding of the soil classification problems and diverse theoretical and practical solutions for designing soil taxonomies. It underlines {{in many ways the}} uniqueness of each national classification system in terms of structure, taxonomic details and nomenclature and makes reasons for the difficulties of correlation clear. The highlights on the peculiarities of soil classification navigate the reader to the ocean of perceptions of soil resources, which originate from local ecological, social and historical conditions. Arid soils are not exceptions: while linkages between soil forming factors, processes and resulting properties might be similar in arid <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the world, <b>preferences</b> to the consideration of properties for classification can vary to a great extent from one classification system to another.

The geometrical flow configuration consists of a central axisymmetric jet surrounded by 16 circular jets, simulating the injection of oxygen in practical oxyfuel burners. A numerical procedure is outlined for the calculation of free flows comprising elliptic flow regions. The computational domain is divided {{into a number of}} subdomains, and elliptic calculations are performed sequentially in each of the domains, keeping constant the number of grid notes and allowing radial grid expansion for each domain. By using a higher-order accurate quadratic upstream scheme for convection discretization it was possible to minimize the effect of numerical diffusion. This was confirmed by an error estimation analysis. The {{predictions of}} the mean flow characteristics exhibit satisfactory agreement with the experiments. However, the k — ϵ eddy viscosity model proved to be inadequate for calculating the individual normal stresses around the recirculating region and at the outer jet boundaries where the values were underpredicted. Structure parameters suggest that far from the recirculating region the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> directional <b>preference</b> decrease with increasing distance from the multijet exit and that the k — ϵ model eddy viscosity model performs satisfactorily...|$|R

40|$|As systems {{dealing with}} {{preferences}} become more sophisticated, it becomes essential {{to deal with}} various kinds <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> statements and their interaction. We introduce a non-monotonic logic distinguishing sixteen kinds <b>of</b> <b>preferences,</b> ranging from strict to loose and from careful to opportunistic, and two kinds of {{ways to deal with}} uncertainty, either optimistically or pessimistically. The classification of the various kinds <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> is inspired by a hypothetical agent comparing the two alternatives <b>of</b> a <b>preference</b> statement. The optimistic and pessimistic way of dealing with uncertainty correspond on the one hand to considering either the best or the worst states in the comparison of the two alternatives <b>of</b> a <b>preference</b> statement, {{and on the other hand}} to the calculation of least or most specific “distinguished” preference orders from a set <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> statements.

In general, optimistic kinds <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> are compatible with optimism in calculating distinguished preference orders, and pessimistic kinds <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> are compatible with pessimism in calculating distinguished preference orders. However, these two sets of eight kinds <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> are not exclusive, such that some kinds <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> can be used in both ways to calculate distinguished preference orders, and other kinds <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> cannot be used in either of them.

40|$|Abstract: In {{marketing}} {{or medical}} research, especially in psychiatrics, {{it is very}} often necessary to define <b>preference</b> <b>of</b> examinees against defined object (persons, products, or phenomena). A question that {{is related to the}} object <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> is defined as like degree <b>of</b> like (positive <b>preference)</b> or as like degree <b>of</b> dislike (negative <b>preference),</b> where estimation is done as in scholar system (nominal or ordinal characteristics), with marks 1 through 5. Rank of objects achieved is very often expressed as average, which is not a good measure for realistic object ranking. In this paper, a coefficient <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> is presented as an effort to rank object more efficiently than average or other methods for ranking, especially in the meaning <b>of</b> <b>preference.</b> Preference is essential for humankind for decision making.

40|$|Little {{attention}} is paid to the inhabitants’ views of places where brownfields are localized. If the residents attract some attention in this matter, it is most often at global level, and no influence of responders’ characteristics or of place of questioning on the perception of problems of brownfields is examined in more detail. However, there is a consensus among researchers that these variables have an immediate effect on perception. That is why we set the objective {{to assess the impact of}} inhabitants’ characteristics and of the place of residence on the structure <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> for various types of brownfields regeneration. Respondents were questioned in three zones (city center, vicinity of the city and the peripheral surroundings of the city) of two cities (497 respondents in Karviná and 833 respondents in České Budějovice, both Czech Republic). Socio-economic characteristics of the respondents were pursued and respondents commented on the extent of agreement with the use of existing brownfields in three defined <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> cities. The impact of origin of the resident (geographic characteristics) and of the character of the respondent (soci-economic characteristics) on a structure in preferences was studied sequentially by means of three methods of multidimensional data analysis (PCA, RDA, and Variation Partitioning). All methods led us to reveal a structure of four factors <b>of</b> <b>preferences</b> for regeneration: green/sport, housing/shopping, industry, and entertainment. Following the RDA the statistically significant variables to influence the structure of answers are both geographical variables – city, <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> a city – and three socio-economic variables – gender, age, and education. Preference for commercial-residential use of brownfields has a distinctive centre-periphery distribution within the city. The <b>preferences</b> <b>of</b> the revitalization through the reactivation of the industry are given primarily by the particular city, and the impact of both types of variables (characteristics of the respondent and the place of questioning) is significant, however the shared explainable variation is negligible (geographic variables explain 51. 6 % and characteristics of respondents 46. 6 %) ...|$|R
