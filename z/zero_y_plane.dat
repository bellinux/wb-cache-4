50|$|The Buenos Aires {{opposition}} reacted quickly, Alsina, Bartolomé Mitre, Vélez Sársfield and Ireneo Portela confronted López <b>y</b> <b>Planes,</b> {{who they}} considered had ideals {{too close to}} those of Urquiza, and denounced López y Planes' vote had no validity affirming he had no attributions to sign it in name of the Buenos Aires government, and that the treaty jeopardised {{the rights of the}} province while giving despotic attributions to Urquiza. The following debates, known as the Jornadas de Junio, concluded with the resignation of López <b>y</b> <b>Planes</b> on June 23 of 1852. The legislature elected Manuel Pinto to replace him, but Urquiza made use of the attributions given to him by the treaty to call a federal intervention that dissolved the provincial legislature and reestablished López <b>y</b> <b>Planes</b> at its head.When López <b>y</b> <b>Planes</b> resigned for a second time, Urquiza assumed the government of the province himself, naming a state conceal of 15 members as deliberating organ.|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on a Cu– 0. 1 % Zr alloy to evaluate the potential for achieving homogeneity when processing by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP). Billets of the alloy were processed by ECAP for up to 8 passes at room temperature using a die with a channel angle of 110 °. This processing reduced the grain size from an initial value of ? 30 ?m to a value of ? 500 nm after 8 passes. Values of the Vickers microhardness were recorded on both the cross-sectional or X planes and the longitudinal or <b>Y</b> <b>planes</b> after ECAP. The results reveal the presence of lower hardness values adjacent to the lower surfaces of the billets {{in the early stages}} of processing but there is an evolution towards a hardness homogeneity throughout the billets after pressing through 8 passes. The measurements show this evolution occurs at similar rates on the X and <b>Y</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R
