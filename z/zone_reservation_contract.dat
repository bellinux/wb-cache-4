40|$|Capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contracts</b> {{and spot}} markets are two {{alternative}} purchasing practices. We {{focus on the}} cost-effective management of the combined use of these two procurement sources. Due to the variability of the spot market prices and demand uncertainty, the flexibility of combined sourcing can be advantageous. Spot market purchasing is a benefit in case of low spot market prices or insufficient reserved capacity, and the capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contract</b> is an operational risk hedging for high spot market price incidents. The structure of the optimal combined purchasing policy is complex.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{important}} {{problem of how}} to assure credible forecast information sharing between a supplier and a manufacturer. The supplier is responsible for acquiring the necessary capacity before receiving an order from the manufacturer who possesses private forecast information for her end product. We address how different contracts affect the supplier's capacity decision and, hence, the profitability of the supplier and the manufacturer. We fully develop two contracts (and provide explicit formulae) to enable credible forecast information sharing. The first is a nonlinear capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contract</b> under which the manufacturer agrees to pay a fee to reserve capacity. The second is an advance purchase contract under which the manufacturer is induced to place a firm order before the supplier secures the component capacity used to build the end product. These contracts serve a strategic role in information sharing. The capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contract</b> enables the supplier to detect the manufacturer's private forecast information, while the advance purchase contract enables the manufacturer to signal her forecast information. We show that channel coordination is possible even under asymmetric forecast information by combining the advance purchase contract with an appropriate payback agreement. Through our structural and numerical results we also show that the degree of forecast information asymmetry and the risk-adjusted profit margin are two important drivers that determine supply chain efficiency and which contract to adopt. game theory, screening, signaling, coordination, supply <b>contracts,</b> capacity <b>reservation,</b> advance purchase, payback, asymmetric information, forecast...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{high-tech}} {{manufacturing industry}} {{is characterized by}} rapid innovation and volatile demands. Capacity reservation provides a risk sharing mechanism that encourages the manufac-turer to expand capacity more readily, while improving the revenue potential for the OEM cus-tomers. We propose a deductible <b>reservation</b> (DR) <b>contract</b> where the customer reserves future capacity with a fee that is deductible from the purchasing price. We show that the DR contract provides channel coordination and is individually rational for all players involved. This has prac-tical importance since reservation has intuitive benet for the manufacturer, but less so for the customers. We start the analysis with a one-manufacturer, one-customer system with stochastic demand, then generalize the analysis {{to the case of}} n customers. A unique feature of the DR con-tract is that the manufacturer announces ex ante the “excess ” capacity she will expand in addition to (and regardless of) the customer reservation amount. We show that the reservation fee should be increasing in the excess capacity amount, and coordination could be achieved with different com-binations of the two. To establish practical insights we compare the DR contract with a contract known in the industry as take-or-pay. We show that while the manufacturer is no worse off under take-or-pay, there may not exist a contract setting that guarantees to benet the customers. We discuss the similarities and differences between the capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contracts</b> and other well known supply chain contracts...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. By {{committing}} to long-term supply contracts, buyers seek {{to lower their}} purchasing costs, and have products delivered without interruption. When a long-term contract is available, suppliers are less pressured to find new customers, and can afford to charge a price lower than the prevailing spot market price. We examine sourcing decisions of a firm {{in the presence of}} a capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contract</b> that this firm makes with its long-term supplier in addition to the spot market alternative. This contract entails delivery of any desired portion of a reserved fixed capacity in exchange for a guaranteed payment by the buyer. We investigate rational actions of the two parties under two different types of periodic review inventory control policies used by the buyer: the two-number policy, and the base stock policy. When typical demand probability distributions are considered, inclusion of the spot market source in the buyer’s procurement plan significantly reduces the capacity commitments from the long-term supplier...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} quantitative {{models to}} aid managerial {{decision making in}} various aspects of manufacturing operations. The first essay deals with the economic design of multivariate statistical quality control charts, which help users respond quickly to sudden changes in the manufacturing process characteristics. The use {{of a system of}} univariate charts is a simple and effective way to monitor the means of multiple correlated quality characteristics. A cost minimization model to design a system of X-bar charts is formulated and solved. This section also includes new computer algorithms to compute the percentage points of a multivariate normal distribution in several cases. ^ The second essay incorporates the effect of supply quality into the quality improvement strategy of the manufacturer. The main subject of interest is the evolution of the product quality level over time. It is assumed that the imperfection levels of the manufacturer and supplier processes continuously decrease according to the associated learning curve characteristics, and in addition, by investing in process improvement, the improvements in quality can be accelerated. The model facilitates the analysis of manufacturer-supplier relations from a quality cost standpoint. It is found that a myopic approach to maximize the quality cost reductions in the short run is not always consistent with the best investment plan under a long-term perspective. The basic model {{can also be used to}} explore other issues arising in supply chain management, such as supplier selection, and long-run versus short-run relationships. ^ The third essay studies the inventory decisions in a supplier-manufacturer-consumer chain in the presence of uncertain demand for the product in the consumer market. A multi-period capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contract</b> between a manufacturer and a long term supplier is designed to establish a stronger supply chain partnership. By providing the manufacturer with the option of sourcing from the spot market, the effect of market forces is incorporated into the capacity <b>reservation</b> <b>contract</b> negotiations.

Furthermore, a simple heuristic procedure is developed to determine the respective policy parameters.

(2) Both the number of species present and the population of migratory birds show an increasing trend, and avian biodiversity has greatly increased.

In such systems, control and design is often an important issue that may significantly affect the performance. This dissertation focuses {{on the development of}} innovative techniques for the design and control of such systems. Special attention is given to real-world applications in (a) the design and control of patient flow in the hospital emergency departments, (b) design and control of service/call centers, and (c) the design and control of supply chains under disruption risks. With respect to application (a), using hospital data, analytical models, and simulation analyses we show how (1) better patient prioritization, (2) enhanced triage systems, and (3) improved patient flow designs allow emergency departments to significantly improve their performance with respect to both operational efficiency and patient safety. Regarding application (b), we give specific attention to a two-server and three-demand class network {{in the shape of a}} ``W'' with random server disruption and repair times. Studying this network, we show how effective control and design strategies that efficiently make use of (partial) flexibility of servers can be implemented to achieve high performance and resilience to server disruptions.
