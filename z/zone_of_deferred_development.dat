However, this strategy involves {{a high degree of}} complexity and uncertainty. On this basis, this study develops a model to assess the value <b>of</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>development</b> projects. At any stage in the project, the model can inform a strategic choice to proceed with development, abandon the project, or <b>defer</b> <b>development.</b> At the same time, the model {{can be used to make}} a realistic assessment of the project value and the degree of risk involved. Based on the particular characteristics <b>of</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>development</b> in real estate investment projects, the model draws on theory on the waiting option and the abandonment option. Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is used to model the interdependent volatility in value associated with proceeding with development and abandoning the project, and Itō’s lemma is applied to deduce stochastic volatility. The model can hence calculate the expected utility and rate <b>of</b> success <b>of</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>development.</b> Finally, case study analysis demonstrates that this model is an effective tool for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>deferred</b> <b>development</b> projects. It therefore provides a useful reference for real estate developers when making strategic decisions...|$|R

In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net deferred tax assets and 48 reported net deferred tax liabilities. Firms differ substantially in the composition <b>of</b> their <b>deferred</b> tax assets and liabilities.

A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net deferred tax assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value <b>of</b> <b>deferred</b> tax assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement.
