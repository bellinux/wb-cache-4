5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves. Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name <b>Zamak.</b> Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E
5|$|Alloys of zinc {{with small}} amounts of copper, aluminium, and {{magnesium}} are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name <b>Zamak.</b> An {{example of this is}} zinc aluminium. The low melting point together with the low viscosity of the alloy makes possible the production of small and intricate shapes. The low working temperature leads to rapid cooling of the cast products and fast production for assembly. Another alloy, marketed under the brand name Prestal, contains 78% zinc and 22% aluminium, and is reported to be nearly as strong as steel but as malleable as plastic. This superplasticity of the alloy allows it to be molded using die casts made of ceramics and cement.|$|E

It deployed the 20th Mechanized Brigade and 8th Mechanized Brigade at King Khalid Military City near Hafr al Batin. The 10th Mechanized Brigade is deployed at Sharawrah, {{which is}} near the border with Yemen and about 150 kilometers from <b>Zamak.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War, the British {{produced}} the No. 4 Mk 2 (Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals for official designations in 1944) rifle, a refined and improved No. 4 rifle with the trigger hung forward from the butt collar and not from the trigger guard, beech wood stocks (with the original reinforcing strap and centre piece of wood {{in the rear of}} the forestock on the No.4 Mk I/Mk I* being removed in favour of a tie screw and nut) and brass buttplates (during World War II, the British replaced the brass buttplates on the No.4 rifles with zinc alloy (<b>Zamak)</b> ones to reduce costs and to speed up rifle production). With the introduction of the No. 4 Mk 2 rifle, the British refurbished many of their existing stocks of No. 4 rifles and brought them up to the same standard as the No. 4 Mk 2. No. 4 Mk 1 rifles so upgraded were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/2, whilst No. 4 Mk I* rifles that were brought up to Mk 2 standard were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/3.|$|E
2500|$|Russian. Acute accents (technically, stress marks) {{are used}} in {{dictionaries}} to indicate the stressed syllable. They may also be optionally used to disambiguate both between minimal pairs, such as [...] за́мок (read as <b>zámak,</b> means [...] "castle") and замо́к (read as zamók, means [...] "lock"), and between question words and relative pronouns such as что ("what", stressed, or [...] "that", unstressed), similarly to Spanish. This is rare, however, as usually meaning is determined by context and no stress mark is written. The same rules apply to Ukrainian, Rusyn, Belarusian and Bulgarian.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>zamak</b> alloy is <b>zamak</b> 3. Besides that, <b>zamak</b> 2, <b>zamak</b> 5 and <b>zamak</b> 7 are also commercially used. These alloys are most {{commonly}} die cast. <b>Zamak</b> alloys (particularly #3 and #5) are frequently {{used in the}} spin casting industry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zamak</b> 3 is the {{de facto}} {{standard}} for the <b>zamak</b> series of zinc alloys; all other zinc alloys are compared to this. <b>Zamak</b> 3 has the base composition for the <b>zamak</b> alloys (96% zinc, 4% aluminium). It has excellent castability and long term dimensional stability. More than 70% of all North American zinc die castings are made from <b>zamak</b> 3.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zamak</b> 4 was {{developed}} for the Asian markets to reduce the effects of die soldering while maintaining the ductility of <b>zamak</b> 3. This was achieved by using half the amount of copper from the <b>zamak</b> 5 composition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zamak</b> 2 has {{the same}} {{composition}} as <b>zamak</b> 3 {{with the addition of}} 3% copper in order to increase strength by 20%, which also increases the price. <b>Zamak</b> 2 has the greatest strength out of all the <b>zamak</b> alloys. Over time it retains its strength and hardness better than the other alloys; however, it becomes more brittle, shrinks, and less elastic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zamak</b> 5 has {{the same}} {{composition}} as <b>zamak</b> 3 {{with the addition of}} 1% copper in order to increase strength (by approximately 10%), hardness and corrosive resistance, but reduces ductility. It also has less dimensional accuracy. <b>Zamak</b> 5 is more commonly used in Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zamak</b> (formerly trademarked as <b>ZAMAK</b> {{and also}} known as Zamac) is a family of alloys with a base metal of zinc and {{alloying}} elements of aluminium, magnesium, and copper.|$|E
50|$|The name <b>zamak</b> is {{an acronym}} of the German {{names for the}} metals of which the alloys are composed: Zink (zinc), Aluminium, Magnesium and Kupfer (copper). The New Jersey Zinc Company {{developed}} <b>zamak</b> alloys in 1929. Zinc alloys are popularly referred to as pot metal or white metal. While <b>zamak</b> is held to higher industrial standards, it is still considered a pot metal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zamak</b> 7 {{has less}} {{magnesium}} than <b>zamak</b> 3 to increase fluidity and ductility, which is especially useful when casting thin wall components. In {{order to reduce}} inter-granular corrosion {{a small amount of}} nickel is added and impurities are more strictly controlled.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zamak</b> alloys {{are part}} of the zinc {{aluminium}} alloy family; they are distinguished from the other ZA alloys because of their constant 5% aluminium composition.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Morris Ashby in Britain had {{licensed}} the New Jersey <b>zamak</b> alloy. The high-purity refluxer zinc {{was not available}} in Britain and so they acquired the right to manufacture the alloy using a locally available electrolytically refined zinc of 99.95% purity. This was given the name Mazak, partly to distinguish it from <b>zamak</b> and partly from the initials of Morris Ashby. In 1933, National Smelting licensed the refluxer patent {{with the intent of}} using it to produce 99.99% zinc in their plant at Avonmouth.|$|E

5000|$|The Jennings J-22 was {{produced}} by the Jennings corporation in California in the 1980s and 1990s. It was an inexpensive [...]22 LR caliber (J-22) and [...]25 ACP caliber (J-25) aluminum alloy slide and frame. The latter models by Bryco were made of <b>Zamak.</b>|$|E
50|$|A large {{problem with}} early {{zinc die casting}} {{materials}} was zinc pest, owing to impurities in the alloys. <b>Zamak</b> avoided this {{by the use of}} 99.99% pure zinc metal, produced by New Jersey Zinc's use of a refluxer as part of the smelting process.|$|E
5000|$|The Vršac Castle (Вршачки замак, Vršački <b>zamak)</b> {{formerly}} known as [...] "Vršac Tower" [...] (Вршачка кула, Vršačka kula) is a medieval fortress near Vršac, Vojvodina, Serbia. Only Donjon tower remained from the entire complex, but in 2009 reconstruction started, to recreate the entire Vršac Castle.|$|E
50|$|Britains Deetail toy {{soldiers}} were a popular product for retail stores in England in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufactured in England by W. Britain, they were plastic figures on <b>Zamak</b> metal bases; {{an idea to}} keep the soldiers from falling down. In the early 1990s production moved to China.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zamak</b> 2 is {{also known}} as Kirksite when gravity cast for use as a die. It was {{originally}} designed for low volume sheet metal dies. It later gained popularity for making short run injection molding dies. It is also less commonly used for non-sparking tools and mandrels for metal spinning.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, {{the casting}} {{materials}} used for competing processes like metal die casting and injection molding are similar, but {{not suitable for}} spin casting. For example, a typical zinc die-casting alloy such as <b>Zamak</b> 3 can be used but will solidify too rapidly from a molten state when cast with centrifugal force. This typically results in incomplete filling of the mold {{as well as a}} rough, porous finish, called orange peel. <b>Zamak</b> 2, of a slightly different composition, was originally developed as a gravity-cast alloy with greater finished strength but was found to work well with spin-casting. Its extra copper content encourages the eutectic behaviour and gives a lower freezing point. It has become known as 'Kirksite' and has given rise to a range of dedicated spin-casting alloys, some with additional components such as magnesium, to control the surface finish.|$|E
50|$|Originally the OO railway {{locomotives}} were {{powered by}} an unconventional 2 pole DC electric motor. Unfortunately {{many of their}} diecast items were manufactured with impure mazac, which {{was all that was}} available immediately after the War. MZAC is an alloy of Magnesium, Aluminium, Zinc and Copper similar to <b>Zamak),</b> which later crumbled due to Zinc pest.|$|E
