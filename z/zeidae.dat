40|$|Des échantillons d’eau et de matière en {{suspension}} ont été prélevés le long de l’oued Moulouya et dans des lacs de carrière {{au niveau}} de l’ancien centre minier de <b>Zeïda</b> (Haute Moulouya, Maroc) en vue d’en évaluer la salubrité. Il est en effet important d’établir le degré et les causes éventuelles de dégradation de la qualité de ces eaux, compte tenu de leur usage à des fins tant domestiques qu’agricoles. Des résidus de traitement ont également été échantillonnés dans les haldes abandonnées. L’analyse des distributions et des variations spatio-temporelles des concentrations de Pb et As a permis de mettre en évidence que le centre minier a véritablement un impact sur la qualité des eaux de surface environnantes, malgré le caractère neutre à alcalin du drainage. Aucune ne rejoint les critères de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé en matière de Pb et As dans l’eau potable (10  µg/L), mais près de la moitié souscrit aux normes marocaines (50  µg/L). L’importance de la dégradation varie selon la saison et la localité, et le contraste entre sites a priori non dégradés et sites dégradés n’est pas toujours très prononcé. On observe même des variations à l’inverse des tendances attendues. Les résultats peuvent cependant être réconciliés en tenant compte de l’importance du transport particulaire par rapport au transport dissous au moment et au lieu de l’échantillonnage. Il appert que les minéralisations et les résidus miniers restés sur place peuvent constituer la principale source de pollution des eaux de surface de la région de <b>Zeïda.</b> The Upper Moulouya Basin was the location of extensive lead mining between 1930 and 1985, with three major operations near Aouli, Mibladen and <b>Zeïda.</b> The Moulouya drains about 7. 5 % of the Moroccan territory and provides drinking and irrigation water to many communities over its more than 500  km path. It is thus important to determine the impact of past mining activities on its water quality, since the mining sites were abandoned {{with little or no}} rehabilitation. This paper focuses on the <b>Zeïda</b> area, the uppermost of these mining centres on the Moulouya. About 630, 172  t of lead concentrates (40 ‑ 70 % Pb) were produced between 1972 and 1985 at <b>Zeïda.</b> Lead was mined from carbonate and sulphide mineral deposits (cerussite, 70 %; galena, 30 %) mixed with barite in stratiform ore bodies hosted by Permo-Triassic arkoses. Mining left 12  Mt and 70  Mt of tailings and wastes in fully exposed piles {{on each side of the}} Moulouya, as well as a dozen water-filled open-stopes. Mine drainage is of neutral pH, thanks to the low content of residual sulphide minerals and the availability of carbonate in the tailings and host rock. The river and some quarry-lakes are tapped to fulfill domestic, agricultural and stock-breeding needs. One lake is used to directly feed <b>Zeïda’s</b> water network (pop. 3, 000), without any water treatment. The Moulouya, upstream and downstream of <b>Zeïda,</b> and four lakes were sampled twice in 2002 (dry period: February; wet period: April). Temperature, electric conductivity (EC), Eh and pH were measured in the field. Samples were filtered through 0. 45  µm membranes. The filtrates were preserved with 4 % HNO 3 and kept at 4 °C until analysis. The filters and their particulate fraction, as well as a composite sample of the tailings, were dried and kept dry until dissolution and analysis. All measurements were performed by ICP-MS and capillary electrophoresis analyses. Lead and arsenic are well above « normal » concentrations in the tailings, at 5, 547  g/t and 192  g/t, respectively. These elements are clear threats to population health, since dust from unstabilized tailings can be dispersed by wind and rain waters, contaminating agricultural soils and surface waters, and eventually leading to cases of saturnism or arsenical intoxication in the population. All Pb and As concentrations measured in the waters sampled are above the World Health Organisation criteria for drinking water (10  µg/L for Pb and As). Nevertheless, about half of these measurements meet the Moroccan criteria (50  µg/L). All samples show near neutral or slightly basic pH values (7. 2 - 8. 9). EC is also high (>  1, 000  µS/cm). As and Pb are largely associated with the particulate fraction (>  80 % of total As and Pb), except for As in two lakes (<  40 %). Overall, their concentrations are higher in the <b>Zeïda</b> area than upstream in the Moulouya. However, this is a tendency rather than a rule, because the differences are often small (<  50 %) and suffer exceptions. For instance, Pb concentrations are 60 % lower than the so-called uncontaminated reference station, in two quarry-lakes sampled during the wet period. The occasional lack of significant and consistent contrast between an obviously degraded environment and a pristine site was unexpected. The results were therefore further investigated, in order to identify possible explanations for the apparent discrepancies. Coherency in the data set emerges when one considers the relative importance of dissolved and particulate transport in the various types of environments sampled. Using this interpretation scheme, EC is considered as an indicator of solute transportation, since EC is a function of dissolved ionic components. Total Pb is regarded as an indicator of particulate transportation, since Pb is strongly adsorbed to particulate substrates at the pH observed. Following these assumptions, particulate transport appears to dominate over dissolved transportation in the Moulouya. Total Pb increases by factors of 3. 4 and 9. 8 from dry to wet periods, whereas EC decreases by 0. 7 - 0. 8, as a result of rain dilution. In two of the four lakes, dissolved transport is comparatively more important, since EC does not change significantly and total Pb shows only a small increase from the dry to the wet period. In these lakes, the dissolved input during the rainy period appears to be large enough to keep EC at its previous value, without significant dilution, as opposed to what is going on in the Moulouya. In the two other lakes, both EC and total Pb decrease from the dry to the wet period, pointing to dilution effects greater than either dissolved or particulate mobilization. Apparent discrepancies in the intensity and direction of variations are explained when prevailing modes of dispersion are taken into account. For instance, the enrichment factor of total Pb in the Moulouya, downstream of <b>Zeïda,</b> jumps from 1. 1 (dry) to 3. 2 (wet), with respect to the reference station. Meanwhile, EC increases only from 1. 2 (dry) to 1. 5 (wet). The greater increase of total Pb over EC is explained by prevalent particulate transport. In another case, the enrichment of EC with respect to the reference station, in two lakes, increases from 14. 2 and 20. 4 (dry) to 20. 1 and 27. 9 (wet) while total Pb enrichment decreases from 2. 0 and 2. 0 (dry) to 1. 6 and 1. 3 (wet). Here, the prevalence of dissolved transport in these two lakes, combined with particulate transport at the reference station, allow for a strong increase in the EC parameter, concurrent with a weak increase in total Pb. Finally, in the lakes where both dissolved and particulate transport are presumably minor, total Pb undergoes enrichment with respect to the reference station, in the dry period (by 3. 4 and 1. 8), whereas depletion characterizes the wet period (0. 6 in both lakes). In this case, enrichment is likely the result of evaporation during the dry season, and depletion the result of dilution by rain during the wet period. These two types of lake behave differently because they are located next to residual mineral deposits (likely with more soluble phases), have short travel distances and thus fewer contacts with adsorbing substrates, which is not the case for the other two lakes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} literary {{representations of}} the city of Brussels in Francophone diasporic writing. Drawing on and exploring the usefulness of memory and trauma studies, postcolonial theory, and spatial studies in a Belgian context, this thesis reads six novels, spanning a contemporary period from 1985 to 2011, by Francophone writers, who themselves or whose parents originate from countries with a history of Belgian and French colonialism: Leïla Houari’s <b>Zeida</b> de nulle part (1985), Pie Tshibanda’s Un fou noir au pays des Blancs (1999), Saber Assal’s A l’ombre des gouttes (2000), José Tshisungu wa Tshisungu’s La Flamande de la gare du Nord (2001), Mina Oualdlhadj’s Ti t’appelles Aїcha, pas Jouzifine (2008) and Patrick François’s La dernière larme du lac Kivu (2011). In doing so, this thesis investigates the multiple ways in which these writers imagine and construct the urban space of Brussels through intersecting transnational trajectories and histories of violence. By analysing how they ‘write’ Brussels, the very architecture and landscape of which are clearly marked by colonialism and labour migration, this thesis offers a critical exploration of how experiences and memories of displacement and exile shape the perception of the urban space in these texts. I argue in particular that these writers either recode certain urban spaces or create new ones in order to construct narratives of marginalisation and belonging. Finally, this thesis aims to join the emerging discussion of ethnic-minority writing in Belgium by providing an understanding of the ambiguous role of Brussels as a postcolonial metropolis and post-war destination for labour migration, while seemingly remaining a peripheral location for Francophone literary production in a cultural sphere that still gravitates towards Paris...|$|R
40|$|Chemical extractions {{coupled with}} {{quantitative}} X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) {{were used to}} define the chemical and mineralogical forms of Pb and Zn in abandoned wastes and soils from the Upper Moulouya mining district (Morocco). The aim was to provide baseline data required to assess metal mobility and bioavailability. Wastes and soils were sampled in the mine sites of <b>Zeïda,</b> Mibladen and Aouli. Additional potentially unaffected soil samples were taken outside the Mibladen site. Total Pb and Zn concentrations have {{a wide spread of}} values (Pb: 0. 041 – 17. 25 g kg− 1; Zn: 0. 051 – 276. 5 g kg− 1), with tailings from all mines and soils from Mibladen processing area exhibiting the highest concentrations. Very low or no detectable contamination characterizes the soils from exploitation areas and those collected outside Mibladen. Zinc contamination is mainly restricted to Mibladen processing area, where Zn ores from other Moroccan mines were possibly processed. The sequential extraction procedure for metal fractionation indicates that in contaminated samples Pb and Zn are mainly present in the acetic acid extractable fraction (Pb up to 80 %; Zn up to 52 %), while in less or not contaminated soils both metals are associated with the reducible fraction, presumably as iron oxides (Pb up to 68 %; Zn up to 80 %). Eight minerals containing Pb and Zn were identified: cerussite, anglesite, galena, hydrozincite, smithsonite, sphalerite, willemite and hemimorphite. Cerussite is the most important Pb-host. According to the alkaline conditions and to the low solubility of Pb and Zn mineral phases, it can be suggested that within the studied environment mobilization into solution in aqueous systems and bioavailability of Pb and Zn have a low potential. Nevertheless, given aridity and strong winds, inhalation of airborne particulates may be a concern...|$|R

As far as known, the eggs belonging to these systematic groups are spherical in form, the egg membrane smooth without any conspicuous structure, and the perivitelline space narrow. Lamprida. Only a s ingle species, Trachipterus sp. is known from southern waters of Japan. The egg is large, measuring 1. 9 - 2. 3 mm in diameter, lacking the oil globule, and its early developmental stages are quite {{similar to those of}} Fistularia petimba Lacepede. The yolk is not segmented. During the course of the egg development elongated dorsal and ventral fin rays appear. The number of elongated dorsal and ventral fins is 4 and 3 respectively, the longest dorsal fin ray is as long as two-thirds of the total length of the body and is provided with 5 swelled parts covered with melanophores. The appearance of the oral part of the larva closely resembles to that of the adult. The number of myotomes is 87. During the course of the egg and larval development only melanophores appear. <b>Zeida.</b> The matured egg of Zeus japonicus Cuvier et Valenciennes is already reported by Kamiya. The egg is large, measuring 1. 9 - 2. 0 mm in diameter, with a single yellow oil globule measuring 0. 35 mm in diameter. The yolk is not segmented. Mugilina. Mugil cephalus Linne, Sphyraena pinguis Giinther and their related species arc known from Mediterranean Sea, Indian waters as well as from Japanese waters. The egg diameter of M. cephalus is 0. 72 - 1. 08 mm, with a single oil globule measuring 0. 28 - 0. 40 mm in diameter. The yolk is not segmented. As the specific gravity of the egg slightly surpasses that of the sea water, the spawned eggs gradually sink. During the course of the egg development many melanophores and xanthophores appear on the embryonal body, yolk surface and oil globule. The oil globule of the newly hatched larva is situated at the posterior part of the yolk. The egg diameter of S. pinguis and its related species is 0. 69 - 0. 82 mm, with a single oil globule measuring 0. 18 - 0. 21 mm in diameter. The yolk is roughly segmented. The melanophores and xanthophores appear on the embryonal body, yolk and oil globule {{during the course of the}} egg development. The oil globule of the newly hatched larva is situated at the anterior part of the yolk. Scombrina.

The diameter o f these eggs ranges from 0. 9 to 1. 9 mm, most species having a single oil globule measuring 0. 2 - 0. 6 mm in diameter, but some have several or many oil globules. The yolk is not segmented in many species, but some have segmented yolk. In many species the melanophores and xnathophores appear on the embryonal body, yolk and oil globule, and sometimes on the marginal fin during the course of the egg and larval development. The oil globule of the newly hatched larva is situated at the posterior part of the yolk in many species, but in some species it is situated at the anterior part. As the vertebral number of the fish belonging to this group usually differ according to the family or genus, so, to identify the eggs of this group, the myotome number of the hatched larvae is important characteristic together with the mode of change of the pigmentation during the course of the larval development. Carangina Trachurus japonicus (Temminck et Schlegel) and clo s ely related 3 other species, Decapterus russellii (Ruppell), Seriola quinqueradiata (Temminck et Schlegel) and Leiognathus nuchalis (Temminck et Schlegel) are already known from Japanese as well as Indian waters. The egg of carangid fishes ranges 0. 7 - 1. 3 mm in diameter, with a single oil globule measuring 0. 17 - 0. 33 mm in diameter. The yolk is roughly segmented. During the course of the egg development many melanophores and xanthophores appear on the embryonal body, yolk and oil globule. The oil globule of the newly hatched larva is situated at the anterior part of the yolk and partly protruded from its surface. The number of myotomes of the hatched larva is 26 - 28, and the anus is situated near the middle of the body and its position does not change during the larval development. In the marginal fin only the xanthophores appear in most species, but in some species a few melanophores also appear. The egg diameter of L. nuchalis is 0. 60 - 0. 65 mm, with a single oil globule measuring 0. 12 - 0. 15 mm in diameter. The yolk is not segmented. Excepting the lack of pigment in the marginal fin, the pigmentation is similar to those of carangid fishes. The oil globule of the newly hatched larva is situated at the posterior part of the yolk. Stromateina. Labracogl o ssa argentiventris Peters and the matured egg of Psenopsis anomala (Temminck et Schlegel) are known from Japanese waters. The egg is 1. 00 - 1. 33 mm in diameter, with a single oil globule measuring 0. 21 - 0. 25 mm in diameter. The yolk of L. argentiventris is roughly segmented, but this is not the case in P. anomala.
