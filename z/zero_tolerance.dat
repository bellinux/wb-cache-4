5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based <b>zero</b> <b>tolerance</b> approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E
30|$|The {{concept as}} {{presented}} in Fig.  3 has inbuilt process for checkmating corruption.

So also, mainstreaming of gender balance would reduce the tendencies of corruption than gender insensitive arrangement. The rigorous background check of the monitoring team would minimize the appointment of corrupt monitoring staff.

5|$|The {{visit to}} the US was the high point in Diệm's {{relations}} with his primary sponsor. The Americans began to place increasing pressure on Diệm to carry out democratic reforms and liberalize the political system, particularly during ambassadorship of Elbridge Durbrow. Diệm resisted the calls to broaden {{the base of his}} government and continued to rig elections. Meanwhile in the US, his support among the AFV also declined, in part due to his ongoing authoritarianism, and also because of his persistent complaints to them about negative media depictions of his regime; many Vietnamese leaders of various persuasions did not understand that western governments did not control their own media. Pressure also increased on Diệm at home, as the communists intensified their insurgency against him. In November 1960, discontent in his own army prompted a failed coup attempt by paratroopers. Although Diệm eventually organized for loyalists to put down the coup, he was angered by Durbrow's calls for him to try to negotiate a settlement, regarding the lack of support for his <b>zero</b> <b>tolerance</b> policy as a betrayal.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. (Educational management) The {{extensive}} {{changes in}} South Africa {{since the first}} democratic elections in 1994 have impacted immensely on educational governance. The South African Schools Act (RSA, 1996 a) has brought about a major reform in education administration by decentralizing school governance to local school communities. The Constitution and its Bill of Rights (RSA, 1996 b) has also impacted significantly on all areas of school governance. School management has to take cognizance of the South African Schools Act and the Bill of Rights when developing and implementing all school policies. One of the policies that all schools must have is a disciplinary policy. Notwithstanding the requirement that every public school should have a disciplinary policy to ensure a disciplined teaching and learning environment, there is a perception amongst educators and other stakeholders such as parents that learner discipline at schools is emerging as a serious problem. This is causing many schools to become ineffective institutions of teaching and learning. The aim of this research {{study was to explore}} and describe the experiences of school managers and educators of learner discipline in the school and classroom environment, as well as to ascertain from them their perceptions of a <b>zero</b> - <b>tolerance</b> approach to managing learner discipline. This was undertaken in order to formulate principles and guidelines for school managers and educators to effectively implement a <b>zero</b> - <b>tolerance</b> management approach to learner discipline. A qualitative research design that was explorative, descriptive and contextual was employed. This paradigm was chosen because of the relative newness of the topic to be researched in the South African context. The researcher conducted focus group interviews in order to collect data. The data collected were analysed and interpreted from which various themes and categories were identified. Quotations from transcribed interviews were given to substantiate the themes and categories identified through analysis. A literature control was also undertaken whereby these themes and categories were compared further with the relevant literature and also discussed. Several categories could not be substantiated and thus reflects the unique contribution of this research study. The themes and categories that were identified by the researcher and the independent coder, and the literature reviewed, provided the basis for the proposed guidelines formulated by the researcher. The guidelines focused on two aspects, namely, principles on which a <b>zero</b> - <b>tolerance</b> management approach towards learner discipline should be based and, guidelines for educators to use in dealing with the problem of learner discipline in the classroom situation. Since this research study has been limited to the city of Johannesburg one of the recommendations made by the researcher is that further research should be undertaken on the efficacy of a <b>zero</b> - <b>tolerance</b> approach to managing learner discipline in South African schools. Future research studies on this phenomenon must be based more broadly with special emphasis on the experiences and perceptions of educators in the townships of South Africa. Also, this research study should ultimately form the basis for further quantitative research...|$|R

An extensive program of the four Es (enforcement, education, engineering, and emergency response) brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre-unification levels after ten years while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards (e.g., 130 km/h (81 mph) Autobahn advisory limit, 100 km/h (62 mph) on other rural roads, and 0.5 milligrams BAC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{explore the}} {{performance}} tradeoff between op-portunistic and regulated access {{inherent in the}} design of multiuser cognitive radio networks. We consider a cognitive radio system with sensing limits at the secondary users and interference tolerance limits at the primary and secondary users. Our objective is to determine the optimal amount of spectrum sharing, i. e., the number of secondary users that maximizes the total deliverable throughput in the system. We begin with the case of perfect primary user detection and <b>zero</b> interference <b>tolerance</b> at each of the primary and secondary nodes. We find that the optimal fraction of licensed users lies between the two extremes of fully opportunistic and fully licensed operation and is equal to the traffic duty cycle. For the more involved case of imperfect sensing and non-zero interference tolerance constraints, we provide numerical simulation results to study the tradeoff between licensing and autonomy and the impact of primary user sensing and interference tolerance on the deliverable throughput.
