5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software allowed for {{a wider range of}} colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the <b>Z-axis</b> to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
5|$|The player {{initially}} {{can see a}} top-down view of the surface-level of {{the fortress}} site; each layer of a <b>z-axis</b> level can be viewed when the player changes it. An entire underground level {{would be seen as}} its entire section of terrain while a mountain at the surface level would have only its section visible with the remaining surface landscape. Thus, for digging, the player can designate, for every z-level starting from the surface, staircases to be carved, and, at the final designated level, end the staircase by having it dug into a room.|$|E
5|$|Spherical coordinates, {{known as}} {{ecliptic}} longitude and latitude or celestial longitude and latitude, {{are used to}} specify positions of bodies on the celestial sphere {{with respect to the}} ecliptic. Longitude is measured positively eastward 0° to 360° along the ecliptic from the vernal equinox, the same direction in which the Sun appears to move. Latitude is measured perpendicular to the ecliptic, to +90° northward or -90° southward to the poles of the ecliptic, the ecliptic itself being 0° latitude. For a complete spherical position, a distance parameter is also necessary. Different distance units are used for different objects. Within the Solar System, astronomical units are used, and for objects near Earth, Earth radii or kilometers are used. A corresponding right-handed rectangular coordinate system is also used occasionally; the x-axis is directed toward the vernal equinox, the y-axis 90° to the east, and the <b>z-axis</b> toward the north ecliptic pole; the astronomical unit is the unit of measure. Symbols for ecliptic coordinates are somewhat standardized; see the table.|$|E
25|$|The winding {{number of}} an {{oriented}} {{curve in the}} x-y plane is equal to its linking number with the <b>z-axis</b> (thinking of the <b>z-axis</b> as a closed curve in the 3-sphere).|$|E
25|$|For a state |L, Lz of orbital angular {{momentum}} L with <b>z-axis</b> projection Lz, P|L, Lz=(−1)L|L, Lz.|$|E
25|$|In what follows, {{attention}} {{is restricted to}} simple rotation about an axis of fixed orientation. The <b>z-axis</b> has been chosen for convenience.|$|E
25|$|In {{cylindrical}} coordinates, {{every point}} of space {{is represented by}} its height z, its radius r from the <b>z-axis</b> and the angle θ its projection on the xy-plane makes {{with respect to the}} horizontal axis.|$|E
25|$|Stereoscopic PIV utilises two cameras with {{separate}} viewing angles {{to extract the}} <b>z-axis</b> displacement. Both cameras must {{be focused on the}} same spot in the flow and must be properly calibrated to have the same point in focus.|$|E
25|$|The boron {{framework}} of YB41Si1.2 consists of five B12 icosahedra (I1–I5) and a B12Si3 polyhedron {{shown in figure}} 8a. An unusual linkage is depicted in figure 8b, where two B12-I5 icosahedra connect via two B atoms of each icosahedron forming an imperfect square. The boron {{framework of}} YB41Si1.2 {{can be described as}} a layered structure where two boron networks (figures 9a,b) stack along the <b>z-axis.</b> One boron network consists of 3 icosahedra I1, I2 and I3 and is located in the z = 0 plane; another network consists of the icosahedron I5 and the B12Si3 polyhedron and lies at z = 0.5. The icosahedron I4 bridges these networks, and thus its height along the <b>z-axis</b> is 0.25.|$|E
25|$|Other {{types of}} mass {{spectrometry}} data are well {{represented as a}} three-dimensional contour map. In this form, the mass-to-charge, m/z is on the x-axis, intensity the y-axis, and an additional experimental parameter, such as time, is recorded on the <b>z-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Professional seismic {{observatories}} {{usually have}} instruments measuring three axes: north-south (y-axis), east-west (x-axis), and the vertical (<b>z-axis).</b> If only one axis is measured, {{this is usually}} the vertical because it is less noisy and gives better records of some seismic waves.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be found}} {{interesting}} that the specific speed coefficient {{may be used in}} place of speed to define the y-axis of Figure 1.2, while at the same time, the specific diameter coefficient may be in place of diameter to define the <b>z-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also in January 2014, MakerBot {{released}} the Replicator Mini with a build volume of 10.0cm x 10.0cm x 12.5cm (3.9″ x 3.9″ x 4.9″ L/W/H), layer resolution of 200 µm, and a positioning precision of 11µm on the x and y-axis and 2.5µm in the <b>z-axis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In spherical coordinates, {{every point}} in space is {{represented}} by its distance ρ from the origin, the angle θ its projection on the xy-plane makes {{with respect to the}} horizontal axis, and the angle φ that it makes with respect to the <b>z-axis.</b> The names of the angles are often reversed in physics.|$|E
25|$|Above 1750ft, the axes of the {{turbulence}} {{coincide with the}} wind frame axes. Below 1750ft, the vertical turbulence axis is aligned with the Earth frame <b>z-axis,</b> the longitudinal turbulence axis is aligned with the projection of the mean wind vector onto the Earth frame's horizontal plane, and the lateral turbulence axis {{is determined by the}} right hand rule.|$|E
25|$|For various formulaic purposes, {{physicists}} divide rotation {{into three}} components, assigning portions to x, y and z axis that are mutually perpendicular. For bowling, the x-axis {{can be assigned}} to a line that {{is parallel to the}} foul line, the y-axis to the line parallel to the boards, and the <b>z-axis</b> to the vertical. Forward-roll is rotation about the x-axis, side-roll is rotation about the y-axis and mid-roll (or spin) is rotation about the <b>z-axis.</b> The pure full-roller delivery is a combination of forward- and side-roll only. Semi-rollers include spin. Spinners may have very little side roll. In a very strict physics sense, a ball may be delivered with rotation, but usually not in a roll, because that would imply complete traction. The technique of the great majority of bowlers involves a delivery that starts the ball in a skid that evolves into a roll that hooks into the pins.|$|E
25|$|Particle image {{velocimetry}} methods will {{in general}} {{not be able}} to measure components along the <b>z-axis</b> (towards to/away from the camera). These components might not only be missed, they might also introduce an interference in the data for the x/y-components caused by parallax. These problems do not exist in Stereoscopic PIV, which uses two cameras to measure all three velocity components.|$|E
25|$|The B80 boron cluster {{occupies}} the large space between four supericosahedra {{as described in}} the REB66 section. On the other hand, the 2-dimensional supericosahedron networks in the Sc4.5–xB57–y+zC3.5–z crystal structure stack in-phase along the <b>z-axis.</b> Instead of the B80 cluster, a pair of the I2 icosahedra fills the open space staying within the supericosahedron network, as shown in figure 28 where the icosahedron I2 is colored in yellow.|$|E
25|$|The cloth or fiber {{material}} used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's type designation (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) {{and therefore the}} characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is fire retardant, the dielectric constant (er), the loss factor (tδ), the tensile strength, the shear strength, the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the <b>Z-axis</b> expansion coefficient (how much the thickness changes with temperature).|$|E
25|$|This allowed Sommerfeld {{to generalize}} Bohr's theory of {{circular}} orbits to elliptical orbits, {{showing that the}} energy levels are the same. He also found some general properties of quantum angular momentum which seemed paradoxical at the time. One of these results was that the z-component of the angular momentum, the classical {{inclination of an orbit}} relative to the <b>z-axis,</b> could only take on discrete values, a result which seemed to contradict rotational invariance. This was called space quantization for a while, but this term fell out of favor with the new quantum mechanics since no quantization of space is involved.|$|E
25|$|Figure 1.1 {{represents}} the aero-thermo domain of turbomachinery. The horizontal axis {{represents the}} energy equation derivable from The first law of thermodynamics. The vertical axis, {{which can be}} characterized by Mach Number, represents the range of fluid compressibility (or elasticity). The <b>Z-axis,</b> which can be characterized by Reynolds number, represents the range of fluid viscosities (or stickiness). Mathematicians and physicists who established the foundations of this aero-thermo domain include: Isaac Newton, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Claude-Louis Navier, George Stokes, Ernst Mach, Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky, Martin Wilhelm Kutta, Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán, Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius, and Henri Coandă.|$|E
25|$|Turbomachinery analysts gain {{tremendous}} {{insight into}} performance by comparisons of these 5 parameters with efficiencies and loss coefficients {{which are also}} dimensionless. In general application, the flow coefficient and head coefficient are considered of primary importance. Generally, for centrifugal compressors, the velocity coefficient is of secondary importance while the Reynolds coefficient is of tertiary importance. In contrast, as expected for pumps, the Reynolds number becomes of secondary importance and the velocity coefficient almost irrelevant. It may be found interesting that the speed coefficient may be chosen to define the y-axis of Figure 1.1, {{while at the same}} time the Reynolds coefficient may be chosen to define the <b>z-axis.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{positional}} {{order parameter}} {{is also used}} to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the <b>z-axis</b> the density [...] is often given by: ...|$|E
500|$|A <b>z-axis</b> was {{introduced}} in the 2008 release because he felt the limitations with a single plane increasing; the feature of making various constructions like walls was also added at this time. In the earlier version, players could dig only into a mountainside and not underground because of having only one [...] "z-level", thus it was considered [...] "2D". This was significantly easier to maintain due to the limited playable area. Adams commented that this major change was further difficult to implement because of considering details like fluid mechanics and cave-ins. Vampiric and lycanthropic infections with necromancers and undead were added in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Without loss of generality, we may {{eliminate}} the normal rotational symmetry by choosing the Cartesian coordinates {{such that the}} <b>z-axis</b> is aligned with the angular momentum vector L and the momentum hodographs are aligned {{as they are in}} Figure 7, with the centers of the circles on the y-axis. [...] Since the motion is planar, and p and L are perpendicular, pz = η'z = 0 and attention may be restricted to the three-dimensional vector [...] [...] The family of Apollonian circles of momentum hodographs (Figure 7) correspond to a family of great circles on the three-dimensional [...] sphere, all of which intersect the η'x-axis at the two foci , corresponding to the momentum hodograph foci at px = ±p0. [...] These great circles are related by a simple rotation about the η'x-axis (Figure 8). [...] This rotational symmetry transforms all the orbits of the same energy into one another; however, such a rotation is orthogonal to the usual three-dimensional rotations, since it transforms the fourth dimension η'w. [...] This higher symmetry is characteristic of the Kepler problem and corresponds to the conservation of the LRL vector.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{the moment}} of inertia of the ball {{is the sum of}} the moments of inertia of the discs along the <b>z-axis,</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Once the x- and y-axes are specified, they {{determine}} the line along which the <b>z-axis</b> should lie, {{but there are}} two possible directions on this line. [...] The two possible coordinate systems which result are called 'right-handed' and 'left-handed'. [...] The standard orientation, where the xy-plane is horizontal and the <b>z-axis</b> points up (and the x- and the y-axis form a positively oriented two-dimensional coordinate system in the xy-plane if observed from above the xy-plane) is called right-handed or positive.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the values}} of the semi-axes are {{approach}}ing, the two pencils of planes (and circles) approach either. For [...] all the planes are orthogonal to the <b>z-axis</b> (rotation axis).|$|E
2500|$|For {{three-dimensional}} systems, {{a convention}} is {{to portray the}} xy-plane horizontally, with the <b>z-axis</b> added to represent height (positive up). Furthermore, there is a convention to orient the x-axis toward the viewer, biased either to the right or left. [...] If a diagram (3D projection or 2D perspective drawing) shows the x- and y-axis horizontally and vertically, respectively, then the <b>z-axis</b> should be shown pointing [...] "out of the page" [...] towards the viewer or camera. In such a 2D diagram of a 3D coordinate system, the <b>z-axis</b> would appear as a line or ray pointing down {{and to the left}} or down and to the right, depending on the presumed viewer or camera perspective. In any diagram or display, the orientation of the three axes, as a whole, is arbitrary. However, the orientation of the axes relative to each other should always comply with the right-hand rule, unless specifically stated otherwise. All laws of physics and math assume this right-handedness, which ensures consistency.|$|E
2500|$|In spherical coordinates, mathematicians usually {{refer to}} phi as the polar angle (from the <b>z-axis).</b> [...] The {{convention}} in physics {{is to use}} phi as the azimuthal angle (from the x-axis).|$|E

2500|$|In {{fundamental}} fluid mechanics, displacement {{within a}} unit {{time in the}} X, Y and Z directions are commonly defined by the variables U, V and W. [...] As was previously described, basic PIV extracts the U and V displacements as functions of the in-plane X and Y directions. [...] This enables calculations of the , , [...] and [...] velocity gradients. [...] However, the other 5 terms of the velocity gradient tensor are unable to be found from this information. [...] The stereoscopic PIV analysis also grants the <b>Z-axis</b> displacement component, W, within that plane. [...] Not only does this grant the <b>Z-axis</b> velocity of the fluid at the plane of interest, but two more velocity gradient terms can be determined: [...] and [...] [...] The velocity gradient components , , and [...] can not be determined.|$|E
2500|$|Position : This {{allows the}} {{description}} of a rotation as the angular position of a planar reference frame M relative to a fixed F about this shared <b>z-axis.</b> [...] Coordinates p = (x, y) in M are related to coordinates P = (X, Y) in F by the matrix equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 3D {{subtitles}} {{combine the}} standard subtitle position along the X and Y {{axis of the}} picture, with a third position along the <b>Z-axis.</b> [...] This third positioning allows the subtitle to [...] "float" [...] {{in front of the}} 3D image.
