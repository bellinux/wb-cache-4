5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of the tractor beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J. Kelly, as well as the designer of virtually every major bridge in New York City from the George Washington to the Verrazano, Leopold Just, are also NYU alumni.|$|E
25|$|Unlike DSLRs, most {{digital cameras}} lack {{the option to}} change the lens. Instead, most compact digital cameras are {{manufactured}} with a <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> that covers {{the most commonly used}} fields of view. Having fixed lenses, they are limited to the focal lengths they are manufactured with, except for what is available from attachments. Manufacturers have attempted (with increasing success) to overcome this disadvantage by offering extreme ranges of focal length on models known as superzooms, some of which offer far longer focal lengths than readily available DSLR lenses.|$|E
25|$|Zoom lenses {{typically}} have a maximum relative aperture (minimum f-number) of 2.8 to 6.3 through their range. High-end lenses {{will have a}} constant aperture, such as 2.8 or 4, {{which means that the}} relative aperture will stay the same throughout the zoom range. A more typical consumer zoom will have a variable maximum relative aperture since it is harder and more expensive to keep the maximum relative aperture proportional to the focal length at long focal lengths; 3.5 to 5.6 {{is an example of a}} common variable aperture range in a consumer <b>zoom</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|Among {{standard}} <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses,</b> it {{is known}} for very good contrast and sharpness and for its extremely low chromatic aberration and barrel distortion. It has a metal body and neutral color rendition. Although discontinued since 2002 {{it is still a}} high ranking lens according to DxOMark among Canon <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> and other standard <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses.</b> Like many other <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses,</b> it exhibits some barrel distortion at the wide end of its range.|$|R

25|$|With {{the success}} of the Zeiss-Ikon Contaflex of the mid-50's and its {{follow-ups}} in form of the Bessamatic, Retina- and Paxette-reflex, Zenit's next attempt was the Zenit-4 (1964), -5 and -6 cameras. These were based on a Voigtländer Bessamatic-type mount with Compur-type iris-shutter near the lens elements. The poor durability and high manufacturing cost of this concept in contrast to the classical barebone Zenit design based on ultimate simplicity showed KMZ to have taken a wrong track: Nevertheless, the Zenit-5 was the first Soviet motor-driven SLR camera, and the first Soviet <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> (Rubin-1c 2.8/37–80, based on Voigtländer Zoomar design) featured in the Zenit-6.|$|E
25|$|Moonlighting {{was unusual}} {{at the time}} for being {{one of only three}} shows, due to FCC regulations, to be owned and {{produced}} in-house by a broadcast network (NBC’s Punky Brewster and CBS’s Twilight Zone revival being the others). This allowed the network greater flexibility in budgeting the show since the “back-end potential” for profits was so much greater with not having to pay a licensing fee to the film studio or independent production company. As a result, ABC gave Caron a lot of control over production. Caron, however, was a perfectionist and viewed Moonlighting as the filming of a one-hour movie every week, using techniques usually reserved for big budget films. To capture the cinematic feel of the films of the 1940s, for example, he would prohibit the use of a <b>zoom</b> <b>lens,</b> opting instead to use more time-consuming moving master cameras that move back and forth on a track and require constant resetting of the lights. Diffusion disks were used to soften Cybill Shepherd’s features, and a special lens needed to be employed so that in a two shot, Maddie would be diffused and David would not.|$|E
500|$|The Sigma 8–16mm lens is an enthusiast-level, ultra {{wide-angle}} rectilinear <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> made by Sigma Corporation {{specifically for}} use with APS-C small format digital SLRs. It is the first ultrawide rectilinear (non-fisheye lens) <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> with a minimum focal length of 8mm, designed specifically for APS-C size image sensors. The lens was introduced at the February 2010 Photo Marketing Association International Convention and Trade Show. At its release it was the widest viewing angle focal length available commercially for APS-C cameras. It is part of Sigma's DC (Digital Camera) line of lenses, meaning {{it was designed to}} have an image circle tailored to work with APS-C format cameras. [...] The lens has a constant length regardless of optical zoom and focus with inner lens tube elements responding to these parameters. The camera has hypersonic zoom autofocus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> - {{variable}} {{focal length}} <b>lenses.</b> <b>Zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> cover {{a range of}} focal lengths by utilising movable elements within {{the barrel of the}} lens assembly. In early varifocal lens lenses the focus also shifted as the lens focal length was changed. Varifocal lenses are also used in many modern autofocus cameras as the lenses are cheaper and simpler to construct and the autofocus can take care of the re-focussing requirements. Many modern <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> are now confocal, meaning that the focus is maintained throughout the zoom range. Because of the need to operate over a range of focal lengths and maintain confocality, <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> typically have very many lens elements. More significantly, the front elements of the lens will always be a compromise in terms of its size, light-gathering capability and the angle of incidence of the incoming rays of light. For all these reasons, the optical performance of <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> tends to be lower than fixed-focal-length lenses.|$|R
50|$|Pancake-style prime lenses are {{generally}} simpler to manufacture than pancake <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> like Sony E PZ 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 {{due to the}} general lack of an internal micromotor and fewer image correcting elements, allowing for a thinner profile. Because of this limitation, pancake <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> are much less common.|$|R
50|$|It is {{generally}} considered {{to be one of the}} finest <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> ever produced, comparing favorably with many wide-angle prime Nikkor lenses. As of 2006, Photozone.de ranks the lens in 4th place among all Nikkors both prime and zoom, and in first place among all <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> by any manufacturer.|$|R
500|$|In 1989, {{the company}} brought out Primo, {{a new line}} of lenses. Designed with a {{consistent}} color match between all the different focal-length instruments in the line, these were also the sharpest lenses yet manufactured by Panavision. Six years later, Oscars were awarded to the company and to three of its employees for their work on the Primo 3:1 zoom lens: Iain Neil for the optical design, Rick Gelbard for the mechanical design, and Eric Dubberke for the lens's engineering. According to the AMPAS citation, [...] "The high contrast and absence of flare, along with its ability to provide close focusing and to maintain constant image size while changing focus, make the Primo 3:1 <b>Zoom</b> <b>Lens</b> truly unique." [...] In 1991, the company released its new 65mm technology, System 65, though Arri had beaten it to market by two years with the Arriflex 765. The gauge was not widely readopted, and only two major Hollywood films were shot with the new 65mm Panavision process: Far and Away (1992) and Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet (1996).|$|E
500|$|Stanton wanted WALL-E to be {{a box and}} EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's {{eyes were}} {{inspired}} {{by a pair of}} binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He [...] "missed the entire inning" [...] because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others pointed it out to him.|$|E
500|$|U2 3D {{production}} {{featured the}} first 3D multiple-camera setup and was shot using every digital 3D camera and recording deck in existence. The crew had {{two days to}} set up the filming equipment before each concert, which required running optical fiber cables and hooking up an electrical generator to supply power at each venue. The filming equipment consisted of nine custom-built 3D rigs. The project's large scale prompted 3ality Digital to work with director James Cameron—their chief competitor at the time. 3ality used their own 3flex TS1 camera rigs for filming, in addition to five Fusion 3D rigs, designed by Cameron and camera operator Vincent Pace. [...] A total of 18 Sony CineAlta HDC-F950 cameras were used for filming, with two cameras on each rig. The cameras were fitted with Zeiss digital zoom lenses, making U2 3D the first 3D film shot using a <b>zoom</b> <b>lens.</b> One of the Fusion 3D camera rigs was used as a Spydercam and became the first 3D aerial camera. [...] The cameras on each rig were spaced eye-distance apart to create a 3D effect in post-production. Using a beam splitter mounted to the camera rig, one camera shot through a 50/50 mirror, while the other shot the image reflected from that mirror. Each rig weighed an average of [...] All of the concert footage was shot with twin-camera setups, except for the two Melbourne shoots, where a single CineAlta camera with a Steadicam was also used to capture close-ups. The cameras captured high-definition video onto HDCAMSR recording decks, which enabled the crew to capture an entire concert.|$|E

50|$|Most often a {{prime lens}} will be used, both because the zoom is not {{necessary}} for posed shots (and primes are lighter, cheaper, faster, and higher quality), and because <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> can introduce highly unflattering geometric distortion (barrel distortion or pincushion distortion). However, <b>zoom</b> <b>lenses</b> may be used, particularly in candid shots or to encourage creative framing.|$|R

By convention, [...] "#" [...] is treated as a single symbol, and specific values of # are written by replacing the number sign with the value. The two ways to increase the f-stop are to either decrease {{the diameter of}} the entrance pupil or change to a longer focal length (in the case of a <b>zoom</b> <b>lens,</b> this can be done by simply adjusting the lens). Higher f-numbers also have a larger depth of field due to the lens approaching the limit of a pinhole camera which is able to focus all images perfectly, regardless of distance, but requires very long exposure times.|$|E

Zsigmond states that Altman [...] "wanted to do something different" [...] in this film, {{and told him he}} [...] "wanted the camera to move—all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side." [...] Cinematographer Roger Deakins, discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, [...] "I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for.

We never use a zoom," [...] he said. [...] "I don't even carry a <b>zoom</b> <b>lens</b> with me, unless it's for something very specific." [...] The famous coin-tossing scene between Chigurh and the old gas station clerk is a good example; the camera tracks in so slowly that the audience isn't even aware of the move. [...] "When the camera itself moves forward, the audience is moving, too. You're actually getting closer to somebody or something. It has, to me, a much more powerful effect, because it's a three-dimensional move. A zoom is more like a focusing of attention. You're just standing in the same place and concentrating on one smaller element in the frame. Emotionally, that's a very different effect." ...|$|E
