40|$|The {{relationships}} between age of hens, number of laid eggs, egg weight {{on one hand}} and fertility and hatchability on the other were analysed during two periods of individual pedigree hatching. Altogether 1 369 hens originated from 9 selected initial laying lines of Bar Plymouth Rock (BPR) (3 lines), Rhode Island Red (RIR) (4 lines), Rhode Island White (RIW), and Sussex Light (SUL) breeds. A total number of 23 473 eggs from hens of all 9 aforementioned lines were set after being artificially inseminated. The total average hatchability of set eggs was 73. 2 % and the average percentage of unfertilised eggs was 9. 3 %. Positive correlations (<b>r</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 22 to <b>r</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 72; P < 0. 01) were found between the total number of eggs laid till the 240 th day of age and the number of eggs produced {{at the beginning of the}} laying period in the all studied lines. There were negative correlations (<b>r</b> <b>p</b> =− 0. 03 to <b>r</b> <b>p</b> =− 0. 16; P < 0. 01) between the total number of eggs laid till the 240 th day of age and the average egg weight (on the 222 nd day of age). Zero to positive correlations existed between the total number of eggs laid till the 240 th day of age {{on one hand and}} the number of hatching eggs, number of hatched chicks/hen and hatchability; the calculated values ranged from <b>r</b> <b>p</b> =− 0. 02 to <b>r</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 30 (P< 0. 01), from <b>r</b> <b>p</b> = − 0. 08 to <b>r</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 36 (P p =− 0. 09 to <b>r</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 30 (P< 0. 01), respectively. Correlations between the egg weight and number of hatched chicks/hen were negative to zero and their values ranged from <b>r</b> <b>p</b> =− 0. 19 (P p = 0. 02. Correlations between the egg weight and hatchability were always negative (<b>r</b> <b>p</b> =− 0. 15; P p =− 0. 04). Regarding the fact that there is a concurrent selection for an increased egg weight it can be said that this preference of smaller eggs is really counter-productive. A positive relationship between the number of hatching eggs/hen and the hatchability (<b>r</b> <b>p</b> =− 0. 02 to <b>r</b> <b>p</b> = 0. 39; P < 0. 01) was influenced by calculated negative correlations existing between the weight of eggs and the hatchability as well as between the weight of eggs and the number of laid eggs. As far as the hatchability is concerned, it can be concluded that in the aforementioned laying lines those hens are preferred, which produce more eggs of smaller size and that this fact obviously influences also the efficiency of selection for a greater weight of produced eggs...|$|R

40|$|Chromosomal inversions {{are thought}} {{to play a major}} role in climatic adaptation. In D. melanogaster, the {{cosmopolitan}} inversion In(3 R) Payne exhibits latitudinal clines on multiple continents. As many fitness traits show similar clines, it is tempting to hypothesize that In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> underlies observed clinal patterns for some of these traits. In support of this idea, previous work in Australian populations has demonstrated that In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> affects body size but not development time or cold resistance. However, similar data from other clines of this inversion are largely lacking; finding parallel effects of In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> across multiple clines would considerably strengthen the case for clinal selection. Here, we have analysed the phenotypic effects of In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> in populations originating from the endpoints of the latitudinal cline along the North American east coast. We measured development time, egg-to-adult survival, several size-related traits (femur and tibia length, wing area and shape), chill coma recovery, oxidative stress resistance and triglyceride content in homokaryon lines carrying In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> or the standard arrangement. Our central finding is that the effects of In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> along the North American cline match those observed in Australia: standard arrangement lines were larger than inverted lines, but the inversion did not influence development time or cold resistance. Similarly, In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> did not affect egg-to-adult survival, oxidative stress resistance and lipid content. In(3 <b>R)</b> <b>P</b> thus seems to specifically affect size traits in populations from both continents. This parallelism strongly suggests an adaptive pattern, whereby the inversion has captured alleles associated with growth regulation and clinal selection acts on size across both continents...|$|R
