40|$|The potency and {{duration}} of the antisecretory action of <b>zaltidine,</b> a novel H 2 -receptor antagonist, have been examined in healthy volunteers and in patients with previous duodenal ulceration. In eight healthy male volunteers single oral doses of 5 mg, 25 mg and 100 mg produced dose-related inhibition of basal and pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (M. A. O.) with an estimated ID 50 of 40 mg for the latter. In eight subjects with duodenal ulceration single 100 mg and 200 mg doses produced 85 % and 97 % inhibition of M. A. O. at peak (3 h post-dose) and 20 % and 23 % inhibition at 24 h, respectively; inhibition of basal acid output was 97 % at 3 h and 50 % at 24 h with both doses. The long duration of action of <b>zaltidine</b> is ascribed to its relatively slow elimination from the plasma...|$|E
