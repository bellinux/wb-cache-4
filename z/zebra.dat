5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the {{mountain}} <b>zebra,</b> Equus zebra; plains <b>zebra,</b> Equus quagga; Grévy's <b>zebra,</b> Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.|$|E
5|$|Later {{morphological}} studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 {{analysis of}} cranial measurements {{found that the}} quagga was as different from the plains <b>zebra</b> as the latter is from the mountain <b>zebra.</b> A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains <b>zebra.</b> In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains <b>zebra</b> and the quagga as separate species.|$|E
5|$|Quaggas {{have been}} {{reported}} gathering into herds of 30–50 individuals and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell's <b>zebra</b> between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, {{and there is no}} evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann's mountain <b>zebra</b> (Equus <b>zebra</b> hartmannae).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are more}} Grant’s <b>zebras</b> {{in the wild}} than any other species or {{subspecies}} of <b>zebras.</b> Unlike Grevy and Mountain <b>zebras,</b> they are not endangered. [...] Grant’s <b>zebras</b> eat the coarse grasses that grow on the African plains, and they are resistant to diseases that often kill cattle, so the <b>zebras</b> {{do well in the}} African savannas. However, recent civil wars and political conflicts in the African countries near their habitats has caused regional extinction, and sometimes <b>zebras</b> are killed for their coats, or to eliminate competition with domestic livestock.|$|R

5|$|The quagga was {{the first}} extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study {{launched}} the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was {{more closely related to}} zebras than to horses, with the quagga and mountain <b>zebra</b> (Equus <b>zebra)</b> sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains <b>zebra.</b> A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains <b>zebra.</b>|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains <b>zebra</b> remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, the Grévy's <b>zebra,</b> mountain <b>zebra</b> and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains <b>zebra</b> as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The <b>zebra</b> has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single <b>zebra</b> stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual <b>zebra.</b> Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the <b>zebra</b> stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

Rihanna wears a variety of outfits in the video, including a gold net bodysuit and a black and white <b>zebra</b> print catsuit, which she wears while sitting atop a stuffed <b>zebra.</b> Rihanna performs various 1990s dancehall dance moves, such as the Bogle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zebras</b> have {{excellent}} eyesight. It {{is believed that}} they can see in color.

5|$|There is robust {{morphological}} {{support for}} {{the placement of the}} <b>zebra</b> shark, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of the <b>zebra</b> shark, and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed the <b>zebra</b> shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma.|$|E

5|$|Docile and slow-moving, <b>zebra</b> {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many <b>zebra</b> sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The <b>zebra</b> shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E
25|$|Embryological {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} the <b>zebra's</b> background colour is dark and the white is an addition. The first subspecies to be described, the now-extinct quagga, had plain brown hindquarters. There have been various mutations of the <b>zebra's</b> pelage, from mostly white to mostly black.

5|$|During the day, <b>zebra</b> {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. <b>Zebra</b> sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, {{a cross between}} a male donkey and a female horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is {{a cross between a}} male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a <b>zebra</b> and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a <b>zebra</b> and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains <b>zebra</b> {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain <b>zebra</b> inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's <b>zebra</b> {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E
2500|$|Plains <b>zebras</b> {{generally}} live in treeless grasslands and savanna woodlands but can {{be found}} in a variety of habitats, both tropical and temperate. However they are generally absent from deserts, dense rainforests and permanent wetlands. <b>Zebras</b> also live in elevations from sea level to [...] on Mount Kenya. They rely on rainfall for food and water, and go on great migrations to follow the rains. The <b>zebras</b> will migrate up to [...] for food. Other grazers also migrate. Plains <b>zebras</b> are highly water-dependent and are usually found within 25–30 kilometres of a water source.|$|R

5000|$|This {{northern}} subspecies is vertically striped in front, horizontally on {{the back}} legs, and diagonally on the rump and hind flanks. Shadow stripes are absent or only poorly expressed. The stripes, {{as well as the}} inner-spaces, are broad and well defined. Northerly specimens may lack a mane. Grant’s <b>zebras</b> grow to be about 120 to 140 cm tall, and generally weigh about 300 kg. [...] The <b>zebras</b> live in family groups of up to 17 or 18 <b>zebras,</b> and they are led by a single stallion. Grant’s <b>zebras</b> live an average of 20 years.|$|R

5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a <b>zebra</b> {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a <b>zebra.</b> It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|The horses, {{especially}} young foals and juveniles, provide a major food {{source in the}} southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena, along with gemsbok and springbok. However, the availability of other food {{appears to have a}} significant influence on predation rates among the horses. Leopards and black-backed jackals also predate young horses, although this is more rare. The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse, as they cause dehydration, malnutrition, exhaustion and lameness. Other large plains animals, including the mountain <b>zebra,</b> may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall, but human interference (including fencing off portions of land and hunting) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area. The endangered Hartmann's mountain <b>zebra</b> does exist in the Naukluft Mountain <b>Zebra</b> Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park, but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse.|$|E
