40|$|Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) is a carbon (<b>C)</b> <b>and</b> {{nitrogen}} (N) reservoir comprising {{a continuum of}} overlapping pools of different sizes, composition, turnover times and levels of significance to <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N cycling in terrestrial systems. The mineralization of SOM provides <b>C,</b> N <b>and</b> energy to microorganisms and N to plants. Soil <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N dynamics are linked {{to each other and}} N is usually the limiting substrate for C microbial turnover. Soil <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N demand increase with higher crop yields and risks of depletion of soil reserves arise when removals are larger than inputs. Assessing the <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N dynamics in sensitive SOM pools is a key to measure changes in soil quality under intensive agriculture. Short-term (18 -month) <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N dynamics was studied using stable isotopes (15 N <b>and</b> 13 <b>C)</b> in four SOM pools under maize-soybean cropping systems. ^ Temporal changes in total soil <b>C</b> (TSC) <b>and</b> N (TSN) were related to the amount of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N inputs and removals each cycle. The LF and MHA were the most labile fractions with greater sensitivity to <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N of residue inputs. The LF displayed the largest seasonal fluctuation in <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N gains and removals. The change in 13 <b>C</b> <b>and</b> 15 N enrichment revealed the sequence of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N turnover as LF 3 ̆e MHA 3 ̆e CaHA 3 ̆e Humin. Biological activity dominates the <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N turnover in the LF and MHA due to their simpler chemical composition and reduced protection by minerals while the turnover of CaHA and Humin suggest that abiotic processes dominate turnover.

To understand the response of ecosystem <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N to grazing exclusion in semiarid grassland, we determined the <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N in litter, aboveground biomass, roots and soils from ungrazed grassland fenced at different times in northwest China. Our results showed that the aboveground biomass, root biomass and plant litter were 70 - 92 %, 56 - 151 % and 59 - 141 % higher, respectively, in grazer excluded grassland than in grazed grassland. Grazing exclusion significantly increased <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N stored in plant biomass and litter and increased the concentrations <b>and</b> stocks of <b>C</b> <b>and</b> N in soils.

A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model was constructed and revealed metal- and exposure routedependent accumulation profiles. Under the tested exposure conditions in water (0. 1 ìM <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> 1 ìM Zn), only 0. 1 and 0. 07 %, respectively, of the total <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn load that passed the branchial surfaces was accumulated by the carp. In contrast, the carp accumulated 20 and 29 % of the total ingested <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn load (mean concentrations in food of newly accumulated metals were 2. 24 ± 0. 29 and 19. 91 ± 2. 89 nmol/g wet weight, respectively). However, the contribution of the waterborne metals to the whole-body metal accumulation was higher than the metal uptake from food. The constructed model was used to simulate the effect of variable assimilation efficiency (AE) values on the relative importance of dietary <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn exposure to the overall metal accumulation in common carp. This simulation was performed under a realistic exposure scenario <b>and</b> with <b>Cd</b> <b>and</b> Zn AE values ranging from 5 to 95 %.
