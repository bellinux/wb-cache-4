40|$|Context Studying {{interactions}} between a wildlife species and its spatial environment can enable {{a deeper understanding}} of its ecology. Studies of spatial ecology are generally undertaken by attaching <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> to selected individuals and following their movements. Highly mobile species, such as black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus spp.), that occupy habitats with patchy resources are ideal candidates. The powerful beak and chewing habits of black cockatoos make it difficult to successfully attach <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> to them. Aims We developed a safe technique for attaching <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> to black cockatoos and assessed the impact of the <b>tracking</b> <b>devices,</b> as well as their performance in relation to battery life, retention time and accuracy of location fixes. Methods We describe a technique for attaching Telonics (Mesa, AZ, USA) Argos Avian Transmitter TAV 2617 <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> to the two central tail feathers of black cockatoos. Key results Of 26 <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> fitted (24 to Carnaby's cockatoos, C. latirostris; two to Baudin's cockatoos, C. baudinii), 20 exhibited longer retention time than the nominal battery life. One <b>tracking</b> <b>device</b> was chewed until it was non-functional before release and two were presumed chewed after release because their <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> failed prematurely. There was no evidence that the <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> inhibited the flight capability of cockatoos. The performance of the Argos <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> exceeded expectations with regard to retention times, battery life and overall accuracy of location fixes. The <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> enabled detection of instances of rapid long-distance movements, including one bird that travelled 70 km between night roosts while migrating. Most study birds (68 %) remained within 50 km of their release sites while monitored. Conclusion The <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> were a suitable choice for black cockatoos and {{for the purpose of this}} study. They posed minimal snag risk, were of suitable dimensions for tail attachment and they enabled data to be collected even if birds dispersed long distances. The main limitations that must be considered when assessing their suitability for future research projects are the errors associated with location fixes, limited retention time in relation to moulting of tail feathers and limited battery life. Implications The development of a method for successfully attaching <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> to black cockatoos opens the possibility to study aspects of the ecology of black cockatoos and other highly mobile species that was not previously possible...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{studies in the}} mid-twentieth century, {{lightweight}} electronic <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> have been increasingly used to study waterfowl movements. With {{half a century of}} experience and growing sample sizes, it has become clear that the attachment of a <b>tracking</b> <b>device</b> can affect a bird’s behaviour and fitness. This becomes problematic when it introduces uncertainty about whether the recorded data represent natural behaviour. Waterfowl may be particularly prone to tag effects, since many species are migratory and <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> can disrupt their waterproof plumage. The primary aim {{of this paper is to}} identify how <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> may affect waterfowl survival, migration and reproduction, and how better measuring and reporting of such effects can improve our understanding of the risks, providing a first step towards reducing their impact in future studies. We reviewed literature on electronic tracking of waterfowl to create an overview of currently recognized effects of harness-attached backpacks, implants, subcutaneous attachments and neck collars. Additionally, we analysed developments in the use of attachment methods, the weight of <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> relative to bird body mass, and the reporting rate of effects of <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> in 202 original tracking studies. We found that although the number of waterfowl tracking studies described in peer-reviewed literature has steeply increased over the past decades, reporting rates of potential effects have decreased from 65. 0 to 26. 5 %. Meanwhile, the mean weight of the <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> relative to the bird’s body mass remained stable around 2. 0 %. Major negative effects were reported in 17 % of all studies and were found for all attachment methods. Overall, large differences exist in the occurrence and type of negative effects between species and studies, even if the same tracking methods were used. Inconsistent reporting of effects, lack of control groups to measure effects and incomplete descriptions of the methodology hamper the identification of factors contributing to these effects. To accomplish a reduction in adverse effects of tracking, it is necessary to improve the measuring and reporting of effects. We propose a framework for standardized reporting of methods in primary tracking studies and standardized protocols to measure effects of <b>tracking</b> <b>devices</b> on waterfowl...|$|R
