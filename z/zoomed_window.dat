A piezo-sensor suite was deployed to activate and collect Lamb wave signals that propagate along metallic specimens.

Several advanced techniques were explored to extract representative features from acoustic time series. Among them, the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is a recently developed technique {{for the analysis of}} non-linear and transient signals. A moving window method was introduced to generate the local peak characters from acoustic time series, and a <b>zooming</b> <b>window</b> technique was developed to localize the structural flaws. The time-frequency analysis and pattern recognition techniques were combined for classifying structural defects in brass tubes. Several types of flaws in brass tubes were tested, both in the air and in water. The techniques also proved to be effective under background/process noise. A detailed theoretical analysis of Lamb wave propagation was performed and simulations were carried out using the finite element software system ABAQUS. This analytical study confirmed the behavior of the acoustic signals acquired from the experimental studies.

ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ· Development of a hybrid modeling technique for process diagnosis and its evaluation using laboratory heat exchanger test data. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ· Development and testing of a sensor suite using piezo-electric devices for monitoring structural integrity of both flat plates (beams) and tubing. Experiments were performed in air, and in water with and without bubbly flow. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ· Development of advanced signal processing methods using wavelet transforms and image processing techniques for isolating flaw types. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ· Development and implementation of a new nonlinear and non-stationary signal processing method, called the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), for flaw detection and location. This is a more robust and adaptive approach compared to the wavelet transform. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ· Implementation of a moving-window technique in the time domain for detecting and quantifying flaw types in tubular structures. A <b>window</b> <b>zooming</b> technique was also developed for flaw location in tubes. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ· Theoretical study of elastic wave propagation (longitudinal and shear waves) in metallic flat plates and tubing with and without flaws. ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ· Simulation of the Lamb wave propagation using the finite-element code ABAQUS. This enabled the verification of the experimental results. The research tasks included both analytical research and experimental studies. The experimental results helped to enhance the robustness of fault monitoring methods and to provide a systematic verification of the analytical results. The results of this research were disseminated in scientific meetings. The journal manuscript titled, "Structural Integrity Monitoring of Steam generator Tubing Using Transient Acoustic Signal Analysis," was published in IEEE Trasactions on Nuclear Science, Vol. 52, No. 1, February 2005. The new findings of this research have potential applications in aerospace and civil structures.

40|$|The {{focus of}} release {{is very much}} on {{technical}} improvements, efficiency and general polish. The most obvious and exciting change is {{the introduction of the}} live_loop which will change the way you work with Sonic Pi. For more information on live_loop {{take a look at the}} new section in the tutorial. Another very exciting development is that v 2. 1 marks the official support for Windows thanks to the excellent work by Jeremy Weatherford. Finally, this release is also the first release where Sonic Pi has a Core Team of developers. Please give a warm welcome to Xavier Riley, Jeremy Weatherford and Joseph Wilk. API Changes New fn live_loop - A loop for live coding New fn inc - increment New fn dec - decrement New fn quantise - quantise a value to resolution New fn factor? - Factor test New fn at - Run a block at the given times New fn degree - for resolving a note in a scale by degree such as :i, :iv New fn chord_degree - Construct chords based on scale degrees New TL fn use_sample_bpm - for changing the BPM based on a sample's duration New fn rest? - Determine if note or args is a rest New fn vt - Get virtual time New fn set_control_delta! - Set control delta globally wait now handles both sleep and sync functionality Allow first arg to play to be a proc or lambda. In which case simple call it and use the result as the note Teach play to accept a single map argument (in which case it will extract :note key out if it exists. Fns play and synth now treat 'notes' nil, :r and :rest as rests and don't trigger any synths. GUI Modifications Updated and improved tutorial Much improved autocompletion Add HPF, LPF, mono forcer and stereo swapping preferences to new studio section for use when performing with Sonic Pi through an external PA. Shortcuts overhauled - now supports basic Emacs-style Ctrl-* navigation. Shortcuts Alt-[and Alt-] now cycle through workspaces Shortcuts now work when toolbar is hidden Font sizes for individual workspaces are now stored between sessions Ctl-Mouse-wheel <b>zooms</b> font on <b>Windows</b> Links are now clickable (opening external browser) Entries in docsystem's synth arg table are now clickable and will take focus down to arg documentation Stop users accidentally clearing entire workspace if they type quickly after hitting run Hitting F 1 or C-i over a function name now opens up the doc system at the relevant place Bugs/Improvements Reworked examples. Much improved efficiency in many areas - especially for Raspberry Pi. Avoid occasional clicking sound when stopping runs Note Cb is now correctly resolved to be a semitone lower than C Non RP systems now start with more audio busses (1024) Array#sample and Array#shuffle are now correctly seeded with thread local random generator Log files are now placed into ~/. sonic-pi/log Chords and scales now wrap around when accessed from indexes outside of their range. rand_i and rrand_i now correctly return integers rather than floats rrand arguments now correctly handle a range of 0 (i. e. min == max) Line offset in error messages is now correct When saving files on Windows, CRLF line endings are used Stop users defining functions with same name as core API fns Synths, Samples & FX New samples (bass drums, snares and loops) Allow mod_range param to have negative values (for oscillating with lower notes) Change slide mechanism to default to linear sliding with support for changing the curve type. All modifiable args now have corresponding _slide_shape and _slide_curve args. Improve TB 303 synth - now supports separate cutoff ADSR envelopes. New args: cutoff_attack, cutoff_sustain, cutoff_decay, cutoff_release, cutoff_min_slide, cutoff_attack_level, cutoff_sustain_level, cutoff_env_curve Releases Mac Link Sonic-Pi-for-Mac-v 2. 1. 0. dmg MD 5 e 782 e 7 ad 0 ff 742 c 7 ef 8 d 672 daf 0 f 1 cd 6 SHA 256 8 adcc 17 b 43406 f 39 cd 7 fb 6 a 59 bcb 7 e 29641 c 09 eda 131 f 98272 d 1 b 8 ab 04899 e 1 e Windows Link Sonic-Pi-for-Win-v 2. 1. 0. msi MD 5 6 ee 01 a 5 c 980621 ca 73 dd 5 a 0 bc 50 d 656 d SHA 256 25 dd 2 dad 75 c 7 c 78067 ac 0 e 8 f 1 fe 3 d 147 d 843 a 1 e 1 f 4 d 23 e 14 de 52 d 32002 b 639 cb RPi Wheezy Link Sonic-Pi-for-RPi-Wheezy-v 2. 1. 0. tgz MD 5 1 db 953 dfb 3 b 44 a 2 e 30 d 1 bebf 61682833 SHA 256 2 d 094 e 3 bab 7 a 63 b 72 d 400 c 1 ef 8 c 0 bed 31 e 4 eceeb 042 f 28 de 26 cf 26 a 372 a 568 f...|$|R
