40|$|The {{chemistry}} of nickel complexes supported by phosphine donor ligands has gained recent interest {{due to the}} ability of these species to catalyze a variety of chemical transformations. A series of divalent, monovalent, and <b>zerovalent</b> <b>nickel</b> complexes supported by the strongly electron-releasing, monoanionic tris(phosphino) borate ligand, [PhBP_ 3]=[PhB(CH_ 2 PPh 2) _ 3]^-, have been synthesized to explore their coordination chemistry and reactivity. The characterization of these complexes will be presented, with comparisons drawn to isostructural nickel complexes supported by neutral phosphine ligands...|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} reaction between azolium salts (N-heterocyclic carbene precursors) and ethylene, catalyzed by <b>zerovalent</b> <b>nickel</b> complexes, {{has been investigated}} {{using a combination of}} experiment and density functional theory (DFT). The reaction proceeds via a redox mechanism involving the generation of Nicarbene intermediates. The experimental studies employed an in situ catalyst system, derived from Ni- (COD) 2 and a variety of phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene spectator ligands, to couple 1 -propyl- 3 - methylimidazolium bromide (ionic liquid) and other azolium salts with ethylene. The DFT studies employed the simpler dimethylimidazolium salt to model the reaction...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{reaction}} of the unsaturated pentadieneoic- and hexadieneoic acids and their derivatives with <b>zerovalent</b> <b>nickel</b> and platinum is examined. This reaction shows product selectivity depending on the coligand and the metal centre. With [Ni(COD) _ 2] as metal(0) -precursor and sterically demanding phosphines as coligands the reaction results in the formation of nickelacyclic #eta#" 3 -allyl-carboxylates, where the carboxyl-group coordinates monodentate after migration of the acidic proton to the beta-carbon of the acid. The nickel-allylcarboxylates where characterised by X-ray-diffraction analysis, NMR-,IR-, UV-spectroscopy and by cyclovoltammographie. (orig.)

40|$|IR {{spectroscopy}} of {{low temperature}} adsorbed CO and CO + NO {{has been used}} to characterize the surface species on a 5 % Ni-YSZ catalyst. Dispersed surface Ni species are present on the fresh catalyst, essentially formed by Ni 2 +, although it is evident that these species are very easily reduced in very mild conditions to <b>zerovalent</b> atomic <b>nickel.</b> Reduction in stronger conditions gives rise to small Ni metal particles, which are however easily reoxidized to bivalent nickel. This work has demonstrated how elastic is the redox state of this catalyst.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of nanotechnology is causing an ubiquitously presence of nanoparticles (NPs) in the environment. Cobalt, iron and <b>nickel</b> <b>zerovalent</b> NPs {{are the most}} promising materials for nanotechnological applications due to their application in fields such as electronics, communication and security systems, food industry and cosmetics, environmental remediation, water purification, tools for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} diseases and even in army. It is evident that a multidisciplinary study of the possible toxicity of the above mentioned NPs is fundamental. For this reason we have performed in vitro experiments on SKOV- 3 and U 87 cell lines to evaluate NP cytotoxicity, uptake and their influence on gene expression. The results have shown a higher cytotoxicity of nickel and cobalt compare to iron. All NP are readily internalized into cells within 30 min exposure; this observation is in agreement with the cytotoxicity, that seems to be dose but not time dependent. Furthermore, results of Real-Time PCR suggest that Fe-NPs and Co-NPs, at the tested concentration, have moderate effects on the expression, while Ni-NPs seems to up-regulate the investigate genes...|$|R
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the chemistry of molecular precursors is useful in achieving more predictable and reproducible nanocrystal preparations. Recently, an efficient approach was introduced that consists of fine-tuning the chemical reactivity of the synthetic molecular precursors used, while keeping all other reaction conditions constant. Using nickel phosphides as a research platform, we have studied how the chemical structure and reactivity of a family of commercially available organophosphite precursors (P(OR) 3, R = alkyl or aryl) alter the preparation of metallic and metal phosphide nanocrystals. Organophosphites are a versatile addition to the pnictide synthetic toolbox, nicely complementing other available precursors such as elemental phosphorus or trioctylphosphine (TOP). Experimental and computational data show that different organophosphite precursors selectively yield Ni, Ni 12 P 5, and Ni 2 P and that these phases evolve over time through separate mechanistic pathways. Based on our observations, we propose that nickel phosphide formation requires organophosphite coordination to a nickel precursor, followed by intramolecular rearrangement. We also propose that metallic nickel formation involves outer sphere reduction by uncoordinated organophosphite. These two independent pathways are supported by the fact that preformed Ni nanocrystals do not react {{with some of the most}} reactive phosphide-forming organophosphites, failing to evolve into nickel phosphide nanocrystals. Overall, the rate at which organophosphites react with nickel(II) chloride or acetate to form nickel phosphides increases in the order P(OMe) 3 3 ̆c P(OEt) 3 3 ̆c P(OnBu) 3 3 ̆c P(OCH 2 tBu) 3 3 ̆c P(OiPr) 3 3 ̆c P(OPh) 3. Some organophosphites, such as P(OMe) 3 or P(OiPr) 3, transiently form <b>zerovalent,</b> metallic <b>nickel,</b> while this is the only persistent product observed with the bulky organophosphite P(O- 2, 4 -tBu 2 C 6 H 4) 3. We expect that these results will alleviate the need for time-consuming testing and random optimization of several different reaction conditions, thus enabling a faster development of these and similar pnictide nanomaterials for practical applications...|$|R

The nickel-mediated {{coupling}} of asymmetric alkynes {{with carbon}} dioxide {{is known to be}} highly regioselective with respect to the formation of nickelacycle intermediates and α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid products. Using density functional theory (DFT), we have investigated the effect that parameters such as acetylene-substituent, ancillary ligand and solvent have on the potential energy surface of the nickelacycle coupling reaction. 3 -R-substituted nickelacycles are the thermodynamically preferred product in all cases surveyed, however, the transition structure characterised by the attack of CO 2 on the alkyne carbon distal from the R-group is generally lower in energy, making the 2 -R-substituted nickelacycle the kinetically favoured product. Ligating the <b>zerovalent</b> <b>nickel</b> species with the diazabicyclo[5. 4. 0]undec- 7 -ene (DBU) ancillary ligand in preference to 2, 2 ′-bipyridine (BIPY) leads to lower activation energies for the coupling reaction and products that are less susceptible to steric bulk in the 2 -position of the nickelacycle. Solvation with dimethylformamide (DMF) has the advantage of lowering the activation barrier for the coupling reaction when compared to tetrahydrofuran (THF). David C. Graham, Michael I.

40|$|Density {{functional}} theory {{indicates that}} oxidative {{addition of the}} C-F and C-H bonds in C 6 F 6 and C 6 H 6 at <b>zerovalent</b> <b>nickel</b> and platinum fragments, M(H 2 PCH 2 CH 2 PH 2), proceeds via initial exothermic formation of an eta 2 -coordinated arene complex. Two distinct transition states have been located on the potential energy surface between the eta 2 -coordinated arene and the oxidative addition product. The first, at relatively low energy, features an eta 3 -coordinated arene and connects two identical eta 2 -arene minima, while the second leads to cleavage of the C-X bond. The absence of intermediate C-F or C-H sigma complexes observed in other systems is traced {{to the ability of}} the 14 -electron metal fragment to accommodate the eta 3 -coordination mode in the first transition state. Oxidative addition of the C-F bond is exothermic at both nickel and platinum, but the barrier is significantly higher for the heavier element as a result of strong 5 dpi-ppi repulsions in the transition state. Similar repulsive interactions lead to a relatively long Pt-F bond with a lower stretching frequency in the oxidative addition product. Activation of the C-H bond is, in contrast, exothermic only for the platinum complex. We conclude that the nickel system is better suited to selective C-F bond activation than its platinum analogue for two reasons: the strong thermodynamic preference for C-F over C-H bond activation and the relatively low kinetic barrier...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} divalent, monovalent, and <b>zerovalent</b> <b>nickel</b> {{complexes}} {{supported by the}} electron-releasing, monoanionic tris(phosphino) borate ligands [PhBP_ 3] and [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3] ([PhBP_ 3] = [PhB(CH_ 2 PPh_ 2) _ 3]-, [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3] = [PhB(CH_ 2 PiPr_ 2) _ 3]-) have been synthesized to explore fundamental aspects of their coordination chemistry. The pseudotetrahedral, divalent halide complexes [PhBP_ 3]NiCl (1), [PhBP_ 3]NiI (2), and [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]NiCl (3) were prepared by the metalation of [PhBP_ 3]Tl or [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Tl with (Ph_ 3 P) _ 2 NiCl_ 2, NiI_ 2, and (DME) NiCl_ 2 (DME = 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane), respectively. Complex 1 is a versatile precursor {{to a series of}} complexes accessible via substitution reactions including [PhBP_ 3]Ni(N_ 3) (4), [PhBP_ 3]Ni(OSiPh_ 3) (5), [PhBP_ 3]Ni(O-p-tBu-Ph) (6), and [PhBP_ 3]Ni(S-p-tBu-Ph) (7). Complexes 2 − 5 and 7 have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and are pseudotetrahedral monomers in the solid state. Complex 1 reacts readily with oxygen to form the four-electron-oxidation product, {[PhB(CH_ 2 P(O) Ph_ 2) _ 2 (CH_ 2 PPh_ 2) ]NiCl} (8 A or 8 B), which features a solid-state structure that is dependent on its method of crystallization. Chemical reduction of 1 using Na/Hg or other potential 1 -electron reductants generates a product that arises from partial ligand degradation, [PhBP_ 3]Ni(η^ 2 -CH_ 2 PPh_ 2) (9). The more sterically hindered chloride 3 reacts with Li(dbabh) (Hdbabh = 2, 3 : 5, 6 -dibenzo- 7 -azabicyclo[2. 2. 1]hepta- 2, 5 -diene) to provide the three-coordinate complex [κ^ 2 -PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Ni(dbabh) (11), also characterized by XRD. Chemical reduction of complex 1 in the presence of L-type donors produces the tetrahedral Ni(I) complexes [PhBP_ 3]Ni(PPh_ 3) (12) and [PhBP 3]Ni(CNtBu) (13). Reduction of 3 following the addition of PMe_ 3 or tert-butyl isocyanide affords the Ni(I) complexes [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Ni(PMe_ 3) (14) and [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Ni(CN^tBu) (15), respectively. The reactivity of these [PhBP_ 3]Ni^IL and [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]NiI^L complexes with respect to oxidative group transfer reactions from organic azides and diazoalkanes is discussed. The zerovalent nitrosyl complex [PhBP_ 3]Ni(NO) (16) is prepared by the reaction of 1 with excess NO or by treating 12 with stoichiometric NO. The anionic Ni(0) complexes [[κ^ 2 -PhBP_ 3]Ni(CO) _ 2][^nBu_ 4 N] (17) and [[κ^ 2 -PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Ni(CO) _ 2][ASN] (18) (ASN = 5 -azoniaspiro[4. 4]nonane) have been prepared by reacting [PhBP_ 3]Tl or [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Tl with (Ph_ 3 P) _ 2 Ni(CO) _ 2 in the presence of R_ 4 NBr. The photolysis of 17 appears to generate a new species consistent with a zerovalent monocarbonyl complex which we tentatively assign as {[PhBP_ 3]Ni(CO) }{^nBu_ 4 N}, although complete characterization of this complex has been difficult. Finally, theoretical DFT calculations are presented for the hypothetical low spin complexes [PhBP_ 3]Ni(N^tBu), [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Ni(N^tBu), [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Ni(NMe), and [PhBP^(iPr) _ 3]Ni(N) to consider what role electronic structure factors might play with respect to the relative stability of these species...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this work two nanoparticle-enzyme (NP-enzyme) systems were designed: one for medical and one for {{industrial}} applications. The first is the NP-DAAO system that, developed for cancer therapy purpose, combines the magnetic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles (γ-Fe 2 O 3 NPs) with those of the H 2 O 2 generating enzyme D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) in order to target the system near to the cancer and once there, to induce a local toxicity able to kill the surrounding tumor cells. The second NP-enzyme system is the NP-LASPO and finds application in the industrial field. This NP-system, composed by magnetic Fe 3 O 4 NPs conjugated to L-aspartate oxidase (LASPO), allows the resolution of a racemic mixture of D, L-aspartate offering many advantages such as the possibility to recover and reuse the system once the reaction in the bioreactor is over but also to obtain pure end-products without the enzyme contamination.
