50|$|In 1938, the {{brothers}} invented <b>Zyglo</b> and Magnaglo, two flaw-detection processes that used fluorescent dyes. The dyes penetrate defects in machined parts, allowing the defects to be detected by inspecting the parts under black light. (Magnaglo {{was based on}} a preceding process of magnetic particle inspection that detects flaws in ferromagnetic materials. Because Magnaglo uses fluorescence instead of magnetism, the process can be used on non-ferromagnetic materials.) After a dispute with Continental Lithograph over the rights to <b>Zyglo</b> and Magnaglo, {{the brothers}} established the independent Switzer Brothers, Inc., in 1946 to continue developing and marketing new uses for fluorescent materials. The company changed its name to Day-Glo Color Corp. in 1969.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, DayGlo {{products}} were extensively {{used by the}} U.S. military in applications where visibility was required. U.S. ground troops in North Africa identified themselves using daylight fluorescent fabric panels to prevent friendly fire bombings by pilots, and DayGlo paints were used on aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. Navy air carriers used DayGlo's black light fluorescent paints to allow planes to land at night, an advantage that enemy pilots did not have. Military equipment manufacturers, particularly those of aircraft parts, employed DayGlo's <b>Zyglo</b> and Magnaglo processes to identify defects in metal fabricated parts.After the war, daylight fluorescent paints were used by advertisers to make their products more visible to consumers. Tide detergent became known for its fluorescent packaging beginning in 1959, but other products such as clothing, posters and hula hoops also used daylight fluorescent colors. Daylight fluorescent pigments were also used across safety applications such as construction cones, street signs and safety vests, due to their high visibility.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} provide an advanced-temperature nickel-base alloy with properties suitable for aircraft turbine blades {{as well as for}} possible space vehicle applications. An entire series of alloys that do not require vacuum melting techniques and that generally provide good stress-rupture and impact properties was evolved. The basic-alloy composition of 79 percent nickel, 8 percent molybdenum, 6 percent chromium, 6 percent aluminum, and 1 percent zirconium was modified by a series of element additions such as carbon, titanium, and boron, with the nickel content adjusted to account for the additives. Stress-rupture, impact, and swage tests were made with all the alloys. The strongest composition (basic alloy plus 1. 5 percent titanium plus 0. 125 percent carbon) displayed 384 - and 574 -hour stress-rupture lives at 1800 F and 15, 000 psi in the as-cast and homogenized conditions, respectively. All the alloys investigated demonstrated good impact resistance. Several could not be broken in a low-capacity Izod impact tester and, on this basis, all compared favorably with several high-strength high-temperature alloys. Swaging cracks were encountered with all the alloys. In several cases, however, these cracks were slight and could be detected only by <b>zyglo</b> examination. Some of these compositions may become amenable to hot working on further development. On the basis of the properties indicated, it appears that several of the alloys evolved, particularly the 1. 5 percent titanium plus 0. 125 percent carbon basic-alloy modification, could be used for advanced- temperature turbine blades, as well as for possible space vehicle applications...|$|E
