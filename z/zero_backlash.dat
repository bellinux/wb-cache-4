5000|$|Backlash is {{the error}} in motion {{that occurs when}} gears change direction. It exists because there is always some gap between the {{trailing}} face of the driving tooth and the leading face of the tooth behind it on the driven gear, and that gap must be closed before force can be transferred in the new direction. The term [...] "backlash" [...] {{can also be used}} to refer to the size of the gap, not just the phenomenon it causes; thus, one could speak of a pair of gears as having, for example, [...] "0.1 mm of backlash." [...] A pair of gears could be designed to have <b>zero</b> <b>backlash,</b> but this would presuppose perfection in manufacturing, uniform thermal expansion characteristics throughout the system, and no lubricant. Therefore, gear pairs are designed to have some backlash. It is usually provided by reducing the tooth thickness of each gear by half the desired gap distance. In the case of a large gear and a small pinion, however, the backlash is usually taken entirely off the gear and the pinion is given full sized teeth. Backlash can also be provided by moving the gears further apart. The backlash of a gear train equals the sum of the backlash of each pair of gears, so in long trains backlash can become a problem.|$|E

40|$|Wire capstan drives {{are used}} as rotary {{transmission}} elements for their very low (nominally <b>zero)</b> <b>backlash</b> and high stiffness properties. To obtain high stiffness, the cable is typically wrapped around the input and output drum in a figure-eight pattern multiple times. This stiffness can be determined by analyzing the amount of deformation between the cable and the drums and the friction caused by this contact. In product literature and various textbooks [1][2][3], it was noticed that different methods of determining the stiffness of the transmission drive were presented depending how friction was considered. It is found the model which considers the extension from the external torque and preload force matches experimental data {{along with the other}} model that defined the area of traction to act in a certain section of the drum.

A novel transmission for speed reduction, Speed-o-Cam, is currently under research at McGill University's Centre for Intelligent Machines (CIM). The transmission {{is based on the}} layout of pure-rolling indexing cam mechanisms, and hence, eliminates backlash and friction.

The use of very small electronic and electro-optical components {{in a variety}} of consumer and investment goods is leading to an increasing demand for small-scale servo actuators for microassembly applications in production equipment. The previous generation of micro gears and micro actuators was not suited to this type of application, because of unacceptable accuracy. The Micro Harmonic Drive ® gear was introduced into the market in 2001 as the world’s smallest backlash-free micro gear. It is manufactured using a modified LIGA process, called Direct-LIG. This allows the cost-effective production of extremely precise metallic gear components.

One of the key areas of research is that of telerobotics for space station assembly and maintenance. Initial implementation will be teleoperated, but long-term plans call for autonomous robotics. One of the essential components for making this transition successful is the manipulator joints mechanism. Historically, teleoperated manipulators and industrial robotics have had very different mechanisms for force transmission. This is because the design objectives are almost mutually exclusive. A teleoperator must have very low friction and inertia to minimize operator fatigue; backlash and stiffness are of secondary concern. A robot, however, must have minimum backlash, and high stiffness for accurate and rapid positioning.

40|$|Harmonic drive motors {{are widely}} used in {{precision}} control systems due to several advantages such as <b>zero</b> <b>backlash,</b> high gear ratio, compact size and light weight. However, the combination of friction and flexibility in harmonic drives often limits the performance in positioning applications when using conventional control methods.

In this thesis, a new control approach using impulse inputs is developed to improve the resolution of harmonic drive motors. The main objective is to achieve maximum resolution in the presence of high friction levels. A model capable of predicting the impulse response of harmonic drive motors is developed and used to guide the development of an optimal impulse waveform that is robust to parameter variations. The optimal input is then used in the development of an adaptive impulse control method. The performance of the approach is verified with extensive simulations and experiments. Use of the impulse control method demonstrates that the resolution of harmonic drive motors can be increased by more than an order of magnitude.
