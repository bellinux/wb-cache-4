5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has <b>zero</b> <b>effect,</b> the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E

That year, he also starred in several dramas, including <b>Zero</b> <b>Effect,</b> Your Friends & Neighbors, and Permanent Midnight. Stiller was invited {{to take part in}} hosting the Music Video awards, for which he developed a parody of the Backstreet Boys and performed a sketch with his father, commenting on his current career. In 1999, Stiller starred in three films, including Mystery Men, where he played a superhero wannabe called Mr. Furious. He returned to directing with a new television series for Fox titled Heat Vision and Jack, starring Jack Black; however, the show was not picked up by Fox after its pilot episode and the series was cancelled.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants {{may often}} do types {{of work that}} natives are largely unwilling to do, {{contributing}} to greater economic prosperity for {{the economy as a}} whole: for instance, Mexican migrant workers taking up manual farm work in the United States has close to <b>zero</b> <b>effect</b> on native employment in that occupation, which means that the effect of Mexican workers on U.S. employment outside farm work was therefore most likely positive, since they raised overall economic productivity. Research indicates that immigrants are more likely to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants' lower English language ability and educational attainment. Further, some studies indicate that higher ethnic concentration in metropolitan areas is positively related to the probability of self-employment of immigrants.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} announcing future {{institutional}} change is investigated {{in three different}} contexts: a gains frame, a loss frame, and a loss frame with risk. The institutional change is {{the transition from a}} normal public goods game into a threshold public goods game. Announcements may change subject behaviour, through influencing their expectations, before the implementation of the new institution (adjustment effect) and/or after the implementation (adaptation effect). We find that announcements in the gains frame cause <b>zero</b> adjustment <b>effects</b> and negative adaptation effects; while announcements in the loss frame cause positive adjustment and adaptation effects. However, including risk into the threshold phase of the loss frame causes the announcements to have <b>zero</b> <b>effects.</b> These results have important implications for the climate change debate...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Repeatability of {{experiments}} {{is an important}} criterion of modern research and a major challenge for homeopathic basic research. There {{is a lack of}} a recent overview about basic research studies in high homeopathic potencies that have been subjected to laboratory-internal, multicenter or independent repetition trials. Methods: We considered biochemical, immunological, botanical, cell biological and zoological studies on high potencies, i. e. beyond a dilution of 10 - 23. Main sources of information were reviews, personal contact with members of the homeopathic basic research community, and the MEDLINE and HOMBREX databases. Studies were extracted from the publications and grouped into models. Studies were further sorted according to repetition type (laboratory-internal, multicenter, or independent) and results achieved. Results: A total of 107 studies have been found. From these, 30 were initial studies. In the attempt to reproduce one of these initial studies, 53 follow up studies yielded comparable effects (35 laboratory-internal, 8 multicenter, 10 independent repetitions), eight studies showed a consistent, yet different result from the initial study (2 laboratory-internal, 2 multicenter, 4 independent repetitions), and 16 studies yielded <b>zero</b> <b>effects</b> (5 laboratory-internal, 2 multicenter, 9 independent repetitions). When all repetitive studies are considered, 69 % reported effects comparable to that of the initial study, 10 % different effects, and 21 % <b>zero</b> <b>effects.</b> Independently performed repetition studies reported 44 % comparable effects, 17 % different effects, and 39 % <b>zero</b> <b>effects.</b> Conclusions: We identified 24 experimental models in basic research on high homeopathic potencies, which were repeatedly investigated. 22 models were reproduced with comparable results, 6 models with different results, and repetition showed no results for 15 models. Independent reproductions with either comparable or different results were found for seven models. We encourage further repetition trials of published studies, in order {{to learn more about the}} model systems used and in order to test their repeatabilit...|$|R
