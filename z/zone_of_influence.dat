5|$|In {{an attempt}} to expand his <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> to Nablus, the {{commercial}} center of Palestine and its agriculturally-rich hinterland, Zahir besieged Nablus in late 1771. By then, Zahir had secured an alliance with the powerful Jarrar clan, who were incensed at Uthman Pasha's assignment of Mustafa Bey Tuqan as the collector of the miri (hajj pilgrimage tax). Nablus was under the de facto control of the Tuqan and Nimr clans, local rivals of the Jarrars. The loss of Jaffa and Bani Sa'b stripped Nablus of its sea access. Nablus was defended by 12,000 mostly peasant riflemen under Nimr and Tuqan commanders. After nine days of clashes, Zahir decided to withdraw and avoid a costly stalemate. As he departed Nablus, his forces raided many of the city's satellite villages, from which its peasant defenders originated.|$|E

25|$|Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni {{arrived in}} Jerusalem {{with the intent}} to {{surround}} and besiege its Jewish community. He moved to Surif, a village to the southwest of Jerusalem, with his supporters—around a hundred fighters who were trained in Syria before the war and who served as officers in his army, Jihad al-Muqadas, or Army of the Holy War. He was joined by a hundred or so young villagers and Arab veterans of the British Army. His militia soon had several thousand men, and it moved its training quarters to Bir Zeit, a town near Ramallah. Its <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> extended up to Lydda and Ramleh, where Hasan Salama—a veteran of the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine—commanded 1,000 men and coordinated, with al-Husayni, a plan of disruption and harassment of road traffic.|$|E
25|$|The British goal {{in these}} {{negotiations}} with France was {{to ensure that}} a weaker power (Spain) held the strategic coast opposite Gibraltar in return for Britain ceding all interest in Morocco. France began negotiating with Spain at once, but the offer of 1902 was no longer on the table. Since France had given up her ambitions in Ottoman Libya in a convention with Italy in 1903, she felt entitled to a greater share of Morocco. On 3 October 1904, France and Spain concluded a treaty that defined their precise zones. Spain received a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> consisting of a northern strip of territory and a southern strip. The northern strip did not reach to the border of French Algeria, nor did it include Tangier, soon to be internationalized. The southern strip represented the southernmost part of Morocco as recognized by the European powers: the territory to its south, Saguia el-Hamra, was recognized by France as an exclusively Spanish zone. The treaty also recognized the Spanish enclave of Ifni and delimited its borders.|$|E

25|$|The Cairo Conference of March 1921 was convened by Winston Churchill, then Britain's Colonial Secretary. With the {{mandates}} of Palestine and Iraq {{awarded to}} Britain, Churchill wished {{to consult with}} Middle East experts. At his request, Gertrude Bell, Sir Percy Cox, T. E. Lawrence, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, Sir Arnold T. Wilson, Iraqi minister of war Jaʿfar alAskari, Iraqi minister of finance Sasun Effendi (Sasson Heskayl), and others gathered in Cairo, Egypt. An additional outstanding question was the policy to be adopted in Transjordan to prevent anti-French military actions from being launched within the allied British <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> The Hashemites were Associated Powers during the war, and a peaceful solution was urgently needed. The two most significant decisions of the conference were to offer the throne of Iraq to Emir Faisal ibn Hussein (who became Faisal I of Iraq) and an emirate of Transjordan (now Jordan) to his brother Abdullah ibn Hussein (who became Abdullah I of Jordan). The conference provided the political blueprint for British administration in both Iraq and Transjordan, and in offering these two regions to the sons of Sharif Hussein ibn Ali of the Hedjaz, Churchill stated that the spirit, if not the letter, of Britain's wartime promises to the Arabs might be fulfilled. After further discussions between Churchill and Abdullah in Jerusalem, it was mutually agreed that Transjordan was accepted into the mandatory area as an Arab country apart from Palestine {{with the proviso that}} it would be, initially for six months, under the nominal rule of the Emir Abdullah and that it would not form part of the Jewish national home to be established west of the River Jordan.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1820s, the United States deemed two matters {{untoward}} interference by European powers in its <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> [...] The {{first was the}} Russian Ukase of 1821, asserting exclusive territorial and trading rights along {{much of what is}} today Canada's Pacific coast. [...] The United States considered this area {{to be part of the}} Oregon Country and hoped to eventually gain control of it. [...] The second was possible European threats against the Latin American nations, newly independent from Spain. [...] United States officials feared that a Quadruple Alliance of Prussia, Austria, Russia, and France would restore Spain to power in the Americas.|$|E
500|$|During {{planning}} stages, the 1942 {{operation was}} known as [...] "Anvil", to complement Operation Sledgehammer, {{at that time the}} code name for the invasion of Normandy. Subsequently, both plans were renamed, Sledgehammer becoming Operation Overlord, and Anvil becoming Operation Dragoon. The original idea of an invasion of Southern France had come from General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff already in 1942. It was supported at the Tehran Conference in late 1943 by Joseph Stalin, who, in discussions with Franklin D. Roosevelt, advocated for it as an inherent part of Overlord, preferring to have the Allies in the far west instead of an alternative landing in the Balkans as he considered them to be in his <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence.</b> Marshall insisted that it be included in the strategic planning, and Roosevelt found it unpalatable to cancel the operation.|$|E

The boundary between the two <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> each selected pair of sulci stands for a gyrus seed. A second diagram yields the gyrus parcellation.

500|$|In {{a meeting}} with German {{military}} leaders on 3 February 1933, Hitler spoke of [...] "conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation" [...] as his ultimate foreign policy objectives. In March, Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von Bülow, secretary at the Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office), issued a statement of major foreign policy aims: Anschluss with Austria, the restoration of Germany's national borders of 1914, rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles, {{the return of the}} former German colonies in Africa, and a German <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> in Eastern Europe. Hitler found Bülow's goals to be too modest. In speeches during this period, he stressed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements. At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933, Hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the Brazilian Cabinet could not reach {{agreement}} {{as to how to}} address the danger posed by Rosas. Some ministers advocated seeking a peaceful resolution at any cost. These feared Brazil was unprepared for war and that a defeat would lead to a situation similar to the chaos following the loss of Cisplatine in the 1820s, which ended in abdication by Dom Pedro I, the Emperor's father. Other ministers took the position that only a military response would eliminate the threat. In 1849, however, Paulino José Soares de Sousa, a member of the pro-war faction and later Viscount of Uruguai, was chosen as the new minister of Foreign Affairs. Soares made clear his intent to deal with Argentina without foreign assistance, announcing that the [...] "Imperial Government does not desire or judge convenient an alliance with France or any other European nation related to the matters in the Platine region. It understands that they must be resolved by the nations which [...] are closely connected with... It will not admit European influence over America."

500|$|At {{this point}} the Orkneyinga Saga once again becomes {{the main source of}} {{information}} about the north. In 990 Sigurd the Stout, Earl of Orkney took control of the Hebrides, and placed a jarl called Gilli in charge. By 1004 the isles' independence had been re-asserted under Gofraid's son Ragnal mac Gofraid, who died in that year. It is possible their rule overlapped, with Gilli's <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> to the north and Ragnal's to the south. On Ragnal's death Sigurd re-asserted control, which he held until his death at the Battle of Clontarf after which the islands may have been held by Håkon Eiriksson. According to the Welsh text Historia Grufudd vab Kenan Olaf Sigtryggsson is recorded as having been king {{of a wide variety of}} places on his death in 1034. These included the Isle of Man, [...] "many of the other islands of Denmark", Galloway, the Rhinns, and Anglesey. Olaf was an Uí Ímair dynast and it is difficult to reconcile his rule with that of the Norwegians who apparently came before and after him according to the sagas. There is also an obscure reference in The Prophecy of Berchán hinting that King Máel Coluim mac Cináeda of Scotland may have been active in Islay and Arran at about this time, emphasising the potentially fluid nature of Scandinavian, Norse-Gael and Scots influence during this period.|$|E
50|$|Several of the Aegean issues {{deal with}} the {{delimitation}} <b>of</b> both countries' <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> {{in the air and}} on the sea around their respective territories. These issues owe their virulence to a geographical peculiarity of the Aegean sea and its territories. While the mainland coasts of Greece and Turkey bordering the Aegean Sea on both sides represent roughly equal shares of its total coastline, the overwhelming number of the many Aegean islands belong to Greece. In particular, there is a chain of Greek islands lined up along the Turkish west coast (Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and the Dodecanese islands), partly in very close proximity to the mainland. Their existence blocks Turkey from extending any <b>of</b> its <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> beyond a few nautical miles off its coastline. As the breadth of maritime and areal <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>influence,</b> such as the territorial waters and national airspace, are measured from the nearest territory of the state in question, including its islands, any possible extension <b>of</b> such <b>zones</b> would necessarily benefit Greece much more than Turkey proportionally.|$|R

Although French arms helped to keep Biafra in action for the final 15 months of the civil war, its involvement was seen as insufficient and counterproductive.
