50|$|The next part {{constructed}} the C ring starting from aldehyde 26, which was extended by one carbon atom to homologue 27 in a Wittig reaction with Methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine (Scheme 3). The acetonide group was removed by dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium iodide in dioxane and one hydroxyl {{group in the}} resulting diol 28 was protected as the triethylsilyl ether (TES) 29 with the corresponding silyl chloride and pyridine enabling oxidation of the remaining hydroxyl group to the ketone 30 with the Dess-Martin periodinane. Reaction with Eschenmoser's salt placed a methylene group (C20 in the Taxol framework) in the alpha position of the aldehyde to 31 and the next reaction introduced (the still lacking) C6 and C7 as the Grignard reagent of allyl bromide in a nucleophilic addition aided by <b>zinc(II)</b> <b>chloride,</b> which blocked the Grignard from attack on carbonate group, to alcohol 32. The newly formed alcohol was protected as the BOM ether 33 with BOMCl and N,N-diisopropylethylamine. After removal of the TES protecting group with ammonium fluoride, the carbonate group in 34 was converted to a hydroxybenzoate group by action of phenyllithium and the secondary alcohol to the acetate 35 by in situ reaction with acetic anhydride and DMAP. In the next step the acyloin group had its positions swapped by reaction with triazabicyclodecene (other amine bases fail) forming 36 and in the final steps ring closure of ring C was accomplished by ozonolysis at the allyl group to 37 and Aldol reaction with 4-pyrrolidinopyridine to 38.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and {{study of the}} anion recognition properties {{of a variety of}} synthetic organic and inorganic receptors. A series of known anion receptors containing a common urea and varying alkyl and aryl substituents have been investigated for their ability to bind the alkylcarbamate portion of two alkylammonium-alkylcarbamate salts and the CO 2 adduct of a cyclic amidine, in an investigation into novel CO 2 fixation strategies. Chemical shift changes were used to observe relative binding strengths for interactions between the alkylcarbamate and the receptors in DMSO-d 6. The results show {{that it is possible to}} bind the alkylcarbamate anion in the presence of the primary alkylammonium cation, when a receptor of sufficient strength is employed. The strength of this interaction was increased when 18 -crown- 6 was added, which acts as a receptor for the alkylammonium cation. The CO 2 adduct of the cyclic amidine, (1, 4, 5, 6, tetrahydropyrimidine) was shown to have the strongest interactions with the receptor series. Several Schiff-base and urea containing receptors have been synthesised and assessed for anion complexation properties in solution using 1 H NMR in DMSO-d 6 : water mixtures. These are selective for acetate, benzoate and dihydrogen phosphate over chloride and hydrogen sulfate, and exhibit a mixture of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1, (guest:host), binding stoichiometries in several cases. <b>Zinc(II)</b> and cobalt(II) <b>chloride</b> complexes of one of this series were synthesised.

40|$|Zinc {{and copper}} are trace {{elements}} essential for proper folding, stabilization and catalytic activity of many metalloenzymes in living organisms. However, disturbed zinc and copper homeostasis is reported in {{many types of}} cancer. We have previously demonstrated that copper complexes induced proteasome inhibition and apoptosis in cultured human cancer cells. In the current study we hypothesized that zinc complexes could also inhibit the proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity responsible for subsequent apoptosis induction. We first showed that <b>zinc(II)</b> <b>chloride</b> was able to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of a purified 20 S proteasome with an IC(50) value of 13. 8 mu M, which was less potent than copper(II) chloride (IC 50 5. 3 mu M). We then compared the potencies of a pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PyDT) -zinc(II) complex and a PyDT-copper(II) complex to inhibit cellular proteasomal activity, suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in various human breast and prostate cancer cell lines. Consistently, zinc complex was less potent than copper complex in inhibiting the proteasome and inducing apoptosis. Additionally, zinc and copper complexes appear to use somewhat different mechanisms to kill tumor cells. Zinc complexes were able to activate calpain-, but not caspase- 3 -dependent pathway, while copper complexes were able to induce activation of both proteases. Furthermore, the potencies of these PyDT-metal complexes depend {{on the nature of}} metals and also on the ratio of PyDT to the metal ion within the complex, which probably affects their stability and availability for interacting with and inhibiting the proteasome in tumor cell...|$|E

Eighty percent of the world’s energy consumption is generated from fossil fuels and this is unlikely to change in the short and medium term inevitably leading to energy shortfalls. The CO 2 -less energy of nuclear fuel shows strong potential to meet the future energy demands. However economic, politic and environmental requirements mean that the nuclear industry must adapt its current technology and present fuel usage. A pyroelectrochemical reprocessing system utilising liquid cathode technology could provide an efficient and secure reprocessing cycle essential for reduction in volume and toxicity of nuclear waste and extension of natural nuclear resources. The electrochemistry of aqueous copper(II) and <b>zinc(II)</b> <b>chloride</b> was studied upon a liquid mercury cathode using cyclic voltammetry. Bulk deposition of the Cu upon the liquid mercury cathode was studied using both amperometry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. The surface deposits formed by copper deposition upon the mercury liquid cathode were analysed using x-ray powder diffraction and determined to be the rare naturally occurring mineral Belendorffite, Cu 7 Hg 6. Electrochemical diagnostics for surface deposition upon the mercury liquid cathode surface were investigated as a potential analogue system for high temperature liquid cathode systems. Bulk deposition investigation of lanthanum upon the high temperature bismuth system demonstrated transfer of EIS diagnostics for surface growth, with the system demonstrating a similarity to the zinc-mercury ambient system.
