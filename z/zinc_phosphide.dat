25|$|Several {{desirable}} control methods are currently ineffective for various reasons. <b>Zinc</b> <b>phosphide</b> {{is the only}} rodenticide currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet sure how many nontarget species are susceptible to <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide,</b> but birds and rabbits {{have been known to}} die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement.|$|E
25|$|For farm use, pellets of {{aluminium}} phosphide, calcium phosphide, or <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide</b> release phosphine upon contact with atmospheric water or rodents' stomach acid. These pellets also contain agents {{to reduce the}} potential for ignition or explosion of the released phosphine. A more recent alternative {{is the use of}} phosphine gas itself which requires dilution with either CO2 or N2 or even air to bring it below the flammability point. Use of the gas avoids the issues related with the solid residues left by metal phosphide and results in faster, more efficient control of the target pests.|$|E

500|$|Zinc {{deficiency}} {{appears to}} be the most common micronutrient deficiency in crop plants; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. [...] Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia. [...] Substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is added to the soil primarily through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (<b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide),</b> limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.|$|E
2500|$|Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) is {{one method}} of determining environmental impacts from PV. Many {{studies have been}} done on the various types of PV including first generation, second generation, and third generation.

2500|$|Two new {{promising}} {{thin film}} technologies are copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4 or CZTS), <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide</b> (Zn3P2) and single-walled carbon nano-tubes (SWCNT). These thin films are currently only {{produced in the}} lab but may be commercialized in the future. The manufacturing of CZTS and (Zn3P2) processes {{are expected to be}} similar to those of current thin film technologies of CIGS and CdTe, respectively. While the absorber layer of SWCNT PV is expected to be synthesized with CoMoCAT method. by [...] Contrary to established thin films such as CIGS and CdTe, CZTS, [...] Zn3P2, and SWCNT PVs are made from earth abundant, nontoxic materials and have the potential to produce more electricity annually than the current worldwide consumption. While CZTS and Zn3P2 offer good promise for these reasons, the specific environmental implications of their commercial production are not yet known. Global warming potential of CZTS and Zn3P2 were found 38 and 30 grams CO2-eq/kWh while their corresponding EPBT were found 1.85 and 0.78 years, respectively. Overall, CdTe and Zn3P2 have similar environmental impacts but can slightly outperform CIGS and CZTS. Celik et al. performed the first LCA study on environmental impacts of SWCNT PVs, including a laboratory-made 1% efficient device and an aspirational 28% efficient four-cell tandem device and interpreted the results by using mono-Si as a reference point. the results show that compared to monocrystalline Si (mono-Si), the environmental impacts from 1% SWCNT was ∼18 times higher due mainly to the short lifetime of three years. However, even with the same short lifetime, the 28% cell had lower environmental impacts than mono-Si.|$|E

The injection seed source {{can be either}} a continuous wave 3. 39 m laser or a tunable near-infrared OPO laser, which provides wide wavelength tuning capability. The injection seeded ZGP OPO narrows the idler wavelength linewidth to less than 1 nm, limited by the measurement resolution of the monochromator.

40|$|<b>Zinc</b> {{germanium}} <b>phosphide</b> crystals about 20 mm× 90 mm {{were grown}} by using Bridgman techniques.

The infrared absorption properties were studied according to the experimental and theoretical data. The results show that the transmitted intensity gradually increased from top to bottom of ZGP crystals, which is caused by the inhomogeneous distribution of different kinds of intrinsic point defect. The absorption spectra of donor defects and acceptor defect  in ZGP crystals are calculated theoretically. It is found that the influence of acceptor defect  on absorption spectra is stronger than that of donor defect...|$|R
5000|$|Researchers at the University of Alberta have {{successfully}} synthesized colloidal <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide,</b> {{and are the}} first to do so. Before, researchers were able to create efficient solar cells from bulk <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide,</b> but their fabrication required temperatures greater than 850 C or complicated vacuum deposition methods.

50|$|Metal phosphides {{have been}} used as a means of killing rodents and are {{considered}} single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1-3 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide)</b> is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic phosphine gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide</b> baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of <b>zinc</b> <b>phosphide</b> bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents, that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait {{for a week or two}} (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2-4 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily).|$|E
