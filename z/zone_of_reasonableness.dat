40|$|Reasonableness is {{a common}} topic in the Philosophy for Children (P 4 C) literature. Nevertheless some {{important}} aspects regarding the inter-relationship among reasonableness, emotion and community of inquiry has not been theoretically addressed. Our thesis is that the emergence <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> depends on the way emotions are fostered as crucial for the ethos {{of the community of}} inquiry because they {{play an important role in}} promoting the self-corrective and regulative aspects of thinking. We shows that just as thinking about thinking helps us to modify, correct and refine the activity of thinking for the continual growth <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> in a community, so emotions about emotions help to modify, correct and refine the way we feel for deepening the sense <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> Thus, in the context of a community of philosophical inquiry, the growth <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> can be acknowledged in self-evaluating moments because it enables participants to pay attention and regulate meta-emotions. This allows the community to foster deeper and more rigorous inquiry (cognition) and to acknowledge it (metacognition), turning thinking, feeling, acting and being like a community into a shared deliberate activity. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{reports the}} {{preliminary}} {{results of a}} content analysis of the use and functions <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> in the New York Times editorial page from 1860 - 2004. We begin by setting out several reasons why we should devote our critical attention to the concept <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> We then justify our choice of the New York Times editorial page and describe our sample and analytic method. The body of the paper reports three results. First, the primary meanings of the concept are detailed. These include prudence, rationality, fairness, and appropriateness. Second, a distinction between an epistemic and a non-epistemic function of the concept was found in both the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data. Moreover, {{we found that the}} vast majority of the editorials employ the non-epistemic function [...] a fact that we argue has significant consequences for argumentation theory. Finally, we found that the topoi <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> primarily concern the legitimacy of applications of social and political power. We conclude that to explicate the meanings and functions <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> is to explicate the rhetoric of power in libera...|$|R

In order to justify political liberalism through a public justification that averts the risk of falling into a dilemma, it is important to establish in advance which are the epistemic constraints that should be respected.

40|$|In her {{recently}} published book, Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom, Cynthia Lee weaves together {{an array of}} case narratives {{to argue that the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> in self-defense and provocation cases allows majority culture defendants to benefit from jurors 2 ̆ 7 deeply ingrained biases. She makes her case by drawing from three categories of cases: men who claim they were provoked to kill by female infidelity; gay panic cases, in which heterosexual defendants claim self-defense or provocation from unwanted homosexual advances; and racialized fear cases, in which white defendants claim self-defense to justify the killing of victims of color. Lee argues that the role <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> in the law of criminal defenses permits the majority culture defendants in these cases to benefit from unspoken juror biases that render male jealousy, heterosexual protectiveness, and white fears of people of color understandable. Lee 2 ̆ 7 s reassessment <b>of</b> the <b>reasonableness</b> requirement launches primarily from her concern about this inequity. Having identified her primary concern, Lee devotes the bulk of her book to the development of three reforms. First, she argues that jurors should be required to apply a normative concept <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> in addition to an empirical one, focusing not only on what most individuals might have believed or done in the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s situation, but also on what an individual ought to have believed or done. Second, she maintains that jurors should evaluate the <b>reasonableness</b> <b>of</b> not only the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs, but also his actions. Finally, and most interestingly, Lee encourages a trial practice of switching, in which jurors would be asked to switch the races, genders, and sexual orientations of the parties involved in the case in order to expose any hidden biases. In this review, I attempt to situate Lee 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations within the broader debates in current criminal law scholarship between rule-based and standard-based defenses and between objective and subjective standards for judging claims <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> Situating her analysis within the broader literature on criminal defenses, I recharacterize her recommendation that jurors evaluate the <b>reasonableness</b> <b>of</b> both the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs and his conduct as a call for criminal defenses defined by flexible standards, rather than by imperfect rules intended to reflect those standards. Only when defenses have resorted to imperfect rules has it created the potential for defendants who believed reasonably, but behaved unreasonably, to avoid criminal liability. I then turn to Lee 2 ̆ 7 s suggestion of using switching and attempt to discern its implications for the broader dichotomy between subjective and objective standards <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> The standard story here juxtaposes an objective standard <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> with a so-called subjective one in which jurors evaluate the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s reasonableness by comparing him to a hypothetical reasonable person sharing all of the individual defendant 2 ̆ 7 s relevant character traits. Although the battered woman has been depicted as the poster child of subjectivity, Lee adds a new dimension to this traditional dichotomy by suggesting that it is not battered women but, rather, white, heterosexual men who are most able to manipulate the concept <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> by invoking dominant cultural norms. Although Lee sees switching as a way to neutralize stereotypes in the cases that concern her, I see it more broadly as a method of implementing an objective, contextualized standard <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> in which jurors would compare the defendant to a hypothetical neutral reasonable person - without gender, race, or sexual orientation - in the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s situation. By tackling their intuitive responses to switching exercises, jurors conjuring a neutral reasonable person in the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s shoes might best be able to isolate the relevant, objective circumstances that should properly contextualize the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s situation, a task that has troubled courts and scholars since the emergence of the battered woman self-defense cases...|$|R

40|$|This book {{examines}} {{the influence of}} masculinity, heterosexuality, and race norms on the reasonableness requirement in two criminal law defenses: the doctrine of provocation and the defense of self-defense. I argue that certain defendants are better able than others to bolster their claims <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> by relying on dominant social norms and illustrate this point by examining three types of cases: (1) female infidelity killings, (2) gay panic killings, and (3) racialized self-defense cases (both private claims of self-defense and police use of deadly force against persons of color). Even though these three types of cases may seem completely unconnected at first glance, they are linked by the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on social norms to bolster his (or her) claim <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness.</b> I offer three proposals for reform. My first proposal is theoretical - {{rather than relying on}} a positivist conception <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> (or one that focuses on what the average or typical person would have believed or done), I suggest we ought to also utilize a normative conception <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness</b> (or one that focuses on what actions ought to be considered reasonable). To implement this normative conception <b>of</b> <b>reasonableness,</b> I offer a practical reform: a race-switching (or gender-switching or sexual orientation-switching) jury instruction. Upon a motion by the prosecutor or defense attorney or if the judge sua sponte thinks it appropriate, the judge would instruct jurors that they may switch the races (or genders or sexual orientation) of the defendant and victim and determine whether they would come to a different result after switching. If so, then jurors may wish to reconsider the case with the knowledge that they may have been relying upon racial stereotypes (or masculinity or heterosexuality norms) the first time around. Finally, I offer a doctrinal reform that raises the bar for all defendants claiming provocation or self-defense which is really just a clarification of existing law in the case of self-defense. In contrast to the current focus on <b>reasonableness</b> <b>of</b> beliefs and emotions, this reform (which I call the Act-Belief Distinction) would require the jury to find that both the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs (or emotions) and his or her acts were reasonable...|$|R
