5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys {{have a wide}} range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in nuclear reactors. Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as <b>zircaloy)</b> is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{internal}} components and fuel assembly cladding are made from <b>zircaloy</b> because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately , <b>zircaloy</b> is inert. However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, zirconium metal can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas. The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction. In addition, <b>zircaloy</b> can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.|$|E
25|$|Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into <b>Zircaloy</b> tubes that are bundled together. The <b>Zircaloy</b> tubes are about 1cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted through the top directly into the fuel bundle. The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in 235U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel {{that can lead to}} corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The <b>Zircaloy</b> tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.|$|E
5000|$|Cladding {{for nuclear}} reactor fuels consumes about 1% of the {{zirconium}} supply, {{mainly in the}} form of <b>zircaloys.</b> The desired properties of these alloys are a low neutron-capture cross-section and resistance to corrosion under normal service conditions. [...] Efficient methods for removing the hafnium impurities were developed to serve this purpose.|$|R
40|$|High {{strain rate}} tensile loading {{behaviours}} of <b>Zircaloys</b> subjected to various treatments were investigated {{at room temperature}} and at 300 °C, and {{compared with those of}} static cases.

5000|$|Whereas {{there is}} no {{consensus}} on whether zirconium and zirconium alloy have the same oxidation rate, <b>Zircaloys</b> 2 and 4 do behave very similarly in this respect. Oxidation occurs at the same rate in air or in water and proceeds in ambient condition or in high vacuum. A sub-micrometer thin layer of zirconium dioxide is rapidly formed in the surface and stops the further diffusion of oxygen to the bulk and the subsequent oxidation. The dependence of oxidation rate R on temperature and pressure can be expressed as ...|$|R

25|$|The {{first phase}} lasted only several seconds, with {{temperatures}} locally exceeding 2600°C, when a zirconium-uranium-oxide melt formed from {{no more than}} 30% of the core. Examination of a hot particle showed a formation of Zr-U-O and UOx-Zr phases; the 0.9mm thick niobium <b>zircaloy</b> cladding formed successive layers of UOx, UOx+Zr, Zr-U-O, metallic Zr(O), and zirconium dioxide. These phases were found individually or together in the hot particles dispersed from the core.|$|E
25|$|Cladding is {{the outer}} {{layer of the}} fuel rods, {{standing}} between the coolant and the nuclear fuel. It is made of a corrosion-resistant material with low absorption cross section for thermal neutrons, usually <b>Zircaloy</b> or steel in modern constructions, or magnesium with small amount of aluminium and other metals for the now-obsolete Magnox reactors. Cladding prevents radioactive fission fragments from escaping the fuel into the coolant and contaminating it.|$|E

5000|$|Dislocation loops {{are formed}} if {{vacancies}} form clusters on a lattice plane. If these vacancy concentration expand in three dimensions, a void forms. By definition, voids are under vacuum, but may became gas-filled {{in the case}} of alpha-particle radiation (helium) or if the gas is produced as a result of transmutation reactions. The void is then called a bubble, and leads to dimensional instability (swelling) of parts subject to radiation. Swelling presents a major long-term design problem, especially in reactor components made out of stainless steel. Alloys with crystallographic isotropy, such as <b>Zircaloys</b> are subject to the creation of dislocation loops, but do not exhibit void formation. Instead, the loops form on particular lattice planes, and can lead to irradiation-induced growth, a phenomenon distinct from swelling, but that can also produce significant dimensional changes in an alloy.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{diffusion}} rate of hydrogen in zirconium oxides {{comes into play}} in both the steam oxidation and the hydriding of zirconium alloys. In view of the low measured uptake and diffusion of neutral hydrogen species in zirconium oxides, {{it has been suggested}} that the measured rates of hydrogen uptake in <b>zircaloys</b> exposed to high-temperature steam can be explained by the diffusion of protons through the surface oxide layers. This paper investigates the diffusion of protons in tetragonal zirconia at 1500 K using density functional theory-based molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. An average value of 4 × 10 − 9 /m 2 s− 1 is calculated for the {{diffusion rate}}, which, considering the contrived basis of the simulations, compares qualitatively with the value of 3. 2 × 10 − 10 /m 2 s− 1 obtained by fit to experimentally-determined diffusivities of hydrogen in yttrium-stabilized zirconia.

25|$|In Reactors 1, 2, and 3, {{overheating}} {{caused a}} reaction between {{the water and}} the <b>zircaloy,</b> creating hydrogen gas. On 12 March, an explosion in Unit 1 was caused by the ignition of the hydrogen, destroying {{the upper part of the}} building. On 14 March, a similar explosion occurred in the Reactor 3 building, blowing off the roof and injuring eleven people. On the 15th, there was an explosion in the Reactor 4 building due to a shared vent pipe with Reactor 3.|$|E
25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion. Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel because of falling water levels exposing <b>zircaloy</b> structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen, with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the containment building. When the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in {{the air of the}} secondary containment building, an ignition source such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, blowing out the walls of this building from the inside.|$|E
25|$|During a meltdown, the {{temperature}} of the fuel rods increases and they can deform, in the case of <b>Zircaloy</b> cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the fuel rods ruptures the control rod cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of <b>zircaloy</b> oxidized. Hydrogen embrittlement may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged fuel rods. Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of control rod cladding. At 1800°C (3,272 °F), the cladding oxides melt and begin to flow. At 2700–2800°C (4,892-5,072 °F) the uranium oxide fuel rods melt and the reactor core structure and geometry collapses. This can occur at lower temperatures if a eutectic uranium oxide-zirconium composition is formed. At that point, the corium is virtually free of volatile constituents that are not chemically bound, resulting in correspondingly lower heat production (by about 25%) as the volatile isotopes relocate.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{chemical}} characterization of metallic alloys and oxides is conventionally {{carried out by}} wet chemical analytical methods and/or instrumental methods. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) is capable of analyzing samples nondestructively. As {{a part of a}} chemical quality control exercise, <b>Zircaloys</b> 2 and 4, nimonic alloy, and zirconium oxide samples were analyzed by two INAA methods. The samples of alloys and oxides were also analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and direct current Arc OES methods, respectively, for quality assurance purposes. The samples are important in various fields including nuclear technology. Methods: Samples were neutron irradiated using nuclear reactors, and the radioactive assay was carried out using high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. Major to trace mass fractions were determined using both relative and internal monostandard (IM) NAA methods as well as OES methods. Results: In the case of alloys, compositional analyses as well as concentrations of some trace elements were determined, whereas in the case of zirconium oxides, six trace elements were determined. For method validation, British Chemical Standard (BCS) -certified reference material 310 / 1 (a nimonic alloy) was analyzed using both relative INAA and IM-NAA methods.

25|$|Zirconium from <b>zircaloy,</b> {{together}} with other metals, reacts with water and produces zirconium dioxide and hydrogen. The production of hydrogen is a major danger in reactor accidents. The balance between oxidizing and reducing chemical environments {{and the proportion of}} water and hydrogen influences the formation of chemical compounds. Variations in the volatility of core materials influence the ratio of released elements to unreleased elements. For instance, in an inert atmosphere, the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods releases almost only cadmium. In the presence of water, the indium forms volatile indium(I) oxide and indium(I) hydroxide, which can evaporate and form an aerosol of indium(III) oxide. The indium oxidation is inhibited by a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, resulting in lower indium releases. Caesium and iodine from the fission products that can react to produce volatile caesium iodide, which condenses as an aerosol.|$|E
25|$|After almost 80minutes of slow {{temperature}} rise, {{the primary}} loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to cavitate as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, {{and it was}} believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the <b>Zircaloy</b> nuclear fuel rod cladding, yielding zirconium dioxide, hydrogen, and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} {{the concrete and}} the corium melt. Free and chemically bound water is released from the concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the corium mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the corium and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the corium. The oxide phase, in which the nonvolatile fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten <b>zircaloy,</b> iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of zirconium dioxide and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the corium penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the metal layer is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete. Decomposition of concrete and volatilization of the alkali metal compounds consumes {{a substantial amount of}} heat.|$|E

A typical PWR has fuel assemblies of 200 to 300 rods each, and a large reactor would have about 150–250 such assemblies with 80–100 tonnes of uranium in all.
