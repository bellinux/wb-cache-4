After 6 weeks salmon {{were transferred to}} a salt water seapen and exposed to infection with Lepeophtheirus salmonis for 14 weeks. Zinc treatment resulted in some physiological changes consistent with increased stress, such as decreased leukocrit values, and increased plasma cortisol levels. Plasma glucose levels were significantly elevated in fish previously treated with zinc, but this was only evident after fish {{had been in a}} seapen, 14 weeks subsequent to treatment. Improved conversion of tetraiodothyronine to triiodothyronine, as well as no changes in interrenal cell nuclear diameters suggested that overall stress effects were low. Fish exposed to 200 ppb and 400 ppb zinc showed gill pathology. Infection intensity with L. salmonis was significantly higher on salmon previously exposed to 400 ppb zinc.

It has been shown that the amount of Cu and Zn ions released from CuO and ZnO are almost negligible to cause phytotoxicity to plants. Plants grown with nanoparticles showed increased accumulation of Cu and Zn (20 fold Cu and 24 fold Zn) which altered root metabolism in wheat plants.

Desorption of the Zn was minimal from both microplastics and soil in synthetic soil solution (0. 01 M CaCl 2), but in synthetic earthworm guts desorption was higher from microplastics (40 – 60 %) than soil (2 – 15 %), suggesting microplastics could increase Zn bioavailability.

40|$|Phytochelatin synthases (PCS, EC 2. 3. 2. 15) are cytosolic enzymes, constitutively {{expressed}} in the genome of different organisms including Schizosaccharomyces pombe (1), Caenorhabditis elegans (2, 3), algae and plants (4). PCS have been explicitly studied {{with respect to their}} role and mechanism of action towards heavy metal detoxification (e. g. essential heavy metals such <b>as</b> <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> <b>as</b> well as toxic such as cadmium (Cd) (5). Based on studies of Arabidopsis thaliana phytochelatin synthase 1 (AtPCS 1), it is recognized that PCS catalyse the formation of thiol rich oligomers, phytochelatins (PCs), from glutathione (GSH) and related thiols in the presence of metal ions (6). Moreover: i) AtPCS 1 is involved in the catabolism of GSH-conjugates (7); ii) AtPCS 1 is required for pathogen-triggered callose deposition (8); iii) its mRNA is upregulated by a mimic of eubacterial flagellin (8); iv) AtPCS 1 expression might be not upregulated by heavy metal toxicity (9), but its transcript abundance in roots increases by deficiency of the micronutrient iron (Fe) (10); v) physiological (homeostatic) Fe concentrations activate the in vitro activity of PCS even in basal land plants (11). The main goal {{of this study was to}} determine the AtPCS 1 -driven response towards Fe deficiency and to establish whether and how AtPCS 1 is involved in Fe homeostasis. To do so, we compared the growth, Fe concentration, and the expression of Fe transporter genes in roots and shoots of the A. thaliana cad 1 - 3 mutant lacking functional AtPCS 1 and transgenic plants overexpressing AtPCS 1 (AtPCS 1 -OE) vs. wild-type, all grown either under Fe-sufficient or deficient conditions. We found that the cad 1 - 3 mutant accumulated less Fe in roots and was significantly more sensitive to Fe deficiency than wild-type plants. By contrast, AtPCS 1 -OE lines were more tolerant to Fe deficiency than cad 1 - 3 and wild-type plants. These results were consistent with the expression of Fe transporter genes in different plant lines. A mechanistic model of the role of AtPCS 1 in Fe homeostasis will be proposed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Summary: For {{the last}} several decades, {{antimicrobial}} compounds {{have been used to}} promote piglet growth at weaning through the prevention of subclinical and clinical disease. There are, however, increasing concerns in relation to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and the potential of these and associated resistance genes to impact on human health. As a consequence, European Union (EU) banned the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in swine and livestock production on 1 January 2006. Furthermore, minerals such <b>as</b> <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> and copper (Cu) are not feasible alternatives/replacements to antibiotics because their excretion is a possible threat to the environment.

40|$|Cuscuta sp., known {{with the}} common name of "dodder", is an obligate {{parasite}} capable of invading stems and leaves {{of a wide range}} of host plants. Dodder stem usually coils counterclockwise around the host and, within a few days, develops haustorial structures at each point of contact. As soon as dodder haustoria reach host vascular bundles, they start tapping water, photosynthates and minerals. Metal ions such <b>as</b> <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> and copper (Cu) are essential for dodder growth and metabolism, although an exceedingly high (over-homeostatic) supply of these micronutrients can result in growth inhibition and cellular toxicity. Even more so. non-essential metals such as cadmium (Cd), if transferred from the host to the parasite, need to be neutralized by timely detoxification mechanisms. In this work, we showed that Cuscuta campestris Yuncker establishes effective haustorial connections with leaf petioles and blades of Daucus carota L (carrot), with the consequent transfer of Cd and essential metals (such <b>as</b> <b>Zn</b> and Cu) from the host vascular bundles to the parasite. Following up to this point, we detected the presence in the parasite of significant amounts of glutathione and phytochelatins, even in the absence of Cd exposure. This suggests that thiol peptides in dodder might be particularly important for Zn and Cu homeostasis as well as for Cd detoxification. Finally, we demonstrated that dodder is capable of synthesizing phytochelatins on its own, rather than massively importing them from the host, and also provided evidence for the existence of an endogenous, constitutively expressed, dodder's phytochelatin synthase...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Formation of arbuscular mycorrhizas {{can enhance}} plant uptake of {{immobile}} nutrients such <b>as</b> <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> and phosphorus (P). Enhancement of Zn uptake by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on Zn-deficient soils {{has been studied}} previously, however, the quantity of Zn that is contributed by the AM pathway of uptake to the plant has not previously been reported for soil of any Zn status. METHODS We grew a mycorrhiza-defective mutant tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) genotype (rmc) and its mycorrhizal wild-type progenitor (76 R) in pots containing a hyphal compartment (HC) accessible only by the external hyphae of AM fungi, and containing the radioisotope 65 Zn. This was repeated at three soil Zn concentrations, ranging from low to high. We estimated the amount of Zn delivered via both the AM and direct (root) pathways. RESULTS Up to 24 % of Zn in the shoots of the AM plants was delivered via the AM pathway at the lowest soil Zn treatment. This decreased significantly, to 8 %, <b>as</b> soil <b>Zn</b> concentration increased. No 65 Zn was detected in the tissues of the non-mycorrhizal genotype.

40|$|A {{manganese}} dioxide (MnO 2) cathode with <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> <b>as</b> the anode {{has been investigated}} using lithium sulphate (Li 2 SO 4) as an electrolyte. Previously we demonstrated that cells comprising MnO 2 and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as an electrolyte can be made rechargeable to over one-electron capacity with a discharge capacity of 150 mAh g- 1. Here we have extended our work to assess Li 2 SO 4 as an electrolyte and {{have found that the}} battery is not rechargeable. Based on the electrochemical (discharge/charge) performance and the products formed following discharge and charge, the mechanism proposed for the sulphate-based media is one of proton insertion into the MnO 2 cathode, rather than the lithium ion insertion observed for the LiOH electrolyte. The addition of bismuth species to the Li 2 SO 4 - based cell results in a transition to rechargeable behaviour. This is believed to be due to the influence of Bi ions on the formation of soluble Mn 3 + soluble intermediates. However, the coulombic efficiency of the cell diminishes rapidly with repeated charge/discharge cycles.

The observation of Zn-Co substitution in this high-latitude member of the Prymnesiophyceae class, coupled with similar previous observations in the coccolithophore Emiliana huxleyi and several centric diatoms, suggests that Zn-Co substitution could be a widespread global phenomenon in eukaryotic phytoplankton. The Zn-Co biochemical substitution seen in Phaeocystis might be the result of evolutionary pressure for maintaining growth rates in high export environments in which rapid depletion of Zn, Co, and carbon occur simultaneously in the upper water column.

40|$|Cereals such as wheat {{serve as}} staples {{for a large}} {{proportion}} of the world’s population. However, they contain relatively low concentrations of essential micronutrients such <b>as</b> <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> in their edible tissues. This is a major issue for human nutrition and food security. The process of Zn uptake and partitioning in plants is highly controlled, with systems present for sensing and responding to Zn status. In the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two transcription factors, bZIP 19 and bZIP 23, are thought to act <b>as</b> <b>Zn</b> sensors mediating the increased expression of Zn membrane transporters, ZIPs (Zrt/Irt-like proteins), in response to low Zn status. In this thesis the identification and characterisation of homologous bZIP transcription factors and ZIP transporters in wheat are described. TabZIP sequence analysis confirmed the presence of motifs characteristic to the F-group of bZIP transcription factors. Expression of these wheat bZIPs in an Atbzip 19 bzip 23 line showed a conservation of function between the Arabidopsis and wheat group F bZIPs. A key question is whether the wheat bZIP transcription factors and ZIP transporters are regulated by Zn. Gene-expression analysis indicated that the wheat transcription factors TabZIP 1, 3 a, 3 b, 4 & 5, and the wheat ZIP transporters, TaZIP 1, 4, 5, 6 & 7 are induced by Zn-deficient conditions. The Zn-transport capability of TaZIP 1, 5, 6, 7 & 8 was confirmed using heterologous yeast expression. Additionally, the binding ability of TabZIPs to regulatory-elements in the promoters of TaZIPs was demonstrated. This links TabZIPs and TaZIPs in the Zn-regulatory mechanism of wheat. This research has identified key genes involved in the regulation, uptake and distribution of Zn in wheat. The molecular mechanisms elucidated will be important in the development of Zn biofortified wheat varieties as well as cultivars which maintain high yield in Zn-deficient conditions. These may prove vital in achieving global food security. </p...|$|R

Using confocal synchrotron radiation micro X-ray fluorescence analysis, we characterized the spatial distribution of Zn in high-grade sclerosing osteosarcoma of nine patients (four women/five men; seven knee/one humerus/one femur) following chemotherapy and wide surgical resection. Levels were compared with adjacent normal tissue. Quantitative backscattered electron imaging as well as histological examinations was also performed. On average, the ratio of medians of Zn count rates (normalized to calcium) in mineralized tumor tissue was about six times higher than in normal tissue. There was no difference in Zn levels between tumor fraction areas with a low fraction and a high fraction of mineralized tissue, which were clearly depicted using quantitative backscattered electron imaging. Moreover, we found no correlation between the Zn values and the type of tumor regression according to the Salzer-Kuntschik grading. The underlying mechanism of Zn accumulation remains unclear.

Nutrient solution experiments were conducted to examine the root uptake and root-to-shoot translocation of 65 Zn in seedlings precultured with different N supplies. In additional experiments, the effect of varied N nutrition on retranslocation of foliar-applied 65 Zn was tested at both the vegetative and generative stages. When N supply was increased, the 65 Zn uptake by roots was enhanced by up to threefold and the 65 Zn translocation from roots to shoots increased by up to eightfold, while plant growth was affected to a much smaller degree. Retranslocation of 65 Zn from old into young leaves and from flag leaves to grains also showed marked positive responses to increasing N supply. The results demonstrate that the N-nutritional status of wheat affects major steps in the route of Zn from the growth medium to the grain, including its uptake, xylem transport and remobilization via phloem. Thus, N is a critical player in the uptake and accumulation of Zn in plants, which deserves special attention in biofortification of food crops with Zn...|$|R

Validation of the developed BLM using 17 media with different pH, hardness, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content resulted in a significant correlation coefficient (R- 2 = 0. 76) between predicted and observed 48 -h EC 50. Eighty-eight percent of the predictions were within a factor of 1. 3 of the observed 48 -h EC 50...|$|R
40|$|Background: Serum {{level of}} several trace {{elements}} such <b>as</b> <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> and manganese (Mn) levels are altered in type 2 DM and its deficiencies {{are associated with}} the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Objective: To assess the serum zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) levelsin subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, Dhaka Medical College, Dhaka from July 2014 to June 2015. Fifty type 2 diabetic subjects with age ranging from 40 to 55 years of both sexes were study group and 50 age, sex and BMI matched healthy subjects were control group. Patients were selected from Bangladesh Institute of Research for Diabetic Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM) General Hospital, Dhaka. Serum Zn and Mn levels were estimated by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry. For statistical analysis, unpaired student’s‘t’ test and chi square test was performed. Results: In this study, mean serum zinc and manganese levels were significantly (P< 0. 001) lower in the study group than that of control group. In addition, hypozincemia in 36 % and hypomanganesemia in 18 % of diabetic patients were observed and which was significantly (p< 0. 001) higher than those of control. Conclusion:From this study, it may be concluded that serum zinc and manganese deficiencies may develop as diabetes related complications...|$|R
40|$|The Sedum alfredii Hance hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) has {{the ability}} to hyperaccumulate cadmium (Cd), <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> and lead (Pb) in {{above-ground}} tissues. Although many physiological studies have been conducted with these plants, the molecular mechanisms underlying their hyper-tolerance to heavy metals are largely unknown. Here we report on the generation of 9. 4 gigabases of adaptor-trimmed raw sequences and the assembly of 57, 162 transcript contigs in S. alfredii Hance (HE) shoots by the combination of Roche 454 and Illumina/Solexa deep sequencing technologies. We also have functionally annotated the transcriptome and analyzed the transcriptome changes upon Cd hyperaccumulation in S. alfredii Hance (HE) shoots. There are 110 contigs and 123 contigs that were up-regulated (Fold Change ≥ 2. 0) and down-regulated (Fold Change </= 0. 5) by chronic Cd treatment in S. alfredii Hance (HE) at q-value cutoff of 0. 005, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR was employed to compare gene expression patterns between S. alfredii Hance (HE) and non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE). Our results demonstrated that several genes involved in cell wall modification, metal translocation and remobilization were more induced or constitutively expressed at higher levels in HE shoots than that in NHE shoots in response to Cd exposure. Together, our study provides large-scale expressed sequence information and genome-wide transcriptome profiling of Cd responses in S. alfredii Hance (HE) shoots...|$|R
40|$|Coral reef {{communities}} {{contain a}} wide variety of mutualistic associations none more important than the relationship between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium sp., commonly referred to as zooxanthellae. The function of <b>Zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> <b>as</b> cofactor of several enzyme systems such as extracellular carbonic anhydrase (extracellular CA) which catalyzes the interconversion of HCO 3 - and CO 2. Concentrations of dissolved Zn in oligothropic waters are often very low therefore may limit the growth of zooxanthellae and their ability to fix CO 2 from seawater via the carbonic anhydrase. The aim of this research is to investigate the effect of various concentrations of Zn on the growth and extracellular CA activity in zooxanthellae. Cell density was monitored daily by enumeration with hemocytometer-type chamber (0. 1 mm). Extracellular CA was measured in homogenized intact whole cell by a pH drift assay. Results revealed that Zn status strongly influences the growth rate and extracelullar CA activity in zooxanthellae. The specific growth rate and cell density increased two-fold whilst extracelullar CA activity increased 10. 5 times higher than that in control with increasing concentrations of Zn from 0 to 80 nM, but decreased when Zn was over 80 nM. Under a concentration of 80 nM was not Zn limited culture, consequently the growth rate of zooxanthellae not dependent on CO 2 concentration yet offset by extracelullar CA activity...|$|R
40|$|Tributyltin (TBT), an aqueous biocide {{derived from}} {{antifouling}} paint pollution, {{is known to}} have impacted coastal marine ecosystems, and has been reported in the sediment of the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, a network of rivers and shallow lakes in eastern England. In the marine environment, the 1987 TBT ban has resulted in expanded use of alternative biocides, raising the question of whether these products too have impacted the Broads ecosystem and freshwaters in general. Here we examine the lake sediment record in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads for contamination by copper (Cu) (as an active biocide agent) and <b>zinc</b> (<b>Zn)</b> (<b>as</b> a component of booster biocides), to assess their occurrence and potential for causing environmental harm in freshwater ecosystems. We find that, after the introduction of leisure boating, there is a statistically significant difference in Cu enrichment between heavily and lightly boated sites, while no such difference exists prior to this time. At the heavily boated sites the onset of Cu enrichment coincides with a period of rapid increase in leisure boating. Such enrichment is maintained to the present day, with some evidence of continued increase. We conclude that Cu-based antifouling has measurably contaminated lakes exposed to boating, at concentrations high enough to cause ecological harm. Similar findings can be expected at other boated freshwater ecosystems elsewhere in the world...|$|R
