50|$|An {{example of}} such a {{simulation}} is the Boids program created by Craig Reynolds in 1986. Another is the Self Propelled Particle model. Many current models use variations on these rules. For instance, many models implement these three rules through layered zones around each animal. In the zone of repulsion very close to the animal, the focal animal will seek to distance itself from its neighbors in order to avoid a collision. In the slightly further away zone of alignment, a focal animal will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbors. In the outmost <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction,</b> which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal animal will seeks to move towards a neighbor. The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of the animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish, on the other hand, rely on both vision and on hydrodynamic signals relayed through its lateral line. Antarctic krill rely on vision and on hydrodynamic signals relayed through its antennae.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} in aggregations form {{as a result}} of the interplay between costs and benefits experienced by individuals. Such self-organisation of aggregations can be explained using a zonal model in which a short-range zone of repulsion and longer-range <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> surrounding individuals leads to emergent pattern properties. The signal of these processes can be detected using spatial pattern analyses. Furthermore, in sessile organisms, post-settlement mortality reveals the relative costs and benefits of positions within the aggregation. Acorn barnacles are known to require contact with conspecifics for reproduction and are therefore believed to aggregate for this purpose; isolated individuals may also be more susceptible to abiotic stress and predation. At short distances, however, competition for space and resources is likely to occur. In this study spatial patterns of barnacles (Semibalanus balanoides L.) were analysed using pair-correlation functions. Individuals were dispersed at distances below 0. 30 cm, but peak relative density occurred at a distance of 0. 36 cm from conspecifics. This is much closer than required for reproductive access, implying a strong aggregative drive, up to the point of physical contact with neighbours. Nevertheless, analysis of dead barnacles illustrated that such proximity carries a cost as barnacles with many neighbours were more likely to have died. The inferences obtained from these patterns are that barnacles aggregate as closely as they can, and that local neighbourhood competition is a powerful determinant of mortality. These processes give rise to the observed pattern properties...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{two major}} {{works of the}} twentieth century: Marcel Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu and Jean-Luc Godard's Histoire(s) du cinéma. Both of these works explore the expressiveness of their own medium {{in relation to other}} media, thereby opening up diverse channels of sensory experience within their own particular deployment of aesthetic form. In each case, these works draw upon sensory multiplicity in order to develop new ways of conceptualizing the present as well as new ways of generating acts of memory that relate past and present. Most studies of Proust's novel focus on one single medium that becomes a catalyst for the narrator's transformative experience. On the contrary: Proust's text does not make any particular medium the absolute (including the novel's own medium of writing), but develops its own perspective by dramatizing the tensions between multiple regimes of sensuous experience, e. g. between text, music, photography, painting, and optical technologies. Ultimately, the novel shows how any attempt to use one particular medium to capture or master reality fails. Moreover, every act of expression in one medium indexes the partiality of its own opening onto the world, thereby creating a space in which an other medium or an other image of the world becomes possible and desirable. Every particular medium foregrounds the blindspot of other media while simultaneously opening up a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> toward which other media tend. This movement toward other sensuous channels reveals not only the limits of a particular medium, but constitutes the depth of a medium by holding open an inexhaustible reserve of data that it can never fully capture. The text therefore moves in a space that is characterized by a tension between media that seek to totalize their own points of entry into the world and the inexorable detotalization that ensues when these points of entry are revealed to be incomplete, partial, and revisable. Drawing on the models of the kinetoscope and the kaleidoscope in the early pages of A la recherche du temps perdu, the intermedial configuration of the novel points toward its main task for thought: the relation between the one and the multiple. The novel interrogates the very integrity of perception [...] how humans are able to perceive identity in difference and how individuals are the same and yet different over time [...] by drawing upon the multiplicity of forms of individuation across different media. Ultimatley, the act of writing recovers the past not by capturing the essence or fullness of time, but by revealing how the same world is modulated over time in differentiated sensuous forms. Intermediality also lies at the core of Jean-Luc Godard's filmic production. Godard interweaves texts, images and sounds in order to explore the power and limits of cinematic language. Godard's filmic productivity prioritizes showing rather than saying and thereby seeks to vanquish the subordination of the image to forms of narrativization specific to textuality. In Histoire(s) du cinéma, Godard constructs an intermedial space that seems at first glance to aim at a redemption of past moments of suffering and injustice (in particular associated with the Holocaust). However, as in Proust's novel, a double gesture emerges in Godard's film: a movement that oscillates between totalization and detotalization. Whereas cinema aims to represent "everything," Godard continually frustrates this tendency by using intermediality to achieve a radically different goal: video, montage, and formal fragmentation produces an act of memory that is simultaneously an act of dispossession. By refusing a complete or full representation of the past, Godard's film keeps viewers {{in a constant state of}} tension, longing, attentiveness, and ultimately, creativity. For Godard, cinema does not regain time and cannot redeem reality. Cinematic memory is not restorative. Instead, cinema provokes multiple acts of memory that do not merely reproduce that which is gone, but allow latent traces from the past to re-enter human practices and perceptions through the work of art. Working upon the image bestows on the past a new form of existence rather than restoring that which has irrevocably disappeared...|$|E
40|$|General {{accounts}} of global trends in world prehistory {{are dominated by}} narratives of conquest on land: scavenging and hunting of land mammals, migration over land bridges and colonisation of new continents, gathering of plants, domestication, cultivation, and ultimately sustained population growth founded on agricultural surplus. Marine and aquatic resources fit uneasily into this sequence {{of social and economic}} development, and societies strongly dependent on them have often been regarded as relatively late in the sequence, geographically marginal or anomalous. We consider the biases and preconceptions of the ethnographic and archaeological records that have contributed to this view of marginality and examine some current issues focusing on the role of marine resources at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition of northwest Europe. We suggest that pre-existing conventions should be critically re-examined, that coastlines may have played a more significant, widespread and persistent role as <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> for human dispersal, population growth and social interaction than is commonly recognised, and that this has been obscured by hunter-gatherer and farmer stereotypes of prehistoric economies...|$|R

Using the concepts of triangulation, performance and flow, this paper presents a series of experiments designed to shape pedestrian movement patterns in public spaces in different spatial and operation contexts, by eliciting noticeable behaviours and disrupting routine use of space. The hypothesis investigated is that playful, non-obstructive interventions foster a positive social experience yet {{can be used to}} shape pedestrian movement. The interventions examined were around the themes of floor marking and mirrors. Analysis demonstrated that the interventions were able to create <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> and exclusion, engage people’s curiosity and elicit playful actions. Habituation, goal-directed behaviour and the influence of increased cognitive load at personal level were all important factors responsible for reducing the level of engagement with an intervention. The results suggest that increased understanding between environmental and interpersonal stimuli and behavioural responses can provide guidance in using socially acceptable design interventions to influence use of space in different operational contexts, contributing to sustainable security...|$|R
40|$|Social aggregations of {{fish are}} {{extremely}} common in nature. Pitcher (1983) defines a social aggregation of fish as a shoal, {{with a highly}} polarized shoal constituting a school. The ultimate causes of fish shoaling have been extensively studied and are well established, with the main causes being protection from predators and enhanced foraging ability. The proximate mechanisms by which groups are maintained are less well understood. Several models exist that examine these decision rules. A common theme to these models is {{the existence of a}} region at large nearest-neighbour distances (NND), where an individual will move towards its nearest neighbour, and a region of repulsion at small NND, where the individual will move away from its nearest neighbour. Recent models (Gueron et al., 1996; Couzin and Krause, 2003) suggest that shoaling decisions may not be instantaneous, instead being hierarchical as fish assess {{the presence or absence of}} one or more neighbours in <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction,</b> repulsion and neutrality.

40|$|Schools of {{fish and}} flocks of birds are {{examples}} of self-organized animal groups that arise through social interactions among individuals. We numerically study two individual-based models, which recent empirical studies have suggested to explain self-organized group animal behavior: (i) a zone-based model where the group communication topology is determined by finite interacting <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> repulsion, <b>attraction,</b> and orientation among individuals; and (ii) a model where the communication topology is described by Delaunay triangulation, which is defined by each individual’s Voronoi neighbors. The models include a tunable parameter that controls an individual’s relative weighting <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> and alignment. We perform computational experiments to investigate how effectively simulated groups transfer information {{in the form of}} velocity when an individual is perturbed.

40|$|High quality {{magnetic}} nanoparticles (MNPs) {{are used}} in applications such as electronic data storage. Current methods for synthesising the consistent MNPs required use high temperatures, harsh chemicals and bespoke equipment. As this is energy intensive, expensive and not very environmentally friendly, cheaper and „greener‟ alternatives are being sought. Mms 6 is a biomineralisation protein from a magnetic bacterium (Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB- 1), which is able to biotemplate the formation of uniform cubo-octahedral magnetite nanoparticles in vitro under mild reaction conditions. The N-terminal section is hydrophobic, and may cause the protein to self-assemble in aqueous solution. This self-assembly may facilitate the biotemplating ability of the protein, {{but it is the}} acidic C-terminal section of the protein that is the most important for binding iron and templating uniform MNPs. Attachment of Mms 6 via the N-terminus to a micro-contact printed (μCP) patterned self-assembled monolayer (SAM) allows the protein to biotemplate uniform, ferrimagnetic magnetite MNPs in situ. These biotemplated MNPs were investigated with magnetic force microscopy (MFM), which found that they form multi-particle <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>attraction</b> and repulsion. This is likely to be due to exchange-coupling of MNPs on the surface, with the long-axis of these magnetic features running parallel to the long axis of the assembly of patterned nanoparticles. As magnetite is magnetically soft, the system was doped with cobalt to increase the coercivity of the MNPs, both when templated onto a surface and in a bulk solution. To create biotemplated MNPs for use in data storage, a high coercivity is necessary to ensure that the magnetic orientation, and therefore the data recorded, is retained. The work presented here demonstrates that biotemplating can be used to produce high quality magnetic materials under far milder conditions than required in current industrial synthesis techniques, which should allow the development of more environmentally friendly bioinspired devices in the future.

These equations admit complicated wave solutions. The numerical challenges concern: (i) discretisation of a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld; (ii) discretisation of geostrophic boundary conditions combined with no-normal ﬂow at solid walls; (iii) discretisation of the conserved, Hamiltonian dynamics of the inertial-waves; and, (iv) large-scale computational demands owing to the three-dimensional nature of inertial-wave dynamics and possibly its narrow <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> chaotic <b>attraction.</b> These issues have been resolved: (i) by employing Dirac’s method of constrained Hamiltonian dynamics to our DGFEM for linear, compressible ﬂows, thus enforcing the incompressibility constraints; (ii) by enforcing no-normal ﬂow at solid walls in a weak form and geostrophic tangential ﬂow —along the wall; (iii) by applying a symplectic time discretisation; and, (iv) by combining PETSc’s linear algebra routines with our high-level software.

This property of the medial neocortex is temporally regulated with switching from inhibition to attraction within 24 h.

In this manner, interneurons arising from common precursors and sharing common migratory pathways are able to populate different pallial structures...|$|R

Bifurcation and slow-fast analysis give conditions on the parameter space for the establishment of this bi-stability. In the parametric <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> bi-stability, weak-noise amplitudes may strongly inhibit the neuron's spiking activity.
