5|$|Medaka and <b>zebrafish</b> {{are used}} as {{research}} models for studies in genetics and developmental biology. The <b>zebrafish</b> is {{the most commonly used}} laboratory vertebrate, offering the advantages of genetic similarity to mammals, small size, simple environmental needs, transparent larvae permitting non-invasive imaging, plentiful offspring, rapid growth, and the ability to absorb mutagens added to their water.|$|E
5|$|Orthologs of {{the human}} TBR1 gene have been {{identified}} in chimpanzee, dog, cow, rat, mouse, and <b>zebrafish.</b>|$|E
5|$|Animals such as {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila melanogaster, the <b>zebrafish,</b> the chicken and the house mouse, serve {{a major role in}} science as {{experimental}} models, both in fundamental biological research, such as in genetics, and in the development of new medicines, which must be tested exhaustively to demonstrate their safety. Millions of mammals, especially mice and rats, are used in experiments each year.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene. An isoform switch from ssTnI to cTnI occurs during perinatal heart development. ssTnI is not {{expressed in the}} embryonic hearts of Xenopus and <b>zebrafish,</b> while it is expressed in the somites and {{skeletal muscle}}s.|$|E
5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the <b>zebrafish.</b> Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E
5|$|Multifactorial sex {{determination}} occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the darter characine has a ZW multifactorial system where the female {{is determined by}} ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as <b>zebrafish,</b> have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which {{play a role in}} determining sex. Environment-dependent {{sex determination}} has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but PH levels, growth rate, density and social environment may also play a role. For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.|$|E
25|$|In science, one of {{the most}} famous members of the Cypriniformes is the <b>zebrafish</b> (Danio rerio). The <b>zebrafish</b> is {{one of the}} most {{important}} vertebrate model organisms in biological and biochemical sciences, being used in many kinds of experiment. As, during early development, the <b>zebrafish</b> has a nearly transparent body, it is ideal for studying developmental biology. It is also used for the elucidation of biochemical signaling pathways. They are also good pets, but can be shy in bright light and crowded tanks.|$|E
25|$|One puzzling {{aspect of}} shoal {{selection}} {{is how a}} fish can choose to join a shoal of animals similar to themselves, given that it cannot know its own appearance. Experiments with <b>zebrafish</b> have shown that shoal preference is a learned ability, not innate. A <b>zebrafish</b> tends to associate with shoals that resemble shoals {{in which it was}} reared, a form of imprinting.|$|E
25|$|Chromatophores are {{sometimes}} used in applied research. For example, <b>zebrafish</b> larvae {{are used to}} study how chromatophores organise and communicate to accurately generate the regular horizontal striped pattern as seen in adult fish. This {{is seen as a}} useful model system for understanding patterning in the evolutionary developmental biology field. Chromatophore biology has also been used to model human condition or disease, including melanoma and albinism. Recently, the gene responsible for the melanophore-specific golden <b>zebrafish</b> strain, Slc24a5, was shown to have a human equivalent that strongly correlates with skin colour.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>zebrafish</b> the pineal gland {{does not}} {{straddle}} the midline but shows a left-sided bias. In humans, functional cerebral dominance {{is accompanied by}} subtle anatomical asymmetry.|$|E
25|$|One {{particular}} {{species of}} these small and undemanding danionines is the <b>zebrafish</b> (Danio rerio). It has become the standard model species for studying developmental genetics of vertebrates, in particular fish.|$|E
25|$|Whereby {{traditional}} HTS {{drug discovery}} uses purified proteins or intact cells, very interesting recent {{development of the}} technology {{is associated with the}} use of intact living organisms, like the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and <b>zebrafish</b> (Danio rerio).|$|E
25|$|In 2010, a {{drug that}} boosts numbers of blood stem cells, {{originally}} discovered in <b>zebrafish</b> in the Boston Children's Hospital laboratory of Leonard I. Zon, M.D., went to clinical trial in patients with leukemia and lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|The role of Notch {{signaling}} in {{the regulation}} of gut development has been indicated in several reports. Mutations in elements of the Notch signaling pathway affect the earliest intestinal cell fate decisions during <b>zebrafish</b> development. Transcriptional analysis and gain of function experiments revealed that Notch signaling targets Hes1 in the intestine and regulates a binary cell fate decision between adsorptive and secretory cell fates.|$|E
25|$|Over {{time the}} project has {{expanded}} to include additional species (including key model organisms such as mouse, fruitfly and <b>zebrafish)</b> {{as well as a}} wider range of genomic data, including genetic variations and regulatory features. Since April 2009, a sister project, Ensembl Genomes, has extended the scope of Ensembl into invertebrate metazoa, plants, fungi, bacteria, and protists, whilst the original project continues to focus on vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{synthesis}} in evo-devo {{has been in}} the field of animal evolution, one reason being the presence of elegant model systems like Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, <b>zebrafish</b> and Xenopus laevis. However, {{in the past couple of}} decades, a wealth of information on plant morphology, coupled with modern molecular techniques has helped shed light on the conserved and unique developmental patterns in the plant kingdom also.|$|E
25|$|When and how {{multipotent}} chromatophore {{precursor cells}} (called chromatoblasts) develop into their daughter subtypes {{is an area}} of ongoing research. It is known in <b>zebrafish</b> embryos, for example, that by 3 days after fertilization each of the cell classes found in the adult fish—melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores—are already present. Studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that transcription factors such as kit, sox10, and mitf are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation. If these proteins are defective, chromatophores may be regionally or entirely absent, resulting in a leucistic disorder.|$|E
25|$|CYPs {{have been}} {{extensively}} examined in mice, rats, dogs, and less so in <b>zebrafish,</b> {{in order to}} facilitate use of these model organisms in drug discovery and toxicology. Recently CYPs have also been discovered in avian species, in particular turkeys, that {{may turn out to be}} a great model for cancer research in humans. CYP1A5 and CYP3A37 in turkeys were found to be very similar to the human CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 respectively, in terms of their kinetic properties as well as in the metabolism of aflatoxin B1.|$|E
25|$|During the {{segmentation}} of vertebrate embryos, {{waves of}} gene expression sweep across the presomitic mesoderm, the tissue {{from which the}} precursors of the vertebrae (somites) are formed. A new somite is formed upon arrival of a wave at the anterior end of the presomitic mesoderm. In <b>zebrafish,</b> {{it has been shown}} that the shortening of the presomitic mesoderm during segmentation leads to a Doppler effect as the anterior end of the tissue moves into the waves. This Doppler effect contributes to the period of segmentation.|$|E
25|$|An archaic form of {{splicing}} {{preserved in}} <b>Zebrafish</b> {{is known to}} use microsatellite sequences within intronic mRNA {{for the removal of}} introns in the absence of U2AF2 and other splicing machinery. It is theorized that these sequences form highly stable cloverleaf configurations that bring the 3' and 5' intron splice sites into close proximity, effectively replacing the spliceosome. This method of RNA splicing is believed to have diverged from human evolution at the formation of tetrapods and to represent an artifact of an RNA world.|$|E
25|$|Numerous melanocortin, MCH and {{melatonin}} receptors {{have been}} identified in fish and frogs, including a homologue of MC1R, a melanocortin receptor known to regulate skin and hair colour in humans. It has been demonstrated that MC1R is required in <b>zebrafish</b> for dispersion of melanin. Inside the cell, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) {{has been shown to be}} an important second messenger of pigment translocation. Through a mechanism not yet fully understood, cAMP influences other proteins such as protein kinase A to drive molecular motors carrying pigment containing vesicles along both microtubules and microfilaments.|$|E
25|$|Pattern {{formation}} in the morphogenesis of an animal is regulated by genetic induction factors that put cells to work after damage has occurred. Neural cells, for example, express growth-associated proteins, such as GAP-43, tubulin, actin, an array of novel neuropeptides, and cytokines that induce a cellular physiological response to regenerate from the damage. Many of the genes {{that are involved in}} the original development of tissues are reinitialized during the regenerative process. Cells in the primordia of <b>zebrafish</b> fins, for example, express four genes from the homeobox msx family during development and regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Pterois is a genus of venomous marine fish, {{commonly}} known as lionfish, native to the Indo-Pacific. Also called <b>zebrafish,</b> firefish, turkeyfish or butterfly-cod, it is characterized by conspicuous warning coloration with red, white, creamy, or black bands, showy pectoral fins, and venomous spiky fin rays. Pterois radiata, Pterois volitans, and Pterois miles are the most commonly studied species in the genus. Pterois species are popular aquarium fish. P. volitans and P. miles are a recent and significant invasive species in the west Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|Notch {{signaling}} {{is central}} to somitogenesis. In 1995, Notch1 was shown to be important for coordinating the segmentation of somites in mice. Further studies identified the role of Notch signaling in the segmentation clock. These studies hypothesized that the primary function of Notch signaling does not act on an individual cell, but coordinates cell clocks and keep them synchronized. This hypothesis explained the role of Notch signaling {{in the development of}} segmentation and has been supported by experiments in mice and <b>zebrafish.</b> Experiments with Delta1 mutant mice that show abnormal somitogenesis with loss of anterior/posterior polarity suggest that Notch signaling is also necessary for the maintenance of somite borders.|$|E
25|$|For {{partially}} complementary microRNAs to recognise their targets, nucleotides 2–7 of the miRNA (its 'seed region') must {{be perfectly}} complementary. Animal miRNAs inhibit protein {{translation of the}} target mRNA (this is present but less common in plants). Partially complementary microRNAs can also speed up deadenylation, causing mRNAs to be degraded sooner. While degradation of miRNA-targeted mRNA is well documented, whether or not translational repression is accomplished through mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, {{or a combination of}} the two is hotly debated. Recent work on miR-430 in <b>zebrafish,</b> as well as on bantam-miRNA and miR-9 in Drosophila cultured cells, shows that translational repression is caused by the disruption of translation initiation, independent of mRNA deadenylation.|$|E
25|$|The MATP gene {{is highly}} conserved, {{especially}} among mammals. The human MATP gene is 82% {{identical to the}} mouse MATP gene, 79% identical to the rat MATP gene, 35% to the <b>zebrafish</b> version, and 30% identical to the fruitfly MATP gene. The gene is best known in humans as being {{the location of a}} mutation that results in human type IV oculocutaneous albinism (OCA4). Type IV oculocutaneous albinism, like other types of human albinism, results in hypopigmentation of the skin and eyes, with increased rates of skin cancer and reduced visual acuity. None of these effects are associated with the equine cream gene. Other human MATP polymorphisms result in normal pigment variations, specifically fair skin, light eyes, and light hair in Caucasian populations.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{microarray}} {{studies done}} on different fish species exposed to low-oxygen conditions {{have shown that}} at the genetic level fish respond to hypoxia by changing the expression of genes involved in oxygen transport, ATP production, and protein synthesis. In the liver of mudsuckers exposed to hypoxia there were changes in the expression of genes involved in heme metabolism such as hemopexin, heme oxygenase 1, and ferritin. Changes in the sequestration and metabolism of iron may suggest hypoxia induced erythropoiesis and increased demand for hemoglobin synthesis, leading to increased oxygen uptake and transport. Increased expression of myoglobin, which is normally only found in muscle tissue, has also been observed after hypoxia exposure in the gills of <b>zebrafish</b> and in non-muscle tissue of the common carp suggesting increased oxygen transport throughout fish tissues.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in Nature found that hydrogen peroxide {{plays a role in}} the immune system. Scientists found that hydrogen peroxide presence inside cells increased after tissues are damaged in <b>zebrafish,</b> which is thought to act as a signal to white blood cells to converge on the site and initiate the healing process. When the genes required to produce hydrogen peroxide were disabled, white blood cells did not accumulate at the site of damage. The experiments were conducted on fish; however, because fish are genetically similar to humans, the same process is speculated to occur in humans. The study in Nature suggested asthma sufferers have higher levels of hydrogen peroxide in their lungs than healthy people, which could explain why asthma sufferers have inappropriate levels of white blood cells in their lungs.|$|E
25|$|Lancelets, {{which are}} {{primitive}} chordates, possess only one homologue of Drosophila Hh (figure 7). Vertebrates, {{on the other}} hand, have several hedgehog ligands that fall within three subgroups – desert, Indian and sonic, each represented by a single mammalian gene. This is probably {{a consequence of the}} two genome duplications that occurred early in the vertebrate evolutionary history. Two such events would have produced four homologous genes, one of which must have been lost. Desert hedgehogs are the most closely related to Drosophila Hh. Additional gene duplications occurred within some species such as the <b>zebrafish</b> Danio rerio, which has an additional tiggywinkle hedgehog gene in the sonic group. Various vertebrate lineages have adapted hedgehogs to unique developmental processes. For example, a homologue of the X.laevis banded hedgehog is involved in regeneration of the salamander limb.|$|E
25|$|Sleep in fish is not {{extensively}} studied. Typically fish exhibit {{periods of}} inactivity but show no significant reactions to deprivation of this condition. Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because {{of a need}} for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep. There is also doubt about certain blind species that live in caves. Other fish seem to sleep, however. For example, <b>zebrafish,</b> tilapia, tench, brown bullhead, and swell shark become motionless and unresponsive at night (or by day, {{in the case of}} the swell shark); Spanish hogfish and blue-headed wrasse can even be lifted by hand all the way to the surface without evoking a response. A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep. On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care.|$|E
25|$|Segmentation is a {{basic process}} of {{embryogenesis}} occurring in most invertebrates and all vertebrates by which the body is initially divided into functional units. In the segmented regions of the embryo, cells begin to present biochemical and morphological boundaries at which cell behavior is drastically different – vital for future differentiation and function. In the hindbrain, segmentation is a precisely defined process. In the paraxial mesoderm, however, development is a dynamic and adaptive process that adjusts according to posterior body growth. Various Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed in these regions, and, through functional analysis, it has been determined that Eph signaling is crucial for the proper development and maintenance of these segment boundaries. Similar studies conducted in <b>zebrafish</b> have shown similar segmenting processes within the somites containing a striped expression pattern of Eph receptors and their ligands, which is vital to proper segmentation - the disruption of expression resulting in misplaced or even absent boundaries.|$|E
500|$|Studies in the <b>zebrafish</b> Danio rerio {{show that}} TBR1 is highly conserved across species. TBR1 cDNA clones from <b>zebrafish</b> were {{acquired}} by screening a <b>zebrafish</b> embryo using a phosphorus labeled probe. [...] The TBR1 found in <b>zebrafish</b> (zf-TBR1) has 83-97% amino acid identity to orthologs in humans (hu-TBR1), xenopus (x-EOMES), and mice (mu-TBR1). [...] The <b>zebrafish</b> TBR1 is only {{expressed in the}} forebrain, not in {{other regions of the}} <b>zebrafish</b> embryo.|$|E
500|$|<b>Zebrafish</b> {{have three}} types of chromatophores—iridophores, melanophores, and xanthophores—which produce silver, black, and yellow {{pigmentation}} respectively. [...] <b>Zebrafish</b> that lack iridophores [...] are known as roy mutants, those that lack melanophores as albino mutants, and those which lack both melanophores and iridophores are ruby mutants. [...] The gross eye morphology, feeding and swimming behaviours between wild-type and albino <b>zebrafish</b> were indistinguishable, except under dim or bright light or low contrast.|$|E
500|$|Model organisms for {{developmental}} biology include the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the <b>zebrafish</b> Danio rerio, the mouse Mus musculus, and the weed Arabidopsis thaliana. (A model organism is {{a species that}} is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, {{with the expectation that}} discoveries made in that organism provide insight into the workings of other organisms.) ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{estimated}} that the annual use of vertebrate animals—from <b>zebrafish</b> to non-human primates— ranges from tens to more than 100 million. [...] In the European Union, vertebrate species represent 93% of animals used in research, and 11.5 million animals were used there in 2011. By one estimate the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in 2001 was 80 million. [...] Mice, rats, fish, amphibians and reptiles together account for over 85% of research animals.|$|E
500|$|The bowfin genome {{contains}} an intact ParaHox gene cluster, {{similar to the}} bichir and to most other vertebrates. [...] This is in contrast, however, with teleost fishes, which have a fragmented ParaHox cluster, probably because of a whole genome duplication event in their lineage. The presence of an intact ParaHox gene cluster suggests that bowfin ancestors separated from other fishes before the last common ancestor of all teleosts appeared. Bowfin are thus possibly a better model to study vertebrate genome organization than common teleost model organisms such as <b>zebrafish.</b>|$|E
