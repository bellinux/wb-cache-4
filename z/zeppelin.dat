5|$|In 1968, the Stones, {{following}} a suggestion by pianist Ian Stewart, put a control {{room in a}} van and created a mobile recording studio {{so that they would}} not be limited to the standard 9–5 hours most recording studios operated by. The band lent the mobile studio out to other artists, including Led <b>Zeppelin,</b> which used it to record Led <b>Zeppelin</b> III(1970) andLed <b>Zeppelin</b> IV(1971).|$|E
5|$|A {{film of the}} O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was {{released}} on home video on 19 November. The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US, respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed {{that he had been}} remastering the band's discography. The first wave of albums, Led <b>Zeppelin,</b> Led <b>Zeppelin</b> II, and Led <b>Zeppelin</b> III, were released on 2 June 2014. The second wave of albums, Led <b>Zeppelin</b> IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014. Physical Graffiti {{was released}} on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release. The fourth and final wave of albums, Presence, In Through the Out Door, and Coda, were released on 31 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Led <b>Zeppelin</b> took a {{break from}} touring and {{launched}} their own record label, Swan Song, named after an unreleased song. The record label's logo, based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by William Rimmer, features a picture of Apollo. The logo {{can be found on}} Led <b>Zeppelin</b> memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to promote their own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things and Maggie Bell. The label was successful while Led <b>Zeppelin</b> existed, but folded less than three years after they disbanded.|$|E
50|$|On 5 January 1918, {{a fire at}} Ahlhorn {{destroyed}} four of the specialised double sheds {{along with}} four <b>Zeppelins</b> and one Schütte-Lanz. In July 1918, the Tondern Raid conducted by the RAF and Royal Navy, destroyed two <b>Zeppelins</b> in their sheds.|$|R
25|$|The Germans {{maintained}} {{a fleet of}} <b>Zeppelins</b> that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids. The planned raid on Sunderland intended to use <b>Zeppelins</b> {{to watch out for}} the British fleet approaching from the north, which might otherwise surprise the raiders.|$|R
60|$|Probably {{a friend}} of Lady Frensham's, he thought. Still--the idea of <b>Zeppelins</b> over London did seem rather ridiculous to Mr. Britling. He would not {{have liked to have}} been caught talking of it himself.... There never had been <b>Zeppelins</b> over London. They were gas bags....|$|R
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact <b>Zeppelin</b> had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way <b>Zeppelin</b> intended. However, the German high command did not come to expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Royal Flush {{was also}} {{intended}} to support Operation <b>Zeppelin,</b> the 1944 overall deception {{plan for the}} Middle Eastern theatre. <b>Zeppelin</b> developed threats against Greece and Southern France between February and July. Its intention was to tie up German defensive forces in the region {{during the period of}} D-Day.|$|E
5|$|Since 1980, the {{surviving}} members have sporadically collaborated {{and participated in}} one-off reunions, the most successful being the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert, with Jason Bonham taking his late father's place behind the drums. After {{the release of the}} concert film Celebration Day, Page announced the remastering of the band's discography in the form of deluxe editions. The first wave of albums, Led <b>Zeppelin,</b> Led <b>Zeppelin</b> II, and Led <b>Zeppelin</b> III, were released on 2 June 2014. The next two albums, Led <b>Zeppelin</b> IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014. The double album, Physical Graffiti, was released on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the original release. The final three albums, Presence, In Through the Out Door, and Coda, were released on 31 July 2015.|$|E
50|$|The Graf <b>Zeppelins</b> {{original}} length-to-beam {{ratio was}} 9.26:1, {{resulting in a}} slender silhouette. However, in May 1942, the accumulating top-weight of recent design changes required the addition of deep bulges {{to either side of}} Graf <b>Zeppelins</b> hull, decreasing that ratio to 8.33:1 and giving her the widest beam of any carrier designed prior to 1942. The bulges served mainly to improve Graf <b>Zeppelins</b> stability but they also gave her an added degree of anti-torpedo protection and increased her operating range because selected compartments were designed to store approximately 1500 tons more fuel oil.|$|R
50|$|To {{counter the}} {{increasingly}} effective defences new <b>Zeppelins</b> were introduced {{with an increased}} operating altitude of 16500 ft and a ceiling of 21000 ft. The first of these S-class <b>Zeppelins,</b> LZ 91 (L 42) entered service in February 1917. They were basically a modification of the R-class, sacrificing strength and power for improved altitude. The surviving R-class <b>Zeppelins</b> were adapted by removing one of the engines. The improved safety was offset by the extra strain on the airship crews caused by altitude sickness and exposure to extreme cold and operating difficulties caused by cold and unpredictable high winds encountered at altitude.|$|R

5|$|The Rocketeer's {{attack on}} the Nazi <b>Zeppelin</b> was filmed near Six Flags Magic Mountain {{amusement}} park in Valencia, California over four months through pick-ups. Remaining visual effects footage took place at ILM's headquarters in San Rafael and Hamilton Air Force Base. There, they constructed a 12ft scale model of the <b>Zeppelin,</b> which was photographed against matte paintings that resembled 1938 Los Angeles for intercutting purposes. The <b>Zeppelin</b> explosion special effect alone cost $400,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 22 October 1969 on Atlantic Records, with advance orders of 400,000 copies. The advertising campaign was built around the slogans 'Led <b>Zeppelin</b> – The Only Way to Fly' and 'Led <b>Zeppelin</b> II Now Flying'. Commercially, Led <b>Zeppelin</b> II was the band's first album to hit No. 1 in the US, knocking The Beatles' Abbey Road (1969) twice from the top spot, where it remained for seven weeks. By April 1970 it had registered three million American sales, whilst in Britain it enjoyed a 138-week residence on the LP chart, climbing to the top spot in February 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{first attempt}} to bomb the <b>Zeppelin</b> sheds south of Cuxhaven, Germany was on 24 October, but had to be {{cancelled}} because of bad weather. Another was made on 23 November, but it was cancelled when intercepted radio signals revealed that a squadron of armoured cruisers was in their path. The third attempt began on 24 December, with Fearless and eight destroyers from the 1st DF providing close cover for the strike force. The Germans noticed the strike force about 07:30 on the 25th after it had launched its seaplanes north the island of Heligoland. In response, the Germans launched their own aircraft and a <b>Zeppelin</b> to find and attack the British ships; another <b>Zeppelin</b> already airborne was diverted to search for them as well. The British were soon located, but the German attacks by two seaplanes and a <b>Zeppelin</b> were ineffective. Another seaplane attacked Fearless and her half-flotilla without effect and was driven off by the cruiser. After the ships had reached the rendezvous point {{to pick up the}} returning aircraft, they were attacked by another <b>Zeppelin,</b> again without effect.|$|E
50|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the Luftschifftruppe numbered around 20 - 25 <b>zeppelins</b> in service. The Luftschifftruppe began aerial surveillance early on in Belgium and France, but often came under fire by anti-aircraft guns. Because of their slow speed, they were very vulnerable. After three <b>Zeppelins</b> were shot down {{in the first month}} alone, the Luftschiffer were switched to naval surveillance, observing British ship movements, in which capacity they played a decisive role in the Battle of Jutland. Tests were done of dropping bombs from <b>Zeppelins</b> in order to increase their potential. <b>Zeppelins</b> had a typical carrying capacity of almost 9 metric tons, making them useful enough for this operation. Following the Christmas truce, Kaiser Wilhelm II approved of the Luftschifftruppe's bombing of England. On January 19, 1915, the first bombs fell over Britain, when two <b>Zeppelins</b> dropped 50 kg explosives on villages outside Great Yarmouth. Five people died in the first raid; 18 more raids that year would end in almost 900 casualties. Following the terror, the British government began taking measures to stop the bombings. Anti-aircraft guns were set up all over south-eastern England, as well as spotlights for night time.|$|R

5|$|<b>Zeppelin</b> was {{executed}} in five phases between February and July 1944. The story behind each stage developed various invasion threats against Greece, Albania, Croatia, Turkey, Bulgaria and France. The latter {{portions of the}} operation received their own codenames. Vendetta referred to a threat toward Southern France close to D-Day whilst Turpitude was the codename for {{the final stage of}} <b>Zeppelin,</b> an overland threat to Greece and Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Because of Plant's injuries, Led <b>Zeppelin</b> did not tour in 1976. Instead, {{the band}} {{completed}} the concert film The Song Remains the Same {{and the accompanying}} soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led <b>Zeppelin</b> faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Graf <b>Zeppelin</b> {{began on}} 28 December 1936, when her keel was laid {{down at the}} Deutsche Werke {{shipyard}} in Kiel. Named in honor of Graf (Count) Ferdinand von <b>Zeppelin,</b> the ship was launched on 8 December 1938, and was 85% complete by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Graf <b>Zeppelin</b> was not completed and was never operational due to shifting construction priorities necessitated by the war. She remained in the Baltic {{for the duration of}} the war; with Germany's defeat imminent, the ship's custodian crew scuttled her just outside Stettin in March 1945. The Soviet Union raised the ship in March 1946, and she was ultimately sunk in weapons tests north of Poland 17 months later. The wreck was discovered by a Polish survey ship in July 2006.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of their second album, Led <b>Zeppelin</b> {{completed}} several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led <b>Zeppelin</b> concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was {{during this period of}} intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E
50|$|Germany was {{the first}} country to {{organize}} regular air attacks on enemy infrastructure with the Luftstreitkräfte. In World War I, it used its <b>zeppelins</b> (airships) to drop bombs on British cities. At that time, Britain did have aircraft, though her airships were less advanced than the <b>zeppelins</b> and were very rarely used for attacking; instead they were usually used to spy on German U-boats (submarines).|$|R
50|$|The second {{priority}} {{was to create}} a cadre of flyers capable of flying at night and intercepting <b>Zeppelins</b> and to devise ammunition for aeroplanes' guns suitable for attacking <b>Zeppelins.</b> Although workable proposals had been submitted in 1914, these had been rejected and once again in 1915 after successful trials. Fortunately for England the ammunition and flyers were available by 1916 when the Germans launched their air offensive.|$|R

5|$|In July 1940, Graf <b>Zeppelin</b> was towed from Kiel to Gotenhafen (Gdynia) and {{remained}} there {{for nearly a}} year. While there, she {{was used as a}} storage depot for Germany's hardwood supply. Just before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the carrier was again moved, this time to Stettin, to safeguard her from Soviet air attacks. By November, the German army had pushed deep enough into Russian territory to remove any further threat of air attack and Graf <b>Zeppelin</b> was returned to Gotenhafen. There, she was used as a store ship for timber.|$|E
