40|$|Analogue {{modelling}} experiments of thrust-wrench fault {{interference in}} a brittle medium are presented and discussed. Simultaneous reactivation of confining strike-slip and thrust faults bounding a (corner) <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> {{defined by the}} angle between the two fault systems is simulated, instead of previously reported discrete (time and space) superposition of alternating thrust and strike-slip events. The influence of different considered interference angles of 60 °, 90 ° and 120 ° is investigated through comparison between the obtained structural configurations in each case. It is shown that under these conditions a characteristic morpho-structural pattern with a deltoid shape resembling a tie-knot consistently forms in the (corner) zone between the two fault systems. The specific structural configuration of a such tie-knot structure (TKS) varies significantly {{as a function of}} the prescribed fault interference angle, which determines the orientation of the displacement vector shear component (ds→) along the main frontal thrust system, and critically controls the geometry and kinematics of the TKS. Comparison with three natural examples shows remarkable geometric and kinematic similarity, confirming model predictions and suggesting the existence of common underlying dynamic processes governing the specific (TKS) structural configuration of different thrust-wrench fault interference corner-zones in nature...|$|E

In fact, it is {{precisely}} the interference between the two terms of the quantum superposition corresponding to states in which the particle is localized in one of the two slits which implies that the particle is [...] "guided" [...] preferably into the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> constructive <b>interference</b> and cannot end up in a point in the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> destructive <b>interference</b> (in which the wave function is nullified).

30|$|Currently, the {{interference}} elimination mainly includes two aspects, namely pre-coding design at transmitting {{end and the}} signal detection at receiving end, respectively. As for signal detection, it is usually limited by the achievement of channel state information, and it has high-complexity iterative detection process [19, 20]. As for the pre-coding design, CCI suppression can employ the block diagonalization pre-coding algorithm [21 – 24]. However, initially, this algorithm requires the number of transmitting antennas should be greater than {{the total number of}} all users’ receiving antennas, which is difficult to satisfy. At present, some regularized versions of BD-type algorithms can deal with the limitation of the number of transmitting antennas [25, 26], but they are not referred to the application in multi-cell environment. Furthermore, BD algorithm will not take the problems of noise amplification into consideration; thus, it is unrealistic to put it into practice. Therefore, the signal to leakage and noise ratio (SLNR) algorithm proposed by Sadek is chosen to be the criterion of pre-coding design [27]. This algorithm maximizes the ratio of signal over the sum of leakage and noise, decomposes the multi-user MIMO system into multiple collateral and independent single-user MIMO systems, so that it is not restricted by the number of antennas, and gets the pre-coding matrices of each user independently, so the better interference suppression performance and extensive application scenarios can be obtained [28 – 31]. Moreover, {{in order to reduce the}} inter-cell co-channel interference, {{the interference}} alignment technology is adopted in multi-cell MIMO network [32, 33]. Generally, the interference alignment technology designs the interference suppression matrices at receivers and aligns the interference signal to the corresponding zero <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> suppression matrices to suppress the inter-cell co-channel interference. Though the interference alignment technology is helpful to suppress the inter-cell and intra-cell interference as well as enhance the system capacity, it will undoubtedly increase the number <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> suppression matrices at receivers and its corresponding computation complexity.|$|R

50|$|The two {{stations}} are synchronized as a single-frequency network, {{the same way}} a booster station would be. This means that the stations transmit the same audio at exactly the same time, intended to make for a nearly seamless transition for listeners. The main indication is static, most often occurring around southeastern Cobb county, near the Chattahoochee River and the northwestern part of the Perimeter (I-285 around Atlanta). This is due to the two stations being around the same signal strength in this area, and the numerous hills, which causes the relative levels of the two to rapidly oscillate back and forth (picket-fencing) when travelling at freeway speeds. Slower speeds or stationary listening may actually be more difficult, as the listener is stuck in small pockets of poor reception for longer periods. The <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> RF <b>interference</b> moves hourly and daily based on weather and overnight temperature inversions, which affect radio propagation, especially over the longer distance from the main station. The two stations may also have their actual carrier waves synchronized via GPS for further stability, and to avoid phase cancellation, but as a matter of physics it is impossible to avoid the switching caused by FM's capture effect.|$|R

30|$|Identifying {{deployment}} {{parameters for}} HetNets help {{to prevent the}} generation <b>of</b> harmful <b>interference</b> between heterogeneous wireless systems that interact with each other. Interference is considered harmful if it causes disruption in user’s service. In general, examples of deployment parameters for HetNets are [4, 5] primary exclusion <b>zones</b> (radius <b>of</b> protection of a primary receiver/transmitter), transmission power limits on secondary users, number of admitted secondary users, acceptable level <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> in primary receptor, and monitoring time. The deployment parameters depend on the dynamic spectrum access technique (overlay or underlay) that a secondary user performs to exploit a primary band. In the case of deploying a HetNet with spectrum underlay access, it is relevant to set a limit on the transmission power of secondary users, primary exclusion <b>zones,</b> permissible number <b>of</b> secondary users, and acceptable level <b>of</b> <b>interference</b> in the primary receptor. The detection threshold and monitoring time are factors to overlay access mode.

40|$|Around the {{southern}} {{margins of the}} São Francisco Craton, there is a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> tectonic <b>interference</b> between the Brasília belt {{to the west and}} the younger Ribeira belt to the east. U-Pb monazite and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar cooling age determinations carried out in the area reveal the cooling histories of these belts and the timing of tectonic overprint, unraveling the final stages of Brasiliano Orogeny in SE Brazil. The U-Pb monazite data from migmatized paragneisses and late-stage pegmatites in the Socorro-Guaxupé Nappe System of {{the southern}} Brasília belt show that migmatization peaked between ca. 613 ± 1 and 607 ± 3 Ma. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar biotite and muscovite ages of paragneisses and schists in this area indicate that the northern high-grade core of the Nappe System (Guaxupé Domain) was uplifted and cooled through the 350 °C isotherm between 599 ± 1 and 587 ± 1 Ma. In contrast, samples from the southern high-grade core of the Nappe System, the Socorro Domain, south of the Jacutinga shear zone, yields a broader and younger spectrum of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar biotite ages between 571 ± 1 and 562 ± 1 Ma, attributed to a later uplift and cooling of the crust. The cooling ages can be assigned to local resetting of the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar system during transpressive tectonic overprint due to reactivation as a result of collision of the Ribeira belt. A younger group of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar mica ages (537 ± 1 to 521 ± 1 Ma) in schists of the Socorro Domain, are associated with transpressional structures of the Ribeira belt. Rock samples from the Jacutinga and Três Corações shear zones, yield 40 Ar/ 39 Ar biotite-muscovite ages around 520 Ma. These are typical cooling ages of the Ribeira belt, and are interpreted to mark the western limit of the Ribeira belt transpressional regime within the Brasília belt. The youngest biotite-muscovite cooling ages in schists of the Socorro Domain, between 510 ± 2 and 491 ± 1 Ma, mark the final cooling and exhumation of that part of the Brasília belt...|$|R
