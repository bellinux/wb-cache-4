5|$|Quebec is the {{regional}} market leader in Canada, with about 11,000 plug-in electric cars registered , of which, 55% are plug-in hybrids. Registrations {{in the province}} totaled 3,100 units in 2015, representing a market share of 0.7% of new car sales, and 45% of total Canadian plug-in electric car sales that year. In October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec passed a new zero emission vehicle legislation that obliges major automakers selling cars in the Canadian province to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% {{of the total number}} of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A tradable credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties.

25|$|In October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec {{passed a}} new zero {{emission}} vehicle legislation that obliges any carmaker who sells in the Canadian province more than 4,500 new vehicles per year {{over a three-year}} average, to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% {{of the total number}} of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles (ZEV) starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A tradable credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. The quotas will be determined by Quebec's Ministry of Sustainable Development. Quebec became the first Canadian province to pass such legislation, joining ten U.S. states, including California, that have similar ZEV laws. Quebec aims to have 100,000 <b>zero</b> <b>emission</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the road by 2020.

2500|$|Norway offered {{incentives}} to help reach {{the goal of}} 50,000 <b>zero</b> <b>emission</b> <b>vehicles</b> by 2018. Electrics are exempt from all non-recurring vehicle fees, making electric cars price competitive with conventional cars. BEVs are exempt from the annual road tax, public parking fees and toll payments (including domestic ferries), as well as given access to bus lanes. These incentives were to be in effect {{until the end of}} 2017 or until the goal was achieved. PHEVs have a smaller market than BEVs because they are not eligible for the same incentives.
