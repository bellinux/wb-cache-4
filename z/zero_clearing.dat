In one of the experiments made along a line of 5. 2 km, two explosions of 100 and 80 kg in charge amount were fired in the sea and eleven stations were established at about 0. 5 km intervals on the rocks outcropped in East and West Ongul Islands. The other smaller charge experiment was made in East Ongul Island to reveal shallower structure of snow-free area. Five shots were fired and generated seismic waves were observed at eight stations along two lines of 0. 7 and 0. 9 km long. In both of the experiments direct waves were clearly recorded at all the stations as the first arrivals. The mean apparent velocity and the mean interval velocity (distance from shot is divided by travel time) of the waves are 6. 19 ± 0. 11 and 5. 74 ± 0. 88 km/s, respectively. The obtained velocity of the snow-free area {{in the vicinity of}} the Ongul Islands is nearly the same as the velocities under the ice sheet of all areas in East Antarctica previously obtained by the research expeditions of the United States, USSR and Japan.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{rationing}} policy in an inventory system with two demand classes and different service criteria for backorders. Due {{to the difference}} of customer values, system performance sometimes has to be measured {{with a mixture of}} penalty cost and service level in managing inventory. With a continuous review (r,Q) system, we develop a critical level rationing policy in which a threshold mechanism is adopted to allocate backorders when multiple outstanding orders exist. Due to the complexity of the problem, a heuristic is developed based on the principle that both demand classes are served with respective target service levels. We also introduce bounds so that the search ranges of decision variables become restrictive. The numerical examples indicate an excellent performance of our heuristic. In addition, when ordering cost is medium or high, the threshold clearing mechanism has the same results as the optimal one. When ordering cost is small (set to <b>zero),</b> different <b>clearing</b> mechanisms should be used depending on the priorities of demand classes. Further analysis indicates that transforming the service constraint into a cost parameter and then applying the existing algorithm will not be a good approach for this problem with mixed performance criteria. It either increases the costs or violates the service constraint. This study also shows the importance of applying rationing policy when high priority class has a low demand volume, target service levels between two classes have a large gap, or replenishment lead time is long.

40|$|We study {{vortex flow}} {{resistance}} (VFR) in films of Pb with holes as periodic pinning centers (PPCs) and of Nb with PPCs {{in the form}} of Ni dots, as function of temperature, dc current and constant applied magnetic field. The experimental resolution is better than 10 (- 5) of the normal state resistance. At high temperatures near to T-C and high drive currents the resistance shows local minima both at matching fields and zero field. For lower temperatures, however, in a narrow temperature range before the vortex system becomes completely frozen, we observe suppression of the VFR with increasing magnetic field. In the Pb film with PPCs these phenomena show up as a <b>clear</b> <b>zero</b> field resistance excess, which is gradually suppressed by the applied magnetic field.

This result was reminiscent to the reduced amounts of dimeric and tetrameric ATP synthase from yeast null mutants of subunits e and g detected by CNE. The dimer/oligomer-stabilizing effects of subunits e/g and a/A 6 L seem additive in human and yeast cells. The mature IF 1 inhibitor was specifically bound to the dimeric/oligomeric forms of ATP synthase and not to the monomer.
