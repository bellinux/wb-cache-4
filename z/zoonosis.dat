5|$|Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are {{believed}} to have originated in non-human primates in West-central Africa, and {{are believed}} to have transferred to humans (a process known as <b>zoonosis)</b> in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|This {{disease is}} {{considered}} to be a <b>zoonosis</b> (an infectious disease that is naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans), with the exception of Leishmania tropica — which is often an anthroponotic disease (an infectious disease that is naturally transmissible from humans to vertebrate animals).|$|E
25|$|Swine flu {{has been}} {{reported}} numerous times as a <b>zoonosis</b> in humans, usually with limited distribution, rarely with a widespread distribution. Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry, primarily by causing stunting and extended time to market. For example, this disease costs the British meat industry about £65 million every year.|$|E
25|$|Prairie {{dogs are}} also very {{susceptible}} to bubonic plague, and many wild colonies have been wiped out by it. Also, in 2002, {{a large group of}} prairie dogs in captivity in Texas were found to have contracted tularemia. The prairie dog ban is frequently cited by the CDC as a successful response to the threat of <b>zoonosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Entry {{into the}} host cell is {{achieved}} by attachment of the viral envelope protein E to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. Humans, mammals, mosquitoes, and ticks serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are <b>zoonosis</b> and bite.|$|E
25|$|Outbreaks of zoonoses {{have been}} traced to human {{interaction}} with {{and exposure to}} animals at fairs, petting zoos, and other settings. In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an updated list of recommendations for preventing <b>zoonosis</b> transmission in public settings. The recommendations, developed {{in conjunction with the}} , include educational responsibilities of venue operators, limiting public and animal contact, and animal care and management.|$|E
25|$|Over 3,500 {{species of}} {{mosquitoes}} {{have already been}} described from {{various parts of the}} world. Some mosquitoes that bite humans routinely act as vectors for a number of infectious diseases affecting millions of people per year. Others that do not routinely bite humans, but are the vectors for animal diseases, may become disastrous agents for <b>zoonosis</b> of new diseases when their habitats are disturbed, for instance by sudden deforestation.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2003, due to {{cross-contamination}} at a Madison, Wisconsin-area pet swap from an unquarantined Gambian {{pouched rat}} imported from Ghana, several prairie dogs in captivity acquired monkeypox, and subsequently a few humans were also infected. This led the CDC and FDA {{to issue a}} joint order banning the sale, trade, and transport within the United States of prairie dogs (with a few exceptions). The disease was never introduced to any wild populations. The European Union also banned importation of prairie dogs in response. While largely seen by exotic pet owners and vendors as unfair, the monkeypox scare {{was not the only}} <b>zoonosis</b> incident associated with prairie dogs.|$|E
25|$|The 1918 flu {{pandemic}} in humans {{was associated with}} H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this may reflect a <b>zoonosis</b> either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans. For instance, swine influenza was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918, after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people. Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans, birds, animals, and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal, the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive. It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 100million people were killed worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Lyme {{disease is}} {{classified}} as a <b>zoonosis,</b> as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts. Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the main vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia). Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage, because they are very small and thus may feed {{for long periods of}} time undetected. Larval ticks are very rarely infected. Although deer are the preferred hosts of the adult stage of deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Lyme disease spirochetes from deer. Rather, deer ticks acquire Borrelia microbes from infected small mammals and occasionally birds, including the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus.|$|E
25|$|Feline <b>zoonosis</b> are the viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, {{nematode}} and arthropod {{infections that}} can be transmitted to humans from the domesticated cat, Felis catus. Some of these are diseases are reemerging and newly emerging infections or infestations caused by zoonotic pathogens transmitted by cats. In some instances, the cat can display symptoms of infection (these may differ from the symptoms in humans) and sometimes the cat remains asymptomatic. There can be serious illnesses and clinical manifestations in people who become infected. This {{is dependent on the}} immune status and age of the person. Those who live in close association with cats are more prone to these infections. But those that do not keep cats as pets are also able to acquire these infections because of the transmission can be from cat feces and the parasites that leave their bodies.|$|E
25|$|People {{who work}} with poultry and swine, {{especially}} those with intense exposures, {{are at increased risk}} of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and constitute a population of human hosts in which <b>zoonosis</b> and reassortment can co-occur. Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure. Transmission of influenza from swine to humans {{who work with}} swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public health surveillance. Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers.|$|E
25|$|Major modern {{diseases}} such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, though it has now evolved to a separate human-only disease. Most strains of influenza that infect humans are human diseases, although many strains of swine and bird flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu. Taenia solium infection is one of the neglected tropical diseases with public health and veterinary concern in endemic regions. Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. Most human diseases originated in animals; however, only diseases that routinely involve animal to human transmission, like rabies, are considered direct <b>zoonosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fasciolosis (also {{known as}} fascioliasis, fasciolasis, {{distomatosis}} and liver rot) is a parasitic worm infection {{caused by the}} common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica {{as well as by}} Fasciola gigantica. The disease is a plant-borne trematode <b>zoonosis,</b> and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). It affects humans, but its main host is ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The disease progresses through four distinct phases; an initial incubation phase of between a few days up to three months with little or no symptoms; an invasive or acute phase which may manifest with: fever, malaise, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria, anemia, jaundice, and respiratory symptoms. The disease later progresses to a latent phase with less symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase months to years later. In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the bile ducts, gall bladder and may cause gall stones as well as fibrosis. While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates, it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk.|$|E
500|$|... {{tuberculosis}} {{appears to}} be widespread among captive elephants in the US. It is believed that the animals originally acquired the disease from humans, a process called reverse <b>zoonosis.</b> Because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos.|$|E
500|$|Bats {{present a}} {{significant}} hazard {{in areas where}} the rabies virus is endemic. For example, in the United States, bats typically constitute around a quarter of reported cases of rabies in wild animals, and their bites account {{for the vast majority of}} cases in humans. Rabies is fully preventable if the patient is vaccinated before the onset of symptoms, but bat bites are small and may remain unnoticed. The most severe threat to humans and domestic animals comes from sick, downed, or dead bats. Bat rabies virus can rarely infect victims purely through airborne transmission ("cryptic rabies"). All active widespread rabies strains appear to have evolved from strains endemic to bats. Through <b>zoonosis,</b> these mutated and [...] "jumped" [...] to other species. In North America, for example, this reportedly occurred in the mid-1600s.|$|E
500|$|Smallpox is {{believed}} to have been acquired by humans originally as a <b>zoonosis</b> from a terrestrial African rodent between 16,000 and 68,000 years ago, well before the dawn of agriculture and civilization. [...] The earliest physical evidence of it is probably the pustular rash on the mummified body of Pharaoh Ramses V of Egypt. The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans annually during the closing years of the 18th century (including five reigning monarchs), and was responsible for a third of all blindness. Of all those infected, 20–60 percent—and over 80 percent of infected children—died from the disease. Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300–500 million deaths during the 20th century. As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{common and}} {{preventable}} forms of <b>zoonosis</b> [...] are as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Zoonoses have {{different}} modes of transmission. In direct <b>zoonosis</b> {{the disease is}} directly transmitted [...] from animals to humans through media such as air (influenza) or through bites and saliva (rabies). In contrast, transmission can also occur via an intermediate species (referred to as a vector), which carry the disease pathogen without getting infected. When humans infect animals, it is called reverse <b>zoonosis</b> or anthroponosis. The term is from Greek: ζῷον zoon [...] "animal" [...] and νόσος nosos [...] "sickness".|$|E
2500|$|Most {{diseases}} that affect dogs or humans are not transferable {{between the two}} species. [...] Diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans are terrmed zoonoses. [...] A well-known <b>zoonosis</b> is rabies, a viral infection transmitted through a bite. [...] A common bacterial <b>zoonosis</b> is leptospirosis, transmitted through urine. [...] Some {{of the most important}} zoonoses are parasitic. [...] Zoonotic intestinal parasites transmitted through contact with feces include Toxocara canis (the canine roundworm), which causes toxocariasis, visceral larva migrans, and ocular larva migrans, and hookworms, which can cause cutaneous larva migrans. [...] Zoonotic skin parasites include scabies, caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. [...] The most common zoonotic fungal disease is ringworm, caused in this case by Microsporum canis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the current}} era of globalization, {{the world is}} more interdependent {{than at any other}} time. [...] Efficient and {{inexpensive}} transportation has left few places inaccessible, and increased global trade in agricultural products has brought more and more people into contact with animal diseases that have subsequently jumped species barriers (see <b>zoonosis).</b>|$|E
2500|$|... free {{school milk}} and school meals, cancer {{research}} centre, and <b>zoonosis</b> research centre all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, {{professor at the}} School of Tropical Medicine, the first school {{of its kind in}} the world. Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas, and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray.|$|E
2500|$|Hydatidosis {{is caused}} by a cestode Echinococcus. This is usually noticed among dogs, wild dogs, foxes, etc. Due to its {{importance}} as a <b>zoonosis,</b> these worms are important to treat. [...] Preventing hydatidosis is an easier task than treating the same. Anthelmintics such as praziquantel may help prevent this condition. Prohibition of the feeding of dogs with uncooked offals may be the best prophylactic measure against these tapeworms.|$|E
2500|$|An {{infectious}} disease {{is caused by}} the presence of pathogenic organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites (either animalian or protozoan). [...] Most of these diseases can spread from cat to cat via airborne pathogens or through direct or indirect contact, while others require a vector such as a tick or mosquito. Certain {{infectious disease}}s are a concern from a public health standpoint because they are a Feline <b>zoonosis</b> and transmittable to human.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} {{syphilis}} are unknown, and some historians {{argue that it}} descended from a twenty-thousand-year-old African <b>zoonosis.</b> [...] Other historians place its emergence in the New World, arguing that the crews of Columbus’s ships first brought the disease to Europe. The first recorded case of syphilis occurred in Naples in 1495, after King Charles VIII of France besieged the city of Naples, Italy. [...] The soldiers, and the prostitutes who followed their camps, came from all corners of Europe. [...] When they went home, they took the disease with them and spread it across the continent.|$|E
2500|$|Every lethal {{viral disease}} {{presents}} a paradox: killing its host is obviously of no {{benefit to the}} virus, so how and why did it evolve to do so? Today {{it is believed that}} most viruses are relatively benign in their natural hosts; some viral infection might even be beneficial to the host. The lethal viral diseases are believed to have resulted from an [...] "accidental" [...] jump of the virus from a species in which it is benign to a new one that is not accustomed to it (see <b>zoonosis).</b> For example, viruses that cause serious influenza in humans probably have pigs or birds as their natural host, and HIV is thought to derive from the benign non-human primate virus SIV.|$|E
2500|$|Those at {{the highest}} risk of {{contracting}} a disease from a cat are those with behaviors that include: being licked, sharing food, sharing kithchen utensils, kissing, and sleeping with a cat. The very young, the elderly {{and those who are}} immunocompromised increase their risk of becoming infected when sleeping with their cats (and dogs). [...] The CDC recommends that cat owners not allow a cat to lick your face because it can result in disease transmission. If someone is licked on their face, mucous membranes or an open wound, the risk for infection is reduced if the area is immediately washed with soap and water. Maintaining the health of the animal by regular inspection for fleas and ticks, scheduling deworming medications along with veterinary exams will also reduce the risk of acquiring a feline <b>zoonosis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Phylogenetic {{studies of}} the West Nile Virus have shown that it emerged as a {{distinct}} virus around 1000 years ago. This initial virus developed into two distinct lineages, lineage 1 and its multiple profiles {{is the source of}} the epidemic transmission in Africa and throughout the world. Lineage 2 was considered an Africa <b>zoonosis.</b> However, in 2008, lineage 2, previously only seen in horses in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar, began to appear in horses in Europe, where the first known outbreak affected 18 animals in Hungary in 2008. Lineage 1 West Nile virus was detected in South Africa in 2010 in a mare and her aborted fetus; previously, only lineage 2 West Nile virus had been detected in horses and humans in South Africa. [...] A 2007 fatal case in a killer whale in Texas broadened the known host range of West Nile virus to include cetaceans.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{cases were}} {{described}} in Brazil in 1992 in siblings from Cotia, São Paulo that developed symptoms as a migrating redness, general flu-like symptoms and arthritis after being bitten by ticks. Although the symptoms {{were similar to}} those presented by patients of Lyme disease, clinical and laboratorial results were considerably different. Ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex were not found at the risk areas; bacteria from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex —that cause Lyme disease— were not found in biological fluids and tissues of the siblings. Blood analysis of the patients on electron microscopy exhibited structures resembling microorganisms of the spirochaete phylum. For these reasons, the Brazilian <b>zoonosis</b> was considered a new disease and named Baggio–Yoshinari Syndrome (BYS), defined as: [...] "Exotic and emerging Brazilian infectious disease, transmitted by ticks not belonging to the Ixodes ricinus complex, caused by latent spirochetes with atypical morphology, which originates LD-like symptoms, except for occurrence of relapsing episodes and auto-immune disorders".|$|E

Brucellosis occurs naturally in the Yellowstone Bison Herd and [...] the normal winter migrations of bison outside the park have raised concerns that Brucellosis infected Bison may infect cattle. [...] The United States government has programs to eradicate brucellosis in domestic livestock. Since 1934, an estimated $3.5 billion in federal, state, and private funds has been spent on brucellosis eradication in domestic livestock.
