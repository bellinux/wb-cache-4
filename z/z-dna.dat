5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and <b>Z-DNA</b> forms, although, only B-DNA and <b>Z-DNA</b> have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts {{depends on the}} hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, {{and the presence of}} polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider {{right-handed}} spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological {{conditions in}} partly dehydrated samples of DNA, {{while in the}} cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, {{the opposite of the}} more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific <b>Z-DNA</b> binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.|$|E
25|$|In nature, DNA {{can form}} three structures, A-, B-, and <b>Z-DNA.</b> A- and B-DNA are very similar, forming {{right-handed}} helices, whereas <b>Z-DNA</b> is a left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. <b>Z-DNA</b> {{is thought to}} play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of {{the properties of the}} junction between B- and <b>Z-DNA.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rich {{speculates that}} the <b>Z-DNA</b> is {{necessary}} for transcription and that E3L stabilizes the <b>Z-DNA,</b> thus prolonging expression of the anti-apoptotic genes. He suggests that a small molecule that interferes with the E3L binding to <b>Z-DNA</b> could thwart the activation of these genes and help protect people from pox infections.|$|E
25|$|While no {{definitive}} biological significance of <b>Z-DNA</b> has been found, {{it is commonly}} believed to provide torsional strain relief (supercoiling) while DNA transcription occurs. The potential to form a <b>Z-DNA</b> structure also correlates with regions of active transcription. A comparison of regions with a high sequence-dependent, predicted propensity to form <b>Z-DNA</b> in human chromosome 22 with a selected set of known gene transcription sites suggests there is a correlation.|$|E
25|$|The first domain to bind <b>Z-DNA</b> {{with high}} {{affinity}} {{was discovered in}} ADAR1 using an approach developed by Alan Herbert. Crystallographic and NMR studies confirmed the biochemical findings that this domain bound <b>Z-DNA</b> in a non-sequence-specific manner. Related domains were identified {{in a number of}} other proteins through sequence homology. The identification of the Z-alpha domain provided a tool for other crystallographic studies that lead to the characterization of Z-RNA and the B-Z junction. Biological studies suggested that the <b>Z-DNA</b> binding domain of ADAR1 may localize this enzyme that modifies the sequence of the newly formed RNA to sites of active transcription.|$|E
25|$|<b>Z-DNA</b> {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{possible}} double helical structures of DNA. It is a left-handed double helical structure in which the double helix winds to the left in a zig-zag pattern (instead of to the right, like the more common B-DNA form). <b>Z-DNA</b> is thought to be one of three biologically active double helical structures along with A- and B-DNA.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to predict {{the likelihood of a}} DNA sequence forming a <b>Z-DNA</b> structure. An algorithm for predicting the propensity of DNA to flip from the B-form to the Z-form, ZHunt, was written by Dr. P. Shing Ho in 1984 (at MIT). This algorithm was later developed by Tracy Camp, P. Christoph Champ, Sandor Maurice, and Jeffrey M. Vargason for genome-wide mapping of <b>Z-DNA</b> (with P. Shing Ho as the principal investigator).|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the RNA {{version of}} <b>Z-DNA,</b> Z-RNA, was {{described}} as a transformed version of an A-RNA double helix into a left-handed helix.|$|E
25|$|At the {{junction}} of B- and <b>Z-DNA,</b> one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from RNA polymerase or nucleosome binding.|$|E
25|$|Ethidium bromide {{has also}} been used {{extensively}} to reduce mitochondrial DNA copy number in proliferating cells. Effect of EtBr on mitochondrial DNA is used in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomosis in cattle, as EtBr binds molecules of kinetoplastid DNA and changes their conformation to <b>Z-DNA</b> form. This form inhibits replication of kinetoplastid DNA which is for trypanosomas lethal.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Alex Rich {{noticed that}} a {{poxvirus}} virulence factor, called E3L that has a Z-alpha related domain, mimicked a mammalian protein that binds <b>Z-DNA.</b> In 2005, Rich and his colleagues pinned down what E3L does for the poxvirus. When expressed in human cells, E3L increases by five- to 10-fold the production of several genes that block a cell's ability to self-destruct in response to infection.|$|E
25|$|The CYR61 {{promoter}} is a TATA box containing promoter, with binding {{sites for}} many transcription factors including AP1, ATF, E2F, HNF3b, NF1, NFκB, SP1, and SRF, and 2 poly(CA) stretches that may form <b>Z-DNA</b> structure. Transcriptional activation of CYR61 is exquisitely sensitive {{to a wide}} range of environmental perturbations, including stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), growth hormone, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cAMP, vitamin D3, estrogen and tamoxifen, angiotensin II, hypoxia, UV light, and mechanical stretch.|$|E
500|$|DNA {{complexes}} {{have been}} made that change their conformation upon some stimulus, making them one form of nanorobotics. [...] These structures are initially formed {{in the same way}} as the static structures made in structural DNA nanotechnology, but are designed so that dynamic reconfiguration is possible after the initial assembly. [...] The earliest such device made use of the transition between the B-DNA and <b>Z-DNA</b> forms to respond to a change in buffer conditions by undergoing a twisting motion.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Z-DNA</b> {{is quite}} {{different}} from the right-handed forms. In fact, <b>Z-DNA</b> is often compared against B-DNA in order to illustrate the major differences. The <b>Z-DNA</b> helix is left-handed and has a structure that repeats every 2 base pairs. The major and minor grooves, unlike A- and B-DNA, show little difference in width. Formation of this structure is generally unfavourable, although certain conditions can promote it; such as alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence (especially poly(dGC)2), negative DNA supercoiling or high salt and some cations (all at physiological temperature, 37°C, and pH 7.3-7.4). <b>Z-DNA</b> can form a junction with B-DNA (called a [...] "B-to-Z junction box") in a structure which involves the extrusion of a base pair. The <b>Z-DNA</b> conformation has been difficult to study because it does not exist as a stable feature of the double helix. Instead, it is a transient structure that is occasionally induced by biological activity and then quickly disappears.|$|E
2500|$|Left handed DNA {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Robert Wells and colleagues, during their studies of a repeating polymer of inosine-cytosine. They observed a [...] "reverse" [...] circular dichroism spectrum for such DNAs, and interpreted this (correctly) {{to mean that}} the strands wrapped around {{one another in a}} left handed fashion. The relationship between <b>Z-DNA</b> and the more familiar B-DNA was indicated by the work of Pohl and Jovin, who showed that the ultraviolet circular dichroism of poly(dG-dC) was nearly inverted in 4 M sodium chloride solution. The suspicion that this {{was the result of a}} conversion from B-DNA to <b>Z-DNA</b> was confirmed by examining the raman spectra of these solutions and the <b>Z-DNA</b> crystals. Subsequently, a crystal structure of [...] "Z-DNA" [...] was published which turned out to be the first single-crystal X-ray structure of a DNA fragment (a self-complementary DNA hexamer d(CG)3). It was resolved as a left-handed double helix with two anti-parallel chains that were held together by Watson-Crick base pairs (see: x-ray crystallography). It was solved by Andrew Wang, Alexander Rich, and co-workers in 1979 at MIT. The crystallisation of a B- to <b>Z-DNA</b> junction in 2005 provided a better understanding of the potential role <b>Z-DNA</b> plays in cells. Whenever a segment of <b>Z-DNA</b> forms, there must be B-Z junctions at its two ends, interfacing it to the B-form of DNA found in the rest of the genome.|$|E
2500|$|The {{double helix}} is the {{dominant}} tertiary structure for biological DNA, and is also a possible structure for RNA. [...] Three DNA conformations {{are believed to be}} found in nature, A-DNA, B-DNA, and <b>Z-DNA.</b> The [...] "B" [...] form described by James D. Watson and Francis Crick is believed to predominate in cells. James D. Watson and Francis Crick described this structure as a double helix with a radius of 10 Å and pitch of 34 Å, making one complete turn about its axis every 10 bp of sequence. The double helix makes one complete turn about its axis every 10.4-10.5 base pairs in solution. This frequency of twist (known as the helical pitch) depends largely on stacking forces that each base exerts on its neighbours in the chain. [...] Double-helical RNA adopts a conformation similar to the A-form structure.|$|E

50|$|In 1979, Rich and {{co-workers}} at MIT grew a crystal of <b>Z-DNA.</b> This {{was the first}} crystal structure of any form of DNA. After 26 years of attempts, Rich et al. finally crystallised the junction box of B- and <b>Z-DNA.</b> Their results were published in an October 2005 Nature journal. Whenever <b>Z-DNA</b> forms, there must be two junction boxes that allow the flip back to the canonical B-form of DNA. Rich died on April 27, 2015, aged 90.|$|E
