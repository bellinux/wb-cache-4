5|$|An {{amino acid}} is also {{amphoteric}} {{with the added}} complication that the neutral molecule is subject to an internal acid–base equilibrium in which the basic amino group attracts and binds the proton from the acidic carboxyl group, forming a <b>zwitterion.</b>|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the <b>zwitterion</b> predominates, but coexists in dynamic {{equilibrium}} with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E

40|$|Nucleophilic {{substitution}} reactions at silicon {{are frequently}} thought to occur through {{the formation of}} pentacoordinated or hexacoordinated intermediates or transition states. Pentacoordinated compounds have geometries ranging from trigonal bipyramidal to square or rectangular pyramidal. Interconversion from one geometry to another occurs via Berry pseudorotation. Hexacoordinated compounds have geometries ranging from octahedral to bicapped tetrahedral. ^ Silicon compounds which achieve higher coordination {{as a result of}} intramolecular coordination are useful model compounds for the intermediates in nucleophilic substitution reactions. Group 14 and 15 elements are the donor atoms commonly found to behave in this regard. ^ Six compounds which incorporate both sulfur and silicon atoms into an eight-membered ring system are synthesized. In addition, a disiloxane with two eight-membered ring systems is obtained as a hydrolysis product. Si-S coordination is observed in the five crystal structures that are obtained. Steric and electronic effects on the degree of coordination are compared. The degree of coordination is measured by calculating the distortion of the geometry around the silicon atom from a tetrahedral to a trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Four other organosilanes that have the sulfur atom as part of a dangling moiety attached to the eight-membered ring are also synthesized. No coordination was observed in this type of system, with the silicon atom retaining a tetrahedral geometry. The 29 Si NMR spectra of all 11 organosilanes are indicative {{of the nature of the}} substituents on the silicon atom. ^ A total of seven zwitterionic silicates are synthesized.
