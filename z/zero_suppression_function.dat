40|$|In {{order to}} reduce event size during LHC running, it will be {{necessary}} to suppress readout of HCAL channels with energy below certain threshold. However, <b>Zero</b> <b>Suppression</b> (ZS) introduces bias to reconstructed energy in HCAL. In this note we evaluate and quantify effect of ZS (with firmware version 5 A) on distribution of reconstructed energy deposition of cosmic ray muons. We conclude that cosmic ray data must be taken without <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> in order to have an unbiased sample, which can used to validate the HCAL energy calibration and to evaluate the effect of different possible options for <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> on HCAL calibration, muon ID and muon isolation algorithms. 1...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} the ATLAS event size is roughly 2 MB, with the LAr data corresponding to 70 % of the record. In this document two methods of reducing {{the contribution of the}} LAr calorimetry to the overall ATLAS data size are described. The first method simply recognizes that very low energy cells require less space in the record. The second method, called <b>zero</b> <b>suppression,</b> saves space in the LAr data recordby suppressing cells containing electronic and pileup noise. Using these two methods, reductions {{in the size of the}} LAr data record by a factor of approximately five to six can be achieved without obvious impairment of the underlying physics. The data reduction takes place in the RODs. The <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> algorithms are constructed to work either in the RODs or in the Event Filter. Information on how to run the <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> code are given and a sketch of a possible data format for the LAr data record is given. Last, but not least details are given of planned future upgrades to the <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> procedures...|$|R

40|$|The final sensor {{equipping}} the EUDET {{telescope is}} expected to cope with typi-cally 1 million particles per second. Its architecture relies on a parallelised process-ing of the pixels, complemented with a fast <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> logic. The develope-ment of the sensor is organised accordingly along two lines, one focussed on a pixel array organised in columns with discriminated output read out in parallel, and one addressing the <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> logic complemented with output memories. The final prototype of the column parallel architecture (IDC) was fabricated in 2007 / 08 and fully tested in 2008. The <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> micro-circuit (SDC- 2), which was fabricated in 2007, was also characterised in 2008. Both chips meet all their requirements.

40|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>suppression</b> of the TRT data is {{foreseen}} {{already at}} the ROD level. Valid straws will be identified by applying a gate of tunable position and width to the low threshold data bits. Various schemes have been proposed for the encoding of data from valid straws. The schemes are answering the requirements posed by the different running modes of LHC/ATLAS: low luminosity, low luminosity b-physics programme, and high luminosity. This note presents a Monte Carlo study of the validity gate approach and of the proposed encoding schemes. Results are presented on the obtainable efficiency and background <b>suppression</b> as <b>function</b> of the validity gate position and width. The different encoding schemes are investigated and estimates of the output data volumes are presented for different luminosities...|$|R

40|$|LHCb {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{experiments}} currently under construction at LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN, and its aim is the study of b-quark physics [1]. LHCb trigger strategy is based on three levels, and will reduce the event rate from 40 MHz to a few hundred Hz [2]. The first two levels (L 0 and L 1) will use signals from some part of the detector in order to take fast decisions, while the last one, called High Level Trigger (HLT), will have access to the full event data. An ”off detector ” readout board (TELL 1) has been developed and will be used by the majority of LHCb subdetectors. It will take L 0 accepted data as input, and output them to L 1 Trigger and HLT after data processing which includes event synchronization, L 1 Trigger pre-processing and <b>zero</b> <b>suppression,</b> L 1 buffering, and HLT <b>zero</b> <b>suppression...</b>|$|R
40|$|Measurements of low wind {{velocities}} (the {{absolute value}} of V sub H is approx. equal to 6 m/s) with a VHF wind profiler {{can be difficult}} if ground clutter or other biases in the system dominate in altering {{the position of the}} perceived peak in the calculated power spectrum. A variety of methods for ground clutter suppression are used in profiler systems today (Cornish, 1983). An editing method called <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> takes the spectral value of selectable number of points (N) on each side of 0 velocity (one point on either side, in this study) and sets them equal to the mean value of the points exterior to the specified N points on either side of 0. Analysis done with the PSU VHF(1) radar, shows that this zero-suppression method can systematically bias horizontal wings V sub H below 6 m/s. With the <b>zero</b> <b>suppression,</b> an artificial increase in absolute wind velocities occurs when the spectral peaks fall within the plus or minus N points of the FFT (personal communication, Strauch, 1985). It was also established that the method artificially decreases the absolute wind velocities inferred from spectral peaks that are outside but near the suppressed region. Comparisons of wind profiles observed with and without <b>zero</b> <b>suppression</b> are given. The range of the biased velocities extends to about plus or minus 6 m/s. Biases have been deduced to be as much as 2 m/s, but more commonly they are on the order of 1. 0 m/s...|$|R
