30|$|The petrochemical, {{mining and}} power {{industries}} have {{reacted to the}} recent South African water crisis by focussing on improved brine treatment for water and salt recovery {{with the aim of}} achieving <b>zero</b> <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>discharge.</b> The purpose of this novel study was to compare experimentally obtained results from the treatment of synthetic NaCl solutions and petrochemical industrial brines such as spent ion exchange regenerant brines and reverse osmosis (RO) brines to the classical well-known Knudsen diffusion, molecular diffusion and transition predictive models. The predictive models were numerically solved using a developed mathematical algorithm that was coded using MATLAB® software. The impact of experimentally varying the inlet feed temperature on process performance of the system is presented here and compared to simulated results. It was found that there was good agreement between the experimentally obtained results, for both the synthetic NaCl solution and the industrial brines. The mean average percentage error (MAPE) was found to be 7.9 % for the synthetic NaCl solutions when compared to the Knudsen model. The Knudsen/molecular diffusion transition theoretical model best predicted the performance of the membrane for the industrial spent ion exchange regenerant brine with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 13.3 %. The Knudsen model best predicted the performance of the membrane (MAPE of 10.5 %) for the industrial RO brine. Overall, the models were able to successfully predict the water flux and can be used as potential process design tools.|$|R

40|$|Alternatives were {{evaluated}} for management of treated radioactive liquid waste from the radioactive {{liquid waste treatment}} facility (RLWTF) at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Three additional phases of upgrades to the present radioactive liquid waste system are proposed to accomplish <b>zero</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge.</b> The first phase involves minimization of liquid waste generation, along with improved characterization and monitoring of the remaining liquid waste. The second phase removes dissolved salts from the reverse osmosis concentrate stream to yield a higher effluent quality.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to develop a {{sustainable}} <b>zero</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> desalination system. Direct contact membrane distillation unit is connected directly to salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) to achieve <b>zero</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> desalination. The used system contains a hydrophobic microporous membrane module and a plastic pipe circulating all over the pond water surface to be used as a cooling system. The pipe also used as a wave suppression system as it is floating over the top of the pond water surface. The system is sourced by the hot and high concentrated saline water that is extracted from non convective zone as a feed solution, then, the brine discharges at the lower convective zone of the solar pond. Therefore, if the saturated brine is used to produce salts, there will not be any brine left over which may lead to <b>zero</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> desalination. The system is modelled theoretically and solved by Matlab simulation program. It has been found that the system has the ability to deliver 52 I/day of fresh water for m(2) of membrane coupled with SGSP, consuming almost 11 kWim(2) of thermal energy. Also, the trans membrane coefficient of the used membrane is proved to be 0. 001 kg/m(2) /Pa/h. The results are analysed and the system performance is evaluated and presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Assessing the {{potential}} impact of climate changes on a hydrologic time serie is based on identifying the trend of the annual mean discharges. Time series of annual mean <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges</b> from all the hydrometric posts situated in the� pper basin of Bârlad river are studied: Băceşti and Negreşti on Bârlad (1950 – 2007), Ţibana and Tungujei on Şacovăţ (1987 – 2007), Frenciugi and Căzăneşti on Stavnic (1950 – 2007). Parametric (linear, second degree polynomial and exponential equations) and non-parametric methods (Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope) are applied in order to detect a trend in data. The parametric testing shows that the polynomial model is the most apropiate, which means that during the interannual evolution of discharges a natural fluctuation seems to be more probable that an effect of the climate warming. The results of the non-parametric tests do not show a trend in data. We can conclude that in the studied area there is no clear impact of the climate change upon the annual mean <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges...</b>|$|R
