40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Programming implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with a high-rate therapy {{strategy}} {{has proven to}} be effective in reducing shocks and is associated with a reduced mortality. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the impact of a very high rate cutoff programming strategy on outcomes in patients with a primary indication for an ICD due to reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. METHODS: Using data from the multicenter French DAI-PP registry, this cohort-controlled study compared outcomes in 500 patients programmed with a very high rate cutoff (VH-RATE group: monitor zone 170 - 219 beats/min; ventricular fibrillation zone ≥ 220 beats/min with 13 ± 4 detection intervals) with 1500 matched control patients programmed with 1 or 2 <b>therapy</b> <b>zone.</b> All ICDs were implanted for primary prevention in patients with systolic dysfunction. Risks of events were compared after propensity score matching of sex, age, ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, and type of device. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 3. 6 ± 2. 3 years, VH-RATE programming was associated with a reduction of appropriate therapy risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 40; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 31 - 0. 51; P <. 0001) and inappropriate shock (HR 0. 42; 95 % CI 0. 27 - 0. 63; P <. 0001). It was also associated with a decreased risk of sudden cardiac death (HR 0. 43; 95 % CI 0. 17 - 0. 99; P =. 04) as compared with patients programmed with 2 <b>therapy</b> <b>zones.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} overall survival between the groups. CONCLUSION: In patients implanted with an ICD in primary prevention with left ventricular dysfunction, very high rate cutoff programming (single <b>therapy</b> <b>zone</b> ≥ 220 beats/min) was associated with a 60 % reduction of appropriate therapies as well as inappropriate shocks, without affecting mortality...|$|R

40|$|WHAT YOU WILL {{understand}} {{by the end}} of {{this chapter}} is how the new field of positive psychology provides a robust theoretical and empirical base for the artful practice of life and executive coaching. But first, what exactly is positive psychology, and how is it different from business as usual? Through the years, traditional psychology has focused on ways to help make ill people better by finding clinically valid and empirically supported methods to help fix things that are wrong with them. The mission of positive psychology is to develop sound theories of optimal functioning and to find empirically supported ways to improve the lives of ordinary and extraordinary people. In this chapter the author will present a number of emerging trends in positive psychology theory and research and explore their applications to coaching. I’ll walk you through studies of positive emotion, flow (ac-cessing the <b>zone),</b> hope <b>therapy,</b> and classification of strengths. Each set of studies offers a rich resource of knowledge that can be mined for po-tential coaching interventions.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{hyperthermia}} and thermo-ablation are two promising {{alternatives for}} local tissue overheating of deep seated human tumours. After a short characterisation {{of the two}} techniques and {{the identification of the}} main parameters, results of an analytical theory of local heat up, cooling, and heat expansion are presented. The theory is based on a spherical model for hyper-thermia with a critical thermal dose and on a cylinder-symmetrical model for thermo-ablation with a critical temperature limit for thermal tissue coagulation. Two representative hard ware concepts are discussed. The hyperthermia applicator consists of a MHz transducer, which ro-tates concentrically in a water filled capsule with acoustically transparent window, and radiates collimated ultrasound under 45 ° into a concentric target area of nearly spherical symmetry. The applicator for thermo-ablation is a MHz transducer which radiates high intensity focussed ultra-sound (HIFU) into a “cigar shaped ” target area at the focal <b>zone.</b> Typical <b>therapy</b> diagrams for both techniques are presented. They show therapeutic target volumes as functions of the ther-apy time with the peak temperature or the radiated acoustic power as parameters. These dia-grams are discussed under consideration of power requirement, maximal sound intensity, and power efficiency at optimized frequency conditions. 1...|$|R

Anecdotal evidence has claimed potential health benefits of reflexology for patients with various chronic diseases. In this study, selected databases that were accessible were searched using keywords such as reflexology therapy, <b>zone</b> <b>therapy</b> and combinations thereof. Databases such as SA Nexus, SAePublications, ProQuest, Web of Knowledge, EBSCOhost Platform, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library and Google Advanced Scholar were searched for primary studies and reviews of primary studies from 2000 {{until the end of}} 2008 (N = 1171). Primary experimental and non-experimental studies in any language with an abstract in English were identified. Only studies that complied with the inclusion criteria were reviewed and appraised (n = 35) for study quality with appropriate tools from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and the American Dietetic Association's (ADA) Evidence analysis manual. Evidence extraction, analysis and synthesis were done to review available evidence by means of the evidence class rating and evidence grading of strength prescribed in the ADA's manual. Study findings represent a statistical significant reduction in the frequency of seizures of patients with intractable epilepsy, an improvement of sensory and urinary symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis and a clinical significant reduction of pain and anxiety in patients with cancer and fibromyalgia syndrome to increase overall well-being and quality of life. No statistical significant evidence was reported on benefits of reflexology for irritable bowel syndrome, menopausal symptoms, chronic low back pain and asthma. Thus there appears to be fair evidence of the effectiveness of reflexology, in addition clinical evidence supports the utilisation of reflexology to promote well-being and quality of life in adults with chronic disease.

40|$|Background/Aims: The pathphysiological {{properties}} of N-Methyl -N -nitrosourea (MNU) induced photoreceptor degeneration {{are similar to}} the hereditary retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The present study sought to explore the beneficial effects of the peonidin, a common aglycone form of anthocyanin, on the MNU induced photoreceptor degeneration via topographic measurements. Methods: The MNU administrated mouse received peonidin or vehicle injections, and then they were examined by electroretinography (ERG), multi electrode array (MEA), histological and immunohistochemistry studies. Results: The protective effects of peonidin on the MNU administrated retinas were systematically verified and quantified by topographic measures. The peonidin treatment could protect the photoreceptor against the MNU toxicity both functionally and morphologicaly. The most sensitive <b>zone</b> to peonidin <b>therapy</b> was sorted out, indicating that different rescuing kinetics existed between the retinal hemispheres and retinal quadrants. Moreover, the hyperactive spontaneous firing response and the debilitated light induced response in MNU administrated retinas could be partially reversed by peonidin treatment.

40|$|In their {{letter to}} the editor Cay et al [1] express some valid {{concerns}} regarding the strategy we described for overcoming T-wave oversensing in our patient [2]. They stress that programmable features of the device should be used first before planning a reintervention. As mentioned in our case-report we tried both the enhanced T wave suppression algorithm available in the device and programming a low sensitivity of 0. 9 mv but T-wave oversensing remained. They also stated that changing ventricular sensing configuration can result in higher R-wave amplitude (> 3 mV) and loss of T-wave sensing. Changing ventricular sensing configuration is an option in pacemakers (bipolar to unipolar) and some ICDs (true bipolar to integrated bipolar) but unfortunately this option was not available in the device used in our patient. Another suggestion was to change the timing and sequence of ventricular pacing with various V-V pace delay settings {{to solve the problem of}} TWOS. Changing the initially chosen optimal V-V interval is often not a practical solution as it might lead to broader QRS complex and loss of optimal synchronization leading to LV function deterioration.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to elucidate the problem of assessing and providing alternative medical technologies. The purpose is divisible into three parts: To investigate the bases of assessment for the acceptance of an alternative medical technology; 2. To investigate the professional and ethical problems connected with the practice of alternative medical technologies and {{find out whether the}} views of laymen and physicians differ with regard to the provision of treatments which are not in accordance with science and proven experience; 3. To investigate the interest physicians have shown in alternative medicine and the motives for this interest. These investigations are based partly on a study of the literature on alternative medicine dealing with the effects of the following alternative medical technologies: manipulation therapy, acupuncture, reflexio (<b>zone)</b> <b>therapy,</b> homoeopathy and magnetic therapy, and partly on empirical research into the attitudes expressed by doctors and patients towards non-scientific treatments. The results of these studies show that the acceptance of empirical data cannot be separated from the scientific paradigm within which the investigation has been planned. The documentation of the effect of alternative medical technologies is often empirically insufficient and based, in many instances, on so-called ”personal experience”. The interest shown by accredited physicians in alternative medicine is often motivated by the fact that certain complaints brought to them by their patients cannot be rectified by academic medical methods. The study also shows that physicians have professional interests which the patient is not prepared to respect {{in the same way as}} the physician is prepared to respect the right of a patient to refuse to undergo life-saving medical treatment. The main conclusion is that alternative medicine is a heterogeneous field where the interest expressed can be interpreted as a crisis phenomenon and an indication of the need for the assessment of alternative medicine as well as academic medicine. Laymen perceive the ethical and professional problems connected with the practice of alternative medicine relatively differently when compared to physicians. The possibility of scientific co-operation between practitioners of alternative medicine and academic medicine is difficult due to the fact that alternative medicine and academic medicine relate to different scientific paradigms. Clinical co-operation in the case of individual patients, on the other hand, is likely to occur. Diss. (sammanfattning) Umeå : Umeå universitet, 1991, härtill 6 uppsatser digitalisering@um...|$|E

The clinical picture of peripheral angiopathy consists of a combination of specific diabetic angiopathy with the medium and large vessels atherosclerosis. In the case of diabetes feet the combined lesions are underlying the obliterating vascular disease. In younger diabetic patients these changes have primarily functional nature in the form of changes in vascular tone and capillaropathy. Thus, there is a need to develop efficient way to treat and prevent DPA that could actively influence the quality of life, reduce or prevent complications that arise during DPA and lower doses of pharmaceuticals. Nowadays we know several ways of physiotherapeutic treatment and prevention of complications of diabetes. Almost all patients after 3 - 4 sessions have a slight improvement of blood microcirculation in the lower extremities and reduce overall blood sugar level. After 10 - 12 treatments the test scores improve. The closest to the developed method is a method of treating diabetes and its complications prevention, which includes magnetic-laser-ultrasound therapy of the pancreas, liver and their segmental <b>zones.</b> This magneto-laser-ultrasound <b>therapy</b> treatment is combined with low-intensity electromagnetic radiation physiopuncture in a millimetric range spectrum [2]. The main drawbacks of existing methods of treating complications of diabetes is that they do not involve zonal influence on the DPA area and do not include the need to influence the oxygen capacity of blood and increase its energy activity, and in this regard, the effectiveness of the treatment is generally reduced. As the base of invention is laid the task of creating such a way that dramatically improves the performance of DPA treatment in patients with diabetes and reduces the procedural burden on them. Our developed method of treating the DPA in diabetic patients is based on the simultaneous use of magnetic laser stimulation of the pancreas or liver with additional simultaneous laser irradiation of venous blood in popliteal areas and scanning laser beam therapy of the DPA area. Procedures performed 2 - 3 times a week. The course of treatment is 10 procedures. A second course is performed if necessary after 1 - 2 months. There may be some tactical changes, which are determined individually by your doctor depending on the clinical condition of the patient. The technical results, achieved by suggested solution are: increasing the effectiveness of treatment, the removal of metabolic disorders, a positive effect on the microcirculation, desintoxication of the body, increasing blood oxygen capacity and increase of its energy activities, which largely prevents complications in the treatment of DPA. Based on the proposed method treatment is performed using a laser multifunction system. Magnetic-laser stimulation of the pancreas and liver is performed, for example, using the following parameters: modulation frequency of magnetic laser - 9. 4 Hz, magnetic fields up to 30 ± 10 mT, the optical flow power of red or blue range of the spectrum is 30 ± 10 Wt, optical flow power of infrared spectrum - of 50 ± 20 mW, magnetic laser applicator of red spectral range is set on the projection of the pancreas, magnetic laser applicator of infrared or blue range of the spectrum is set on the projection of the liver. Popliteal overvessel blood laser irradiation is performed using the laser emission of red spectrum range – wavelength laser 0, 63 ± 0, 03 mm, laser power – 20 ± 10 mW. The DPA <b>zones</b> <b>therapy</b> with the laser scanning beam: laser wavelength – 0, 63 ± 0, 03 mm, laser power – 150 ± 50 mW, scanning figure – "Grid", the scanning dimensions – 400 x 200 mm. Additionally it is possible to perform nasal breathing with SOM using apparatus MIT-S. After the procedure is done the patient ingests the 50 - 200 ml of activated by singlet-oxygen mixture fluid. The liquid activation is held for 3 minutes. As can be seen from the data in Table 1, the patient significantly improved metabolism indicators and clinical parameters (blood pressure, pulse, bowel function, etc.). The developed method can be used in hospitals, clinics, spa facilities and therapeutic centers, etc. and be combined with drug therapy.

40|$|Current {{combination}} therapies cure Helicobacter pylori {{infection in}} 75 to 85 % of cases. However, many treatment failures are not explained by antibiotic resistance. Our {{goal was to}} explore treatment failures under in vivo conditions by using the H. pylori Sydney strain (SS 1) mouse model. Mice infected with H. pylori (SS 1) were treated with monotherapies or combination therapies used in human trials. Bacterial levels and distribution of organisms within the stomach were assessed 24 h after treatment to determine clearance and location of treatment failures and 29 days after treatment to determine cure rates. Except for treatment with metronidazole, mono- and dual therapies did not cure infection but resulted in decreases in bacterial levels and differences in distribution within the stomach. In cases of treatment failure when clarithromycin was used, omeprazole and dual therapy with omeprazole and amoxicillin resulted in organisms being cleared from the antrum, but organisms remained in the antrum-body transitional <b>zone.</b> The triple <b>therapies</b> of OMC and bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole, and tetracycline were successful in eradicating infection.

The {{management}} of IASs {{in patients with}} a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) differs from that in patients with a conventional ICD because of different sensing algorithms and programming options. To describe the {{management of}} IASs in patients with an S-ICD. Patients were implanted with an S-ICD between February 2009 and July 2012. The prevalence data and clinical determinants of IASs were prospectively collected. In the case of T-wave oversensing (TWOS), an exercise test was performed, and all possible sensing vectors were screened for TWOS. The absence of TWOS defined a suitable vector. Eleven of 69 patients (54 % men; mean age 39 ± 14 years; 73 % primary prevention) received IASs after 8. 9 ± 10 months of implantation (10. 8 % annual incidence rate). In 8 cases, TWOS caused IASs. Seven of these IASs occurred during exercise and 1 during atrial fibrillation with a high ventricular rate. To manage TWOS, in 7 of 8 patients the sensing vector was changed and in 5 of 8 patients the (un) conditional zone was changed. Hereafter, IASs recurred in 3 of 8 patients, in 2 because of programming errors. Hence, after reprogramming, we observed no IASs in 87. 5 % of the patients with TWOS during a follow-up of 14. 1 ± 13 months. IASs due to TWOS in the S-ICD can be managed by reprogramming the sensing vector and/or the <b>therapy</b> <b>zones</b> of the device using a template acquired during exercise. Exercise-optimized programming can reduce future IASs, and standard exercise testing shortly after the implantation of an S-ICD may be considered in patients at an increased risk for TWO...|$|R
40|$|Background: Late {{gadolinium}} enhancement (LGE) {{border zone}} on cardiac {{magnetic resonance imaging}} has been proposed as an independent predictor of ventricular arrhythmias. The purpose {{was to determine whether}} size and heterogeneity of LGE predict appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) patients and to evaluate 4 LGE border-zone algorithms. Methods and Results: ICM and NICM patients who underwent LGE cardiac magnetic resonance imaging prior to ICD implantation were retrospectively included. Two semiautomatic algorithms, expectation maximization, weighted intensity, a priori information and a weighted border zone algorithm, were compared with a modified full-width half-maximum and a 2 - 3 SD threshold-based algorithm (2 - 3 SD). Hazard ratios were calculated per 1 % increase in LGE. A total of 74 ICM and 34 NICM were followed for 63 months (1 - 140) and 52 months (0 - 133), respectively. ICM patients had 27 appropriate ICD events, and NICM patients had 7 ICD events. In ICM patients with primary prophylactic ICD, LGE border <b>zone</b> predicted ICD <b>therapy</b> in univariable and multivariable analysis measured by the expectation maximization, weighted intensity, a priori information, weighted border zone, and modified full-width half-maximum algorithms (hazard ratios 1. 23, 1. 22, and 1. 05, respectively; P< 0. 05; negative predictive value 92 %). For NICM, total LGE by all 4 methods was the strongest predictor (hazard ratios, 1. 03 - 1. 04; P< 0. 05), though the number of events was small. Conclusions: Appropriate ICD therapy can be predicted in ICM patients with primary prevention ICD by quantifying the LGE border zone. In NICM patients, total LGE but not LGE border zone had predictive value for ICD therapy. However, the algorithms used affects the predictive value of these measures...|$|R
40|$|Combination {{therapy with}} {{mexiletine}} and quinidine {{has been shown}} to be more effective than either agent alone. The ability of mexiletine monotherapy, quinidine monotherapy and mexiletine-quinidine combination therapy to suppress inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia was related to drug-induced changes in ventricular refractoriness, conduction times and monophasic action potential duration recorded from both ventricles. Ventricular tachycardia could no longer be induced in 7 (35 %) of the 20 patients studied with combination therapy. This was a significantly higher proportion of patients than that of the groups responding to either monotherapy (quinidine, 10 %; mexiletine, 5 %). Ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were measured when applying single (S 2), double (S 3) and triple (S 4) extrastimuli. Quinidine monotherapy increased functional and effective refractory periods of both single and multiple extrastimuli. However, when comparing measurements made during mexiletine treatment with those at baseline, mexiletine monotherapy increased only the refractory periods of S 4. The effective refractory period of S 4 during mexiletine monotherapy (200 ± 20 ins) was significantly longer than at baseline (160 ± 21 ms). Similarly, when comparing measurements made during combination therapy with those during quinidine monotherapy, combination therapy significantly increased the refractory periods only of multiple extrastimuli. The effective refractory period of S 4 during combination therapy (253 ± 26 ms) was significantly longer than that of quinidine monotherapy (223 ± 27 ms). The only other significant difference between combination therapy and monotherapy with either agent was a greater prolongation of conduction time to the left ventricular dyskinetic <b>zone</b> with combination <b>therapy.</b> Therefore, mexiletine-quinidine combination therapy is associated with additional prolongation of the refractory periods of multiple extrastimuli and with further prolongation of conduction into the dyskinetic zone of the left ventricle. These electrophysiologic effects may be markers of enhanced antiarrhythmic activity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Since {{the cell}} therapy {{benefits}} for myocardial infarction are mainly related to infarct reduction by regenerating lost myocardium or increasing survival of tissues at risk, we evaluated {{the effects of}} bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNC), implanted {{after the completion of}} necrosis, on infarct progression and cardiac remodeling. Methods: After 48 h of induction of myocardial infarction (MI), Lewis-inbred rats were injected with 6 x 10 (6) cells (MI + MNC) or saline (MI). After six weeks, scar dimension, ventricular morphology and function were analyzed by echocardiography followed by histomorphology of the infarcted and border <b>zones.</b> Results: After <b>therapy,</b> the relative size of the infarct was smaller in MI + MNC (37 +/- 1 % of the left ventricle) than in MI (43 +/- 1 %). While the MI group exhibited parallel elongation of the infarcted (31. 6 +/- 3. 8 % increase) and reminiscent ventricular portions (33. 5 +/- 3. 7 %), MNC therapy preserved the initial infarct length. Infarcted walls were thicker (979 +/- 31 mm) in the MNC group than in the untreated group (709 +/- 41 mm), also demonstrating an absence of infarct expansion. in the border zones, MNC led to increased capillary densities and capillary/myocyte ratios. the cardiac systolic function remained depressed in MI, but improved by 19 +/- 5 % in MI + MNC which reduced the incidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (37. 5 % in MI and 6. 25 % in MI + MNC). Conclusion: MNC therapy prevented the infarct expansion and thinning related to cardiac remodeling and was associated with an improvement of border zone microcirculation: as a result, MNC therapy reduced typical MI dysfunctional repercussions.

40|$|Background: Roughly focused extracorporeal {{shock waves}} therapy (ESWT) is {{characterized}} by a wide focal area, a large <b>therapy</b> <b>zone,</b> easy positioning, and less pain during treatment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of roughly focused ESWT on the expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) in osteoporotic fractures in rats. Methods: Seventy-two female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, 3 months old, were divided into sham-operated group (n = 6) and an ovariectomized (OVX) group (n = 66). Sixty OVX SD rats were used as a model of double proximal tibial osteotomy and inner fixation. The osteotomy site in the left tibia was treated with roughly focused ESWT once at an energy density of 0. 26 mJ/mm 2, 60 doses/min, and 2000 pact quantities. The contralateral right tibia was left untreated and served as a control. Expression of OPG and BMP- 2 in the callus of the osteoporotic fracture area was assessed using immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Western blotting analysis. Results: Bone mineral density (BMD) at the proximal tibia, femur, and L 5 spine was significantly reduced after ovariectomy. BMD of proximal tibia was 12. 9 % less in the OVX group than that in the sham-operated group. Meanwhile, bilateral oophorectomy resulted in a lower trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in the proximal tibia of the sham-OVX animals. Three months after bilateral oophorectomy, BV/TV was 14. 29 % of baseline BV/TV in OVX legs versus 45. 91 % in the sham-OVX legs (P < 0. 001). These data showed that the SD rats became a suitable model of osteoporosis, 3 months after they were OVX. Immunohistochemical analysis showed higher levels of BMP- 2 and OPG expression in the treatment group than those in the control group. Compared with the contralateral controls, decreased expression of OPG and BMP- 2 at 3 days after roughly focused ESWT, followed by a later increase at 7 days, was indicated by real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis. The OPG messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels peaked at 6 weeks after the shock wave treatment, paired with a much earlier (at 4 weeks) increase of BMP- 2, and declined close to normal at 8 weeks. Conclusions: Roughly focused ESWT may promote the expression of OPG and BMP- 2 in the osteoporotic fracture area in rats. BMP- 2 and OPG may act synergistically and may lead to a significant enhancement of bone formation and remodeling...|$|R
40|$|FUNDAMENTO: A programação ideal da energia de choque do CDI deve ser pelo menos 10 J acima do limiar de desfibrilação (LDF), necessitando de técnicas alternativas quando o LDF é elevado. OBJETIVO: Avaliar o comportamento clínico dos portadores de CDI com LDF> 25 J e a eficácia da terapêutica escolhida. MÉTODOS: Foram selecionados portadores de CDI, entre janeiro de 2000 e agosto de 2004 (banco de dados prospectivo), com LDF> 25 J intra-operatório, e analisaram-se: características clínicas, FEVE, resgate de eventos arrítmicos pelo CDI e óbitos. RESULTADOS: dentre 476 pacientes, 16 (3, 36 %) apresentaram LDF> 25 J. Idade média de 56, 5 anos, sendo 13 pacientes (81 %) do sexo masculino. Quanto à cardiopatia de base 09 eram chagásicos, 04 isquêmicos e 03 com etiologia idiopática. A FEVE média dos pacientes foi 37 % e 94 % utilizavam amiodarona. O seguimento médio foi de 25, 3 meses. Em 02 pacientes com LDF > Choque Máximo (CM), foi necessário implante de eletrodo de choque adicional (array), sendo mantido programação com CM em zona de FV (> 182 bpm) nos demais. Durante o seguimento 03 pacientes apresentaram 67 terapias de choque apropriadas (TCA) com sucesso. Ocorreram 07 óbitos sendo 5 por causas não cardíacas e 2 por insuficiência cardíaca avançada. Os pacientes que foram a óbito apresentaram níveis de LDF maiores (p= 0, 0446), entretanto sem relação com a causa dos mesmos tendo em vista que não ocorreram TCA sem sucesso. CONCLUSÃO: Nessa coorte de pacientes com CDI, a ocorrência de LDF elevado foi baixa, implicando terapêuticas alternativas. Houve associação com disfunção {{ventricular}} grave, entretanto sem correlação com as causas de óbito. BACKGROUND: The ideal programming of the {{implantable cardioverter defibrillator}} (ICD) {{shock energy}} {{should be at least}} 10 J above the defibrillation threshold (DFT), requiring alternative techniques when the DFT is elevated. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical behavior of ICD patients with DFT> 25 J and the efficacy of the chosen therapy. METHODS: Patients who had undergone ICD implantation between Jan/ 00 and Aug/ 04 (prospective database) and presented intraoperative DFT> 25 J were selected. The analyzed variables were: clinical characteristics, LVEF, rescue of arrhythmic events from ICD and causes of deaths. RESULTS: among 476 patients, 16 (3. 36 %) presented DFT> 25 J. The mean age was 56. 5 years, and 13 patients (81 %) were men. According to the baseline cardiomyopathy, 09 patients had Chagas' disease, 04 had ischemic cardiomyopathy and 03 had idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Mean LVEF was 0. 37 and amiodarone was used by 94 % of the patients. Mean follow-up (FU) period was 25. 3 months. DFT was higher than maximum energy shock (MES) in 2 patients and it was necessary to implant an additional shock electrode (array). It was programmed MES in ventricular fibrillation <b>zone</b> of ICD <b>therapy</b> in the other patients. In the FU, 03 patients had 67 successful appropriate shock therapies (AST). There were 05 noncardiac and 02 heart failure deaths. The patients who died showed higher DFT levels (p= 0. 044) without correlation with death because there wasn't unsuccessful AST. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of ICD patients, the occurrence of elevated DFT (> 25 J) was low, leading to alternative therapies. There was an association with severe ventricular dysfunction, although without correlation to the causes of death...|$|R
40|$|Proton {{therapy is}} a recent type of {{radiotherapy}} that uses high-energy proton beams, and more recently carbon ion beams, to benefit of their physical selectivity. The energy deposited by these particle beams is inversely proportional to their velocity. Therefore they release most of the energy {{at the end of}} their path into the tissue. The energy is deposited in a few millimeters, in a zone called the Bragg peak. Before and after the Bragg peak the energy deposition is minimal. The depth and the width of the Bragg peak depends on the beam energy and on the density of tissues located along the beam path. By setting the beam energy, the Bragg peak can be positioned in the tumor site, avoiding the healthy tissues. Because of the sharpness of the Bragg peak <b>zone,</b> proton <b>therapy</b> is advantageous for tumors located near to important body part, such as the brain, spine, and neck. The drawback is that small uncertainties on particle range can have a serious impact on treatment and limit the efficiency of the proton therapy. To obtain more effective treatments in proton therapy real-time range verifications are necessary to perform on-line corrections of the delivered treatment. Among different techniques presented in the literature, positron emission tomography (PET) and prompt gamma imaging (PGI) are the most promising methods for in vivo range verification. PET and PGI are indirect approaches to measure protons penetration depth inside patients because they aim to detect secondary particles resulting from the interaction between proton beams and tissue nuclei. PET imaging detects coincidence gamma rays due to the production of positron emitters and requires some minutes to achieve enough statistics to have a sufficient signal to noise ratio. PGI instead uses prompt gamma rays generated by de-excitation of target nuclei; the quantity of these rays and their temporal emission (few nanoseconds) allow to perform a range verification during treatment with the PGI. Several research groups are evaluating different approaches to realize a prompt gamma imaging system suitable for the use in clinical condition and the optimization of a gamma-ray detector for PGI is still ongoing. The Gammarad project works in this direction and aims to develop an high-performance and solid-state gamma ray detection module (GDM) with a slit camera design. The project is based on a collaboration among Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK, Trento, Italy), Politecnico di Milano (Milano, Italy), the Trento Institute for Fundamental Physics and Applications (TIFPA, Trento, Italy), and the Proton Therapy Center of Trento (Italy). The project is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the technological development of a gamma-ray imaging module. This module is composed by a gamma-ray detector, based on a solid-state silicon sensor, and an integrated circuit. They are assembled into a compact module with data and control systems. The second part of the project will be dedicated to the experimental validation of the system both in laboratory with radioactive sources and in a real environment, that of proton therapy. The most innovative part of the gamma-ray detector developed for the project is the photo-sensor used for the scintillation light readout. In traditional applications it is a photomultiplier tube (PMT). However, in recent years, Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) has become increasingly popular in a variety of applications for its promising characteristics. Among them, current-generation SiPMs offer high gain, high Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE), excellent timing performance, high count-rate capability and good radiation hardness. Due to these characteristics they are used as PMTs replacement in several applications, such as in nuclear medicine (PET), in high-energy physics (calorimeters), astrophysics (Cherenkov telescopes) and in others single-photon or few-photon applications. For its characteristics, the SiPM is also very promising for the scintillator readout in prompt gamma imaging and in high energy gamma-ray spectroscopy. Detectors for these applications must be compact, robust, and insensitive to the magnetic field. They have to provide high performance in terms of spatial, temporal, and energy resolution. SiPMs can satisfy all these requirements but typically they have been used with relatively low energy gamma rays and low photon flux, so manufacturers have optimized them for these conditions. Because of the limited number of micro-cells in a standard SiPM, 625 cells/mm^ 2 with 40 µm cells, the detector response is non-linear in high energies condition. Increasing the cell density is extremely important to improve the linearity of the SiPM and to avoid the compression of the energy spectrum at high energies, which worsens the energy resolution and makes difficult the calibration of the detector. On the other hand, small cells provide a lower Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) because of the lower Fill Factor (FF) and as a consequence a lower energy resolution. Summarizing, the energy resolution at high energies is a trade-off between the excess noise factor (ENF) caused by the non-linearity of the SiPM and the PDE of the detector. Moreover, the small cell size provides an ultra-fast recovery time, in the order of a few of nanosecond for the smallest cells. A short recovery time together with a fast scintillator such a LYSO, reduces pile-up in high-rate applications, such as PGI. Based on the above considerations, the aim of this thesis is to develop an optimized gamma-ray detector composed of SiPMs for high-dynamic-range application, such as the scintillation light readout in prompt gamma imaging and in high-energy gamma-ray spectroscopy. SiPMs evaluated for the detector are High-Density (HD) and Ultra-High-Density (UHD) SiPM technologies recently produced at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). Instead of standard SiPMs, HD and UHD SiPMs have a very small micro-cell pitch, from 30 µm down to 5 µm with a cell density from 1600 cells/mm^ 2 to 46190 cells/mm^ 2, respectively. HD SiPMs are produced using a lithography technology with smaller critical dimensions and designed with trenches among SPADs. Small cells have a lower gain which helps to reduce correlated noise, such as After-Pulse and Cross-Talk. Trenches provide an optical and electrical cell isolation, and a smaller dead border around cells which increase the FF limiting PDE losses. UHD SiPMs push the limits of the HD technology even further, by reducing all the feature sizes, such as contacts, resistors and border region around cells. UHD SiPMs have hexagonal cells in a honeycomb configuration which generate a circular active area and a dead border around cells lower than 1 µm. The reduction of this dead boarder can improve the FF in smaller cells although it usually decrease with cell sizes. It is necessary understand how these significant layout changes affect the optical properties of SiPMs to evaluate which SiPM technology provides best performance in high-energy gamma-ray applications. In the first part of the thesis, I presents the characterization of HD and UHD SiPM technologies in terms of PDE, gain, Dark Count Rate, and correlated noise for the cell sizes between 30 and 7. 5 µm. The most important markers of SiPMs performance in gamma-ray spectroscopy are however the energy resolution and the linearity when coupled to the scintillator for the detection of high-energy gamma-rays. A typical characterization of the energy resolution of SiPMs, coupled to scintillator crystals, is performed with radioactive source up to 1. 5 MeV. However, PGI features gamma ray-energies up to 15 MeV which are not easily provided by the usual laboratory calibration sources. Extrapolating the behaviour of the detector from the "low" energy data is not correct and leads to unreliable data for calibration and performance estimation. Therefore, I developed a novel setup that simulates the LYSO light emission in response to gamma photons up to 30 MeV. A LED (emitting at 420 nm) is driven by a pulse generator, emulating the light emitted by a LYSO scintillator when excited by gamma rays. The pulse generator parameters (amplitude, duration, rise and fall time constants) are adjusted so that the LED emitted photons match the intensity and time distribution of the LYSO emission. The photon number in each light pulse is calibrated from the measurements at 511 keV obtained with a ^(22) Na source and a LYSO crystal coupled to the SiPMs. Using this LED setup I characterized the energy resolution and non-linearity of HD and UHD SiPMs in high-energy gamma-ray conditions. The second part of the thesis provides a detailed description of the scintillator setup and of the setup for the simulation of high-energy gamma-ray response, followed by the results of the characterization performing with these setups. Summarizing the results, the lowest non-linearity is provided by the technology with highest cell density, the RGB-UHD. For the 10 and 12. 5 µm-cells we obtained values of 4. 5...|$|R
