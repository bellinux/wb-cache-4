5|$|The <b>zygomatic</b> {{plates are}} almost {{completely}} vertical. As Winge already noted, the front {{margin of the}} <b>zygomatic</b> plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the <b>zygomatic</b> plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the <b>zygomatic</b> plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the <b>zygomatic</b> arches is bended forward and the <b>zygomatic</b> plates are bended outward. Furthermore, the <b>zygomatic</b> notch, the notch between the <b>zygomatic</b> plate and arch, is deep, not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|E
5|$|Other {{features}} of the skull distinguish the two genera. The tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, is much reduced in Voalavo relative to Eliurus. The subsquamosal fenestrae, openings in the squamosal bone {{at the back of the}} skull, are larger in Voalavo than in Eliurus. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate, a plate at the sides of the skull that roots the front part of the <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones), is narrower in Voalavo, and lacks a clear <b>zygomatic</b> notch (a notch formed by a projection at the front of the <b>zygomatic</b> plate), which is present in Eliurus. Among nesomyines, only Brachytarsomys has a more reduced <b>zygomatic</b> notch.|$|E
5|$|The front (rostral) part of {{the skull}} is shortshorter and broader than in T.hylophilusand flat and the notches in the <b>zygomatic</b> plates at the sides are poorly developed. The plates {{themselves}} are broad. The <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow interorbital region (between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped. The braincase is robust.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow <b>zygomatic</b> plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The <b>zygomatic</b> notch, a notch in the upper part of the <b>zygomatic</b> plate, is small. The <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the <b>zygomatic</b> plates, the flattened front portions of the <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its <b>zygomatic</b> plates. These genera also share relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate, the {{flattened}} front part of the <b>zygomatic</b> arch, is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the <b>zygomatic</b> arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate is broad and includes a well-developed <b>zygomatic</b> notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The <b>zygomatic</b> arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate is narrow and lacks a <b>zygomatic</b> notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The <b>zygomatic</b> notch, an extension at the front of the <b>zygomatic</b> plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the <b>zygomatic</b> arch (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The <b>zygomatic</b> notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the <b>zygomatic</b> arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The <b>zygomatic</b> notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} <b>zygomatic</b> plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate, the {{flattened}} front {{part of the}} <b>zygomatic</b> arch, is narrow, with poorly developed <b>zygomatic</b> notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>zygomatic</b> plates (plates of bone at {{the side}} of the skull) are variable, their size is {{generally}} intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight to a little concave. The <b>zygomatic</b> notches, projections at the front of the plates, are better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the braincase is high, the <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones) are {{broad and}} squared, and the incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the palate between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} broad. The upper incisors are orthodont, with their cutting edge nearly vertical. Morphometrically, the skull of O.peninsulae is sharply distinct from other western Mexican Oryzomys.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its <b>zygomatic</b> plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body of the skull, and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the <b>zygomatic</b> arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate is broad and has a well-developed <b>zygomatic</b> notch at its front. The <b>zygomatic</b> arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a process at the back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The cranial {{features}} Ocepeia {{shares with}} primitive eutherians include eye-sockets (orbits) set further {{back on the}} skull, relatively narrow cheek bones (<b>zygomatic</b> arches), and details of the inner ear, while characters it shares with paenungulates their paenungulate-like ancestors include a wide nasal cavity and a very short bony projection in the eye-socket. Pneumatized skulls are also found in larger proboscideans (e.g. elephants, mastodons, and other extinct relatives).|$|E
5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the back margin of the <b>zygomatic</b> plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, {{connected}} to the <b>zygomatic</b> arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short {{front part}} (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located between the eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the front part of the palate, are very broad and extend between the first molars. The <b>zygomatic</b> plates, the flattened anterior portions of the <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed notches at their front ends. The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E
5|$|Traits of O.hammondi that {{supported}} the latter placement include: a relatively short palate that does not extend behind the maxillary bones; simple posterolateral palatal pits; absence of a capsular process (a raising of the bone of the mandible, or lower jaw, at {{the back end of}} the incisor); and presence of the posteroloph on the upper third molar (a crest {{at the back of the}} tooth). In these characters, O.hammondi differs from many or most Oryzomyini and is similar to some species outside Oryzomyini, but all traits of O.hammondi are present in at least one other member of the tribe. Traits shared by O.hammondi and Oecomys included: tail with the same coloration above and below (unicolored); parietal bones extending to the sides of the skull; narrow <b>zygomatic</b> plate, without a <b>zygomatic</b> notch; posteroloph present on upper third molar; mesoflexus (a valley in the molar crown in front of the mesoloph crest) on upper second molar not divided in two.|$|E
5|$|Medium in {{size for}} its genus, {{it was first}} {{described}} as a separate species, but later lumped into other, widespread species until it was reinstated as separate in 2009. It is distinctive in fur color—grayish brown on the forequarters and reddish brown on the hindquarters—and in some dimensions of its skull, with a high braincase, robust <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones), and long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars).|$|E
5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate, a bony plate {{at the side}} of the skull, was broad. The bony palate was long and flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E
5|$|The greater noctule bat has {{a robust}} skull and its rostrum is square with an {{ordinary}} nasal slit. The <b>zygomatic</b> arches are very slender and the braincase is smooth, turned upwards. The sagittal crest is not present, while the lambdoid crest is well developed. Most of the projecting {{point of the}} skull {{is made up of}} exoccipital condyles. The basisphenoid is wide and deep and the tympanic bullae are relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The interorbital {{region is}} 4.14mm {{long and the}} <b>zygomatic</b> plate is 2.38mm. The {{diastema}} (gap) between the incisors and molars is 6.39mm long. The incisive foramina are 5.25mm long and 1.77mm broad. The palatal bridge (the portion of the palate between the incisive foramina and the mesopterygoid fossa behind {{the back end of}} the palate) is 4.29mm long and 2.75mm broad at the first molars. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long and M1 is 1.19mm broad. These measurements make J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} has a large, {{flattened}} skull {{with a short}} and broad rostrum. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend back beyond {{the point where the}} lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. In P. o. planirostris, the rostrum is flatter than in mainland Florida forms, in which it is more convex, and the nasals are said to be relatively longer in P. o. argentatus. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate, the flattened front part of the <b>zygomatic</b> arch (cheekbone), is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The arches themselves are robust and contain small but distinct jugal bones. The sphenopalatine foramen, an opening {{in the side of the}} skull above the molars, is large; it is much smaller in O.couesi. The narrowest part of the region between the eyes is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The marsh rice rat has a narrow braincase lined by prominent ridges and a narrow interparietal bone. According to Goldman, Florida animals (P. o. coloratus and P. o. natator) generally have the largest and broadest skulls, and the western specimen (P. o. texensis) has a somewhat smaller and narrower skull than those from the east outside Florida (P. o. palustris). In P. o. argentatus, the skull is also relatively narrow.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The <b>zygomatic</b> arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge toward the front. The jugal bone is small.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is narrow and extends back to the front margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Zygoma implant; a long implant {{that can}} anchor to the cheek bone by {{passing through the}} maxillary sinus to retain a {{complete}} upper denture when bone is absent. While <b>zygomatic</b> implants offer a novel approach to severe bone loss in the upper jaw, {{it has not been}} shown to offer any advantage over bone grafting functionally although it may offer a less invasive option, {{depending on the size of}} the reconstruction required.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to that of}} Nectomys, {{the skull}} is lightly built and has narrow nasals and a broad, round braincase without {{conspicuous}} ridges on it. The <b>zygomatic</b> plate is broad. The incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate) extend between the first molars and are broadest in their back halves. The broad mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind {{the end of the}} palate, is perforated by sphenopalatine vacuities. The molar crowns are not as simplified as in Nectomys species, but the front cusps of the upper (anterocone) and lower first molar (anteroconid) are not divided in two. In addition to the main roots, the upper and lower first molars have smaller additional roots.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, V-shaped nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and <b>zygomatic</b> bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a {{large and}} long-tailed Oryzomys. The upperparts are brightly ochraceous, {{becoming}} grayer toward the front. The hairs on the underparts are pale gray near the bases and white in the outer half, so that the underparts appear pale grayish according to Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales (not white as claimed by Merriman). The tail is dark above and light below. The skull and molars are relatively robust. O.albiventer has broad <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones), long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars), and long nasal bones that extend behind the premaxillary bones. Compared to its lowland relative O.couesi mexicanus, O.albiventer is larger and more brightly colored and has larger molars but narrower incisive foramina.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys zygomaticus {{was first}} {{described}} by Merriam in 1901 {{as a separate}} species similar to mexicanus, but with the <b>zygomatic</b> arches broadly spreading and curved downward. Goldman, who reduced it to a subspecies of couesi, recorded it from southwestern Guatemala and nearby Chiapas and described it as slightly paler than O.c.couesi but darker than O.c.mexicanus. Three specimens from central El Salvador have Cytb sequences {{similar to those of}} zygomaticus, but in The Mammals of El Salvador (1961), Burt and Stirton recorded only the subspecies couesi from the country, while noting that specimens from some localities were slightly paler than others.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse has a {{large and}} robust skull with {{well-developed}} <b>zygomatic</b> arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region of the skull (between the eyes) is smooth, as in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of the bastard big-footed mouse. The palate is broad and the incisive foramina (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad. In the mandible (lower jaw), {{the root of the}} lower incisor is housed in a distinct capsular process, a protuberance {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The lower masseteric ridge (a crest on the outer side of the mandible) is prominent. As is typical of Macrotarsomys, the molars are cuspidate and low-crowned.|$|E
5|$|The {{back margin}} of the <b>zygomatic</b> plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive {{foramina}} do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A strut of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{generally}} {{similar to that}} of Oryzomys couesi, as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, was small and narrow. The bony palate extended beyond the third molars. The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in O.couesi. On average, the incisive foramina, which perforate the front part of the palate, were shorter than in O.couesi. The <b>zygomatic</b> arch (cheekbone) appears to have been better developed in O.antillarum.|$|E
