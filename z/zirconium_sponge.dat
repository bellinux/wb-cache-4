40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{production}} of nitride nuclear fuel for use in fast nuclear reactors, zirconium is hydrided followed by nitriding and mixing with uranium nitride. This work concludes a study of unwanted metallic particles present in a powder that {{is supposed to be a}} <b>zirconium</b> hydride. <b>Sponge</b> <b>zirconium</b> was hydrided at different temperatures and different time intervals, and the resulting hydride was milled into a powder. The powders were analyzed using SEM and XRD after which the powders were pressed into pellets for light optical microscopic study. The primary goals were determination of the structure of the particles and thereafter elimination of them. It was seen that hydriding at 500 C results in less metal particles but more experiments need to be conducted to confirm this...|$|R

40|$|As {{a widely}} {{applicable}} alloying material, zirconium {{is an essential}} part of many industries (aerospace, nuclear engineering, precision machining, etc.) and is often demanded in high purity. A systemic study was therefore launched in order to combat a trace-level coloration defect discovered in industrial-grade <b>zirconium</b> <b>sponge.</b> The wide variety of morphological features and coloration effects presented by the defect films (iridescent blue/purple, mosso/olive green, brown, brick, red, golden/straw, etc.) which are observed concurrently makes traditional microscopy and spectroscopy an ideal avenue for investigating the composition and formation mechanisms of the films...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of zirconium {{in a wide variety}} of applications, defect identification, isolation, and prevention is critical. In this study, an unknown coloration defect on the surface of porous industrial <b>zirconium</b> <b>sponge</b> is assessed. Various microscopy and spectroscopy techniques (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth profiling, and Raman spectroscopy) are implemented to assist with characterization of impurities and compound identification. The combined effect of sample porosity and overlap of core-shell excitations provides a unique challenge in spectrum analysis, particularly with respect to background function computation. Various curve fitting and data analysis techniques are applied and compared in order to weigh their efficacy in quantifying the chemical state and other characteristics of the specimen. Peak-specific cumulative distribution functions are weighed against the Shirley background in terms of their impact on reliable spectrum quantification. In addition, the quantification merits of various peak functional forms and techniques for establishing reliable fitting in depth profiles are discussed. These analyses suggests that the defect film is zirconium dioxide colorized by trace impurities (principally Fe, Cl, and Mg) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{program for}} {{investigating}} gas pressure buildup in thermoelectric generators was initiated in February 1963 and continued through December 1963. The program objectives were {{to determine the}} source(s) of internal gas pressure increase in SNAP thermoelectric generators, establish methods of alleviating or eliminating the condition, and conduct a proof-of-principle test on an electrically heated 60 -watt thermoelectric SNAP generator to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} procedures developed to control or eliminate the condition. The gas pressure increase in the generators that were initially filled with dry inert gas results from decomposition of the phenol-formaldehyde resin that is used as a binder in the Min-K 1301 thermal insulation and desorption of atmospheric gases and water vapor that adsorb {{on the surface of the}} insulation. The degree of gas release in both cases was determined to be temperature and pressure dependent. The recommended procedure to control gas pressure buildup for all future generators is: (1) precondition the Min-K by burning off the phenolic resin binder; (2) vacuum outgas the insulation at a temperature above its maximum operating temperature; and (3) install a gas getter (zirconium) to absorb any gases that may be released during subsequent generator operation. The complete recommended procedure to control this pressure buildup could not be employed in the 60 -watt thermoelectric SNAP generator test since the generator had been previously constructed and assembled using Min-K that had not been preconditioned by outgassing. Therefore, a modified outgassing procedure was established for the generator when the test was initiated. The procedure, in essence, specified that the generator be maintained on continuous evacuation while the thermoelement hot junction temperature was slowly increased to approximates 525 deg F, and that the generator be subjected to frequent rapid evacuations and gas changes as the temperature was increased to 960 deg F. (Lead telluride thermoelements begin to sublime in a vacuum at elevated temperatures in the 950 to 1000 deg F range.) An amount of 2, 143 grams of <b>zirconium</b> <b>sponge</b> were inserted in the hottest region of the generator to react with getterable gases that remained after the outgassing and evacuation procedure. The 60 -watt electrically heated SNAP generator was then maintained on a stability test for two months. The generator internal gas fill pressure remained essentially constant throughout the period, demonstrating that the recommended control procedure will alleviate the internal gas pressure buildup condition.
