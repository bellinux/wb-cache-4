Spinel (Zn, Fe) Fe2O4 appears as a tan-colored solid that is insoluble in water, acids, or diluted alkali. [...] Because of their high opacity, zinc ferrites can be used as pigments, especially in applications requiring heat stability.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>zinc</b> <b>ferrites</b> can be used as regenerable sorbents for hot coal gas {{desulfurization}} in IGCC processes. The H 2 S concentration in the outlet gas from a fixed-bed reactor can be as low as a few ppmv and the sorbent conversion at breakthrough may be above 70 %, indicating that the sorbent reactivity in the sulfidation process is high. Experiments show that the reactivity is highly dependent on the calcination temperature used for spinel formation, the concentration of component oxides above or below stoichiometry and the possible use of γ-alumina as an inert diluent or support. These features are frequently associated with structural changes occurring both in the fresh or regenerated and in the sulfided sorbent, but, unfortunately, these changes are not detected by the usual characterization techniques. In this study, the structural changes occurring in <b>zinc</b> <b>ferrites</b> during calcination at high temperature or regeneration in oxidant atmosphere and those in iron sulfides during the sulfidation process have been investigated in detail by Moessbauer spectroscopy (MS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rietveld methods for structure refinement.

The cation distributions were estimated from X-ray diffraction intensities of various planes. The theoretical lattice parameter, bulk density, porosity, X-ray density, oxygen positional parameter, ionic radii, jump length, as well as bonds and edges lengths of the tetrahedral (A-) and octahedral (B-) sites were determined. Fe 57 Mössbauer spectra recorded at room temperature were fitted with two sextets corresponding to Fe 3 + ions at tetrahedral (A-) and octahedral (B-) sites. The magnetic hyperfine fields at A- and B-sites show a gradual decrease with increase of Al 3 + ion concentration, which has been explained {{on the basis of}} supertransferred hyperfine field. The cation distribution obtained from X-ray intensities and Mössbauer data indicates a decrease in Fe 3 +(B) /Fe 3 +(A) ratio with increasing aluminum concentration thereby suggesting a decrease in ferrimagnetic behavior...|$|R
