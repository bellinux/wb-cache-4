40|$|The {{information}} that can be conveyed through a wireless channel, with multiple-antenna equipped transmitter and receiver, crucially depends on the channel behavior {{as well as on the}} input structure. In this paper, we present very recent analytical results, concerning the probability density function (pdf) of the output of a single-user, multiple-antenna communication. The analysis is carried out under the assumption of an optimized input structure, and assuming Gaussian noise and block-fading. A further simplification of the output pdf expression presented in our last paper is derived, without the need for resorting to involved integration rules over unitary matrices.

The multivariate Rodrigues formulae are useful in asymptotic multivariate distribution theory for matrix variates. We consider the general forms of the series (Edgeworth) expansions for distributions of both symmetric and rectangular random matrices, and then give an asymptotic (Edgeworth) expansion for the distribution of a scale mixture matrix, as a simple example. As for the Laguerre polynomials, alternative forms of differential equations are derived.
