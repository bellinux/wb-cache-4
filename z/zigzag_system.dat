Based on no private information, but on the known zigzag principle, it was clear that for a further promotion, {{there had to be a}} move to some other part of the Curia. In fact, when the building blocks of a wider series of curial changes were in place, Archbishop Noè was soon transferred to a completely different area and became Delegate of the Fabric of St. Peter, an entity that is not part of the Roman Curia, but recognized by the 1988 apostolic constitution Pastor bonus as [...] "closely associated with the Holy See." [...] The appointment took effect on 24 May 1989. In formal terms the new posting was of equivalent rank to Archbishop Noè's previous appointment. However, it was clearly a promotion in that he was now the number two of an organization that had considerable administrative and financial autonomy and a large workforce, perhaps 6-7 times as many as his former Congregation and perhaps 20 times as many as its liturgical section. Moreover, the elderly head of the Fabric of St. Peter, cardinal Aurelio Sabattani (1983-1991), was not then in robust health, so authority resided in practice with Archbishop Noè, who in fact was given additionally the title of Coadjutor Archpriest of St. Peter's Basilica.|$|E

Among three types of optimized periodical configurations, only in the <b>zigzag</b> <b>systems</b> the band gaps can be remarkably modulated by H-concentrations. There exist middle-gap semiconductors, narrow-gap semiconductors, and gapless systems. The band structures exhibit the rich features, including the destruction or recovery of the Dirac-cone structure, newly formed critical points, weakly dispersive bands, and (C,H) -related partially flat bands. The orbital-projected DOS are evidenced by the low-energy prominent peaks, delta-function-like peaks, discontinuous shoulders, and logarithmically divergent peaks.

40|$|The alkali-adsorbed {{graphene}} nanoribbons {{exhibit the}} feature-rich electronic and magnetic properties.

These mainly arise from a single $s- 2 p_z$ orbital hybridization in the adatom-carbon bond.

With the growing adoption of HTML 5 APIs such as postMessage, client-side validation (CSV) vulnerabilities are conse-quently becoming increasingly important to address as well. However, while detecting and preventing attacks against web applications is a well-studied topic on the server, considerably less work has been performed for the client. Exacerbating this issue is the problem that de-fenses against CSVsmust, in the general case, fundamen-tally exist in the browser, rendering current server-side defenses inadequate. In this paper, we present <b>ZigZag,</b> a <b>system</b> for hard-ening JavaScript-based web applications against client-side validation attacks. ZigZag transparently instru-ments client-side code to perform dynamic invariant de-tection on security-sensitive code, generating models that describe how – and with whom – client-side com-ponents interact. ZigZag is capable of handling tem-plated JavaScript, avoiding full re-instrumentation when JavaScript programs are structurally similar. Learned in-variants are then enforced through a subsequent instru-mentation step. Our evaluation demonstrates that ZigZag is capable of automatically hardening client-side code against both known and previously-unknown vulnerabil-ities. Finally, we show that ZigZag introduces acceptable overhead in many cases, and is compatible with popular websites drawn from the Alexa Top 20 without developer or user intervention. ...|$|R

Based on the Z-precedence and characteristics of the checkpoint pattern, we propose original algorithms for the progressive construction of consistent global checkpoints.

These basic cave data are important to help improve palaeoclimatic speleothem sample selection, because speleothem geochemistry is also controlled by cave geometry and micro-meteorology. Hokkai Cave is a 479. 8 m-long, <b>zigzag,</b> horizontal <b>system,</b> with two entrances. The cave floor is mainly covered with clay, gravels and breakdown blocks. An underground river flows in the centre of the cave and a dry riverbed, and many springs and dolines are present around the cave. Pure white stalagmites in the cave are possibly suitable for use in Asian Summer Monsoon reconstruction studies. Air temperature in the inner cave (> 15 m from entrances) was stable throughout the year (7. 5 – 7. 7 °C); in contrast, air temperature near the entrance was variable because of the influence of the outside air temperature. Inversion of airflow direction is driven by the air temperature gradient between the inside and the outside of the cave. When air temperature inside is warmer than outside, air flows from Ent. U (upper) to Ent. L (lower) and from Ent. U to the inside. When air temperature outside is warmer than inside, air flows from Ent. L to Ent. U and from the inner cave to Ent. U. These results agree with findings from previous studies. Inversion of airflow direction also affects the variation pattern of air temperature near the entrances. Monitoring also indicates that the underground river is usually dry except after heavy rainfall or snow melting...|$|R

It is {{shown that the}} isosteric heats of adsorption for CO 2 (17. 7 kJ?mol- 1) and CH 4 (14. 4 kJ?mol- 1) do not vary with increasing amount of adsorbed gases. The higher value of isosteric heat for CO 2 {{is an indication of}} the stronger interaction between the CO 2 and the Co 3 (HCOO) 6 membrane. The Co 3 (HCOO) 6 membrane is studied by binary gas permeation of CO 2 and CH 4 at different temperatures (0, 25, and 60 ?é. The membrane has CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity with a separation factor higher than 10, which is due to the unique structure and molecular sieving effect. Upon increasing the temperature from 0 to 60 ?ì the preferred permeance of CO 2 over CH 4 is increased from 1. 70 ױ 0 - 6 to 2. 09 ױ 0 - 6 mol?m- 2 s- 1 ?Pa- 1, while the separation factor for CO 2 /CH 4 shows a corresponding decrease from 15. 95 to 10. 37.

Results showed successful rearing of Penaeus monodon (nauplii-postlarvae) in systems with facilities for wastewater recirculation.

For broodstock maturation, a recirculating system with a preconditioned biological filter was compared with a flow-through system. Biological filtration proved to be useful in meeting water quality requirements. Nitrification was satisfactory with ammonia levels lower than 1 Â· 0 mg liter âˆ’ 1. The pH values in the biofilter effluent were maintained at 7 Â· 8 â€“ 8 Â· 3. BOD 5 levels were below 10 mg liter âˆ’ 1 while DO tended to drop due to the nitrifying activity of the filter.

On the other hand, in the ladder, the spin correlation on the rung remains robust and the spin gap exists. Key words: orbital degree of freedom, geometrical frustration, density matrix renormalization group method Frustration among competing interactions is a key issue to bring richness of cooperative phenomena in magnetic systems [1]. For instance, antiferromagnets with the triangle-base structure possess frustration, since it is impossible to satisfy all the interactions. To suppress the effect of frustration, spins compromise with each other to take the noncollinear 120 ◦ structure. On the other hand, when electrons partially fill degenerate orbitals, it is necessary to consider the orbital as an internal degree of freedom in addition to the spin. The spatial anisotropy of the orbital causes electron hopping between orbitals depending on the direction, hence it is important to take account of the lattice geometry to understand the spin-orbital structure even in a simple cubic lattice. In particular, it is interesting to consider the effect of the orbital anisotropy on the frustrated lattice. In this paper, we investigate the eg-orbital degenerate Hubbard model at quarter filling on the zigzag chain and the ladder.
