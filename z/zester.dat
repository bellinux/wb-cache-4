50|$|A <b>zester</b> (also, citrus <b>zester</b> or lemon <b>zester)</b> is {{a kitchen}} utensil for obtaining zest from lemons and other citrus fruit. A kitchen <b>zester</b> is {{approximately}} four inches long, with a handle and a curved metal end, {{the top of}} which is perforated with a row of round holes with sharpened rims. To operate, the <b>zester</b> is pressed with moderate force against the fruit and drawn across its peel. The rims cut the zest from the pith underneath. The zest is cut into ribbons, one drawn through each hole.|$|E

40|$|Electrophoresis: A {{simplified}} method for extracting peroxidase from stem was developed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis successfully resolved peroxidases (EC 1. 11. 1. 7) {{for use as}} a character in cultivar identification of Corylus avellana. The technique involved cutting a sample of cambial tissue with a citrus <b>zester.</b> In a microcentrifuge tube the material was submerged in extraction buffer and pounded with a plastic pestle. Of the range of buffer components tested Tris, glycerol, EDTA, PVP- 40 & DTT were adopted. When analysing samples from dispersed sites the selection of stem material and its post-harvest care were important factors to consider. A laboratory manual was written to assist other researchers using the process. Hazelnut: A review of cultivar introduction to Australia yielded over 80 names for the past century. Isolated research had taken place in Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales. An essay on the use of hazelnut as food found three distinct markets where local production could be sold. Peroxidase was used to identify Australian cultivars. Trials were also developed to examine the reproduction of hazelnut. A bibliography of literature was assembled as a reference source for future researchers. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) is characterised by maternal hyperglyceamia first recognised during pregnancy. GDM produces chronic foetal hyperglyceamia and expressional changes in foetal endothelial cells (ECs). Epigenetic modulation of foetal endothelial genes by the intra-uterine environment has been proposed. MicroRNAs (miRs) inhibit {{the expression of}} their mRNA targets and have been implicated in diabetes-induced endothelial dysfunction. MiR- 101 impairs EC in part via direct inhibition of the methyltransferase Enhancer of <b>Zester</b> Homolog 2 (EZH 2) which catalysed the trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H 3 (H 3 K 27 m 3). We aimed to characterize the molecular and functional impact of GDM on the foetal ECs derived from the umbilical cord vein (HUVECs). HUVECs prepared from GDM or healthy pregnancies, were assessed for apoptosis, migration, and angiogenic capacity. GDM-HUVECs showed decreased functional capacities, increased miR- 101, reduced EZH 2 and H 3 K 27 m 3 expression. In GDM-HUVECs, miR- 101 inhibition increased EZH 2 expression, improved survival and endothelial functions. Moreover, cultured healthy-HUVECs were exposed to high (25 mM, HG) or normal (5 mM) D-glucose concentrations for 48 hours before being assessed for the aforementioned assay and for miR- 101 and EZH 2 expression. Similarly to GDM, in vitro HG impaired healthy-HUVEC function and elicited a concomitant increased in miR- 101. In conclusion GMD and HG impair HUVEC functions in part also via miR- 101 upregulation...|$|E
40|$|Objective : Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) produces fetal hyperglycemia with increased lifelong risks for the exposed offspring of cardiovascular and other diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms induce long-term gene expression changes {{in response to}} in utero environmental perturbations. Moreover, microRNAs (miRs) control the function of endothelial cells (ECs) under physiological and pathological conditions and can target the epigenetic machinery. We investigated the functional and expressional effect of GDM on human fetal ECs of the umbilical cord vein (HUVECs). We focused on miR- 101 and 1 of its targets, enhancer of <b>zester</b> homolog- 2 (EZH 2), which trimethylates the lysine 27 of histone 3, thus repressing gene transcription. EZH 2 exists as isoforms Œ± and Œ≤. Approach and Results : HUVECs were prepared from GDM or healthy pregnancies and tested in apoptosis, migration, and Matrigel assays. GDM-HUVECs demonstrated decreased functional capacities, increased miR- 101 expression, and reduced EZH 2 - Œ≤ and trimethylation of histone H 3 on lysine 27 levels. MiR- 101 inhibition increased EZH 2 expression and improved GDM-HUVEC function. Healthy HUVECs were exposed to high or normal D-glucose concentration for 48 hours and then tested for miR- 101 and EZH 2 expression. Similar to GDM, high glucose increased miR- 101 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using an antibody for EZH 2 followed by polymerase chain reaction analyses for miR- 101 gene promoter regions showed that both GDM and high glucose concentration reduced EZH 2 binding to the miR- 101 locus in HUVECs. Moreover, EZH 2 -Œ≤ overexpression inhibited miR- 101 promoter activity in HUVECs. Conclusions : GDM impairs HUVEC function via miR- 101 upregulation. EZH 2 is both a transcriptional inhibitor and a target gene of miR- 101 in HUVECs, and it contributes {{to some of the}} miR- 101 -induced defects of GDM-HUVECs...|$|E

Histone methylation is a dynamic process regulated by both histone demethylase and histone methyltransferase, which ultimately alters the levels of gene transcription. However, the relationship between histone demethylase and histone methyltransferase, {{as well as their}} regulatory mechanisms in ovarian cancer development, is still unclear. Lysine-specific demethylase 2 B (KDM 2 B) is a key demethylase of H 3 K 36 me 3 and H 3 K 4 me 3 that regulates gene expression and plays a role in tumorigenesis via epigenetic mechanisms. To determine the expression pattern of KDM 2 B in ovarian neoplasms, we analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of KDM 2 B and the histone methyltransferase enhancer of <b>zester</b> homolog 2 (EZH 2) in normal, benign, borderline, and malignant ovarian tissue samples. We found that KDM 2 B expression was gradually increased in ovarian tumors, with the highest expression found in the malignant ovarian tissues, and the differences in KDM 2 B expression among the different International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages and pathological grades/types were statistically significant. Moreover, KDM 2 B expression was positively correlated with EZH 2 expression in ovarian tissues. To determine the role of KDM 2 B in tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo, we silenced KDM 2 B expression in ovarian cancer cells using the KDM 2 B short hairpin RNA expression lentivirus and established a nude mouse xenograft model. Downregulation of endogenous KDM 2 B decreased the expression of EZH 2 and reduced the proliferation and migration of ovarian cancer cells. Loss of KDM 2 B suppressed ovarian tumor formation in vivo. Our results suggest that KDM 2 B {{plays an important role in}} the tumorigenesis of ovarian cancer, with a possible mechanism of increasing the expression of the oncogene EZH 2; this indicates that certain histone methyltransferase may be positively regulated by certain histone demethylase in the epigenetic regulation of ovarian tumors. KDM 2 B may be a novel therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer. Keywords: ovarian cancer, KDM 2 B, EZH 2, epigenetic regulation, tumor formation¬†...|$|E
