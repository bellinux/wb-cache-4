L-NAME attenuated reflex-evoked urethral relaxations (65 ± 10 %), while <b>zaprinast</b> potentiated these responses (68 ± 24 %). L-NAME and <b>zaprinast</b> also increased baseline urethral pressure and urethral striated muscle (EUS-EMG) activity. These drugs {{had little effect}} on the bladder. Following pre-treatment with α-bungarotoxin (i. v.) to block urethral striated muscle, L-NAME and <b>zaprinast</b> failed to increase baseline urethral pressure. Further <b>zaprinast</b> failed to alter the size of reflex-evoked urethral relaxations. Intra-urethral <b>zaprinast</b> caused a significant increase while sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and isoprenaline caused decreases in urethral pressure (+ 14 ± 3 %, − 25 ± 5 %, − 29 ± 7 %, respectively). These changes were associated with increases in EUS-EMG activity. After chlorisondamine (i. v.), <b>zaprinast</b> caused a significant fall in urethral pressure, while the decrease in urethral pressure caused by SNP and isoprenaline was potentiated. No changes in EUS-EMG activity occurred. These results indicate that a nitrergic pathway mediates reflex-evoked urethral smooth muscle relaxations. The data also indicates that there is a background release of NO, which reduces sphincter skeletal muscle activity. Further, the ability of <b>zaprinast</b> to potentiate nitrergic evoked urethral relaxations involves an increase in striated muscle tone.

40|$|<b>Zaprinast</b> accelerates {{recovery}} from established {{acute renal failure}} in the rat. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) has been demonstrated {{to be effective in}} the treatment of acute renal failure (ARF) in both rat and humans. The biological effects of ANF are presumed to be mediated by the generation of intracellular 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Therefore, the current investigation examined whether <b>zaprinast</b> (M&B 22948), a guanosine 3 ′, 5 ′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) -specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, would be effective in the treatment of established acute renal failure in the rat. Acute renal failure was induced by 60 minutes of bilateral renal artery clamping. Twenty-four hours after the ischemic insult, rats received either vehicle (5 % Dextrose), <b>zaprinast</b> (0. 03 or 0. 3 mg/kg/min) or ANF 24 (0. 2 µg/kg/min) intravenously for four hours. Renal function, as measured by daily serum creatinine (days 1 to 7) and day 2 inulin clearances, was dramatically improved by <b>zaprinast</b> but not ANF treatment. Forty-eight hours post-renal ischemia, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 0. 14 ± 0. 04 (ml/min/ 100 g body wt) in the vehicle and 0. 94 ± 0. 29 in the <b>zaprinast</b> treated animals. To evaluate the mechanism by which <b>zaprinast</b> accelerated renal recovery, we measured regional blood flow in the postischemic rat kidneys during drug treatment with a laser doppler flowmeter. Both high and low dose <b>zaprinast</b> significantly increased cortical (17 %) and outer medullary blood flow (40 % and 60 %), an effect not seen with ANF. In summary, <b>zaprinast</b> is effective in the treatment of established ischemic ARF. The mechanism by which <b>zaprinast</b> accelerates renal recovery is due to its unique ability to stimulate regional renal blood flow and increase intracellular cGMP in the setting of tissue ischemia...|$|E

To test this hypothesis the activity of cGMP-PDE and the concentration of cGMP were evaluated in vitro in the renal tissue of 10 control rats and 10 cirrhotic rats with ascites {{before and after the}} intravenous (IV) administration of <b>Zaprinast</b> (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), a specific cGMP-PDE inhibitor (30 microgram/kg/min). Moreover, the effects of the intravenous administration of <b>Zaprinast</b> (15 microgram/kg/min and 30 microgram/kg/min) on renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urinary sodium excretion (U(Na) V) were evaluated in 10 conscious control rats and 10 conscious cirrhotic rats with ascites. The effects of <b>Zaprinast</b> on plasma renin activity (PRA) was also evaluated in 10 control rats and in 10 cirrhotic rats with ascites. Finally, the effect of <b>Zaprinast</b> on RPF, GFR, and U(Na) V were evaluated in 10 cirrhotic rats after the IV administration of the ENP-receptor antagonist, HS- 142 - 1. The renal content of cGMP was reduced in cirrhotic rats because of increased activity of cGMP-PDE. <b>Zaprinast</b> inhibited cGMP-PDE activity and increased the renal content of cGMP in these animals. The inhibition of cGMP-PDE was associated with an increase in RPF, GFR, and U(Na) V and a reduction in PRA. HS- 142 - 1 prevented any renal effect of <b>Zaprinast</b> in cirrhotic rats.

Urinary sodium, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) excretion, and D 1 R protein expression and localization in renal tubules were evaluated in PAN-NS and control rats before and during volume expansion (VE). The effects of <b>zaprinast</b> (phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor), alone or in combination with Sch- 23390 (D 1 R antagonist), were examined in both groups.

This was accompanied in PAN-NS by a marked decrease of D 1 R expression in the renal tubules. Infusion of <b>zaprinast</b> in PAN-NS resulted in increased urinary excretion of cGMP and sodium to similar levels of control rats and increased expression of D 1 R in the plasma membrane of renal tubular cells.

The initial tachycardia caused by GR 138950 or enalapril but not hydralazine was attenuated by L-NAME pretreatment. L-NAME alone caused a transient (20 [*]min) pressor response and a prolonged (6 [*]h) bradycardia in conscious RALH rats. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not affect the cardiovascular effect of GR 138950 in conscious RALH rats. Indomethacin alone did not significantly change basal blood pressure or heart rate in RALH rats. <b>Zaprinast</b> pretreatment did not affect the antihypertensive effect of GR 138950 in conscious RALH rats but potentiated the depressor response to sodium nitroprusside. <b>Zaprinast</b> alone caused a small reduction in basal blood pressure but did not change basal heart rate in RALH rats. The antihypertensive effect of GR 138950 was not associated with an increase in plasma or urine cyclic GMP levels in conscious RALH rats, whereas <b>zaprinast</b> caused a small fall in blood pressure associated with increases in plasma and urine cyclic GMP. The ability of L-NAME to inhibit the antihypertensive action of GR 138950 or enalapril suggests that these agents release nitric oxide (NO) and/or enhance the cardiovascular effects of NO as part of their mechanism of action.

Therefore, we studied the effects of the pan-cGMP PDE inhibitor <b>zaprinast</b> on the metabolic and vascular actions of insulin in muscle. Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps (3 mU·min− 1 ·kg− 1) were performed in anesthetized rats and changes in microvascular blood flow assessed from rates of 1 -methylxanthine metabolism across the muscle bed by capillary xanthine oxidase in response to insulin and <b>zaprinast.</b> We also characterized cGMP PDE isoform expression in muscle by real-time PCR and immunostaining of frozen muscle sections. <b>Zaprinast</b> enhanced insulin-mediated microvascular perfusion by 29 % and muscle glucose uptake by 89 %, while whole body glucose infusion rate during insulin infusion was increased by 33 % at 2 h.

When the cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase of mesangial cells was blocked with <b>zaprinast,</b> the ST-dependent relaxation, assessed both by morphological and biochemical criteria, significantly increased with respect to the experiments performed without <b>zaprinast.</b> These results support a role for cGMP in the ST-dependent relaxation of cultured rat mesangial cells. The increased cGMP synthesis appears to be the consequence of the activation of some form of particulate guanylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{demonstrated that the}} catalytic sub-unit of protein kinase A can catalyse a potent activation of partially purified Type V cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity (Burns et al., 1992, Biochem. J. 283, 487 - 491). We now demonstrate that this phosphodiesterase most likely has a sub-unit mass of 90 kDa, based upon 32 P-cyclic GMP photo-affinity labelling, that activation of the phosphodiesterase {{does not require the}} prior binding of cyclic GMP to the phosphodiesterase, and that alkaline phosphatase can reverse the protein kinase A-dependent activation of phosphodiesterase activity. <b>Zaprinast</b> is a mixed inhibitor of non-activated cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity. However, inhibition of the protein kinase A-activated phosphodiesterase is competitive. These results suggest that protein kinase A can modulate the inhibitory effects of <b>zaprinast</b> via perturbations of a non-catalytic binding site...|$|E
40|$|Most {{pulmonary}} {{arterial hypertension}} therapies are centred around the use of anticoagulants, which risk haemorrhaging, and anti-hypertensive drugs, which risk systemic hypotension. The PDE 5 inhibitor, <b>zaprinast,</b> {{is believed to have}} vasorelaxant properties specific to the pulmonary arterial bed. In the present study, <b>zaprinast</b> relaxed U 46619 -induced contractions of rat aortic and pulmonary arterial rings independent of the presence of endothelium. It was noted that, the pulmonary artery relaxed two to three times quicker than the aorta. Pre-treating the aorta with the calcium-activated potassium (Kca) channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA, lOmM) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-dependent ATPase pump blocker, thapsigargin (1 μM), reduced zaprinast-evoked vasorelaxation. Neither affected the U 46619 -induced contraction of the pulmonary artery. Thus, in aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC), the key player in the zaprinast-induced vasorelaxation is the Kca channel. Blockade of PDE 5 by <b>zaprinast</b> causes cGMP accumulation, activating cGMP-PK. This activates the inositol- 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate (IP- 3) and ryanodine (RyR) receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. This causes vasorelaxation. As neither of these mediators influence the pulmonary response, it is possible that, due to down-regulation or reduced currents in voltage-gated potassium d channels causing a direct Ca influx constricting the artery. This quicker, more direct mechanism may explain the speedier responses in the pulmonary artery. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE) inhibition and forskolin pretreatment on the contractile responses of guinea-pig urinary bladder strips to electrical field stimulation, carbachol, ATP and KCl were studied. Inhibition of cyclic AMP-specific PDE 4 isozymes by rolipram significantly reduced the contractile response of bladder strips to field stimulation. Rolipram also suppressed the contractile response to low concentrations of carbachol, but potentiated {{the response to}} high concentrations. The contractile response to ATP was significantly reduced by rolipram treatment, but that to KCl was unaltered. Inhibition of cyclic GMP-specific PDE 5 isozymes by <b>zaprinast</b> had no effects on the contractile response of bladder strips to field stimulation, ATP or KCl. <b>Zaprinast</b> suppressed the contractile responses to 1 [*]μM carbachol and potentiated the response to high concentrations. Contractile responses to field stimulation and to carbachol after pretreatment with the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, were qualitatively similar to those caused by rolipram treatment. β-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol partially reversed the inhibitory effects of rolipram on the response to field stimulation. Rolipram significantly reduced the contractile response of bladder strips from sensitized guinea-pigs to ovalbumin challenge, but <b>zaprinast</b> was ineffective. PDE inhibition had similar effects on the responsiveness of control and of sensitized guinea-pig bladder strips to field stimulation, carbachol, ATP and KCl.

40|$|Melatonin {{inhibits}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) -induced relaxation of coronary arteries. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} melatonin increases the phos-phorylation of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5), which increases {{the activity of the}} enzyme and thereby decreases intracellular cGMP accumulation in response to NO and inhibits NO-induced relaxation. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 8 -Br-cGMP caused concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated coronary arteries suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. In the presence of melato-nin, the concentration-response curve to SNP, but not 8 -Br-cGMP, was shifted to the right. The effect of melatonin on SNP-induced relaxation was abolished {{in the presence of the}} PDE 5 inhibitors <b>zaprinast</b> and sildenafil. Melatonin markedly inhibited the SNP-in-duced increase in intracellular cGMP in coronary arteries, an effect that was also abolished by <b>zaprinast.</b> Treatment of coronary arteries with melatonin caused a nearly fourfold increase in the phosphoryla...|$|E

With {{the introduction}} of selective PDE-Is it has become possible to study the functional importance of each phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE) concerning the regulation of the ciliary beat. The effects of rolipram (inhibiting a cAMP specific PDE (PDE 4), milrinone (inhibiting a cGMP inhibited PDE (PDE 3)) and <b>zaprinast</b> (inhibiting a cGMP specific PDE (PDE 5)) were investigated in in vitro preparations from the rabbit maxillary sinus and trachea. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured with a photoelectrical method. In sinus mucosa all three compounds accelerated CBF. Milrinone (10 (- 5) M) by 22. 6 +/- 5. 3 % (n = 6; P < 0. 01), rolipram (10 (- 5) M) by 29. 7 +/- 5. 7 % (n = 7; P < 0. 01), and <b>zaprinast</b> (10 (- 5) M) by 19. 4 +/- 6. 3 % (n = 6; P < 0. 05). In the tracheal specimens at a concentration of 10 (- 5) M, milrinone accelerated CBF by 27. 5 +/- 9. 0 % (n = 7; < 0. 05), rolipram by 11. 6 +/- 2. 8 % (n = 6; P < 0. 05) and <b>zaprinast</b> by 24. 3 +/- 5. 3 % (n = 7; P < 0. 01). Comparison of the effects in {{the upper and lower}} airways showed that at concentrations of 10 (- 5) and 10 (- 4) M rolipram was more effective in the upper than in the lower airways. The reverse was true of milrinone which concentrations of 10 (- 7) and 10 (- 6) M had a significant effect in tracheal specimens but not in sinus specimens. <b>Zaprinast</b> was equally effective in both the upper and lower airways. It is concluded that in both the upper and lower airways selective PDE-Is have an accelerating effect on the CBF that may be beneficial in the treatment of airway diseases...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{fibroblasts}} play {{an important}} role in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodelling induced by hypertension and myocardial infarction by undergoing proliferation and depositing extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. We have examined the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on proliferation and collagen synthesis by adult rat and human cardiac fibroblasts in culture. In cells from both species radioligand studies using 125 I-ANP suggested that the majority of binding sites (> 85 %) were non-guanylyl cyclase-linked (NPR-C subtype). Nonetheless ANP (10 − 9 to 10 − 6 [*]M), in the presence of <b>zaprinast,</b> an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase[*] 5 (PDE 5), increased fibroblast cyclic GMP levels 3 – 5 fold in a concentration-dependent manner (P< 0. 05). ANP (10 − 11 to 10 − 6 [*]M), a NPR-C ligand, C-ANF 4 - 23 (10 − 11 to 10 − 6 [*]M) and <b>zaprinast</b> alone had no significant effect on either basal or serum-stimulated DNA synthesis or fibroblast number. In combination with <b>zaprinast</b> (10 − 5 [*]M), however, ANP (10 − 9 to 10 − 6 [*]M) but not C-ANF 4 - 23 (10 − 7 [*]M) inhibited markedly both basal and stimulated fibroblast mitogenesis, an effect reproduced by 8 -bromo-cyclic GMP (10 − 5 to 10 − 3 [*]M). Collagen synthesis, determined by measuring hydroxyproline levels, was stimulated with transforming growth factor-β 1 (40 [*]pM), angiotensin[*]II (10 − 7 [*]M) or 2 % foetal bovine serum. The increase in collagen production, normalised by cell number, was reduced dramatically (to at or near basal production) by ANP (10 − 9 to 10 − 7 [*]M) but not C-ANF 4 - 23 (10 − 7 [*]M) in the presence of <b>zaprinast.</b> Again 8 -bromo-cyclic GMP (10 − 5 to 10 − 3 [*]M) reproduced the effect. ANP is capable of inhibiting collagen synthesis in adult rat and human cardiac fibroblasts via cyclic GMP, a property unmasked and enhanced by inhibition of PDE 5...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntracellular cyclic {{nucleotides}} {{are eliminated}} by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and by ATP Binding cassette transporters such as ABCC 4 and ABCC 5. PDE 5 and ABCC 5 have similar affinity for cGMP whereas ABCC 5 has much higher affinity for cGMP compared with cAMP. Since the substrate (cGMP) is identical {{for these two}} eliminatory processes {{it is conceivable that}} various PDE inhibitors also modulate ABCC 5 -transport. Cyclic GMP is also transported by ABBC 4 but the affinity is much lower with a Km 50 – 100 times higher than for that of ABBCC 5. The present study aimed to determine Ki-values for specific or relative specific PDE 5 inhibitors (vardenafil, tadalafil, <b>zaprinast</b> and dipyridamole) and the non-specific PDE inhibitors (IBMX, caffeine and theophylline) for ABCC 5 andABCC 4 transport. The transport of [3 H]-cGMP (2 µM) was concentration-dependently inhibited with the following Ki-values: vardenafil (0. 62 µM), tadalafil (14. 1 µM), <b>zaprinast</b> (0. 68 µM) and dipyridamole (1. 2 µM), IBMX (10 µM), caffeine (48 µM) and theophylline (69 µM). The Ki-values for the inhibition of the [3 H]-cAMP (2 µM) transport were: vardenafil (3. 4 µM), tadalafil (194 µM), <b>zaprinast</b> (2. 8 µM), dipyridamole (5. 5 µM), IBMX (16 µM), caffeine (41 µM) and theophylline (85 µM). The specificity for ABCC 5 we defined as ratio between Ki-values for inhibition of [3 H]-cGMP and [3 H]-cAMP transport. Tadalafil showed the highest specificity (Ki-ratio: 0. 073) and caffeine the lowest (Ki-ratio: 1. 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Treatment of {{pulmonary}} hypertension {{has not yet}} been established and effective drug therapies are required. We hypothesized that inhibition of cyclic guanosine monophoshate (cGMP) - phosphodiesterase (PDE) would result in specific vasodilation of the hypertensive pulmonary arteries. This study was carried out to determine whether PDE V inhibitors could dilate pulmonary artery (PA) from monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats. Thirty-six Wistar rats were given either monocrotaline (105 mg/kg) or normal saline (control) subcutaneously. Three weeks later, the PA rings were isolated and mounted in 5 -mL organ chambers. After precontraction with norepinephrine (0. 1 μmM), one of two PDE V inhibitors, <b>zaprinast</b> and dipyridamole, was added in a cumulative fashion. We also investigated whether nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) inhibitor modifies the effects of the PDE V inhibitors on the PA. <b>Zaprinast</b> and dipyridamole dose-dependently dilated the PA from either saline- or monocrotaline- treated rats. There was no difference in the dilatory effect between monocrotaline and saline rats. Pretreatment of a NOS inhibitor (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (0. 1 mM)) reduced moderately the vasodilatory effect of <b>zaprinast</b> on the PA from monocrotaline-treated but not saline-treated rats. The results suggest that PDE V inhibitors exert a strong vasodilating effect on PA of pulmonary hypertensive rats as well as on that of normal rats, and that NO plays a role, at least in part, in the effect of PDE V inhibition on PA of pulmonary hypertensive rats...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the ability of type 5 phosphodiesterase (PDE 5) inhibitors to augment the antithrombotic effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in a canine model of platelet-mediated coronary thrombosis after thrombolysis. BACKGROUNDType 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate the ability of NO to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro by preventing platelet cyclic guanosine monophosphate catabolism. We previously reported that breathing low concentrations of NO gas attenuated, but did not prevent, cyclic flow reductions (CFRs) in a canine model of coronary thrombosis after thrombolysis. METHODSCyclic flow reductions were induced after creation of a left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis, endothelial injury, thrombus formation and thrombolysis. Dogs were either untreated or treated with inhaled NO (20 ppm by volume), intravenous <b>zaprinast,</b> intravenous dipyridamole or the combination of inhaled NO with either PDE 5 inhibitor (n = 4 per group). RESULTSCyclic flow reductions ceased, and complete coronary patency was achieved in all dogs after they breathed NO combined with <b>zaprinast</b> (by 12. 0 ± 4. 7 min [mean ± SEM]) or dipyridamole (by 9. 8 ± 4. 7 min). The frequency of CFRs was unaffected by NO, dipyridamole or <b>zaprinast</b> alone. Systemic arterial blood pressure and bleeding time were unchanged with any treatment. Ex vivo thrombin-induced platelet aggregation in dogs breathing NO and receiving dipyridamole was reduced by 75 ± 7 % (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONSThe PDE 5 inhibitors potentiated the antithrombotic properties of inhaled NO in a canine model of platelet-mediated coronary artery thrombosis after thrombolysis, without prolonging the bleeding time or causing systemic hypotension...|$|E
40|$|Limited {{information}} {{is available on the}} brain expression and role of GPR 35, a Gi/o coupled receptor activated by kynurenic acid (KYNA). In mouse cultured astrocytes, we detected GPR 35 transcript using RT-PCR and we found that KYNA (0. 1 to 100 µM) decreased forskolin (FRSK) -induced cAMP production (p< 0. 05). Both CID 2745687 (3 µM, CID), a recently described GPR 35 antagonist, and GPR 35 gene silencing significantly prevented the action of KYNA on FRSK-induced cAMP production. In these cultures, we then evaluated whether GPR 35 activation was able to modulate intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and [Ca 2 +]i fluxes. We found that both KYNA and <b>zaprinast,</b> a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor and GPR 35 agonist, did not modify either basal or peaks of [Ca 2 +]i induced by challenging the cells with ATP (30 µM). However, the [Ca 2 +]i plateau phase following peak was significantly attenuated by these compounds in a store-operated Ca 2 + channel (SOC) -independent manner. The activation of GPR 35 by KYNA and <b>zaprinast</b> was also studied at the CA 3 -CA 1 synapse in the rat hippocampus. Evoked excitatory post synaptic currents (eEPSCs) were recorded from CA 1 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices. The action of KYNA on GPR 35 was pharmacologically isolated by using NMDA and α 7 nicotinic receptor blockers and resulted in a significant reduction of eEPSC amplitude. This effect was prevented in the presence of CID. Moreover, <b>zaprinast</b> reduced eEPSC amplitude in a PDE 5 - and cGMP-independent mechanism, thus suggesting that glutamatergi...|$|E
