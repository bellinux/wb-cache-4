The aim of this work is to carry out measurements of both dissipated acoustic power in the sono‐reactor using calorimetric method, and induction time of crystallization of ZnSO 4 center dot 7 H(2) O. Our measurements were recorded in the sono‐reactor for different liquid phase heights ranging between 0. 08 and 0. 2 m, and for different electric power supplied by the generator. The experimental results have shown that the dissipated acoustic power passes through a maximum at about 0. 15 +/‐ 0. 01 m, and that the induction time passes through a minimum for the same liquid‐level. The dissipated‐power and the induction time are found to be well correlated as the liquid height was varied. The acoustics of the sono‐reactor was studied with linear acoustics, accounting for the wall vibrations by using the Multiphysics Modelling and Simulation Software (COMSOL). Theoretical dissipated acoustic powers were compared to the experimental ones. One of the motivations of this study is to assess by simulation the existence of the maximum of dissipated power in a given sono‐reactor...|$|E

Because of insufficient data, the FEEDAP Panel {{is not in a}} position to derive a maximum safe iron concentration in feed for horses or fish; as a provisional measure, the current value (750 mg/kg) could be maintained. The values for total dietary iron for pigs, ovines, horses, fish and other species/categories (except poultry, bovines and pets) are in line with those currently authorised. Iron from ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is unlikely to modify the iron concentration in edible tissues and products of animal origin. Consumer exposure in the EU is not associated with a risk of excess iron intake to the general population. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel does not foresee any concern for consumer safety resulting from the use of ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> in animal nutrition, provided that the maximum iron content in complete feedingstuffs is respected. Ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is an irritant and corrosive to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract; thus, handling of the additive poses a hazard to the user/worker. Considering the high background concentration of iron and sulphur in soil and water, the supplementation of feed with ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is not expected to pose an environmental risk. Ferrous <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> is an effective source of iron for all animal species and categories.

40|$|International audiencePower {{ultrasound}} {{is known}} to enhance crystals nucleation, and nucleation times can be reduced by one up to three orders of magnitude for several organic or inorganic crystals. The precise physics involved in this phenomenon still remains unclear, and various mechanisms involving the action of inertial cavitation bubbles have been proposed. In this paper, two of these mechanisms, pressure and segregation effects, are examined. The first one concerns the variations of supersaturation induced by the high pressures appearing in the neighbourhood of a collapsing bubble, and the second one results from the modification of clusters distribution {{in the vicinity of}} bubble. Crystallisation experiments were performed on <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> ZnSO 4 center dot 7 H(2) O, which has been chosen for its pressure‐independent solubility, so that pressure variations have no effect on supersaturation. As observed in past studies on other species, induction times were found lower under insonification than under silent conditions at low supersaturations, which casts some doubts on a pure pressure effect. The interfacial energy between the solid and the solution was estimated from induction times obtained in silent conditions, and, using classical nucleation theory, the steady‐state distribution of the clusters was calculated. Segregation theory was then applied to calculate the over‐concentrations of n‐sized clusters {{at the end of the}} collapse of a 41 mu m bubble driven at 20 kHz by different acoustic pressures. The over‐concentration of clusters close to the critical size near a collapsing bubble was found to reach more than one order of magnitude, which may favour the direct attachment process between such clusters, and enhance the global nucleation kinetics...|$|E

Place and Duration of Study: A two-year field experiment was conducted during winter 2013 - 14 and 2014 - 15 at to assess the advantages of Zn nutrition in potato cv. Kufri Jyoti under alluvial soil (Entisols) of West Bengal, India Methodology: The experiment was laid out in randomized block design (RBD) having five treatments and four replications The potato was fertilized with five zinc levels (0, 1. 5, 3. 0, 4. 5 and 6. 0 kg Zn ha− 1) through <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>heptahydrate</b> i. e. ZnSO 4, 7 H 2 O (commercial grade Multi-Zn contained 21 % Zn) at the time of planting. A uniform dose of NPK at 200 : 150 : 150 kg ha− 1 RDF was applied in all the plots in the form of urea (46 % N), single super phosphate (16 % P 2 O 5), and muriate of potash (60 % K 2 O). Results: Application Zn fertilizer at 4. 5 kg ha− 1 recorded significantly higher germination %, plant height, leaf area index (LAI), dry matter accumulation (DMA) and number of tubers hill− 1. Total number and yield of tuber ha− 1 were also changed significantly (P≤. 05) with the levels of Zn-fertilization. Quality parameters like total soluble solids (TSS), total acidity, ascorbic acid, starch and amount of total sugar contents of fresh potato tuber as well as organoleptic quality of chips (colour) also influenced significantly (P≤. 05) with varied levels of Zn fertilization. Conclusion: Results suggest that application of 4. 5 kg Zn ha− 1 in combination with recommended dose fertilizer (RDF) of NPK (i. e. 200 : 150 : 150 kg ha− 1) is vital for optimizing yield components, yield and quality of potato (cv.

30|$|The ATR-FTIR imaging on the priming in the {{cross-section}} from Titian’s Portrait of a Man gave two distinct FTIR spectra. One of these exhibits a complex sulphate infrared absorption band with the maximum centred around 1040  cm− 1 together with additional small sharp bands at c. 1157 and 966  cm− 1, and correlates with areas found by SEM–EDX to contain only Zn, S and O; the other, {{with a single}} broad band at c. 1060 ‒ 70  cm− 1, corresponds to areas containing some potassium in addition [23]. The spectra from the potassium-containing areas are not an exact match to published data for known potassium <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphates</b> such as K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O [30], and further work is needed to fully identify these species. Nevertheless similar results were obtained from two other paintings by Titian where {{it was possible to}} carry out ATR-FTIR imaging, and from the painting by François Quesnel (Table  3 and [23]). The samples from the other paintings in the table were either not suitable for ATR-FTIR imaging, or where this was possible the spectra were not sufficiently distinct. Reassessment of the SEM–EDX results did, however, confirm the presence of potassium in conjunction with the <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> in every case, at least where no potassium-containing pigments such as red lake or ultramarine were present to interfere with the analyses, including in the portrait by François Quesnel, as illustrated in Fig.  2. The source of white vitriol was the mineral goslarite (ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O), and although potassium could be present as an impurity {{it is also possible that}} it was introduced through some sort of processing before use. Zinc acts as a secondary or auxiliary drier, but it may be that its effectiveness is dependent on its preparation, since the experiments using pure <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the <b>heptahydrate</b> form published so far have shown rather variable results [31]. Comments in the historical literature also seem to indicate it might not always be reliable for this purpose. Laurie (1895, [32]) states that it is ineffective, but that the <b>sulphate</b> of <b>zinc</b> mentioned in early treatises worked as a drier because it was not pure (although he speculates that this was because manganese was present as an impurity), and Church (1915, [33]) comments that ‘Another dryer in common use is white vitriol or <b>sulphate</b> of <b>zinc.</b> Its siccative character is very slight.’ Interestingly, given the potassium content in the <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> found in paintings, Samuel Frederick Gray (1830), under the heading ‘boiled oil’ states: ‘The pure <b>sulphate</b> of <b>zinc</b> made in England has not the same drying quality as the common white vitriol imported from Germany’ [34].|$|R

40|$|Summary – Uptake of {{acridine}} orange resulting from increased eggshell permeability is a reliable predictor of hatching for Globodera rostochiensis eggs. We conducted laboratory experiments {{to determine whether}} fluorescence of Heterodera glycines eggs stained with {{acridine orange}} correlated with hatching. Heterodera glycines eggs were incubated in sterile distilled water, <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> or soybean root diffusate and were stained with acridine orange 24 h prior to assessing fluorescence. Fluorescence of mature eggs positively correlated with hatching in <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Correlations in soybean root diffusate were positive, negative or non-existent, depending on the concentration of the diffusate. Although there were some significant correlations between hatching and fluorescence of H. glycines eggs in <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate,</b> the relationships were not sufficiently consistent for this technique to be used reliably to predict H. glycines hatching in soybean root diffusate...|$|R

40|$|Background: Zinc {{is one of}} the {{essential}} micronutrients in plants required in very low quantity for plant growth and development. In higher concentration, it is known to to reduce the rate of photosynthesis, So homoeopathic preparations tested to see it role on plan growth. Objective: To analyse the effect of homoeopathic preparation of <b>Zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> on plants through in-vitro assay using Bacopa monnieri as a model plant system. Materials and Methods: Six homoeopathic potencies (1 X to 6 X) of <b>Zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> were used on a decimal scale along with the control (MS basal agar medium). The samples were evaluated by adding fixed amount (100 μl) in the media as well as by dipping the explants in the test sample overnight. At the completion of the incubation period (14 days) the fresh and dry weight, number and length of the roots, number and length of the shoots and the number of leaves were analysed. Results: It was observed that <b>Zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> showed growth inhibition at potencies from 1 X to 5 X, whereas at potency 6 X, it exhibited growth promotion effect, when compared with the control. Conclusion: Homoeopathic drug (<b>Zinc</b> <b>sulphate)</b> exhibited growth promotion at higher potency (6 X) and growth inhibition at lower potencies (1 X to 5 X) on Bacopa monneiri...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} activated carbon by chemical activation. The selected biomass used as precursor is sawdust from both Cuban and Swedish Pine tree. Phosphoric acid and <b>Zinc</b> <b>Sulphate</b> are the chemical reagents. The objective is to study the influence of acid concentration, impregnation ratio and activation temperature on adsorption performance of the obtained activated carbon. The experiments with phosphoric acid activation show that treatment with 40 % acid concentration at 400 °C produce an activated carbon with good properties for ammonia adsorption and good iodine number. If a 30 % phosphoric acid is used for activation, an activation temperature of 500 °C is recommended. With an impregnation ratio of 1, good adsorption was obtained in the activated carbon produced from Swedish pine while using Cuban pine a higher adsorption was obtained with an impregnation ratio of 2. The experiments with <b>Zinc</b> <b>Sulphate</b> activation show that activation conditions of 20 % <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> concentration, 400 °C and impregnation ratio: 1 are enough to produce an activated carbon with good properties for ammonia adsorption. The adsorption of carbon tetrachloride was lower. Activated carbons produced with 10 % <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> concentration, 0. 5 impregnation ratio and 400 °C activation temperature (the mildest studied conditions) show already good iodine number and BET surface area.     QC 2012020...|$|R
