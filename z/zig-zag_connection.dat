50|$|The Yagi and the LPDA designs {{look very}} similar at first glance, as both {{consist of a}} number of dipole {{elements}} spaced out along a support boom. The Yagi, however, has only a single dipole connected to the transmission line, usually the second one {{from the back of the}} array. The other dipoles on the boom are passive elements, with their two sides shorted, acting as directors or reflectors depending on their slightly different lengths and position relative to the driven element. The difference between the LPDA and Yagi becomes obvious when examining their electrical connections; Yagi's lack the <b>zig-zag</b> <b>connection</b> between the elements. Another clear difference is the length of the dipoles; LPDA designs have much shorter dipoles towards the front of the antenna, forming a triangular shape as seen from the top, whereas the difference in lengths of Yagi elements is less noticeable or non-existent. Another visible difference is the spacing between the elements, which is normally constant in the Yagi, but becomes exponentially wider along the LPDA. Although both directional, the LPDA is intended to achieve a very wide bandwidth, whereas the Yagi has a very narrow bandwidth but achieves greater gain.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{amorphous}} core transformer is highlighted. Configuration of amorphous C-core and its magnetisation characteristic (B-H) are described. Factors {{affecting the}} design are also discussed as a comparison with a conventional transformer. It is concluded that, advantages with amorphous core transformers are- low core losses, low magnetising current, less zero sequence current, less noise, higher efficiency and longer life; however the disadvantages are higher inrush current, more harmonic problem, bigger size and higher initial cost. The problem of third harmonic may be eliminated by adopting <b>zig-zag</b> <b>connection</b> {{in place of}} star connection. Purpose {{of this article is}} to provide a knowledge base about amorphous core transformers, to students of transformer design, by discussing some necessary issues...|$|E
