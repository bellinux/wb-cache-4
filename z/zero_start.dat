The method is to train a matrix pro-jecting from posteriors of Gaussians to a normal size feature space, and then to add the projected features to normal fea-tures such as PLP. The matrix is trained from a <b>zero</b> <b>start</b> using a linear method. Sparsity of posteriors ensures speed in both training and test time. The basic technique gives similar improvements to MPE (around 10 % relative); MPE on top of fMPE results in error rates up to 6. 5 % relative bet-ter than MPE alone, or more if multiple layers of transform are trained. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the following resource constrained scheduling problem. We are given m identical processors, s resources R 1, …, Rs with upper bounds b 1, …, bs, n independent jobs T 1, …, Tn of unit length, where each job Tj has a start time rj ϵ N, requires one processor and an amount Ri(j) ϵ { 0, 1 } of resource Ri, i = 1, …, s. The optimization problem is to schedule the jobs at discrete times in N subject to the processor, resource and start-time constraints so that the latest scheduling time is minimum. Multidimensional bin packing is a special case of this problem. Resource constrained scheduling can be relaxed in a natural way when one allows the scheduling of fraction of jobs. Let Copt (resp. C) be the minimum schedule size for the integral (resp. fractional scheduling). While the computation of Copt is a NP-hard problem, C can be computed by linear programming in polynomial time. In case of <b>zero</b> <b>start</b> times Röck and Schmidt (1983) showed for the integral problem a polynomial-time approximation within ((m 2) Copt and de la Vega and Lueker (1981), improving a classical result of Garey et al.

The main contributions of this paper include the first polynomial-time algorithm approximating Copt for every ε ϵ (0, 1) within a factor of 1 + ε for instances with bi = Ω(ε− 2 log(Cs)) for all i and m = Ω(ε− 2 log C), and a proof that the achieved approximation under the given conditions is best possible, unless P = NP. Furthermore, in some cases we give for every fixed α > 1 a parallel 2 α-factor approximation algorithm...|$|E
