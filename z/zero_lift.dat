The design was originated by Nicosia, but the guidance of Fioravanti was equally important. Being a trained aerodynamist, Fioravanti applied his know-how to set the aerodynamics layout of the car. This meant the large side intakes were not only a statement of style but actually functional – they drew clean air to cool the side radiators and then went upward and left the car through the ventilation holes located at the engine lid and the tail.

The last characterization relies on a detailed study of the relative position of the border terms and their syzygy module.

50|$|The {{angle of}} attack is the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the {{oncoming}} air. A symmetrical airfoil will generate <b>zero</b> <b>lift</b> at zero {{angle of attack}}. But as the angle of attack increases, the air is deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases, resulting in more lift.

40|$|We {{investigate}} half-supersymmetric {{domain wall}} solutions of four maximally supersymmetric D = 9 massive supergravity theories obtained by Scherk– Schwarz reduction of D = 10 IIA and IIB supergravity. One {{of the theories}} {{does not have a}} superpotential and does not allow domain wall solutions preserving any supersymmetry. The other three theories have superpotentials leading to half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions, one of which has zero potential but non-zero superpotential. The uplifting of these domain wall solutions to ten dimensions leads to three classes of half-supersymmetric type IIB 7 -brane solutions. All solutions within each class are related by SL(2,R) transformations. The three classes together contain solutions carrying all possible (quantized) 7 -brane charges.

50|$|As {{the angle}} of attack of a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft increases, separation of the airflow from the upper surface of the wing becomes more pronounced, leading {{to a reduction in}} the rate of increase of the lift coefficient. The figure shows a typical curve for a cambered straight wing. A symmetrical wing has <b>zero</b> <b>lift</b> at 0 degrees angle of attack. The lift curve is also influenced by the wing shape, including its airfoil section and wing planform. A swept wing has a lower, flatter curve with a higher critical angle.|$|E
50|$|The {{angle of}} <b>zero</b> <b>lift</b> of the {{cambered}} airfoils showed almost no variation with RN.Throughout {{the range of}} RN of this investigation, {{the values of the}} lift-curve slope for the smooth sections are very close to that predicted by thin-airfoil theory (2π per radian, or 0.110 per degree).The effects of increasing RN on the maximum lift showed two general trends: for airfoils of 12% thickness or less, the maximum lift remains relatively constant over the lower range of RN. Increasing the RN, however, causes a rapid increase in maximum lift; the 18% thick airfoils demonstrated a steady increase of maximum lift as RN is increased.|$|E

The {{results of}} a series of wind tunnel tests {{involving}} velocity, surface pressure and force measurements on six annular aerofoils are presented together with details of the design procedure which was based on that given by Kiichemann and Weber 1.

40|$|The {{wake of a}} {{streamwise}} oscillating cylinder is presently investigated. The Reynolds number investigated is 300, based on the cylinder diameter d. The cylinder oscillates at an amplitude of 0. 5 d and a frequency fe/fs= 1. 8, where fe is the cylinder oscillating frequency and fs is the natural vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder. Under these conditions the flow is essentially two dimensional. A two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) scheme has been developed to calculate the flow. The DNS results display a street of binary vortices, each containing two counter-rotating vortical structures, symmetrical about the centerline, which is in excellent agreement with measurements. The drag and lift on the cylinder have been examined. The time averaged drag and lift are 1. 4 and 0, respectively, which {{are the same as}} those on a stationary cylinder at the same Re. However, the fluctuating drag was high, about 2. 68. It has been found that, being symmetrically formed about the centerline, the binary vortices induce an essentially <b>zero</b> fluctuating <b>lift,</b> which may have a profound implication in flow control and engineering.

50|$|In aerodynamics, {{angle of}} attack {{specifies}} the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere. Since a wing can have twist, a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable, so an alternate reference line is simply defined. Often, the chord line of {{the root of the}} wing is chosen as the reference line. Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line (and also as the longitudinal axis). Some authors do not use an arbitrary chord line, but use the <b>zero</b> <b>lift</b> axis, whereby zero {{angle of attack}} corresponds to zero coefficient of lift by definition.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} primary ways for an {{aircraft}} {{to change its}} orientation relative to the passing air. Pitch (movement of the nose up or down, rotation around the transversal axis), Roll (rotation around the longitudinal axis, that is, the axis which runs {{along the length of}} the aircraft) and Yaw (movement of the nose to left or right, rotation about the vertical axis). Turning the aircraft (change of heading) requires the aircraft firstly to roll to achieve an angle of bank (in order to balance the centrifugal force); when the desired change of heading has been accomplished the aircraft must again be rolled in the opposite direction to reduce the angle of bank to <b>zero.</b> <b>Lift</b> acts vertically up through center of pressure which depends on the position of wings.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Josephson critical current I_c(Φ) {{of a wide}} superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junction {{as a function of}} the magnetic flux Φ threading it. Electronic trajectories reflected from the side edges alter the function I_c(Φ) as compared to the conventional Fraunhofer-type dependence. At weak magnetic fields, B≲Φ_ 0 /d^ 2, the edge effect <b>lifts</b> <b>zeros</b> in I_c(Φ) and gradually shifts the minima of that function toward half-integer multiples of the flux quantum. At B>Φ_ 0 /d^ 2, the edge effect leads to an accelerated decay of the critical current I_c(Φ) with increasing Φ. At larger fields, eventually, the system is expected to cross into a regime of "classical" mesoscopic fluctuations that is specific for wide ballistic SNS junctions with rough edges.

50|$|The {{maximum lift}} an airfoil can produce {{at a given}} {{airspeed}} is limited by boundary-layer separation. As the angle of attack is increased, a point is reached where the boundary layer can no longer remain attached to the upper surface. When the boundary layer separates, it leaves a region of recirculating flow above the upper surface, as illustrated in the flow-visualization photo at right. This {{is known as the}} stall, or stalling. At angles of attack above the stall, lift is significantly reduced, though it is not <b>zero.</b> The maximum <b>lift</b> that can be achieved before stall, in terms of the lift coefficient, is generally less than 2.0 for single-element airfoils and can be more than 3.0 for airfoils with high-lift slotted flaps deployed.|$|R

The OA-626 computed both the missile's course and the direction of the desired destination from the missile position, and the MARC repeated spoiler signals to reduce the difference.

5000|$|Applying potential-flow {{theory to}} a lifting flow {{requires}} special treatment {{and an additional}} assumption. The problem arises because lift on an airfoil in inviscid flow requires circulation in the flow around the airfoil (See [...] "Circulation and the Kutta-Joukowski theorem" [...] below), but a single potential function that is continuous throughout the domain around the airfoil cannot represent a flow with nonzero circulation. The {{solution to this problem}} is to introduce a branch cut, a curve or line from some point on the airfoil surface out to infinite distance, and to allow a jump {{in the value of the}} potential across the cut. The jump in the potential imposes circulation in the flow equal to the potential jump and thus allows nonzero circulation to be represented. However, the potential jump is a free parameter that is not determined by the potential equation or the other boundary conditions, and the solution is thus indeterminate. A potential-flow solution exists for any value of the circulation and any value of the lift. One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to impose the Kutta condition, which is that, of all the possible solutions, the physically reasonable solution is the one in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly. The streamline sketches illustrate one flow pattern with <b>zero</b> <b>lift,</b> in which the flow goes around the trailing edge and leaves the upper surface ahead of the trailing edge, and another flow pattern with positive lift, in which the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge in accordance with the Kutta condition.|$|E

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{describe}} ergodic-theoretical properties of scalar semilinear parabolic differential equations on the circle, and on the entire R without decay to zero at infinity (the extended case), with either autonomous or time-periodic nonlinearity, and implications to dynamics. In all these cases, we show that the union of supports of all the measures on the appropriate space of functions, invariant with respect to evolution of solutions, projects one-to-one to R^ 2. This holds also in the extended case, if one considers spatially invariant measures with a technical condition of finite density of zeroes. Furthermore, we give general sufficient conditions for uniqueness of the invariant measure, generalizing the results by Sinai for the periodically-forced viscous Burgers equation, and then establish a relatively complete description of asymptotics of dynamics in these cases in both the bounded and the extended case. The main technique is the <b>zero</b> function <b>lifted</b> to the space of Borel probability measures on the space of functions, which is a Lyapunov function {{with respect to the}} evolution of measures induced by two "replicas" of the equation.
