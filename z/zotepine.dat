40|$|Background: Schizophrenia is a {{functional}} psychosis with severe personality changes and thought disorders without cerebral damage. No reports {{are available in}} literature regarding efficacy and tolerability of atypical antipsychotic drug <b>zotepine</b> over olanzapine a preferred drug worldwide {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia. Therefore, present study is undertaken to evaluate efficacy, tolerability and cost effectiveness of <b>zotepine</b> over olanzapine in patients suffering from schizophrenia. Methods: A prospective, randomized, single blind, parallel, 6 weeks clinical study was conducted on a total of 112 patients, of schizophrenia attending psychiatry outpatient department at G. R. Medical College, Gwalior, India randomized into two groups (56 in each). Patients received either olanzapine (10 - 20 mg) or <b>zotepine</b> (75 - 150 mg) per day for a period of 6 week. Efficacy was measured by Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale whereas tolerability was measured by dropout rate and frequency of adverse effects. Cost effectiveness was calculated in terms of cost incurred for improvement at the end of treatment period. Results: Both the drugs showed significant (P. 0. 05). Olanzapine showed significantly better (P 0. 05) between the two groups. Incidence of akathisia and drop out (16 % and 23 %) with <b>zotepine</b> were significant (P< 0. 05) as compared to olanzapine (2 % and 11 %) respectively. Conclusions: Though the efficacy of both the drugs is comparable, olanzapine appears to have better tolerability and cost effectiveness than <b>zotepine</b> in patients of schizophrenia.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} high affinity neurotensin (NT) binding in rat brain following acute or chronic treatment with the classical antipsychotic, haloperidol, and the newer antipsychotic drugs, clozapine and <b>zotepine.</b> Drugs were given orally, as an acute treatment (1 dose) or chronically (21 day dosing) and binding to the NT high affinity receptor was examined in three brain regions; striatum, nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle and frontal cortex. Acute dosing with either vehicle, haloperidol, clozapine or <b>zotepine</b> produced no {{significant changes in}} NT binding from controls (naïve rats). Chronic (21 day) dosing resulted {{in an increase in}} the KD and Bmax of high affinity receptors in the striatum following haloperidol, but not clozapine, <b>zotepine</b> or vehicles. In contrast, the newer antipsychotics, clozapine and <b>zotepine</b> but not haloperidol or vehicles, significantly altered NT binding in the nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle by decreasing the KD and Bmax. Further differentiation between the two newer antipsychotic drugs occurred in the frontal cortex. Clozapine had no significant effect on NT binding, whereas <b>zotepine</b> significantly reduced the KD of the high affinity receptor with no alteration in Bmax. The antipsychotic drugs tested did not interact directly with the NT high affinity receptor. Therefore, they must be acting indirectly via an alternative receptor mechanism to alter NT high affinity binding. In accordance with previously reported NT/dopamine receptor interactions, this would suggest cross-talk between these systems. Overall, these data demonstrate that chronic, but not acute, administration of antipsychotic drugs alters NT binding in the rat brain. In addition, anatomical differences in NT binding arise according to the antipsychotic drug under test. This may be predictive of drug side-effect profile, antipsychotic efficacy or atypicality...|$|E

40|$|Risperidone and its active {{metabolite}} 9 -OH-risperidone {{were compared}} to reference antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol, pipamperone, fluspirilene, clozapine, <b>zotepine)</b> and compounds under development (olanzapine, seroquel, sertindole, ORG- 5222, ziprasidone) for in vitro binding to neurotransmitter receptors in brain tissue and on membranes of recombinant cells expressing cloned human receptors and for in vivo occupancy of neurotransmitter receptors in rat and guinea-pig brain following acute treatment (2 h., s. c.). An ex vivo autoradiography technique was applied to determine the receptor occupancy by the drugs administered in vivo. Of particular interest are the central 5 HT 2 A receptors and D 2 -type receptors. Predominant 5 HT 2 A receptor antagonism is supposed to add to an atypical profile of the antipsychotics (treatment of the negative symptoms, low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects). D 2 antagonism is required the treatment of positive symptoms. A contribution of the new dopamine receptor subtypes D 3 and in particular D 4 receptors has been proposed. In vitro, all compounds, except the 'typical' antipsychotics haloperidol and fluspirilene, showed higher affinity for 5 HT 2 A than for D 2 receptors. Subnanomolar affinity for human 5 HT 2 A receptors was observed for ORG- 5222, sertindole, risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone and ziprasidone. Fluspirilene, ORG- 5222, haloperidol, ziprasidone, risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone and <b>zotepine</b> displayed nanomolar affinity for human D 2 receptors. Sertindole and olanzapine were slightly less potent. Pipamperone, clozapine and seroquel showed 2 orders of magnitude lower D 2 affinity in vitro. Clozapine, but even more so pipamperone, displayed higher affinity for D 4 than for D 2 receptors. For most other compounds, D 4 affinity was only slightly lower than their D 2 affinity. Seroquel was totally devoid of D 4 affinity. None of the compounds had nanomolar affinity for D 1 receptors; their affinity for D 3 receptors was usually slightly lower than for D 2 receptors. In vivo, ORG- 5222, risperidone, pipamperone, 9 -OH-risperidone, sertindole, olanzapine, <b>zotepine</b> and clozapine maintained a higher potency for occupying 5 HT 2 A than D 2 receptors. Risperidone and ORG- 5222 had 5 HT 2 A versus D 2 potency ratio of about 20. Highest potency for 5 HT 2 A receptor occupancy was observed for ORG- 5222 followed by risperidone and olanzapine. Ziprasidone exclusively occupied 5 HT 2 A receptors. ORG- 5222, haloperidol, fluspirilene and olanzapine showed the highest potency for occupying D 2 receptors. No regional selectivity for D 2 receptor occupancy in mesolimbic versus nigrostriatal areas was detected {{for any of the}} test compounds. Risperidone was conspicuous because of its more gradual occupancy of D 2 receptors; none of the other compounds showed this property. The various compounds also displayed high to moderate occupancy of adrenergic alpha 1 receptors, except fluspirilene and ziprasidone. Clozapine, <b>zotepine,</b> ORG- 5222 and sertindole occupied even more alpha 1 than D 2 receptors. Clozapine showed predominant occupancy of H 1 receptors and occupied cholinergic receptors with equivalent potency to D 2 receptors. A stronger predominance of 5 HT 2 A versus D 2 receptor occupancy combined with a more gradual occupancy of D 2 receptors differentiates risperidone and its 9 -OH-metabolite from the other antipsychotic compounds in this study. The predominant 5 HT 2 A receptor occupancy probably plays a role in the beneficial action of risperidone on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, whereas maintenance of a moderate occupancy of D 2 receptors seems adequate for treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. A combined 5 HT 2 A and D 2 occupancy and the avoidance of D 2 receptor overblockade are believed to reduce the risk for extrapyrastatus: publishe...|$|E

ZTP blocked selectively 5 -HT re-uptake in all rat brain regions examined, and its blockade effect was almost equal to 5 - HT, while chlorpromazine (CP), haloperidol (HPD) and imipramine (iMI) showed no inhibition.

To present {{an overview of the}} current knowledge of P-gp and its interaction with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), an internet search for all relevant English original research articles concerning P-gp and SGAs was conducted. Several SGAs are substrates for P-gp in therapeutic concentrations. These include amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, perospirone, risperidone and paliperidone. Clozapine and quetiapine {{are not likely to be}} substrates of P-gp.

The values for the inhibitory effects of neuroleptics on the GABA (3 [*]μM) -current, which were calculated by the fitting Hill's equations where the concentrations represent the mean therapeutic blood concentrations, were ranked clozapine>zotepine>chlorpromazine>olanzapine>risperidone. These inhibitory effects, weighted with the therapeutic concentrations of neuroleptics, were correlated with the clinical incidences of seizure during treatment with neuroleptics. Clozapine reduced the picrotoxin-inhibiton, and may compete with a ligand of the t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding site. Haloperidol and quetiapine {{did not affect the}} peak amplitude of the GABA (3 [*]μM) -current.

It occurs in almost 42 % of men and in 75 % of women with schizophrenia who are treated with prolactin-raising antipshycotics, even though it has aroused minimal interest within the scientific community when compared with extra-pyramidal effects. Conventional antipsychotics and some of the atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, paliperidone, amisulpride and <b>zotepine,</b> are frequently associated with the raise in prolactin plasma levels. Because of this increment in prolactin secretion, they are usually known as prolactin-raising antipshycotics. On the contrary, some of the atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, aripiprazole and ziprazidone, have a minimal or no significant effect in prolactin levels, being known as prolactin-sparing antipsychotics. Hyperprolactinemia clinical symptoms include gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularities, infertility, sexual dysfunction, acne and hirsutism. Some of these symptoms are due to the prolactin direct action in body tissues, while a couple of them can be due to a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysregulation mediated by the elevation of prolactin. Some studies seem to point the evidence of an association between hyperprolactinemia and long-term consequences, such as bone mineral density decrement and breast cancer. However, these results must be confirmed through further studies. Antipsychotic treatment is {{the most common cause of}} hyperprolactinemia in psychiatric patients. However, the evidence of a prolactin increased plasma level demands the differential diagnosis with other pathologies, such as hyphotalamic and pituitary neoplasic disease. The management of a patient with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia must be adapted to each patient and it may include a reduction in the dosage of the offending antipsychotic, switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic or the use of a dopamine receptor agonist, such as bromocriptine, cabergoline and amantadine. Given the osteopenic and osteoporosis risk, combined oral contraceptives must be considered in female patients in fertile age which have amenorrhoea for at least a one year period. With the exception of the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, none of the current international psychiatric guidelines recommend a routine baseline prolactin determination, neither periodic prolactin levels without the presence of any hyperprolactinemia symptoms.

Hyperprolactinemia clinical symptoms include gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularities, infertility, sexual dysfunction, acne and hirsutism. Some of these symptoms are due to the prolactin direct action in body tissues, while a couple of them can be due to a hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysregulation mediated by the elevation of prolactin. Some studies seem to point the evidence of an association between hyperprolactinemia and long-term consequences, such as bone mineral density decrement and breast cancer. However, these results must be confirmed through further studies. Antipsychotic treatment is the most common cause of hyperprolactinemia in psychiatric patients. However, the evidence of a prolactin increased plasma level demands the differential diagnosis with other pathologies, such as hyphotalamic and pituitary neoplasic disease. The management of a patient with antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia must be adapted to each patient and it may include a reduction in the dosage of the offending antipsychotic, switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic or the use of a dopamine receptor agonist, such as bromocriptine, cabergoline and amantadine. Given the osteopenic and osteoporosis risk, combined oral contraceptives must be considered in female patients in fertile age which have amenorrhoea for at least a one year period. With the exception of the Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, none of the current international psychiatric guidelines recommend a routine baseline prolactin determination, neither periodic prolactin levels without the presence of any hyperprolactinemia symptoms...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{question}} of which antipsychotic drug should be preferred {{for the treatment}} of schizophrenia is controversial, and conventional pairwise meta-analyses cannot provide a hierarchy based on the randomised evidence. We aimed to integrate the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative efficacy, risk of all-cause discontinuation, and major side-effects of antipsychotic drugs. METHODS: We did a Bayesian-framework, multiple-treatments meta-analysis (which uses both direct and indirect comparisons) of randomised controlled trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials. gov for reports published up to Sept 1, 2012. Search results were supplemented by reports from the US Food and Drug Administration website and by data requested from pharmaceutical companies. Blinded, randomised controlled trials of patients with schizophrenia or related disorders were eligible. We excluded trials done in patients with predominant negative symptoms, concomitant medical illness, or treatment resistance, and those done in stable patients. Data for seven outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was efficacy, as measured by mean overall change in symptoms. We also examined all-cause discontinuation, weight gain, extrapyramidal side-effects, prolactin increase, QTc prolongation, and sedation. FINDINGS: We identified 212 suitable trials, with data for 43   049 participants. All drugs were significantly more effective than placebo. The standardised mean differences with 95 % credible intervals were: clozapine 0 · 88, 0 · 73 - 1 · 03; amisulpride 0 · 66, 0 · 53 - 0 · 78; olanzapine 0 · 59, 0 · 53 - 0 · 65; risperidone 0 · 56, 0 · 50 - 0 · 63; paliperidone 0 · 50, 0 · 39 - 0 · 60; <b>zotepine</b> 0 · 49, 0 · 31 - 0 · 66; haloperidol 0 · 45, 0 · 39 - 0 · 51; quetiapine 0 · 44, 0 · 35 - 0 · 52; aripiprazole 0 · 43, 0 · 34 - 0 · 52; sertindole 0 · 39, 0 · 26 - 0 · 52; ziprasidone 0 · 39, 0 · 30 - 0 · 49; chlorpromazine 0 · 38, 0 · 23 - 0 · 54; asenapine 0 · 38, 0 · 25 - 0 · 51; lurasidone 0 · 33, 0 · 21 - 0 · 45; and iloperidone 0 · 33, 0 · 22 - 0 · 43. Odds ratios compared with placebo for all-cause discontinuation ranged from 0 · 43 for the best drug (amisulpride) to 0 · 80 for the worst drug (haloperidol); for extrapyramidal side-effects 0 · 30 (clozapine) to 4 · 76 (haloperidol); and for sedation 1 · 42 (amisulpride) to 8 · 82 (clozapine). Standardised mean differences compared with placebo for weight gain varied from - 0 · 09 for the best drug (haloperidol) to - 0 · 74 for the worst drug (olanzapine), for prolactin increase 0 · 22 (aripiprazole) to - 1 · 30 (paliperidone), and for QTc prolongation 0 · 10 (lurasidone) to - 0 · 90 (sertindole). Efficacy outcomes did not change substantially after removal of placebo or haloperidol groups, or when dose, percentage of withdrawals, extent of blinding, pharmaceutical industry sponsorship, study duration, chronicity, and year of publication were accounted for in meta-regressions and sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: Antipsychotics differed substantially in side-effects, and small but robust differences were seen in efficacy. Our findings challenge the straightforward classification of antipsychotics into first-generation and second-generation groupings. Rather, hierarchies in the different domains should help clinicians to adapt the choice of antipsychotic drug to the needs of individual patients. These findings should be considered by mental health policy makers and in the revision of clinical practice guidelines. FUNDING: None...|$|E
