He had three battalions each of the Sievsk and Perm Russian Infantry Regiments, ten squadrons of the <b>Ziethen</b> Dragoon Regiment Nr. 6, five squadrons of the Baczko Dragoon Regiment Nr. 7, 29 cannons, and two howitzers. Villatte directed General of Brigade Bernard-Georges-François Frère's brigade, two battalions each of the 27th Light and the 63rd Line Infantry Regiments, plus three squadrons each of the 17th and 19th Dragoon Regiments.

[...] He is also well known for a raid into the Holy Roman Empire during the Second Silesian War, known as Zieten's Ride.

60|$|Friedrich, at Parchwitz, {{assembled}} his Captains, {{and spoke}} to them; it was the night after <b>Ziethen</b> came in, night of December 3d, 1757; and <b>Ziethen,</b> no doubt, was there: for it is an authentic meeting, this at Parchwitz, and the words were taken down.|$|E
6000|$|<b>ZIETHEN</b> ALMOST CAPTURED. [...] "Prince Henri, in {{the last}} days of August, marched to Sagan in person; [Tempelhof, iii. 231: 29th August.] <b>Ziethen</b> along with him; multifariously {{manoeuvring}} 'to regain communication with the King.' Of course, with no want of counter-manoeuvring, of vigilant outposts, cunningly devised detachments and assiduous small measures on the part of Daun. Who, one day, had determined on a more considerable thing; that of cutting out <b>Ziethen</b> from the Sagan neighborhood. And would have done it, they say,--had not he been too cunctatory. September 2d, <b>Ziethen,</b> who is posted in the little town of Sorau, had very nearly been cut off. In Sorau, westward, Daun-ward, of Sagan a short day's march: there sat <b>Ziethen,</b> conscious of nothing particular,--with Daun secretly marching on him; Daun in person, from the west, and two others from the north and from the south, who are to be simultaneous on Sorau and the Zietheners. A well-laid scheme; likely to have finished <b>Ziethen</b> satisfactorily, who sat there aware of nothing. But it all miswent: Daun, on the road, noticed some trifling phenomenon (Prussian party of horse, or the like), which convinced his cautious mind that all was found out; that probably a whole Prussian Army, instead of a <b>Ziethen</b> only, was waiting at Sorau; upon which Daun turned home again, sorry that he could not turn the other two as well. The other two were stronger than <b>Ziethen,</b> could they have come upon him by surprise; or have caught him before he got through a certain Pass, or bit of bad ground, with his baggage. But <b>Ziethen,</b> by some accident, or by his own patrols, got notice; loaded his baggage instantly; and was through the Pass, or half through it, and in a condition to give stroke for stroke with interest, when his enemies came up. Nothing could be done upon Ziethen; who marched on, he and all his properties, safe to Sagan that night,--owing to Daun's over-caution, and to Ziethen's own activity and luck." [...] [Tempelhof, iii. 233.] ...|$|E
60|$|Frederick {{straightway}} issued {{orders that}} the general who had succeeded Bevern should be put under arrest, for not having at once thrown his army into Breslau; appointed <b>Ziethen</b> in his place, and ordered him to bring the army round to Glogau and meet him at Parchwitz on December 2nd, which <b>Ziethen</b> punctually did.|$|E

6000|$|Simultaneously with <b>Ziethen,</b> {{so far as}} humanly possible: that is the {{essential}} point! Friedrich has taken every pains that it shall be correct, in this and all points; and to take double assurance of hiding it from Daun, he yesternight, in dictating his Orders on the other heads of method, kept entirely to himself this most important <b>Ziethen</b> portion of the Business. And now, at starting, he has taken <b>Ziethen</b> in his carriage with him a few miles, to explain the thing by word of mouth. At the Eilenburg road, or before it, <b>Ziethen</b> thinks he is clear as to everything; dismounts; takes in hand the mass intrusted to him; and strikes off by that rightward course: [...] "Rightward, Herr Ziethen; rightward till you get to Klitschen, your first considerable island in this sea of wood; at Klitschen strike to the left into the woods again,--your road is called the Butter-Strasse (BUTTER-STREET); goes by the northwest side of Siptitz Height; reach Siptitz by the Butter-Street, and then do your endeavor!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Old <b>Ziethen</b> {{was at once}} pushed on, from Glogau {{over the}} frontier, to replace Goltz; but, I doubt, had not now the {{requisite}} velocity: <b>Ziethen</b> merely manoeuvred about, and came home [...] "attending the Russians," [...] as Henri, Dohna and others had done. The Russians entered Silesia, from the northeast or Polish side, without difficulty; and (July 15th-20th) were within reach of Breslau and of an open road to southward, and to junction with Loudon, who is astir for them there. About Breslau they linger and higgle, at their leisure, for three weeks longer: and if their junction with the Austrians [...] "in Neisse neighborhood" [...] is to be prevented or impeded, it is Friedrich, not <b>Ziethen,</b> {{that will have to}} do it.|$|E
6000|$|Of humane consolatory Anecdotes, in this kind, our Opposition Kaltenborn gives several; of the rhadamanthine desolating or {{destructive}} kind, {{though such}} also {{could not be}} wanting, if your Assize is {{to be good for}} anything, he gives us none. And so far as I can learn, the effective punishments, dismissals and the like, were of the due rarity and propriety; though the flashes of unjust rebuke, fulminant severity, lightnings from the gloom of one's own sorrows and ill-humor, were much more frequent, but were seldom--I do not know if ever--persisted in to the length of practical result. This is a Rhadamanthus much interested not to be unjust, and to discriminate good from bad! Of <b>Ziethen</b> there are two famous Review Anecdotes, omitted and omissible by Kaltenborn, so well known are they: one of each kind. At a certain Review, year not ascertainable,--long since, prior to the Seven-Years War,--the King's humor was of the grimmest, nothing but faults all round; to <b>Ziethen</b> himself, and the <b>Ziethen</b> Hussars, he said various hard things, and at length this hardest: [...] "Out of my sight with you!" [...] [Madame de Blumenthal, Life of <b>Ziethen,</b> i. 265.] Upon which Ziethen--a stratum of red-hot kindling in <b>Ziethen</b> too, as was easily possible--turns to his Hussars, [...] "Right about, RECHTS UM: march!" [...] and on the instant did as bidden. Disappeared, double-quick; and at the same high pace, in a high frame of mind, rattled on to Berlin, home to his quarters, and there first drew bridle. [...] "Turn; for Heaven's sake, bethink you!" [...] said more than one friend whom he met on the road: but it was of no use. Everybody said, [...] "Ziethen is ruined;" [...] but <b>Ziethen</b> never heard of the thing more.|$|E
60|$|Being a good general, he lost not {{a moment}} in endeavouring to meet the storm. His left was thrown back a little, a battery of {{fourteen}} guns at the angle so formed opened fire, and he launched his cavalry against that of <b>Ziethen.</b> For the moment Ziethen's men were pushed back, but the fire from an infantry battalion, close by, checked the Austrian horse. They fell back out of range, and <b>Ziethen,</b> making a counter charge, drove them away.|$|E
60|$|<b>Ziethen,</b> vanmost of all, finds Nadasti and his Austrian squadrons drawn {{across the}} Highway, hitherward of the Kreczor latitude: <b>Ziethen</b> dashes on Nadasti; tumbles his squadrons and him away; clears the Road, and Kreczor neighborhood, of Nadasti: drives him quite into {{the hollow of}} Radowesnitz, where he stood {{inactive}} {{for the rest of}} the day. Hulsen now at the level of Kreczor (in the latitude of Kreczor, as we phrased it), halts, faces to right; stiffly presses up, opens his cannon-thunders, his bayonet-charges and platoon-fires upon Kreczor. Stiffly pressing up, in spite of the violent counter-thunders, Hulsen does manage Kreczor without very much delay, completely enough, and like a workman; takes the battery, two batteries; overturns the Infantry;--in a word, has seized Kreczor, and, as new tenant, swept the old, and their litter, quite out. Of all which <b>Ziethen</b> has now the chase, and by no means will neglect that duty. <b>Ziethen,</b> driving the rout before him, has driven it in some minutes past the little Oak-wood above mentioned; and, or rather BUT,--what is much to be noted,--is there taken in flank with cannon-shot and musketry, Daun having put batteries and Croat parties in the Oak-wood; and is forced to draw bridle, and get out of range again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince Karl, {{gathering}} his distracted fragments, put 17,000 into Breslau {{by way of}} ample garrison there; {{and with}} the rest made off circuitously for Schweidnitz; thence for Landshut, and down the Mountains, home to Konigsgratz,--self and Army in the most wrecked condition. Chased by Ziethen; <b>Ziethen</b> (sticking always to the hocks of them,' as Friedrich eagerly enjoins on him; or sometimes it is, 'sitting on the breeches of them:' for about a fortnight to come. [Eleven Royal Autographs: in Blumenthal, Life of De <b>Ziethen</b> (ii. 94-111), a feeble incorrect Translation of them.] <b>Ziethen</b> took 2,000 prisoners; no end of baggages, of wagons left in the difficult places: wild weather even for <b>Ziethen,</b> still more for Karl, among the Silesian-Bohemian Hill-roads: heavy rains, deep muds, then sudden glass, with cutting snow-blasts: 'An Army not a little dilapidated,' writes Prince Karl, almost with tears in his eyes; (Army without linens, without clothes; in condition truly sad and pitiable; and has always, so close are the enemy, to encamp, though without tents.' [Kutzen, p. 134 ("Prince Karl to the Kaiser, December 14th").]. Did not get to Konigsgratz, and safe shelter, for ten days more. Counted, at Konigsgratz in the Christmas time, 37,000 rank and file,--'22,000 of whom are gone to hospital,' by the Doctor's report.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Ziethen,</b> who {{had stood}} all day making idle noises,--of what a fatal quality we know, if <b>Ziethen</b> did not,--waiting for the King's appearance, {{must have been}} {{considerably}} displeased with himself at nightfall, when the King's fire gradually died out farther and farther north, giving rise to the saddest surmises. Ziethen's Generals, Saldern and the Leuthen Mollendorf, are full of gloomy impatience, urgent on him to try something. [...] "Push westward, nearer the King? Some stroke at the enemy on their south or southwestern side, where we have not molested them all day? No getting across the Rohrgraben on them, says your Excellenz? Siptitz Village, and their Battery there, is on {{our side of the}} Rohrgraben:--UM GOTTES WILLEN, something, Herr General!" [...] <b>Ziethen</b> does finally assent: draws leftward, westward; unbuckles Saldern's people upon Siptitz; who go like sharp hounds from the slip; fasten on Siptitz and the Austrians there, with a will; wrench these out, force them to abandon their Battery, and to set Siptitz on fire, while they run out of it. Comfortable bit of success, so far,--were not Siptitz burning, so that we cannot get through. [...] "Through, no: and were we through, is not there the Rohrgraben?" [...] thinks <b>Ziethen,</b> not seeing his way.|$|E
6000|$|Nadasti, though {{astonished}} at the Prussian fire-deluge, stands to his arms; makes, in front, vigorous defence; and even takes, in some sort, the initiative,--that is, dashes out his Cavalry on <b>Ziethen,</b> before <b>Ziethen</b> has charged. Ziethen's Horse, who are rightmost of the Prussians: and are bare to the right,--ground offering no bush, no brook there (though <b>Ziethen,</b> foreseeing such defect, has {{a clump of}} infantry near by to mend it),--reel back under this first shock, coming downhill upon them; and would have fared badly, had not the clump of infantry instantly opened fire on the Nadasti visitors, and poured it in such floods upon them, that they, in their turn, had to reel back. Back they, well out of range;--and leave <b>Ziethen</b> free for a counter-attack shortly, on easier terms, which was successful to him. For, during that first tussle of his, the Prussian Infantry, to left of <b>Ziethen,</b> has attacked the Sagschutz Firwood; clears that of Croats; attacks Nadasti's line, breaks it, their Brummer battery potently assisting, and the rage of Wedell and everybody being extreme. So that, {{in spite of the}} fine ground, Nadasti is in a bad way, on the extreme left or outmost point of his POTENCE, or tactical KNEE. Round the knee-pan or angle of his POTENCE, where is the abatis, he fares still worse. Abatis, beswept by those ten Brummers and other Batteries, till bullet and bayonet can act on it, speedily gives way. [...] "They were mere Wurtembergers, these; and could not stand!" [...] cried the Austrians apologetically, at a great rate, afterwards; as if anybody could well have stood.|$|E
60|$|<b>Ziethen,</b> {{for minor}} good feats, {{had been made}} Lieutenant-Colonel, the very day he marched; his Commission dates May 16th, 1741; and on the morrow he handsels it in this pretty manner. He is now forty-two; much held down hitherto; being a man of inarticulate turn, hot and abrupt in his ways,--liable always to multifarious obstruction, and unjust contradiction from his fellow-creatures. But Winterfeld's report on this {{occasion}} was emphatic; and <b>Ziethen</b> shoots rapidly up henceforth; Colonel within the year, General in 1744; {{and more and more}} esteemed by Friedrich during their subsequent long life together.|$|E
60|$|The Prussian Vanguard, one Krockow its commander, repulsed {{that first}} Austrian attack; swept the Bass clear for some minutes; got their {{section of the}} carriages, or some part of it, 250 in all, hurried through; then halted on the safe side, to wait what <b>Ziethen</b> would do with the remainder. <b>Ziethen</b> does his best and bravest, as {{everybody}} does; keeps his wagon-chaos plugged down; ranks it in square mass, as a wagon fortress (WAGENBURG); ranks himself and everybody, his cannon, his platoon musketry, to the best advantage round it; furiously shoots out in all manner of ways, against the furious Loudon on this flank, and the furious Ziskowitz on that; takes hills, loses them; repels and is repelled (wagon-chaos ever harder to keep plugged); finally perceives himself to be beaten; that the wagon-chaos has got unplugged (fancy it!)--and that he, <b>Ziethen,</b> must retreat; back foremost if possible. He did retreat, fighting {{all the way to}} Troppau; and the Convoy is a ruin and a prey.|$|E
6000|$|... "A day or {{two after}} Ziethen's adventure, Henri quits Sagan, to move southward for a stroke at the Bohemian-Lausitz {{magazine}}s; a stroke, and series of strokes.

SEPTEMBER 9th, Stutterheim summons Friedland, gets it; gets the bit of magazine there; and next day hastens on to Zittau.

"SATURDAY, 25th DECEMBER, 1784, <b>Ziethen,</b> {{in spite}} of the burden of eighty-six years, went to the Palace, {{at the end of the}} Parade, to pay his Sovereign this last tribute of respect, and to have the {{pleasure}} of seeing him after six months' absence. The Parole was given out, the orders imparted to the Generals, and the King had turned towards the Princes of the Blood,--when he perceived <b>Ziethen</b> on the other side of the Hall, between his Son and his two Aides-de-Camp. Surprised in a very agreeable manner at this unexpected sight, he broke out into an exclamation of joy; and directly making up to him,--'What, my good old <b>Ziethen,</b> are you there!' said his Majesty: 'How sorry am I that you have had the trouble of walking up the staircase! I should have called upon you myself. How have you been of late?' 'Sire,' answered <b>Ziethen,</b> (my health is not amiss, my appetite is good; but my strength! my strength!) 'This account,' replied the King, 'makes me happy by halves only: but you must be tired;--I shall have a chair for you.' [Thing unexampled in the annals of Royalty!] A chair," [...] on order to Ziethen's Aides-de-Camp, [...] "was quickly brought. <b>Ziethen,</b> however, declared that he was not at all fatigued: the King maintained that he was. 'Sit down, good Father (MEIN LIEBER ALTER PAPA <b>ZIETHEN,</b> SETZE ER SICH DOCH)!' continued his Majesty: 'I will have it so; otherwise I must instantly leave the room; for I cannot allow you to be incommoded under my own roof.' The old General obeyed, and Friedrich the Great remained standing before him, in the midst of a brilliant circle that had thronged round them. After asking him many questions respecting his hearing, his memory and the general state of his health, he at length took leave of him in these words: 'Adieu, my dear <b>Ziethen</b> [it was his last adieu!]--take care not to catch cold; nurse yourself well, and live as long as you can, that I may often have the pleasure of seeing you.' After having said this, the King, instead of speaking to the other Generals, and walking through the saloons, as usual, retired abruptly, and shut himself up in his closet." [...] [Blumenthal, ii. 341; Militair-Lexikon, iv. 318. Chodowiecki has made an Engraving of this Scene; useful to look at for its military Portraits, if of little esteem otherwise. Strangely enough, both in BLUMENTHAL and in Chodowiecki's ENGRAVING the year is given as 1785 (plainly impossible); Militair-Lexikon misprints the month; and, one way or other, only Rodenbeck (iii. 316) is right in both day and year.] ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{not until}} nearly one {{o'clock in the morning}} that <b>Ziethen</b> learned that the Austrians were already across the river. Then he pushed down into Torgau, and crossed the town bridge in time to capture twenty-six pontoons.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had now got on to Protzen. I {{perceived}} old General van <b>Ziethen</b> {{standing before}} the Manor-house in Protzen,"--rugged brave old soul; with his hanging brows, and strange dim-fiery pious old thoughts!--"I rode forward to the carriage and said:-- ...|$|E

60|$|A {{feeling of}} deep gloom {{spread through the}} army, {{a feeling that the}} king had been deserted, and must have been crushed; just as, on the other side, all felt certain that some serious misfortune must have {{happened}} to <b>Ziethen.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Friedrich himself, {{without waiting}} for the rear of his force, and some while before this mist fell (as I judge), is pushing forward, [...] "a miller lad for his guide," [...] across to Hennersdorf,--Katholisch-Hennersdorf, a long straggling Village, eight or ten miles off, and itself two miles long,--where he understands the Saxons are. Miller lad guides us, over height and hollow, with his best skill, at a brisk pace;--through one hollow, where he has known the cattle pasture in summer time; but which proves impassable, and mere {{quagmire}}, at this season. No getting through it, you unfortunate miller lad (GARCON DE MEUNIER). Nevertheless, we did find passage through the skirts of it: nay this quagmire proved the luck of us; for the enemy, trusting to it, had no outguard there, never expecting us on that side. So that the vanguard, <b>Ziethen</b> and rapid Hussars, made an excellent thing of it. <b>Ziethen</b> sends us word, That he has got {{into the body of}} Hennersdorf,--"found the Saxon Quartermaster quietly paying his men;"--that he, <b>Ziethen,</b> is tolerably master of Hennersdorf, and will amuse the enemy till the other force come up.|$|E
60|$|Friedrich sends {{orders that}} Kyau shall {{be put in}} arrest; that <b>Ziethen</b> shall be general of the Bevern wreck, shall bring it round by Glogau, and {{rendezvous}} with Friedrich at a place and day,--Parchwitz, 2d of December coming;--and be steady, my old <b>Ziethen.</b> Friedrich brushes past the Liegnitz Garrison, leaves Liegnitz and it a trifle to the right; arrives at Parchwitz November 28th; and there rests, or at least his weary troops do, till <b>Ziethen</b> come up; the King not very restful, with {{so many things to}} prearrange; a life or death crisis now nigh. Well, it is but death; and death has been fronted before now! We who are after the event, on the safe sunny side of it, can form small image of the horrors and the inward dubieties to him who is passing through it;--and how Hope is needed to shine heroically eternal in some hearts. Fire of Hope, that does not issue in mere blazings, mad audacities and chaotic despair, but advances with its eyes open, measuredly, counting its steps, to the wrestling-place,--this is a godlike thing; much available to mankind in all the battles they have; battles with steel, or of whatever sort.|$|E
6000|$|Loudon, I conjecture, {{would have}} {{struggled}} farther, had not he known {{that there would}} be a better chance again not very many miles ahead. London has studied this Convoy; knows of <b>Ziethen</b> coming to it with so many; of Ziskowitz coming to him, Loudon, with so many; that <b>Ziethen</b> cannot send for more (roads being all beset by our industry yesterday), that Ziskowitz can, should it be needful;--and that at Domstadtl there is a defile, or confused woody hollow, of unequalled quality! Mosel jumbles on all day with his Train, none molesting; at night gets to his appointed quarters, Village of Neudorff; [The L, or EL, is a diminutive in these Names: (NEUDORFL) [...] "New-ThorpLET," [...] (DOMSTADTL) [...] "Cathedral-TownLET," [...] and the like.] and there finds Ziethen: a glad meeting, we may fancy, but an anxious one, with Domstadtl ahead on the morrow. Loudon concerts with Ziskowitz this day; calls in all reinforcements possible, and takes his measures. Thursday morning, <b>Ziethen</b> finds the Train in such a state, hardly half of it come up, he has to spend the whole day, Mosel and he, in rearranging it: Friday morning, June 30th, they get under way again;--Friday, the catastrophe is waiting them.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as he}} {{was assured}} of this, he poured his cavalry across the river, but Ziethen's cannon drove them back again; and he saw that, with <b>Ziethen</b> {{standing}} in order of battle, in a commanding position, with his guns sweeping the bridges, he could do nothing.|$|E
60|$|MONDAY, 3d NOVEMBER, 1760, at half-past 6 in {{the morning}} Friedrich is on march for this great enterprise. The march goes northward, in Three Columns, with a Fourth of Baggage; through the woods, on four {{different}} roads; roads, or combinations of those intricate sandy avenues already noticed. Northward all of it at first; but {{at a certain point}} ahead (at crossing of the Eilenburg-Torgau Road, namely), the March is to divide itself in two. Half of the force is to strike off rightward there with <b>Ziethen,</b> and to issue {{on the south side of}} Siptitz Hill; other half, under Friedrich himself, to continue northward, long miles farther, and then at last bending round, issue--simultaneously with <b>Ziethen,</b> if possible--upon Siptitz Hill from the north side. We are about 44,000 strong, against Daun, who is 65,000.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, in {{his desire}} to give support to <b>Ziethen,</b> the king decided upon an attack with his own column, alone.

6000|$|<b>Ziethen,</b> {{appointed}} to that function, watches on the Heights of Wurben, the citadel of the place: keeps {{a sharp eye}} to the southwest. All round, in huge half-moon {{on the edge of}} the Hills over there, six or more miles from <b>Ziethen,</b> lie the angry Enemies; Austrians south and nearest, about Kunzendorf and Freyberg. Russians are on the top of Striegau Hills, which are well known to some of us; Russian head-quarter is Hohenfriedberg,--who would have thought it, Herr General von <b>Ziethen?</b> Sixteen years ago, we have seen these Heights in other tenancy: Austrian field-music and displayed banners coming down; a thousand and a thousand Austrian watch-fires blazing out yonder, in the silent June night, eve of such a Day! Baireuth Dragoons and their No. 67;--you will find the Baireuth Dragoons still here in a sense, but also in a sense not. Their fencing Chasot is gone to Lubeck long since; will perhaps pay Friedrich a visit by and by: their fiery Gessler is gone much farther, and will never visit anybody more! Many were the reapers then, and they are mostly gone to rest. Here is a new harvest; the old SICKLES are still here; but the hands that wielded them--! [...] "Steady!"

60|$|These {{he ordered}} to be seized, at once. This was done before the Austrians {{could reach the}} spot, they being {{hindered}} by furious charges by <b>Ziethen,</b> from the open ground between Kumschutz and Canitz; and Frederick rearranged his front of battle, and waited for Retzow {{to come up with}} the left wing.|$|E
6000|$|How lucky that, at this moment, Mollendorf comes in, with a {{discovery}} to westward; discovery {{of our old}} friend [...] "the Butter-Street,"--it is nothing more,--where <b>Ziethen</b> should have marched this morning: there would he have found a solid road across the Rohrgraben, free passage by a bridge between two bits of ponds, at the SCHAFEREI (Sheep-Farm) of Siptitz yonder. [...] "There still," [...] reports Mollendorf, [...] "the solid road is; unbeset hitherto, except by me Mollendorf!" [...] Thitherward all do now hasten, Austrians, Prussians: but the Prussians are beforehand; Mollendorf is master of the Pass, deploying himself {{on the other side}} of it, and <b>Ziethen</b> and everybody hastening through to support him there, and the Austrians making fierce fight in vain. The sound of which has reached Hulsen, and set Lestwitz and him in motion thither.|$|E
6000|$|Daun, {{learning}} by those returned parties from the Woods what the Royal intentions on him are, hastily whirls himself round, {{so as to}} front north, and there receive Friedrich: best line northward for Friedrich's behoof; rear line or second-best will now receive <b>Ziethen</b> or what may come. Daun's arrangements are admitted to be prompt and excellent. Lacy, with his 20,000,--who lay, while Friedrich's attack was expected from south, at Loswig, as advanced guard, {{east side of the}} GROSSE TEICH (supreme pond of all, which is a continuation of the Duck-trap, ENTEFANG, and hangs like a chief goitre on the goitry neck of Torgau),--Lacy is now to draw himself north and westward, and looking into the Entefang over his left shoulder (so to speak), be rear-guard against any <b>Ziethen</b> or Prussian party that may come. Daun's baggage is all across the Elbe, all in wagons since yesterday; three Bridges hanging for Daun and it, in case of adverse accident. Daun likewise brings all or nearly all his cannon to the new front, for Friedrich's behoof: 200 new pieces hither; Archenholtz says 400 in whole; certainly such a weight of artillery as never appeared in Battle before. Unless Friedrich's arrangements prove punctual, and his stroke be emphatic, Friedrich may happen to fare badly. On the latter point, of emphasis, there is no dubiety for Friedrich: but on the former,--things are already past doubt, the wrong way! For the last hour or so of Friedrich's march there has been continual storm of cannonade and musketry audible from Ziethen's side:--"Ziethen engaged!" [...] thinks everybody; and quickens step here, under this marching music from the distance. Which is but a wrong reading or mistake, nothing more; the real phenomenon being as follows: <b>Ziethen</b> punctually got to Klitschen at the due hour; struck into the BUTTER-STRASSE, calculating his paces; but, {{on the edge of the}} Wood found a small Austrian party, like those in Friedrich's route; and, pushing into it, the Austrian party replied with cannon before running. Whereupon <b>Ziethen,</b> not knowing how inconsiderable it was, drew out in battle-order; gave it a salvo or two; drove it back on Lacy, in the Duck-trap direction,--a long way east of Butter-Street, and Ziethen's real place;--unlucky that he followed it so far! <b>Ziethen</b> followed it; and got into some languid dispute with Lacy: dispute quite distant, languid, on both sides, and consisting mainly of cannon; but lasting in this way many precious hours. This is the phenomenon which friends, in the distance read to be, [...] "Ziethen engaged!" [...] Engaged, yes, and alas with what? What Ziethen's degree of blame was, I do not know. Friedrich thought it considerable:--"Stupid, stupid, MEIN LIEBER!" [...] which <b>Ziethen</b> never would admit;--and, beyond question, it was of high detriment to Friedrich this day. Such accidents, say military men, are inherent, not to be avoided, in that double form of attack: which may be true, only that Friedrich had no choice left of forms just now.|$|E
