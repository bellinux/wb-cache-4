50|$|The {{environmental}} behaviour of flame retardants {{has been studied}} since the 1990s. Mainly brominated flame retardants were found in many environmental compartments and organisms including humans, and some individual substances {{were found to have}} toxic properties. Therefore, alternatives have been demanded by authorities, NGOs and equipment manufacturers. The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated flame retardants. In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a reference product containing halogen free versus brominated flame retardants. About a dozen halogen free flame retardants were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings. A large group of the studied flame retardants were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), Aluminium diethyl phosphinate (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), <b>zinc</b> <b>stannate</b> (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS). Overall, they were found to have a much lower tendency to bioaccumulate in fatty tissue than the studied brominated flame retardants.|$|E

Zn(2) SnO(4) generally crystallizes into an inverse spinel crystal structure (cubic phase). However, we found that Zn(2) SnO(4) could assembly into a slightly distorted cubic structure (quasi-cubic phase) for the first time by using tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as an alkaline mineralizer. In addition, we successfully tuned the morphologies of the as-prepared Zn(2) SnO(4) particles, from cube, cuboctahedron, truncated octahedron, to octahedron, by adjusting the type and the concentration of alkaline mineralizers and surfactants. Compared with cubic Zn(2) SnO(4), the quasi-cubic Zn(2) SnO(4) showed a noticeable red shift of the band gap, and the gas sensors based on quasi-cubic Zn(2) SnO(4) exhibited high sensitive performance to alcohol. XPS analyses revealed that the shift of Zn 2 p(3 / 2) binding energy in the quasi-cubic Zn(2) SnO(4), which indicated some Zn ions in quasi-cubic Zn(2) SnO(4) adopted different coordination environments from regular tetrahedral/octahedral ones adopted in cubic Zn(2) SnO(4).

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} process for treating natural rubber to increase its flame retardant capability. Theprocess comprises a mixture of a natural rubber with, (a) halogenated free flame retardant agent (zinc hydroxystannate;STORFLAM ZHS) and (b) halogenated flame retardant agent (decabromodiphenyl; Great Lake DE- 83 R and chlorinatedparaffins; Plastoil 152) and another material like antimony trioxide and aluminium hydroxide in appropriate amount, with ratio of halogenated flame retardant agent: antimony trioxide 3 : 1. In the resulting product with halogen flame retardant showed a more efficient flame retardant property than halogen free flame retardant, i. e. brominated flame retardant provide higher efficiency than chlorinated and ZHS, respectively. The minimum requirement ratio for being flame retardant of antimonytrioxide: brominated or chlorinated agent is 7 : 21 or 10 : 30 phr while aluminium hydroxide: ZHS is 10 : 150 phr.

The Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique was used to deposit CdSe QD coatings on waveguides. Sensors exposed to pH 2 solution lost mass over time in an expected, roughly exponential manner. Sensors at pH 10, in contrast, were stable over time. Results were confirmed with atomic force microscopy imaging. Limiting factors in the use of OWLS in this manner include limitations on the annealing temperature that maybe used to synthesize the oxide film, and limitations on the thickness of the film to be studied.

However, data on (neuro) toxicity of halogen-free flame retardants (HFFRs) are scarce. Recent {{in vitro studies}} indicated a high neurotoxic potential for some HFFRs, e. g., <b>zinc</b> <b>stannate</b> (ZS), whereas the neurotoxic potential of other HFFRs, such as aluminum diethylphosphinate (Alpi), appears low. However, the in vivo (neuro) toxicity of these compounds is largely unknown. We therefore investigated effects of neonatal exposure to TBBPA, Alpi or ZS on synaptic plasticity in mouse hippocampus. Male C 57 bl/ 6 mice received a single oral dose of 211 µmol/kg bw TBBPA, Alpi or ZS on postnatal day (PND) 10. On PND 17 - 19, effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity were investigated using ex vivo extracellular field recordings. Additionally, we measured levels of postsynaptic proteins involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as flame retardant concentrations in brain, muscle and liver tissues. All three flame retardants induced minor, but insignificant, effects on LTP. Additionally, TBBPA induced a minor decrease in post-tetanic potentiation. Despite these minor effects, expression of selected synaptic proteins involved in LTP was not affected. The flame retardants could not be measured in significant amounts in the brains, suggesting low bioavailability and/or rapid elimination/metabolism. We therefore conclude that a single neonatal exposure on PND 10 to TBBPA, Alpi or ZS does affect neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity only to a small extent in mice.

We therefore investigated the in vitro (neuro) toxicity of 13 HFFRs and three BFRs in dopaminergic pheochromocytoma (PC 12) and neuroblastoma (B 35) cells by assessing several cytotoxic and neurotoxic endpoints. Effects on cell viability and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using a combined Alamar Blue and Neutral Red assay and a H 2 -DCFDA assay, respectively, whereas effects on calcium homeostasis were measured using single-cell fluorescent Ca(2 +) -imaging. The majority of the tested flame retardants induced negligible cytotoxicity, except zinc hydroxystannate (ZHS) and <b>zinc</b> <b>stannate</b> (ZS). A considerable fraction of flame retardants affected ROS production (decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209), triphenylphosphate (TPP), aluminium trihydroxide (ATH), ammonium polyphosphate (APP), magnesium hydroxide (MHO), ZHS, ZS and melamine polyphosphate (MPP)). Interestingly, ATH, ZHS, ZS and montmorillonite (MMT) increased the basal intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2 +) ]i), whereas tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), resorcinol bis (diphenylphosphate) (RDP), TPP, 9, 10 -dihydro- 9 -oxa- 10 -phosphaphenanthrene- 10 -oxide (DOPO), ATH, ZHS, ZS and MMT reduced depolarization-evoked increases in [Ca(2 +) ]i {{as a result of}} inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. These combined data on the in vitro (neuro) toxicity of HFFRs in comparison with BFRs are essential for prioritization of safe(r) flame retardants.

The dielectric layers are commonly TiO 2, SnO 2 or ZnO, and all the layers are usually deposited by magnetron sputtering. The market for Low-E coatings has grown considerably in recent years due to environmental legislation and increased energy costs. To further expand the market, the next generation of Low-E coatings are increasingly being deposited onto toughenable glass, which is post-deposition annealed at temperatures of up to 650 oC. However, under these conditions, silver atoms are highly mobile and can rapidly diffuse through the other constituent layers of the coating stack, which can have a detrimental impact on the performance of the coating. Diffusion in polycrystalline films occurs much faster than in bulk samples and by different mechanisms. This is caused by the physical properties of thin films, which may contain a high density of defects such as dislocations, vacancies and grain boundaries that can act as pathways for diffusion processes. The aim of this project therefore is to carry out a detailed study of diffusion processes in dielectric-silver coating systems deposited under industrially relevant conditions (i. e. using commercially available magnetron designs and power deliver modes). TiO 2 coatings have been deposited onto float glass substrates by reactive pulsed magnetron sputtering and characterised using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The coatings have been annealed at temperatures in the range of 100 oC to 800 oC and re-analysed to determine the effect of annealing on the film structures. An interesting transition from a weakly crystalline rutile-like structure with very small grain sizes to a strongly crystalline anatase structure or mixed-phase structure with much larger grains was observed as annealing temperature was increased. Selected coatings were over coated with silver and annealed for a second time. These coatings were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry to determine the diffusion profiles of silver through the titania layer and the reverse diffusion of sodium from the glass substrates. Little difference in the diffusion rate of silver was observed with annealing temperature, but sodium was observed to diffuse significantly faster through samples annealed at higher temperature range. Similar studies have been performed for Al-doped ZnO, Zn 2 SnO 4 and Si 3 N 4 coatings. These films have been post-deposition annealed at 650 oC then over coated with silver and re-annealed at 250 oC. Diffusion profiles for both Ag and Na atoms were measured using secondary ion mass spectrometry. Finally dielectric/Ag/dielectric layers were deposited to investigate the behaviour of silver and sodium after annealing at 250 oC. The basic models of diffusion mechanisms in thin films have been developed using Fick’s second diffusion law. Analytical modelling was used to fit the experimental data into a concentration dependent curve that represents the solution to Fick’s second law. Moreover selected dielectric/Ag/dielectric stacks were subjected to temperature dependency of silver diffusion studies using Arrhenius diffusion principle. Samples were post-deposition annealed at the temperature range of 200 - 650 oC for 5 minutes to investigate silver diffusion at different heat treatment conditions and diffusivity values were used to find activation energies and frequency factors from Arrhenius plot. Overall findings from the diffusion studies are that from dielectric materials investigated in this work Al-doped ZnO coatings have the best barrier properties for silver atoms diffusion and show relatively low values for sodium diffusion, when not annealed at relatively high temperatures. <b>Zinc</b> <b>stannate,</b> on the other hand, was found to be the material through which atoms investigated here diffuse fairly easily. Both silver and sodium atoms were found to have the highest diffusion rates through <b>zinc</b> <b>stannate</b> films relative to the other coatings investigated in this work.

The X-ray diffraction patterns of as-synthesized powders at the Zn/Sn ratio of 1 exhibited formation of ZnSn(OH) 6. Increasing the Zn/Sn ratio further {{resulted in the}} precipitation of an additional phase corresponding to Zn(OH) 2. The decomposition of these powders at 650 °C for 3 h {{led to the formation}} of the orthorhombic phase of ZnSnO 3 and tetragonal SnO 2 -type phase of Zn 2 SnO 4 at the Zn/Sn ratio of 1 and 2, respectively, with the formation of their mixed phases at intermediate compositions, i. e., at Zn/Sn ratio of 1. 25, 1. 50 and 1. 75, respectively. The lattice parameters of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases were a ~ 3. 6203 Å, b ~ 4. 2646 Å and c ~ 12. 8291 Å (for ZnSnO 3) and a = b ~ 5. 0136 Å and c ~ 3. 3055 Å (for Zn 2 SnO 4). The transmission electron micrographs revealed the formation of nano-crystallites with aspect ratio ~ 2; the length and thickness being 24, 13 nm (for ZnSnO 3) and 47, 22 nm (for Zn 2 SnO 4), respectively. The estimated direct bandgap values for the ZnSnO 3 and Zn 2 SnO 4 were found to be 4. 21 eV and 4. 12 eV, respectively.

40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs), {{and to a}} lesser extent polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are widely used {{chemicals}} that prevent or slow the onset and spreading of fire in order to reduce injuries and death. Unfortunately, many of these compounds pose serious threats for human health and the environment. Previous research identified the nervous system as a sensitive target organ. This thesis therefore describes studies in which the neurotoxic mechanism of action of some selected PCBs and BFRs are (further) unraveled. The obtained data underline the need for safer and less persistent alternative halogen-free flame retardants (HFFRs). Unfortunately, the (neuro) toxic potential of these HFFRs is largely unknown. Therefore, available toxicity data of 13 selected HFFRs was reviewed and subsequently in vitro experiments were performed to identify the in vitro neurotoxic potential of these selected HFFRs. First, cytotoxic effects on the neuronal cell lines PC 12 and B 35 were investigated. The majority of the tested HFFRs induced negligible cytotoxicity. Next, effects of the compounds on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined which showed that a considerable fraction of the HFFRs affects ROS production. Oxidative stress occurs when ROS levels in the cell dramatically increase, potentially resulting in significant damage to cell structures. Since an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca 2 +]i) is an important trigger for neuronal (dys) function and cell damage, including apoptosis, effects on Ca 2 +-homeostasis were investigated by using single cell fluorescent microscopy. Some HFFRs were able to disturb basal Ca 2 +-homeostasis. Since [Ca 2 +]i is also essential for proper intra- and intercellular signaling, effects on depolarization-evoked increases in [Ca 2 +]i in PC 12 cells were also determined. This proved to be a sensitive endpoint as 7 of 13 tested compounds were able to inhibit depolarization-evoked calcium influx. In the first part of this thesis it is also shown that postsynaptic inhibitory GABAA and excitatory α 4 β 2 nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors are a direct target for PCBs and BFRs. Therefore, effects on the function of nACh-receptors, expressed in Xenopus oocytes, were measured using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. The results demonstrate that a few HFFRs can act as nACh-receptor antagonist. Using the obtained in vitro (neuro) toxicity data, the suitability of these HFFRs for replacement of BFRs was assessed using an initial rank ordering. Two HFFRs were classified as having a negligible, six as having a low, one as having a moderate, and four as having high in vitro neurotoxic potency. Since the in vivo (neuro) toxicity of these compounds is unknown, synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices of mice neonatally exposed to the BFR tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) or the HFFRs aluminium diethylphosphinate (Alpi) or <b>zinc</b> <b>stannate</b> (ZS) was measured. Despite the clear in vitro neurotoxic effects of ZS, no (developmental) neurotoxicity was observed ex vivo following single oral exposure. The negligible neurotoxic potency of Alpi in vitro was confirmed in this study. Although additional data are required for complete (human) risk assessment, the findings described in this thesis demonstrate that several HFFRs could be suitable substitutes for BFRs...|$|E
