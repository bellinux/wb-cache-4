Caregiver burden (CB) refers to the physical, mental, and socioeconomic problems experienced by the caregivers of chronic patients. Patients and methods: This is a onetime cross-sectional observational study carried out in the movement disorder clinic of a tertiary referral center in India. Persons with PD were interviewed and information was collected regarding demographic and clinical details, treatment taken, and presence of non-motor features such as dementia, psychosis, depression, etc, on a pre-tested format and their caregivers were interviewed for self-perceived burden using <b>Zerit’s</b> caregivers’ burden inventory. Results: We interviewed 91 persons with PD (71 [78 %] men, 20 [22 %] women) with their primary caregivers. The age of the patients ranged from 25 to 75 years (mean 56. 66 ± 11. 83 years). After regression analysis, depression in patients (beta = 0. 352, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 275 to 0. 790), high UPDRS-motor scores (beta = 0. 255, 95 % CI: 0. 108 to 0. 532), and presence of sleep disturbances in the atient (beta = 0. 206, 95 % CI: 0. 817 to 11. 823) were associated with increased caregiver burden and the presence of multiple caregivers was associated with lower caregiver burden (beta = − 0. 311, 95 % CI: − 10. 155 to − 3. 436). Conclusion: The total number of caregivers was found to be an important predictor for reducing CB. Multiple caregivers is a phenomenon which has not been studied till now. Other factors which were found to have adverse predictive effect on caregiver burden are presence of depression, high UPDRS-motor scores, and sleep disturbances in patients.

5000|$|Royalty stream securitizers: These are {{firms that}} {{are engaged in}} the buying and selling of what are {{essentially}} specialized asset-backed securities.

50|$|Stavudine {{was first}} created by Jerome Horwitz in the 1960s and was {{originally}} named D4T.

The pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb manufactures the drug under the trade name <b>Zerit.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is a {{derivative}} of stavudine (d4T, brand name <b>Zerit),</b> {{and has been}} designed to avoid dependence on the rate limiting step of phosphorylation of stavudine to stavudine monophosphate. This is governed by the supply of thymidine kinase that is available, and stavudine is poorly phosphorylated to its monophosphate form in thymidine kinase-deficient cells.|$|E
50|$|Stavudine (d4T), {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} <b>Zerit</b> among others, is an {{antiretroviral}} medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is generally recommended for use with other antiretrovirals. It {{may be used for}} prevention after a needlestick injury or other potential exposure. It; however, is not a first line treatment. It is given by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Prusoff {{spent most}} of his career {{studying}} analogs of thymidine, a nucleoside building block of DNA, with an eye toward developing therapeutic agents. By exploring analogs to thymidine for use as antiviral drugs, his research created a new scientific paradigm for antiviral drug development. In the late 1950s, William Prusoff synthesized one of the first thymidine analogs, 5-iododeoxyuridine. At the time, it was thought to be difficult to find antiviral drugs with a high therapeutic index, but professor Herbert E. Kaufman found that the compound could be used as an effective topical treatment for herpesvirus keratitis by disrupting the virus's ability to reproduce. More significantly, though, this discovery was a scientific [...] - {{it was the first time}} that a clinical antiviral drug had been shown to have selective antiviral activity if used properly. In the 1970s, Prusoff coformulated the Cheng-Prusoff equation to calculate the absolute inhibition constant Ki. In the 1980s, while the AIDS epidemic was spreading and found to be caused by HIV, William Prusoff and the late dr. Tai-Shun Lin discovered that a compound synthesized by dr. Jerome Horwitz had potent anti-HIV properties. The compound was originally named D4T, and Bristol-Myers Squibb developed and marketed this drug under its more common name, <b>Zerit.</b> It became a key drug as part of the first combination therapy for treating AIDS. Realizing that this treatment could provide great benefits to those struggling with the growing HIV crisis in impoverished Africa, Doctors Without Borders and Yale students later lobbied Yale University and Bristol-Myers Squibb to make <b>Zerit</b> available at a low cost for the African market. Prusoff quickly joined the effort, even though it meant a loss of personal income. [...] "We are not doing this to make money, we are interested in developing a compound that would be a benefit to society," [...] he explained. The effort to make <b>Zerit</b> more affordable was a success: millions of people around the world benefited from Prusoff's research and humanitarian efforts.|$|E
5000|$|Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTIs) {{are considered the}} [...] "backbone" [...] of ART and 2 medications are generally used in combination. Due to its known safety profile and extensive use in pregnant patients, zidovudine-lamivudine (ZDV/3TC) is the preferred choice as the NRTI backbone. Zidovudine may worsen anemia, so patients with anemia are advised to use an alternative agent. For women who are coinfected with Hepatitis B, tenofovir with either emtricitabine or lamivudine is the preferred NRTI backbone. NRTI use may cause lactic acidosis in some women, so {{it is important to}} monitor patients for this complication. Deaths from lactic acidosis and liver failure have been {{associated with the use of}} two NRTIs, stavudine and didanosine (<b>Zerit</b> and Videx, respectively); therefore, combinations involving these drugs should be avoided in pregnancy.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. If a {{caregiver}} {{does not have}} access to a refrigerator, the South African National Department of Health advises that stavudine adult capsule formulations be employed using the off-label 'opened capsule' dosing method. The accuracy of this dosing method has not previously been validated. Aim. To assess the accuracy of the off-label opened capsule method for stavudine dosing in infants and children. In addition, we assessed the relative ease of dispersion of generic and original capsule preparations in water to determine which preparations, if any, are suitable for the off-label opened capsule dosing method. Method. We evaluated 10 <b>Zerit</b> (Bristol-Myers Squibb), 5 Stavudine (Aspen), and 5 Stavir (Cipla) capsules. Each capsule was dispersed in 30 ml water, creating 20 separate solutions. Timed dispersion of each generic was compared with that of the original (<b>Zerit).</b> Each solution was then centrifuged to remove sediment, and the concentration of active drug (mg/ml) was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results. The ease of dispersion of the contents of Aspen Stavudine capsules was equivalent to that of <b>Zerit,</b> and resulted in a mean recovery of active drug from solution of over 97 %, confirming the accuracy of this dosing method. The contents of Stavir capsules, however, were extremely difficult to disperse in water despite prolonged agitation; consequently, the recovery of active drug from the solution was reduced. Conclusion. The accuracy of the off-label opened capsule dosing method for stavudine is acceptable. There is no need to instruct caregivers to include sediment in the aliquot given to the infant. However, studies that confirm adequate bioavailability and efficacy are needed. In addition, it is important to avoid supplying generic capsules the contents of which do not disperse easily in water, as this may lead to a significant reduction in the amount of active drug that a child receives.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of phenyl-substituted and benzoannulated cycloSal phosphate triesters of the nucleoside analogue 2 ', 3 '-dideoxy- 2 ', 3 '-didehydrothymidine (d 4 T, <b>Zerit)</b> as lipophilic, membrane-soluble pronucleotides is described. The cycloSal moiety {{was introduced by}} using cyclic chlorophosphite agents prepared from phenyl-substituted saligenin derivatives and ortho-hydroxymethylated naphthols, respectively. Hydrolysis studies (HPLC analysis) of the triesters 2, 3 showed a range of hydrolytic stability from 1. 4 h up to 5. 1 h and the stability could be correlated with the substitution pattern in the cycloSal moiety. A slight decrease of their stability was observed, if phenyl-substituted derivatives were hydrolyzed in human CEM/O cell extracts. D 4 T and thymine, possible products of enzymatic cleavage of the pronucleotides, were not detected in the cell extracts. A further investigation of the hydrolysis process was performed by 31 P-NMR spectroscopy. This technique allowed a precise monitoring of the degradation products and the exact determination of the product ratio. Finally, the newly synthesized compounds were tested concerning their antiviral activity against HIV in vitro. A strong correlation of the hydrolysis properties and the antiviral activity was found. 3 -phenyl-cycloSal-d 4 TMP showed a threefold increase in its anti-HIV- 1 activity and retained full activity in thymidine kinase (TK) deficient cells, indicative of a successful TK-bypass. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiviral}} drug 2 ′, 3 ′-didehydro- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (D 4 T; also know as stavudine and <b>Zerit),</b> {{which is used}} against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), causes delayed toxicity (peripheral neuropathy) in long-term use. After examining a series of 2 ′, 3 ′-didehydro- 3 ′-deoxy- 4 ′-substituted thymidine (4 ′-substituted D 4 T) analogs, 4 ′-ethynyl D 4 T {{was found to have}} a fivefold-better antiviral effect and to cause less cellular and mitochondrial toxicity than D 4 T. The antiviral activity of this compound can be reversed by dThd but not by dCyd. The compound acted synergistically with β-l- 2 ′, 3 ′-deoxy- 3 ′-thiacytidine (also known as lamivudine) and β-l- 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxy- 2 ′, 3 ′-didehydro- 5 -fluorocytidine (also known as elvucitabine) and additively with 2 ′, 3 ′-dideoxyinosine (also known as didanosine and Videx) and 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine (also known as Retovir and zidovudine) against HIV. 4 ′-Ethynyl D 4 T is phosphorylated by purified human thymidine kinase 1 (TK- 1) from CEM cells with a faster relative Vmax and a lower Km value than D 4 T. The efficiency of TK- 1 in the phosphorylation of 4 ′-ethynyl D 4 T is fourfold better than that of D 4 T. While D 4 T is broken down by the catabolic enzyme thymidine phosphorylase, the level of breakdown of 4 ′-ethynyl D 4 T was below detection. Since 4 ′-ethynyl D 4 T has increased anti-HIV activity and decreased toxicity and interacts favorably with other currently used anti-HIV drugs, it should be considered for further development as an anti-HIV drug...|$|E
40|$|Generic {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy is}} {{the mainstay of}} HIV treatment in resource-limited settings, yet {{there is little evidence}} confirming the bioequivalence of generic and brand name formulations. We compared the steady-state pharmacokinetics of lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine in HIV-infected subjects who were receiving a generic formulation (Triomune) or the corresponding brand formulations (Epivir, <b>Zerit,</b> and Viramune). An open-label, randomized, crossover study was carried out in 18 HIV-infected Ugandan subjects stabilized on Triomune- 40. Subjects received lamivudine (150 mg), stavudine (40 mg), and nevirapine (200 mg) in either the generic or brand formulation twice a day for 30 days, before switching to the other formulation. At the end of each treatment period, blood samples were collected over 12 h for pharmacokinetic analysis. The main outcome measures were the mean AUC(0 - 12 h) and C(max). Bioequivalence was defined as a geometric mean ratio between the generic and brand name within the 90 % confidence interval of 0. 8 - 1. 25. The geometric mean ratios and the 90 % confidence intervals were: stavudine C(max), 1. 3 (0. 99 - 1. 71) and AUC(0 - 12 h), 1. 1 (0. 87 - 1. 38); lamivudine C(max), 0. 8 (0. 63 - 0. 98) and AUC(0 - 12 h), 0. 8 (0. 65 - 0. 99); and nevirapine C(max), 1. 1 (0. 95 - 1. 23) and AUC(0 - 12 h), 1. 1 (0. 95 - 1. 31). The generic formulation was not statistically bioequivalent to the brand formulations during steady state, although exposures were comparable. A mixed random effects model identified about 50 % intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters. These findings provide support for the use of Triomune in resource-limited settings, although identification of the sources of intersubject variability in these populations is critical...|$|E
40|$|Two {{important}} {{studies were}} presented back to back. David Nolan's study was presented immediately after Michael Dubé's A 5005 s substudy of ACTG 384. Using {{a different approach}} from the ACTG study (a longitudinal, non-randomized trial), this group from western Australia looked at {{what happened to the}} peripheral fat of treatment-naive patients who were started on a regimen containing either stavudine (d 4 T, <b>Zerit)</b> or zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir). The number of patients in this study was smaller than in the A 5005 s substudy. There were only 53 patients in Dr. Nolan's study, 27 of whom had received stavudine, and 26 zidovudine. Both groups of patients were comparable at baseline, with a slightly lower body mass index (BMI) for the group that received stavudine (remember, this was not a randomized trial). Patients were followed {{for two and a half}} years on average, and if they changed their medication, they were censored at that point. Patients had three to six dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans during the follow up. With the longitudinal data captured, they were able to model fat loss over time for each group of patients. They were also able to create mathematical equations that would predict the rate of fat loss depending on the nucleoside (stavudine or zidovudine) that was selected to originally treat the patients. The choice of stavudine or zidovudine was a strong predictor of the rate of fat loss in the extremities of these patients. Whether the patient was or was not on a PI- or an NNRTI-based regimen did not matter at all. Age and an AIDS diagnosis were also predictors of the fat loss. The study has the beauty of longitudinal studies. Cross-sectional studies, no matter how well done or large they are, cannot tell us more of what they have told us already. This study confirms A 5005 s, which proved that patients receiving stavudine lose peripheral fat faster than patients receiving zidovudine. Not a big surprise for anybody, but it is nice to see data that supports conventional wisdom...|$|E
