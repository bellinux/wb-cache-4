40|$|The {{management}} of an invasive species presents some similarities with renewable resources. However, the objective function {{is the sum}} of two positive and often increasing components : environmental damages and management costs. The paper stresses the importance of stock externalities to ensure that a non <b>zero</b> <b>stock</b> is optimal. In a static approach, the paper shows that when the damage function is always increasing, the absence of stock externalities leads to a solution of eradication (<b>zero</b> <b>stock)</b> under usual assumptions. If the damage is decreasing (and negative as sometimes assumed) it is still possible that a non <b>zero</b> <b>stock</b> to be optimal. In the presence of externalities {{it is more likely that}} an interior solution be optimal, although it needs not to be the case. If the cost externalities tend to be infinitely large for low stock levels, then an eradication is ruled out. In the dynamic approach, conditions are given for an interior solution to exist. Again it is shown that the existence of externalities helps satisfy both first and second order (convexity) conditions for a solution stopping short from full eradication.

The study calculates the equity premium using a variation of a formula in the classic Gordon stock valuation model. The calculation includes the bond yield, the stock dividend yield, and the expected dividend growth rate, which in this formulation can change over time. The study calculates the premium for several measures of the aggregate U. S. stock portfolio and several assumptions about bond yields and stock dividends and gets basically the same result. The premium averaged about 7 percentage points during 1926 – 70 and only about 0. 7 of a percentage point after that.

30|$|One {{significant}} {{result of this}} organization is that transport chains’ urban segment is {{taken care of by}} local carriers, which are often very small businesses with low profit margins. To reduce costs, these local carriers use old vehicles that emit large amounts of pollutants. Another result is that the urban goods transport sector remains relatively under-optimized. A sizable part of urban freight transport is inefficient, i.e. it uses more vehicle-kilometres than necessary to supply households and businesses. The freight industry has had to be very flexible in responding {{to the demands of the}} new urban economy: decreased size of inventories (<b>zero</b> <b>stock),</b> growing demand for express and urgent deliveries, fragmentation of shipments (a few parcels received each day instead of a consolidated load once a week), fast increase of home deliveries following the rapid growth of on-line shopping.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 201420. yüzyılın başlarından itibaren hızla gelişen endüstriler süreçlerini daha iyi kontrol etmek ve maliyetlerini azaltmak istemektedirler. 1960 ’lı yıllarda Toyota Motor Company tarafından uygulanmaya başlanan ve 1974 yılında dünyayı sarsan petrol krizi ile beraber “Yalın Üretim Sistemi” tüm dikkatleri üzerine çekmiştir. Yalın üretim sisteminin temeli sıfır hata ve sıfır stok prensibine dayanmaktadır. Yalın üretim sistemine göre müşterinin para ödemek istemeyeceği her aktivite israftır. İsraflar, yalın üretim sistemindeki araçlar kullanılarak ortadan kaldırılabilir veya azaltılabilir. Böylece işletmeler için maliyete neden olan ama katma değer yaratmayan aktiviteler yani israflar ortadan kalkar ve işletmelerin rekabet güçleri artar. Bu çalışmada, yalın üretim yaklaşımının nasıl ortaya çıktığı, yalın üretim sisteminin tanımı ve amacı açıklanmıştır. Yalın üretim sistemi bakış açısıyla işletmelerdeki israfların türleri ve oluşum nedenleri belirtilmiştir. Yalın üretim sisteminin uygulanması için işletmenin sahip olması gereken ilkeler belirtilmiştir. Üretim kontrol ve malzeme tedariğine ilişkin yalın üretim tekniklerinden çekme sistemi, süreç içi sabit stok, polca, kit halinde teslimat, döngüsel sefer ve karma sistemler detaylı olarak incelenmiştir. Otomotiv yan sanayisinde iklimlendirme sistemleri alanında uluslararası faaliyet gösteren bir işletmede uygulama yapılmıştır. İşletme, Türkiye ve Almanya fabrikasında ürettiği klimalarda kullanılan bakır boruları firma bünyesinde üretmektedir. İşletmedeki tüm üretim bölümlerinin kontrolü üretim planlama bölümü tarafından yapılmaktadır. Yarı mamul olan bakır borular, malzeme tedariğine ilişkin yalın üretim teknikleri kullanılarak incelenmiş ve üretim planlamadan bağımsız olarak kendi üretim ihtiyacını kontrol eden bir yapıya dönüştürülmesine karar verilmiştir. Bir üründe yaklaşık on farklı tipte bakır boru kullanılmaktadır. Yapılan çalışma sonucunda aynı üründe gereksinim duyulan borular kit haline getirilmiştir. Her bir kitin bir ürünlük malzeme bulundurması gerekmekte fakat bu durum üretim süreci açısından {{probleme}} sebep olmaktadır. Bu kitler için kanban büyüklükleri belirlenerek tek kanbanlı sistem uygulanmıştır. Almanya fabrikası için üretilen boruların belli bir sipariş yoğunluğuna sahip olanları için tek kanbanlı sistem, bu yoğunluğun altında kalan boruların ise POLCA sistemine {{benzer bir}} sistem ile takip edilmesine karar verilmiştir. Yapılan uygulama sonucunda ek alan ve maliyete gereksinim duyulmadan, malzeme tedariği, malzeme kontrolü ve üretim talebi kontrolünde % 51 ile % 100 arasında değişen iyileştirmeler olmuştur. Stoklardan yaklaşık % 2 artış olmuştur. Bu artış yönetim tarafından kabul görmüştür. Üretim planlama bölümünden kaynaklanabilecek hatalar ortadan kaldırılmıştır. Klima üretim hattı ile bakır boru üretim tesisi arasında üretim kontrol ve malzeme besleme sistemi geliştirilmiştir. Borular kit olarak kullanılmakta ve kullanım sonrasında sistemde ihtiyaç fazlası boru kalmamaktadır. Kit halinde teslimat yapılan uygulamalarda depoda kitler çalışanlar tarafından hazırlanırken, bu uygulamada bakır boru üretiminin boruları kit haline getirilmiş şekilde üretmesi sağlanmış ve kit hazırlama maliyeti oluşmamıştır. Beginning of 20 th century demand {{of the market}} had increased. Companies wanted to increase their production speed. Therefore, mass production method was become the best production method. While after production rate was caught the demand, customers were wanted to have the products customized and affordable price. Rapid growth industries want to control and reduce their costs. Lean Manufacturing System was applied by Toyota Motor Company in the 1960 ’s. In 1974, oil crisis arises and calls attention to Lean Manufacturing System. The main aim of this system is meeting the customer demand with using minimum sources. Lean manufacturing system is based on two principles, which are zero failure and <b>zero</b> <b>stock.</b> Every activity which customer isn’t willing to pay is waste. These wastes could be eliminated or reduced by using Lean manufacturing tools. Most known seven wastes are over production, waiting, carrying, processing wastes and working with huge stock, movements and defective products. Activities, which have non value adding costs in other term wastes, are removed and company opportunities are increased. In this thesis, how lean manufacturing was showed up, definition and goals of the lean manufacturing system are explained. Types of waste and causes are described from lean manufacturing aspect. The mandatory principles in order to apply lean manufacturing system are defined. Four principles which are value, value flow, flow and pull, have to be applied first. Afterwards, zero defect aspect has to be applied. In the literature research, types of pull system, constant work in process, paired-cells overlapping loops of cards (POLCA), kitting, milk-run and production control and hybrid systems {{are studied in detail}} with figures. Especially, pull system, POLCA and kitting and their interaction are researched. Pull system and kitting were used in many cases regarding to automotive sector. Reasons of these are high handling costs, space requirements, having high customization requests. An application is done in a factory which produces air conditioning units as a original equipment manufacturer in automotive industry. Factory produces their units to order. This factory produces air conditioning units to sell and produces copper pipes and light resin transfer molding covers in order to install their end products. Copper pipes and covers are in-house production and they are used in both Turkey and Germany plants. Copper pipe production is located three kilometers away from the factory Therefore, logistics costs were taken into consideration. In the thesis, actual order acceptance process and production processes are explained by using value stream mapping method. Afterwards, production planning system for both air conditioning and copper pipe production are explained in detail. Light resin transfer molding production is left out of the scope. In actual state, production plan for each production department is given by production planning department. Material feeding systems for copper pipes, which are used in both Turkey and Germany plant, were researched. Potential problems and disadvantages of actual system were examined. Material feeding system requires high work forces of warehouse employees. Produce to order systems requires more setup times. In addition, approximately on different shaped copper pipes are assembled while a unit is producing. Therefore, production can’t be done because of partial production. While redesigning the material feeding system pipes for Turkey plant and Germany plant are separated. The pipes, which are going to be consumed in Turkey plant, become a kit. These kits are created according to pipe-unit matrix. Actually, kits must be consisted of the pipes which are used in same units. Normally, parts in one kit should belong to one unit, but in this application these kits are turned into one bin kanban system due to production restrictions. By this way, setup times and kit preparation times are decreased. Thereafter, pipe production foremen can be able to give a decision of what should be produced. Production planner was giving the production quantities according to system but here after foremen also see the physical situation. Due to having discrete manufacturing, number of Kanban’s must be at least two. Because of that, number of Kanban calculation formula was converted to quantity per kanban equitation whose unknown is quantity per kanban. Required carrier options are searched. Three different types of carriers are used in actual state. Copper pipes for the Germany plant are separated into two different groups. One bin kanban systems were applied to the higher demand group. Lower demand group will have a system similar to POLCA. Higher demand group is consisted of 39 different material codes whose average demands are higher than 20 pieces per month. Lower demand group is consisted of 120 different material codes are lower than 20 pieces per month. Kanban system for higher demand group is exactly same with Turkey plant kanban system. Requirements regarding to Turkey plant are controlled by pipe production foremen. Not only systemic but also physical control is established. Stocks out costs are reduced due to using of kanban system. Pipes are become kit and partial production problems are solved. Work forces for checking the parts availability are improved % 100. Material supplies to the production line are done by warehouse employee. Materials are supplied by kits therefore material feeding time is reduced by % 80. Control of production requirements are reduced by % 72. Control of production requirements for Germany plant is reduced by % 57. Existing material carriers are used in future state. Existing material stocking area is efficiently used and layout study is done. Improved value stream map for pipe production is drawn. Production plan flow between production planning and copper pipe production foremen is removed. As a result, stocks are increased by % 2. Management accepted this increasement in stocks. All mistakes could be done by production planning are eliminated. Self-control mechanisms are created. Material feeding system has established between air conditioning production line and copper pipe production line. Normally, kitting workers are required for kit preparation in general. However, in this application, kits are prepared by pipe production employees during while pipes are producing. Existing material carriers and existing stocking areas are used efficiently. Setup times are reduced due to producing as many as kanban quantities. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the long-run dynamics and the cyclical {{structure of the}} US stock market using fractional integration techniques, specifically {{a version of the}} tests of Robinson (1994 a) which allows for unit (or fractional) roots both at the zero (long-run) and at the cyclical frequencies. We consider inflation, real risk-free rate, real stock returns, equity premium and price/dividend ratio, annually from 1871 to 1993. When focusing exclusively on the long-run frequency, the estimated order of integration varies considerably, but nonstationarity is found only for the price/dividend ratio. When the cyclical component is also taken into account, most series appear to be stationary and to exhibit long memory. Further, mean reversion occurs. Finally, the fractional (at zero and cyclical) models are shown to forecast more accurately than rival ones based on fractional and integer differentiation exclusively at the <b>zero</b> frequency. <b>Stock</b> market, Fractional cycles, Long memory, Gegenbauer processes...|$|R

Much research has been published on the returns to mergers and acquisitions generally and {{in the last ten years}} quite a bit has been published on this topic in hospitality journals. But very little has been published about the impact of payment method in hospitality mergers and acquisitions. This paper uses standard event study methodology to determine abnormal returns for a sample of 282 bidding hospitality firms. The results are that an acquisition in the hospitality industry is more likely to be profitable if payment is made with cash. This provides empirical support for the asymmetric information and signaling theories premise that bidding firms will earn positive abnormal returns for cash offers, but returns are not significantly different than <b>zero</b> for <b>stock</b> offers...|$|R
40|$|We study a two-echelon serial {{inventory}} {{system with}} stochastic demand. We assume that fixed ordering costs are charged only when an order initiates a non-zero shipment. The system is centrally controlled and ordering decisions {{are based on}} echelon base stock policies. The review period of the upper echelon is an integer multiple of the review period of the lower echelon. We derive an exact analytical expression for the objective function. From this expression, we determine optimal base stock levels and review periods. Through a numerical study we show {{that there may be}} several combinations of optimal review periods and that under high fixed ordering costs both stockpoints have the same order frequency. In addition, we identify parameter settings under which the system behaves like a PUSH-system, where the upstream stockpoint never holds any stock. Generally, in literature fixed ordering costs are charged at every review moment, even if no shipment results due to <b>zero</b> upstream <b>stock.</b> We test the impact of this simplifying assumption and illustrate when it is justified...|$|R

40|$|The initial {{thrust of}} this {{research}} (Thompson 1995) was an event study that dealt with shareholder reaction to the announcement of a merger of two bank holding companies (BHC).

This paper details regressions analyses that were employed to attempt to isolate the underlying reasons for the abnormal returns. The results of the regressions indicate that, of the variables chosen, only the capital-toassets ratio was significant for the acquired sample. None of the variables were significant for the acquiring sample...|$|R
40|$|A {{rational}} expectations competitive storage model {{is applied to}} the U. S. corn market to assess the aptness of this framework in explaining monthly price behavior in an actual commodity market. Relative to previous models, extensive realism is added to the model in terms of how production activities and storage costs are specified. By modeling convenience yield, "backwardation" in prices between crop years does not depend on the unrealistic assumption of <b>zero</b> ending <b>stocks.</b> Our model produces cash prices that are distributed with positive skewness and kurtosis, and mean and variance that increase over the storage season, consistent with the persistence and the occasional spikes observed in commodity prices. Futures prices are generated as conditional expectations of spot prices at contract maturity, and the variances of futures prices have realistic time-to-maturity and seasonal patterns. Model realizations of cash and futures prices over many "years" are used to demonstrate the wide variety of price behaviors that can be observed in an efficient market with a similar market structure, implying that marketing strategies based on short, historical samples of prices to manage price risk can be misleading.

40|$|This paper studies a two-echelon {{supply chain}} with {{stochastic}} and discrete consumer demand, batch order quantities, periodic inventory review, and deterministic transportation times. Reorder point policies manage inventories at every location. Average inventory, backorders and fill rates are evaluated exactly for each location. Safety stock is evaluated exactly {{at the lower}} echelon and a good approximation is detailed for the upper echelon. Numerical data are presented to demonstrate the model’s utility. It is found that system costs generally increase substantially if the upper echelon is restricted to carry no inventory, of if the upper echelon is required to provide a high fill rate. In many cases it is optimal to set the upper echelon’s reorder point to yield near <b>zero</b> safety <b>stock,</b> yet in some cases this simple heuristic can significantly increase supply chain operating costs. Finally, policies selected under the assumption of continuous inventory review can perform poorly if implemented in an environment with periodic review. This paper studies a distribution system with one central warehouse and N identical retailers. Inventory is reviewed periodically and transportation times are deterministic. Firms implement reorder point policies and order quantities equal integer multiples of a fixed batch size. Consumer demand is stochastic with a known discrete distribution function that is stationary and independent across tim...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide new}} {{evidence}} on {{the efficiency of the}} Berlin Stock Exchange prior to World War I, when it ranked among the top few markets worldwide by market capitalization. Using a new set of monthly stock price data for a random sample of German companies between 1904 and 1910, we estimate a typical three-factor model and find that returns relate positively to risk (beta), but that book-to-market ratios enter as well (negatively). Firm size and earnings/price ratio relate positively but weakly to returns. The results indicate that the Berlin market did not suffer from unusually large pricing anomalies; thus, its performance was not substantially different from modern markets. Also supporting the conclusion of market efficiency, a momentum portfolio earns returns not different from <b>zero,</b> on average. <b>Stock</b> market anomalies, Book-to-market, Value effect, Size effect...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of maximizing {{expected}} utility from terminal wealth in a semi-static market composed of derivative securities, which we assume can be traded only at time <b>zero,</b> and of <b>stocks,</b> which can be traded continuously in time and are modeled as locally-bounded semi-martingales. Using a general utility function defined on the positive real line, we first study existence and uniqueness of the solution, and then we consider the dependence of the outputs of the utility maximization problem {{on the price of}} the derivatives, investigating not only stability but also differentiability, monotonicity, convexity and limiting properties. Comment: 31 pages. I have decided to merge the paper arXiv: 1210. 5466 with the version 1 of the present paper. This version 2 {{is the result of the}} merg...|$|R
40|$|We studied carbon {{balances}} {{and carbon}} stocks of mountain rangelands and meadows {{in a network}} of 8 eddy covariance sites and 14 sites with biomass data in Europe. Net ecosystem exchange of pastures and extensively managed semi-natural rangelands were usually close to zero, while meadows fixed carbon, {{with the exception of}} one meadow that was established on a drained peatland. When we accounted for off-site losses and inputs also the carbon budget of meadows approached <b>zero.</b> Soil carbon <b>stocks</b> in these ecosystems were high, comparable to those of forest ecosystems, while carbon stocks in plant biomass were smaller. Since soil carbon stocks of abandoned mountain grasslands are as high as in managed ecosystems, it is likely that the widespread abandonment of mountain rangelands used currently as pastures will not lead to an immediate carbon sink in those ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an investor who has available {{a bank account}} (risk free asset) and a stock (risky asset). It is assumed that the interest rate for the risk free asset is <b>zero</b> and the <b>stock</b> price is modeled by a diffusion process. The wealth can be transferred between the two assets under a proportional transaction cost. Investor is allowed to obtain loans from the bank and also to short-sell the risky asset when necessary. The optimization problem addressed here is to maximize the probability of reaching a financial goal a before bankruptcy and to obtain an optimal portfolio selection policy. Our optimal policy {{is a combination of}} local-time processes and jumps. In the interesting case, it is determined by a non-linear switching curve on the state space. This work is a generalization of Weerasinghe [20], where this switching boundary is a vertical line segment. Optimal investment, stochastic differential equations, transaction costs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Business organisations {{are facing}} a lot of {{competition}} during these days. To withstand the competition and to remain in the front row, an enterprise should have optimum profitable plan for his business. Researchers in recent years have developed various inventory models for deteriorating items considering various practical situations. Partial backlogging is considerably a new concept introduced in developing various models for Weibull deteriorating items. 	Methodology: In this paper an inventory model has been developed considering three parameter Weibull deterioration of a single item with partial backlogging. Here demand rate is considered to be constant and lead time is <b>zero.</b> During the <b>stock</b> out period the backlogging rate is variable and is dependent on the length of the waiting time for the next replenishment. 	Results and conclusion: Optimal order quantity and total variable cost during a cycle has been derived for the proposed inventory model considering three parameter Weibull deteriorating item with partial backlogging. The results obtained in this paper are illustrated {{with the help of a}} numerical example and sensitivity analysis...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is an event}} study that deals with shareholder reaction to {{the announcement of the}} merger of two bank holding companies (BHC). The work spans the time period 1980 - 1987. The period was chosen because of its correspondence with significant deregulation of the industry and significant swings in economic activity. The changing economic activity during the period allowed the study of the deregulation effects in different economic climates. The study employs three single-index and two double-index econometric models. An index of bank stocks was also developed to facilitate the analysis. The results of this study provide additional evidence on 1) the significance of bank merger announcements, 2) the comparative announcement effects across exchanges, 3) a comparison of acquiring versus acquired effects, and 4) evidence on the consequences of model choice. It is found that positive abnormal returns accrue to the shareholders of the acquired firm. The abnormal returns to the shareholders of the acquiring firm are either significantly negative or <b>zero</b> and are <b>stock</b> exchange dependent...|$|R
40|$|Every year in Kenya, {{more than}} 100, 000 {{children}} under the age of five die. 90 percent of these deaths can be avoided via the administration of basic essential medicines. Diarrhea is one illness that is easily and cheaply treated, yet more than 5, 400 Kenyan children die from it every year. Proper use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) prevents mortality in 93 percent of diarrheal cases, and the average daily dose costs only 15 US cents. Children are dying because they are not receiving this effective and affordable treatment. The main claim of this dissertation is that low uptake of ORS in Kenya is a problem of supply not demand. Contrary to previous scholarship, I will show that Kenyans demand ORS and administer it to their children when it is available. However, ORS is frequently out of stock in local dispensaries. Using data from an independent audit, I show that 40 percent of Ministry of Health dispensaries in western Kenya have <b>zero</b> ORS in <b>stock.</b> I offer suggestive evidence of what is causing this lack of supply: politicians in Kenya are more incentivized to provide highly visible projects rather than high-impact, low-cost solutions...|$|R
