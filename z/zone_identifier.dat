[BACKWARD INCOMPABILITY] The second argument to stri_pad_*() has been renamed width. [GENERAL] # 69 : stringi is now bundled with ICU 4 C 55. 1. [NEW FUNCTIONS] stri_extract_*_boundaries() extract text between text boundaries. [NEW FUNCTION] # 46 : stri_trans_char() is a stringi-flavoured chartr() equivalent.

Moreover, the default behavior of stri_wrap() is now such that it does not get rid of non-breaking, zero width, etc. spaces [NEW FEATURE] # 133 : stri_wrap() silently allows for width <= 0 (for compatibility with strwrap()).

40|$|Abstract â€” Naming and {{addressing}} are important issues for Next Generation Internet (NGI). In this paper, we discuss a new Mobility and Multihoming supporting Identifier Locator Split Architecture (MILSA). There are three main contributions of our solution. First, we separate trust relationships (realms) from connectivity (<b>zones).</b> A hierarchical <b>identifier</b> {{system for the}} realms and a Realm Zone Bridging Server (RZBS) infrastructure that performs the bridging function is introduced. Second, we separate the signaling and data plane functions to improve the performance and support mobility. Third, to provide transparency to the upper layer applications, identifier locator split happens in network layer. A Hierarchical URI-like Identifier (HUI) {{is used by the}} upper layers and is mapped to a locators set by HUI Mapping Sublayer (HMS) through interaction with RZBS infrastructure. Further scenarios description and analysis show the benefits of this scheme for routing scalability, mobility and multihoming...|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{today is}} facing a {{scalability}} problem in it default free <b>Zone</b> (DFZ) and <b>Identifier</b> and locator split (Id/loc)) have been proposed as a solution. As for all Id/Loc split protocol a mapping system is required to bind the identifiers to their locators. Locator and identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) a network based of id/loc split approach provide scalability of the mapping system through aggregation of identifiers by edge router. Due to location update during entity movement the reaggregation causes a high latency between mapping system component {{at the same time}} with scalability concern in case reaggregation is impossible. In this paper we propose a mapping system based on registries allocation with an update scheme to reduce latency.. Introduction 1 The alarming growth of the DFZ [2] of the routing system has been the cause of the scalability problem of the internet. The usage of a single namespace to express the identity and the location of an entity has been the root o...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the Danish Integrated Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring and Research Programme (DANMAP) are to monitor trends in resistance among bacteria from animals, food and humans, to monitor the consumption of antimicrobial agents and to determine the association between consumption and occurrence of resistance and to model transmission of resistance from animals to humans. DANMAP {{is based on the}} examination of representative bacterial isolates of animal and human pathogens, of zoonotic bacteria and of indicator bacteria. For food animals, both diseased and the healthy populations are studied. Isolates from all three reservoirs are examined for their susceptibility to a basic panel of antibiotics that includes representatives of the major classes of compounds, making comparison of resistance levels in the reservoirs possible. Isolates are stored in a strain collection and are available for further study. The data are stored in databases as MIC values or mm inhibition <b>zones</b> with all <b>identifiers.</b> A system for recording all use of the veterinary medicines, VETSTAT, is currently under implementation. For production animals, the consumption will be recorded for each herd, providing a basis for detailed modelling of the effect o...|$|R
