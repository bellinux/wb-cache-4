Around 1900, the community was concentrated in a few areas, was geographically static and [...] "...was characterised by very high death rate, very high birth rate, very early age at marriage, and 10 to 12 children per married woman". The population had increased eight-fold during the preceding century, from a base figure of about 100,000, and comprised nearly 50 per cent children. But, the population growth of Saint Thomas Christians came down drastically after 1960s, with the lowest birth rate, highest age at marriage, highest family planning user rate, and lowest fertility rate compared to other communities in Kerala. The proportion of children has come down to less than 25%. The absolute and relative size of the community is in a diminishing trend and is approaching a <b>Zero</b> <b>Population</b> <b>Growth</b> regime.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate {{is the key}} unifying {{variable}} linking the various facets of population ecology. The importance of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate lies partly in its central role in forecasting future population trends; indeed if the form of density dependence were constant and known, then the future population dynamics could to some degree be predicted. We argue that <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate is also central {{to our understanding of}} environmental stress: environmental stressors should be defined as factors which when first applied to a <b>population</b> reduce <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate. The joint action of such stressors determines an organism's ecological niche, which should be defined as the set of environmental conditions where <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate is greater than <b>zero</b> (where <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate = r = log(e) (N(t+ 1) /N(t))). While environmental stressors have negative effects on <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate, {{the same is true of}} population density, the case of negative linear effects corresponding to the well-known logistic equation. Following Sinclair, we recognize population regulation as occurring when <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate is negatively density dependent. Surprisingly, given its fundamental importance in population ecology, only 25 studies were discovered in the literature in which <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate has been plotted against population density. In 12 of these the effects of density were linear; in all but two of the remainder the relationship was concave viewed from above. Alternative approaches to establishing the determinants of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate are reviewed, paying special attention to the demographic and mechanistic approaches. The effects of population density on <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate may act through their effects on food availability and associated effects on somatic growth, fecundity and survival, according to a 'numerical response', the evidence for which is briefly reviewed. Alternatively, there may be effects on <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate of <b>population</b> density in addition to those that arise through the partitioning of food between competitors; this is 'interference competition'. The distinction is illustrated using a replicated laboratory experiment on a marine copepod, Tisbe battagliae. Application of these approaches in conservation biology, ecotoxicology and human demography is briefly considered. We conclude that population regulation, density dependence, resource and interference competition, the effects of environmental stress and the form of the ecological niche, are all best defined and analysed in terms of <b>population</b> <b>growth</b> rate...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{violence}} in South Sudan produced significant levels of conflict-driven migration undermining the accuracy and utility of both {{national and local}} level population forecasts commonly used in demographic estimates, public health metrics and food security proxies. This article explores the use of Thiessen Polygons and population grids (Gridded Population of the World, WorldPop and LandScan) as weights for estimating the catchment areas for settlement locations that serve large populations of internally displaced persons (IDP), in order to estimate the county-level in- and out-migration attributable to conflict-driven displacement between 2014 - 2015. Acknowledging IDP totals improves internal population estimates presented by global population databases. Unlike other forecasts, which produce spatially uniform increases in population, accounting for displaced population reveals that 15 percent of counties (n = 12) increased in population over 20 percent, and 30 percent of counties (n = 24) experienced <b>zero</b> or declining <b>population</b> <b>growth,</b> due to internal displacement and refugee out-migration.

40|$|It is {{generally}} thought that for sake of consistency {{men and women}} must have the same average number of lifetime partners. However, {{this is not the}} case in general. When men have younger partners, women enter sexual relationships more quickly than men and have a higher number of lifetime partners. A male dominant model applied to UK data on the male rate of entry into a sexual relationship and the male partnership formation function shows that in a stationary <b>population</b> (<b>zero</b> <b>growth</b> rate) women have 9. 1 % more partners than men. In a stable population with an intrinsic growth rate of - 2 % and a larger but still plausible difference between the ages of partners, women have 24. 6 % more partners than men. Given that in sex surveys men report more partners than women, the resulting bias in estimated numbers of partners may therefore be larger than previously thought. lifetime partners, male dominant model, stable population, stationary population, United Kingdom,...|$|R
