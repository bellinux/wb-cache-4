50|$|Compounds in this {{generation}} were more potent, more stable and had longer durations of action. One of these, CGP2928, a peptidomimetic compound, {{was the first}} renin inhibitor proven effective when taken orally. Tested on marmosets, it was only active at high doses. Development of new drugs in the second generation continued to improve pharmacokinetic properties. Remikiren, enalkiren and <b>zankiren</b> were then discovered. These were peptidomimetic inhibitors with improved structures that made them more specific, potent and stable. Unfortunately, clinical development was terminated because the drugs had poor oral bioavailability (poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized) and lowering blood pressure activity still remained low.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{treatments}} {{available today}} for treating hypertension is diuretics, Î²-blockers, {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} inhibitors (ACEs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers, a-blockers, vasodilators, and centrally acting drugs. It is difficult to achieve the optimized renin angiotensin aldosterone system suppression with currently available antihypertensive agents, because ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics all activate the compensatory feedback mechanism that increases renin release and increase plasma renin activity. The first orally active direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) were developed in 1980 s, including enalkiren, remikiren, and <b>zankiren.</b> However, poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, less bioavailability (< 2 %), short half life, and low potency hindered {{the development of these}} compounds. Aliskiren is the first DRI for the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren is designed through a combination of molecular modeling techniques and crystal structure elucidation. Aliskiren effectively reduces the blood pressure as a mono therapy as well in combination therapy...|$|E
