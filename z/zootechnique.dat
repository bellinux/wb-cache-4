Could takes from 4 to 6 years (8 to 12 periods), is also more specific and could be applied for Scientific Arts courses (like Engineering, Maths, Physics, etc.), somewhat is called Human Art courses in Brazil (like History, Portuguese and Literature and Lawyer studies for example) {{as well as for}} Health Arts (like Medicine, Nursery, <b>Zootechnique,</b> Veterinary and Biology for example). To be able to start the bachelor's degree in Brazil the candidate must to prove proficient in different disciplines and have at least the accumulated Preliminary, Medium and High School degrees accomplished with the minimum merit of 60% to 70% of the degrees and a correspondent study period that can vary from 10 to 12 years minimum. The Bachelor of Science courses in Brazilian Universities normally have the first 1 to 2 years (first 2 to 4 periods) of basics fundamental disciplines (like for example Calculus I, II, III and IV for some engineering courses, Geometry basics and advanced, Analytical Laboratories experiments in Mechanics, Optics, Magnetism, etc.) and the last 2 to 3 years disciplines more related to the professional fields of that Bachelor of Science (for example Units Operations, Thermodynamics, Chemical Reactors, Industrial Processes Kinetics for Chemical Engineering for example). Some disciplines are prerequisite to others and in some universities, the student is not allowed to course any discipline of the entire next period if he was unsuccessful in just one prerequisite discipline of the present period. Usually, the Bachelor of Sciences courses demand a one-year mandatory probation period {{by the end of the}} course (internship in the specific professional area, like a training period), followed by relatively elaborate written and oral evaluations. To get the certification as BSc most Universities require that the students achieve the accomplishment of 60% to 70% in all the [...] "obligatory disciplines", plus the supervisioned and approved training period (like a supervisioned internship period), the final thesis of the course and in some BSc. the final exam test. The final exam also is required so far.

40|$|Dependable {{availability}} of quality fry to stock growout production systems {{has been one}} of the most critical factors in the commercial success of industrial production of fish and shellfish. Over the past two decades intensive larviculture of several fish and shellfish species has expanded into a multimillion dollar industry. Although much progress has been made in identifying the dietary requirements of the larvae of various aquaculture species, the mass culture of their early larval stages still requires the use of live feeds, i. e., selected species of microalgae, the rotifer Brachionus, and the brine shrimp Artemia. The latter two substitutes for natural zooplankton are eventually supplemented with selected lipids and vitamins so as to better meet the dietary requirements of the cultured larvae. An improved knowledge of the composition and functional role of the microflora present in the culture tank or added through the food has allowed improvement of disinfection protocols, eventually complemented with a probiotic use of selected microflora. Brachionus and Artemia can also be used as convenient carriers for oral delivery of chemotherapeutics, vaccines and hormones. Improved <b>zootechniques</b> have also made fish and shellfish larviculture more predictable and more cost-effective.

According to the participants at a workshop on agricultural information in Central Africa, it can indeed. The meeting was organized by CTA in Libreville, Gabon (October 7 - 11, 1991) together with the Institut de Recherche Agronomique et <b>Zootechnique</b> (IRAZ) and supported by the Economic Community of Central African States (CEEAC). This was the first of a series of gatherings of this kind that CTA intends to organize for the coming few years. The objective of these meetings is to bring together the Centre's various target groups in order to analyze their different information needs so that a cooperative strategy can be evolved. This first meeting was meant particularly to determine the most urgent requirements in the region, as a basis for the development of remedial programmes. This procedure will be followed for all the other regions of the ACP. The primary task of agricultural information is to oil the wheels of agricultural production, and it does this by informing decision makers, promoting innovation, raising awareness and by making a link between the farm and the outside world. This last is all the more important nowadays because many of the extension and training systems set up during the last 20 years are under threat, and it is vital to keep open the channel between the scientist and the peasant farmer. For this reason the current Lomé Convention, more than any of its predecessors, puts great emphasis on the necessity to develop the ACP countries' own potential for generating and disseminating STI (scientific and technical information) in the field of agriculture and rural development. Awareness of existing STI resources is a prerequisite for development, and so the participants in the workshop underlined the necessity of making a working inventory of operational centres: research programmes should be listed, possibilities of training for scientists and documentalists in publication and dissemination of the results of their work should be identified, and existing publications in the region should be documented. From this inventory of existing resources it will be possible to link complementary activities in the different countries but an effort should be made to make them truly synergetic. Information exchange is the key to this process. Participants at the workshop recommended the creation of a climate conducive for this; this would involve workshop meetings, exchange of publications, free inter-state movement of scientists, creation of a regional scientific journal, streamlining the profession of extension officers and increased publication in international media by scientists from ACP countries. The Libreville meeting was a fruitful learning experience which, it is hoped, will have laid the foundations of a regional organization bringing together the various professions involved in agricultural and rural development. workshop on agricultural information in Central Africa.

40|$|The giant {{freshwater}} prawn is commercially {{one of the}} most important crustaceans, being widely fished and reared in ponds and rice fields throughout its natural distribution and beyond. Freshwater prawn farming can be conducted by unskilled rural people on small establishments and prawns are consumed domestically by all social classes. It is an activity that can play a role in poverty reduction and the empowerment of women. It has aided in increasing job opportunities for women and increasing their contribution to household income in developing countries. However, a major constraint in the large scale aquaculture of this species is the adequate supply of seed at required quantities and in all locations where the majority of seed used in grow out farming comes from hatcheries. Existing hatcheries are not producing up to their installed capacity due to various constraints. Availability of healthy and high–quality seedlings has always been a major obstacle in the expansion of M. rosenbergii culture. The low yield because of mass mortality of hatchery–reared seed may be caued by several factors such as broodstock management, larviculture <b>zootechniques,</b> microbial control,… Therefore, the current study investigated several factors which affect larval performance in terms of survival and larval quality in order to improve larviculture production and optimize the efficiency of larval rearing. A first study investigated performance of M. rosenbergii broodstock from different sources. The broodstock origin had significant effects on the offspring quality. Larval quality of Chinese and Vietnamese pond–reared breeders was markedly better than that of Vietnamese wild and Hawaiian pond–reared animals in terms of larval development rate, survival and ammonia tolerance. For prawn larval rearing techniques, the best initial larval stocking density was 100 – 150 l– 1 when using a constant–water volume, while this could be increased up to 400 l– 1 in case a rearing method with increasing water volume is used. A feeding frequency of 6 times per day by first–stage Artemia nauplii proved better than feeding only twice daily. Wet or dry artificial diets can replace 25 % of the Artemia nauplii ration from larval stage V onwards. Subsequently, this could be increased up to 50 % from stage IX, without any negative effects on growth, survival and quality of the prawn larvae compared to a live food control. The use of enrichment cultures (ECs) of N–acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) –degrading microbial communities proved a promising tool to control potential pathogens in prawn larviculture. The addition of ECs into the larval rearing water and via enriched Artemia nauplii used for larval feeding protected the larvae from Vibrio harveyi and/or opportunitistic bacteria and had a positive effect on larval survival and larval quality. Feeding larvae of the giant {{freshwater prawn}} with β–hydroxybutyrate (PHB) –containing Artemia nauplii significantly increased survival and growth of the larvae. It proved possible to combine delivery of PHB with bio-encapsulation of Artemia nauplii with a lipid emulsion, which is a commonly used technique in the larval rearing of many fish and crustacean species. In conclusion, several factors need to be addressed in order to optimize the larval rearing techniques of M. rosenbergii and to improve larval survival and larval quality. These include amongst others broodstock source, larval rearing <b>zootechniques</b> and microbial control. However, the optimization of the hatchery process should also be based on the specific conditions of the location and therefore it is not possible to draft standard protocols for all locations. The results of the present study may be applied in freshwater prawn seed production, however many remaining challenges still require further research...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} twenty years, {{extensive}} shrimp aquaculture has dramatically expanded in the coastal fringe of the Mekong Delta. This occurred primarily {{at the expense of}} the mangrove, already severely affected by the Vietnam war. More recently, paddy land has been reclaimed for shrimp aquaculture, a higher currency earner. However, production collapses have frequently occurred and the overall yield has remained far below the expectations for traditional farming. A number of parameters enter into play in the success of this activity, summarized in two questions: i) is the Mekong deltaïc environment - under high continental pressure - suitable to shrimp farming, ii) if not, is it possible to adapt the low technicity of rural poor farmers to reach economic sustainability? This paper is based on the analysis of two full sets of data. Ecological data are composed of hydrobiological, hydrodynamical and land cover data. The former were collected at a number of stations encompassing the local variability, the latter were derived from processing Spot imagery. Surveys of farms <b>zootechniques</b> and management were conducted over a network of shrimp farms, with the objective of determining the part played by these data in farming efficiency, with respect to the environmental conditions. Statistical methods, i. e.

Three animal models were fitted to obtain estimates by REML using an average information (AI) approach. Model 1 considered random direct, maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects. In model 2, a general grandmaternal effect was added to the random effects considered in model 1, and in model 3, the general grandmaternal effect was divided into grandmaternal genetic and grandmaternal permanent environmental effects. All models allowed covariances among genetic effects. The inclusion of grandmaternal effects in models 2 and 3 did not change the estimates of the genetic parameters compared to model 1. Variances attributable to grandmaternal effects became negative and were set close to zero, except for yearling weight for which grandmaternal heritability was 0. 03 ± 0. 03. The estimates for direct and maternal heritabilities were, respectively, 0. 08 ± 0. 03 and 0. 03 ± 0. 02 for birth, 0. 20 ± 0. 05 and 0. 21 ± 0. 05 for weaning, 0. 26 ± 0. 07 and 0. 16 ± 0. 07 for yearling and 0. 14 ± 0. 06 and 0. 16 ± 0. 06 for final weights. The estimates of the genetic correlation between direct and maternal effects for birth, weaning, yearling and final weights were - 0. 17 ± 0. 40, - 0. 58 ± 0. 32, - 0. 52 ± 0. 34 and - 0. 34 ± 0. 37, respectively. For yearling weight with grandmaternal heritability estimated to be only 0. 03, model 3 gave estimates of the genetic correlation between direct and grandmaternal effects and between maternal and grandmaternal effects of 0. 28 ± 0. 48 and - 0. 33 ± 0. 67, respectively.

40|$|Sub-clinical {{acidosis}} {{is poorly}} detected {{and is not}} easily prevented in intensive herds because it is mainly characterized by instability of intake, production and rumen parameters. A meta-analysis performed on 110 papers showed that yeast supplementation can stabilize rumen fermentations, especially in animals with high intake levels and fed high concentrate diets. Feeding a high concentrate diet led to subclinical acidosis (pH < 6. 25), and a variable number of spontaneous bouts of acidosis depending on the goat. These acidosis bouts could influence milk production during several weeks. Daily measurements of rumen pH, intake and milk production were used to model the day-to-day evolution of these parameters during bouts of acidosis. This model {{is a first step}} towards a more mechanistic model of sub-clinical acidosis. Several methodologies were developed in order to simultaneously and continuously record intake, rumen pH and chewing behaviour (time scale around one minute) during several weeks. These measurements allowed to design a new method to analyse intake kinetics by segmentation / classification and to determine some typical feeding behaviours, observed whatever the offered diet, and more or less stable depending on the goat. These types of feeding behaviours lead to different rumen pH kinetics despite a similar daily intake. Bouts of acidosis were characterized by a very low intake and a diminution in nycthemeral organisation of feeding behaviour. However, no relationship was found between feeding behaviour variability and goat susceptibility to acidosis. Taking the bouts of acidosis into account for the analyses of yeast supplementation effects allowed to avoid confounding effects. Yeast supplementation increased milk yield without influencing dry matter intake or milk fat and protein production. This might have been due to the higher sorting behaviour performed by supplemented goats which allowed them to eat a less fibrous diet than the one eaten by control goats. Yeast supplementation tended to increase ruminal biodiversity, which might explain the fact that the decrease in the percentage of fibre ingested by supplemented goats compared to control goats did not influence rumen pH. This study showed that spontaneous bouts of acidosis can lead to many drastic consequences and showed the relevance of analysing feeding behaviour in order to better understand the modifications in digestive or metabolic parameters. L'acidose sub-clinique se caractérise par une instabilité des fermentations ruminales et des paramètres <b>zootechniques.</b> Une méta-analyse a montré que les levures pouvaient réguler les fermentations ruminales. La distribution d'un régime riche en concentré a entraîné une situation d'acidose sub-clinique entrecoupée par des crises spontanées d'acidose. Les mesures quotidiennes d'ingestion, production et pH ruminal ont permis de modéliser l'évolution de ces paramètres pendant les crises. Les mises au point méthodologiques effectuées pour mesurer en continu ingestion, pH ruminal et mastication ont permis de développer une méthode d'analyse de l'ingestion et de déterminer des comportements alimentaires différents. Ces comportements types sont associés, pour des quantités ingérées similaires, à des cinétiques de pH différentes. Aucune relation n'a été observée entre le type de comportement alimentaire et la susceptibilité des animaux à l'acidose. La prise en compte des crises dans les analyses a permis d'éviter les confusions d'effets. Les levures ont augmenté la production laitière, sans modifier la quantité ingérée. Ceci pourrait résulter de la proportion supérieure de concentré ingérée par les animaux supplémentés par rapport aux témoins, suite à un tri de la ration. Les levures ont eu tendance à augmenter la biodiversité de l'écosystème ruminal, ce qui pourrait expliquer que la baisse du pourcentage de fibres ingérées n'a pas induit de baisse du pH ruminal. Cette étude montre que les crises d'acidose ont des conséquences sur tous les paramètres étudiés, et souligne l'intérêt de prendre en compte le comportement pour mieux comprendre les phénomènes physiologiques...|$|R
