50|$|Optimal {{capital income}} {{taxation}} is a subarea of optimal tax theory {{which refers to}} the study of designing a tax on capital income such that a given economic criterion like utility is optimized. Starting from the conceptualization of capital income as future consumption, the taxation of capital income corresponds to a differentiated consumption tax on present and future consumption. Consequently, a capital income tax results in the distortion of individuals' saving and consumption behavior as individuals substitute the more heavily taxed future consumption with current consumption. Due to these distortions, <b>zero</b> <b>taxation</b> of capital income might be optimal, a result postulated by the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem (1976) and the Chamley-Judd zero capital income tax result (1985/1986). Subsequent work on optimal capital income taxation has elucidated the assumptions underlying the theoretical optimality of a zero capital income tax and advanced diverse arguments for a positive (or negative) optimal capital tax.|$|E

We show that <b>zero</b> capital <b>taxation</b> is a knife’s edge result: As {{soon as we}} endow individuals with the slightest concern for other people’s income or tax equity, <b>zero</b> capital <b>taxation</b> ceases to be optimal. This holds irrespective of whether we allow envy or tax equity to impact on work incentives or on absolute levels of well-being. Moreover, the optimal tax policy is non-monotonic in the degrees of envy and tax equity. Above {{a certain degree of}} envy, higher degrees make the pivotal voter- though he is worker- want to opt for a higher level of labour taxation. Regarding the level of government spending, we show that envy and tax fairness effects do not necessarily erode the size of the public sector...|$|R

40|$|I {{study the}} optimal {{taxation}} {{of labor and}} capital in a dynamic economy subject to government expenditure and technology shocks. Unlike representative-agent Ramsey models, workers are heterogenous and lump-sum taxation is not ruled out. I consider two tax scenarios: (a) linear taxation, with a lump-sum intercept and (b) nonlinear-Mirrleesian taxation. When taxes are linear, I derive a partial-equivalence result with Ramsey settings that provides a reinterpretation of such analyses. I find conditions for perfect tax smoothing of labor-income taxes and <b>zero</b> capital <b>taxation.</b> Implications that contrast with Ramsey are derived for public-debt management, for {{the nature of the}} time-inconsistency problem and for the viability of replicating complete markets without state-contingent bonds.

40|$|In {{the context}} of an {{overlapping}} generations model with intragenerational inequality and majority voting, I study how the taxation of the old and retired generation is affected when the population growth rate changes. A fall in the birth rate leads to two opposite effects. On the one hand, the old generation acquires more political power because their relative size in the voting population increases. This exerts downward pressure on the taxation of the old. On the other hand, the tax burden on the young (used to repay the public debt held by the old) increases, so that their support for a low tax rate on assets held by the old decreases. In general, the number of equilibria is either zero or two, one of which involves <b>zero</b> <b>taxation</b> while the other involves partial taxation of the assets held by the old. ...|$|E
40|$|Enthusiasts for {{financial}} sector tax reform typically come either with some form of"flat tax"(including value added tax on financial services, <b>zero</b> <b>taxation</b> on capital income, or a universal transactions tax) or advocating corrective taxes designed to offset market failures or achieve other targeted objectives. As {{a result the}} tax systems in most countries often {{end up with a}} complex mixture. Honohan argues that practical policy for taxation of the financial sector needs to take into account two key features of the sector: its capacity for arbitrage and its sensitivity to inflation and thus to nonindexed taxes. Where these aspects have been neglected, poorly constructed tax systems-whether the consequence of a drive for revenue or of misdirected sophistication-often have sizable unexpected side effects. A defensive stance making the minimization of such distortions as its cornerstone is the best policy.

This may be a major concern when dealing with the influence of corporate tax rates on FDI in developing countries, since most studies concentrate on developed countries. Using data on Japanese firm location choices between 1990 and 2000, we contrast differences in regional tax rates in order to reveal an asymmetry between developed and developing countries. By looking at the interaction effects between Japan and host developing countries' tax systems, we also put forward the idea that special tax sparing provisions signed with Japan can alter the effect of host country taxes on Japanese firms' location choices. Finally, we find that even though tax competition can be strong in developing countries, this competition should not lead to an effective rate of <b>zero</b> <b>taxation</b> for these countries in their competition for FDI inflows.

40|$|In {{existing}} {{models of}} jointly-optimal fiscal and monetary policy, the monetary {{aspects of the}} economic environment {{have little to do}} with capital taxation prescriptions. Instead, the capital-taxation prescriptions of the underlying purely real economy in such models carry over unchanged, qualitatively and very nearly quantitatively, to the monetary economy. In this pa-per, we employ a micro-founded model of money in order to more meaningfully connect optimal fiscal and monetary policy, with a particular focus on optimal capital taxation. Our main result is that deep-rooted frictions underlying monetary trade in and of themselves provide a rationale for nonzero capital taxation — specifically, for capital subsidies. Optimal capital subsidies arise in versions of our model where monetary trades lead to capital holdup problems — in which case the prescription to subsidize capital follows readily — as well as versions of our model where holdup problems are absent. The latter result especially highlights the unique connection between fiscal and monetary policy our model articulates because the underlying purely real economy in our model features <b>zero</b> capital <b>taxation.</b> Connecting our results with some other recent advances in optimal capital taxation, we prove that for some versions of our environment...|$|R

In prac-tice, the two perspectives can clash rather severely, just like the perennial conflict between simplicity in tax administration and the economic efficiency of tax rates. The information and control require-ments of much of corrective taxation tend to be poorly accommodated by the big simplifications. As this tension remains unresolved over the years, elements of each approach become embodied in both the explicit and implicit taxation of the sector. At the same time, the ever-pressing demands of revenue intrude as a further influence on policy design. The tax systems in most countries often end up as a complex mixture defying any straightforward rationalization. The big flat-tax ideas are diluted and modified; the corrective taxes may mis-fire by conflicting with others introduced for different reasons. Meanwhile, even as simplification and correction continue their tug-of-war, policy design can all too often neglect the two distinctive traps into which financial sector taxation can fall, namely, the sector’s unique capacity for arbitrage and its sensitivity to inflation and thus 315 I am greatly indebted to Verónica Mies, Central Bank of Chile, for detailed advice, and to Leonardo Hernández and Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel for helpful suggestions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Sovereign Wealth Fund participation in the United States and office risk premium. Over the past 10 years the commercial real estate industry has been the benefactor of a shifting tide in equity capital formation. Sovereign Wealth Funds, proliferating over the past 15 years, have discovered that commercial real estate is a well aligned asset class along side equities, bonds, and other alternative assets. With that said, Sovereign Wealth Funds are not typical sources of equity. Unlike private capital, sovereign capital receives special treatment in their home county {{as well as most}} recipient countries. For example, some advantages that Sovereign Wealth Funds enjoy over private sources include the following; no disclosure requirements, no stock/stake holders to report to, and limited or <b>zero</b> <b>taxation.</b> Additionally, due to the extreme ground swell of foreign reserves and current account balances, there is nearly zero obligation for the return of capital. With no direct need for a return of or on capital, many of these Sovereign Wealth Funds operate under an effective "indefinite" time horizon. Finally, as government entities, there may be non-economic strategic goals when informing the investment decision. Combining these issues of limited transparency, preferential taxation, limited discloser requirements, indefinite investment horizon, and noneconomic motivations, Sovereign Wealth Funds have a clear pricing advantage over privately sourced investment funds. After achieving a statistically significant regression model, this thesis quantifies the magnitude and character of this advantage by looking at the estimated market risk premium paid as a result of Sovereign Wealth Fund participation. by Robert Joshua Lehr.

40|$|The recent {{literature}} on taxation and growth has stressed the optimality of a <b>zero</b> long-run <b>taxation</b> on all accumulative factors of production.

40|$|The German {{market is}} large and of great {{economic}} importance for Norway. A detailed understanding of the German tax system and the cross-national regulations between Germany and Norway are necessary for Norwegian companies who assess investment projects in Germany. This thesis aims to provide this information. It may also serve as {{an introduction to the}} topic for civil servants in the Norwegian Tax Administration who deal with companies that have German affiliates. The results are achieved by conducting a comparative examination of the different investment alternatives from a tax perspective. The underlying analysis is initially defining significant tax aspects of investment decision as a common frame of references. Subsequently, the thesis provides an overview of the various legal forms. Given this framework, a legal model is applied that allows the comparison of the different investment alternatives. In this way, the tax consequences within the significant aspects are highlighted for different investment approaches. The findings of this analysis indicate that in case a Norwegian individual person is planning a long term investment in Germany and expects positive returns which shall be reinvested in Germany, a subsidiary in form of a corporation has advantages in regard to current taxation. If a Norwegian corporation intends to generate a capital gain through the subsequent disposal of its German operations, the investment alternative of a corporation leads to <b>zero</b> <b>taxation.</b> Yet, the examination shows also that the choice of the investment alternative has in some instances no significant tax effects. Thus, also aspects other than taxation should be considered. This thesis provides valuable insights for the choice of an appropriate investment alternative in Germany. However, due to the different characteristics of a Norwegian company and its German business venture, the results are not universal applicable and should be evaluated in consideration of the individual situation...|$|E
40|$|Following Chamley, Lucas, Laitner, and Aiyagari, this {{dissertation}} {{continues to}} explore the answer for the question of <b>zero</b> capital <b>taxation</b> by discussing how taxes on capital income, labor income, and property affect {{the economy in the}} context of a vintage capital model where the embodied technology grows exogenously. The government maximizes social welfare by finding the optimal combinations of the three tax rates in the steady state and examines the welfare gain/loss over and after the transitions caused by different types of shocks. The simulation method used here is linear approximation. My results show that in the steady-state economy, given a fixed level of gov- ernment expenditure and a zero property tax rate, the capital-income tax rate that maximizes steady-state utility may be negative, zero, or positive depending on the level of government expenditure. I also find that, for many values of government spending, the highest level of steady-state utility occurs with a subsidy to capital income and a tax on labor income. Finally, I find that when taxes on capital income, labor income, and property are available, capital-income taxes are generally the last resort to finance government expenditures. My results show that in the transitional economy, when tax rates are perma- nently changed and the government expenditure is near zero, the loss of utility over the transition from no taxes to capital subsidies is too large so the idea itself is not utility-enhancing. Secondly, I find that when the government expenditure is low and a positive technology shock occurs, social welfare in the economy without capital-income taxes may perform better in the early phase of the transition but worse in the later phase of the transition than that in the economy without property taxes. How- ever, the situation becomes the opposite as government expenditures increase. In addition, when one tax is allowed to change, a changing labor-income tax may bring more utility over the transition than the other two taxes. Finally, when the govern- ment expenditure is unexpectedly reduced, I find that using property taxes rather than capital-income taxes stimulates consumption and employment more given a higher initial level of government expenditure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of agent {{heterogeneity}} on optimal capital income taxes, where taxes are collected for redistributional purposes. In a finite horizon model with an arbitrary number of heterogeneous agents, we ask what forms of taxation are optimal for different causes of inequality and how correlations, e. g. between labor incomes and wealth levels, affect optimal tax rates. While steady state analyses such as Judd (1985) {{have found that the}} optimal capital income tax rate in the steady state is zero, we show that off the steady state this is generally not the case. In a two period model with arbitrarily many heterogeneous households, we find that if households are heterogeneous with respect to productivities and endowments, capital income taxes generally increase welfare. If they are heterogeneous only with respect to productivities, it is optimal not to tax capital income. The extent of the inequality and the joint distribution of its different components (productivities and endowments in our model) are crucial for the size of the marginal welfare effects of taxation. A positive correlation between endowments and productivities, for example, increases the marginal welfare effects of capital income taxation. The paper emphasizes the analogy between commodity taxes and capital income taxes, which effectively tax consumption goods at different points in time. With the help of the literature on optimal commodity taxation based on Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976), we can check the robustness of our results. We find that <b>zero</b> capital income <b>taxation</b> is optimal only if endowments are homogeneous and production is weakly separable between labor and capital and utility functions are homothetic and identical across agents. When we link our model to the infinite horizon steady state analyses as described in Judd (1985), we find that the models are compatible under appropriate assumptions. ...|$|R
