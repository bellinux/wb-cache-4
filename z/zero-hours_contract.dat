5000|$|Under UK law a {{distinction}} is drawn between a mere [...] "worker" [...] and an [...] "employee," [...] an employee having more legal rights than a worker. Whether a person working under a zero-hour contract is an employee or a worker can be uncertain; however, {{even in cases}} where the plain text of the zero-hour contract designates the person as a [...] "worker" [...] courts have inferred an employment relationship based on the mutuality of obligation between employer and employee.Thus, when deciding whether a <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contract</b> constitutes a contract of employment, conferring employee status, the wording of the contract will not be determinative of whether there is, in practice, a mutuality of obligation. The tribunal will look closely at the reality of the agreement. If the reality {{is that there is a}} pattern of regular work which is regularly accepted, the tribunal may deem the contract to be one of employment.|$|E
40|$|The {{story begins}} when Unite the Union were alerted to reports of {{draconian}} {{working conditions and}} terms of employment in Sports Direct and uncovered a litany of hidden exploitation amongst agency workers in the Sports Direct warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire and those on zero-hours contracts in their retail stores. Unite were {{at the forefront of}} highlighting the harsh working conditions experienced by thousands of workers including low pay, precarious working arrangements, a dependence on agency working and a culture of fear. The campaigning by Unite and others led to the company being subject to media and parliamentary investigation and in April 2015 the Channel 4 Dispatches programme aired the ‘Secrets of Sports Direct’. In January 2016, Unite presented written evidence to the House of Commons Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, concerned about the issues affecting employees in Sports Direct and the difficulties that limited their representation. For more than two decades the issues of zero hours contracts and temporary employment agencies {{have been the subject of}} discussion at the union conferences and at the annual conference of the TUC. There has been nationally published research led by the TUC, ACAS, and others and has identified some of the problems for trade unions and their members arising from changing workplace practices. In the UK there has been a rise in Temporary Agency Work (TAW) since the financial crisis, with evidence suggesting the flexibility it offers, has one-sided benefits favouring employers. Similarly zero-hours contracts leave workers vulnerable, subject to bullying and harassment and unable to plan their lives or budget effectively. Yet the campaign often brought challenges of ‘why are you picking on Sports Direct’ and clarification was required about the extent of further hidden exploitation in workplaces across the local economy. The following report is based on work carried out from January 2017 to July 2017 by the authors and others, involving semi-structured interviews with 31 workers on TAW or zero-hours contracts. We also interviewed managers from 4 local agencies and representatives from Derbyshire Unemployed Workers Centres, Unite the Union, North Derbyshire Unite Community branch and Derbyshire Law Centre. Statistical analysis was undertaken to ascertain the extent of TAW and <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contract</b> working in the UK and the East Midlands region through enquiry of the Annual Population Surveys from the Office of National Statistics. We provide details of our interviews highlighting the experiences of those on TAW and zero-hours contracts. This story exposes the impacts of hidden exploitation and we make a number of recommendations to tackle the harsh and imposed regimes of TAW and zero-hours contracts. We also showcase examples of collective struggle – showing change is possible and can be dramatic...|$|E
50|$|According to the CIPD {{research}} about 38% of those employed under <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> considered {{themselves to be}} employed full-time, working 30 hours or more a week.

About 17% of private employers used <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> while they were used by 34% of non-profits organisations and 24% of public employers. <b>Zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> were frequently used in hotels, catering and leisure (48%), education (35%) and healthcare (27%).|$|R

The survey found that larger companies are more likely to use <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts.</b> 23% of workplaces that have 100 or more employees used <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> in 2011, compared to 11% of those with 50-99 employees and 6% of those with fewer than 50 employees.|$|R

50|$|As of September 2016, the Office for National Statistics {{estimated}} that there are over 900,000 workers on <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> (2.9% of the employed workforce), up from 747,000 the previous year, with over 1.8m such contracts (as some people may {{have more than one}} contract), with a further 1.3m where no hours were worked. Some commentators have observed that the number of such contracts may be under-reported, as many people may be confusing them with casual employment, and may not be reporting them as temporary. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), based on a poll of 1,000 workers, reported in August 2013 that as many as 1 million workers in the United Kingdom, 3-4% of the workforce, work under the terms of a <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contract.</b> Based on a survey of 5,000 of its members Unite, Britain's largest labour union, estimates that as many as 5.5 million workers are subject to <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts,</b> 22% of those employed privately. The survey, conducted by Mass 1, showed that <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts</b> were more prevalent in northwest England, among young workers, and in agricultural work. Often workers said that holiday pay was denied (which is illegal) and in most cases sick pay. The National Farmers Union, which represents farmers, supports <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts</b> as offering needed flexibility for tasks such as harvesting.|$|R

40|$|Background Care {{workers have}} an {{important}} social role which is set to expand with the increasing age of the UK population. However, the majority of care workers are employed on <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts.</b> Aims Firstly, to investigate the relationship between working conditions and employee outcomes such as engagement and general mental well-being {{in a sample of}} UK care workers and management. Secondly, to assess whether the use of <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> affects employee well-being. Methods A cross-sectional survey of domiciliary care and care home employees, undertaken using the Management Standards Indicator Tool (MSIT), Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). T-tests and multivariate linear regression evaluated the differences in scoring between those with differing contractual conditions and job roles, and associations of MSIT scores with UWES and GHQ factors. Results Employee understanding of their role and job control were found to be priority areas for improvement in the sample. Similarly, care workers reported greater occupational demands and lower levels of control than management. However, while <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> did not significantly influence employee well-being, these employees had greater levels of engagement in their jobs. Despite this, a greater proportion of individuals with <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> had scores above accepted mental health cut-offs. Conclusions Individual understanding of their role as care workers appears to play an important part in determining engagement and general mental well-being. However, more research is needed on the influence of <b>zero-hours</b> <b>contracts</b> on well-being, particularly in groups with increased likelihood of developing mental health disorders...|$|R

50|$|It is {{particularly}} important to distinguish employment in the gig economy from employment through <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts.</b> Employment in the gig economy entails receiving compensation for one key performance indicator, which, for example, is defined as parcels delivered or taxi lifts conducted. Another feature is that employees can opt to refuse taking an order. Although employers {{do not have to}} guarantee employment or employees can also refuse to take an order under a <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contract,</b> workers under such a contract are paid by the hour and not directly through business related indicators {{as in the case of}} the gig economy.|$|R

50|$|Workers {{subject to}} <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts</b> {{may be subject}} to {{exploitation}} as they may be denied work at any time for any reason, including declining to respond to a demand to work. A refusal to work in any one instance for any reason can result in a prolonged period of lack of work. In 2014, millions of workers were still trapped in low-paid, highly insecure jobs, where mistreatment is the norm and where there is limited prospect of escape, said the Trade Union Congress. Due to the uncertainty of the workers' schedules <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts</b> present problems for workers with children due to the difficulty of arranging child care. The rapidly growing use of <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts</b> {{was the subject of a}} series of articles in late July 2013 by The Guardian and as of 2013 was of concern to Parliament. Vince Cable, business secretary of the government, is considering closer regulation of the contracts but has ruled out a ban.

50|$|In the UK, <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts</b> are controversial. British {{business}} leaders have supported them, stating {{that they provide}} a flexible labour market.

It has been reported that 60% of people on <b>zero-hour</b> <b>contracts</b> are happy with the hours they work. Trade union groups and others have raised concerns about the possibility of exploitation and the use of such contracts by management as a tool to reward or reprimand employees for any reason, or for no reason.
