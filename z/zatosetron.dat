5000|$|<b>Zatosetron</b> (LY-277,359) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as an {{antagonist}} at the 5HT3 receptor It is orally active and has a long duration of action, producing antinauseant effects but without stimulating the rate of gastrointestinal transport. It is also an effective anxiolytic in both animal studies and human trials, although with some side effects at higher doses.|$|E
40|$|The major In vlvo human metabolfte of <b>zatosetron</b> is 8 -a-methyl, 8 -$-oxo <b>zatosetron</b> [N-C (1) zatosetron]. N-Desmethyl <b>zatosetron</b> (NdM <b>zatosetron)</b> and 3 -hydroxy-zatosetron (3 -OH-zatosetron) are minor human fl*tabOIftOS. In the rat, {{the primary}} In vivo {{metabolite}} is 3 -OH-zatosetron. The enzyme kinetics of <b>zatosetron</b> metabolism were determined using human, rat, and monkey hepatic microsomal in-cubatlons. In the rat, the Intrinsic clearance (IC; IC = V,/K = MI/ mm/mg of protein) of 3 -OH-zatosetron (IC = 5. 2) was favored over N-O (1) <b>zatosetron</b> (IC = 3. 0) and NdM <b>zatosetron</b> (IC = 1. 4). In the monkey, N-O (1) <b>zatosetron</b> exhibited the highestlC (IC = 7. 0) relative {{to that for}} 3 -OH-zatosetron (IC = 4. 4) and NdM <b>zatosetron</b> (IC = 2. 9). Monkey microsomes also formed 8 -fl-methyl, 8 -a-oxo <b>zatosetron</b> (IC = 2. 2). In two human samples (identified as HL-E and HL-J), the metabolic clearance of <b>zatosetron</b> favored the formation of N-O (1) <b>zatosetron</b> (HL-E, IC = 6. 9; HL-J, IC = 2. 9) over NdM zatosetro...|$|E
