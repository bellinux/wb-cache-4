If another player {{possesses the}} puck attacking into the <b>zone,</b> the <b>centre's</b> job is to provide support if the puck carrier needs to pass to another player across the blue line.

It {{is also one}} of the few schools in Singapore to offer Economics as an examinable 'O' Level subject, and at the first Cambridge GCE 'O' Level Economics Examination in 2008, TKGS produced the top Economics students in Singapore. Class periods were extended to 50 minutes in 2003, and in 2005, TKGS announced that it would be one of the first schools in Singapore to offer Drama as an examinable 'O' Level subject. The LEGACY (Leading, Empowering, Guiding, Affirming and Challenging Youths) Programme was introduced as part of the Integrated Character Development Programme as well, consisting of classroom and experiential learning of moral education during curriculum time. Another initiative was the Multi-Disciplinary Project Work for the Secondary 2s, with Future Problem Solving at the core of its framework. The Chinese Special Programme (CSP) and the Malay Special Programme (MSP) were introduced for students in Malay and Chinese respectively to learn the other language. In 2007, TKGS was appointed the East <b>Zone</b> <b>Centre</b> of Excellence (COE) for English Language, in recognition of its innovative approach towards the teaching and learning of English and the students' consistently good performance in English at the GCE 'O' Level examinations.|$|E
40|$|Recent work by Elder, Ward and Zhang [Phys. Rev. B 83. 165210 (2011) ] {{has shown}} need for {{correction}} and modification of current {{implementation of the}} k. p method and operator ordering scheme using the interaction parameters defined under double group consideration. This manuscript examines the difference in treatment of spin-orbit interaction under the single and double group formulations. We show that the restriction to the adapted double group bases, {{brought about by the}} imposition of single group selection rule in calculating the k. p interaction, is not appropriate. In addition, the unitary transformation employed in the literature to diagonalise the intra-band spin orbit interaction in semiconductors with diamond lattice can not remove the inter-band terms. It leads to a bases set for valence band ordered differently from D_ 3 / 2 ^+ in the O(3) group thus invalidating any correlation of magnetic quantum number to the z component of angular momentum. Under the double group consideration, spin-orbit interaction affects all the <b>zone</b> <b>centre</b> states and offers a mechanism for changing the relative positions of various <b>zone</b> <b>centre</b> states in the conduction band. In addition to the mixing caused by k independent spin orbit terms, formation of hybridised orbitals under double group rules also produce mixing. This can lead to inversion in materials such as α-tin. The re-arrangement of conduction band <b>zone</b> <b>centre</b> states leads to a negative γ_ 2 in most materials with respect to the valence band bases having the same order as D_ 3 / 2 ^+ in the O(3) group. The double group formulation is also required in the description of Zeeman interaction, including the S. B term, for the mixed <b>zone</b> <b>centre</b> states. It provides a correspondence between second order interaction parameters and the Luttinger invariants. [...] . Comment: 45 pages 4 figure...|$|E
