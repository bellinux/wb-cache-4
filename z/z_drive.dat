In {{hydrodynamic}} simulations of galaxy formation, some gas follows the traditionally envisioned route, shock heating to the halo virial temperature before cooling to the much lower temperature of the neutral ISM.

This ``cold mode'' accretion is channeled along filaments, while the conventional, ``hot mode'' accretion is quasi-spherical. Cold mode accretion dominates high redshift growth by a substantial factor, while at z< 1 the overall accretion rate declines and hot mode accretion has greater relative importance.

Meanwhile, the decoupled delivering of three-directional independent motions at the output end is accessible, and the essential parallel and mirror symmetric configuration guarantees large output stiffness, high natural frequencies, high accuracy as well as high structural compactness of the mechanism.
