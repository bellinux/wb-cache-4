40|$|With {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} electricity, {{the production of}} ash, produced from the coal-fired thermal power plants, and its hazardous impact on the environment, is continuously increasing. This poses a very challenging task of safe handling, proper disposal and utilization of the ash. Several ash utilization schemes, developed and reported by earlier researchers, are being practiced frequently these days. However, these studies do {{not take into account}} the quality of ash produced and the changes it may undergo, before it can be used for different applications. A common method of disposing ash is its wet disposal, where the ash is mixed with water to make slurry and is disposed off in the ash ponds or lagoons. Such a disposal system causes ash, and the alkalis present in it, to interact with water over a period of time and may lead to the formation of ash zeolites. As such, it would be interesting to study the effect of this interaction (i. e. formation of zeolites also termed as <b>zeolitization</b> of the ash) on physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the ash. As geotechnical properties of a material depend on these characteristics, the influence of <b>zeolitization</b> on these properties of the ash must also be investigated.

The parageneses of phyllosilicates generally change systematically with depth and with the degree of alteration, {{which in turn is}} related to permeability of basalts. Saponite and some mixed-layer chlorite/smectite are the dominant phyllosilicates {{at the top of the}} transition zone. Chlorite, corrensite, and mixed-layer chlorite/corrensite occur mainly in the lower transition zone and upper levels of the sheeted dike zone. Chlorite, talc, and mixed-layer talc/chlorite are the major phyllosilicates in the sheeted dike zone, although replacement of talc or ohvine by saponite is observed. The phyllosilicates consist of parallel or subparallel discrete packets of coherent layers with packet thicknesses generally ranging from< 100 Å to a few hundred Å. The packets of saponite layers are much smaller or less well defined than those of chlorite, corrensite and talc, indicating poorer crystal-linity of saponite. by contrast, chlorite and talc from the lower transition zone and the sheeted dike zone occur in packets up to thousands of Å thick. The Si/(Si+Al) ratio of these trioctahedral phyllosilicates increases and Fe/(Fe+Mg) decreases in the order chlorite, corrensite, saponite, and talc. These relations reflect optimal solid solution consistent with minimum misfit of articulated octahedral and tetrahedral sheets. Variations in composition of hydrothermal fluids and precursor minerals, especially in Si/(Si+Al) and Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratios, are thus important factors in controlling the parageneses of phyllosilicates.

The obtained yields of zeolites ZC, ZA and ZS were 95, 97, and 76. 6 % respectively. These zeolites were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and their calcium binding capacity (CBC) was determined. The obtained results were similar to those of commercial zeolites...|$|E
40|$|<b>Zeolitization</b> of fly-ash by {{a direct}} route and a fusion method (two-step process) was studied using an {{orthogonal}} array of Taguchi experimental design. The effect of different processing conditions, such as type and {{concentration of the}} mineralizing agent, fusion and crystalhzing temperatures and times and stirring speed, on the quantity of the zeolitic phase obtained, were evaluated. By means of a variance analysis, {{the contribution of the}} processing conditions to the response variable (content of zeolitic phase, wt%) was evaluated. According to the results, the statistical significant processing conditions that show a stronger effect on the zeolite content were the type of mineralizing agent and crystallizing temperature. The optimal conditions for obtaining 5 types of zeolites were also determined. The type of zeolite depends mainly {{on the nature of the}} mineralizing agent. When using the direct method potassium hydroxide (KOH) was the optimal mineralizing agent, leading to a material with 77 wt% of zeolitic phase. On the other hand, when using the fusion method the optimal alkaline agent was sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reaching up to 91 wt% of zeolitic material...|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to study the effect of zeolite {{formation}} on the volume-change behaviour of kaolinitic soil. This is studied in terms of two criteria, namely concentration and period of interaction. Conventional consolidation tests have been carried out {{to determine the extent of}} change in swell and compressibility of kaolinitic soils remoulded with water and inundated with an alkali solution. It was observed that abnormal swell occurs during unloading when specimens were inundated with a 4 N alkali solution. While allowing a longer interaction period at 6. 25 kPa, it was found that swelling in kaolinitic soils is induced after time lags of 30 and 15 days on inundation with 1 N and 4 N alkali solutions, respectively. Equilibrium is reached after 50 – 70 days in kaolinitic soils, however, and loading was undertaken later. A 16 % swelling was observed in kaolinitic soils when inundated with a 4 N alkali solution, indicating that <b>zeolitization</b> of kaolinite results in swelling at the seating load provided the period of interaction is sufficient. X-ray diffraction studies confirm the formation of zeolite...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{properties}} and the hydration of Portland cement pastes containing zeolitized silica fume were studied. Hydrosodalite {{was obtained by}} <b>zeolitization</b> of silica fume. XRD, DSC, SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used as investigation methods. The compressive strength of hardened cement paste was measured after 28  days. The levels of  cement replacement by  additives were 5  %, 10  % and 15  % by weight in the specimens. Changes in the strength of hardened cement paste were observed. The influence of additives on hydration rate and hydration temperature was also observed. Both 1 Hs (hydrosodalite) and 2 Hs (modified hydrosodalite) additives accelerate the hydration of the cement paste. The highest hydration temperature was achieved in a mixture with 5  wt.  % 1 Hs additive and with 10  wt.  % 2 Hs additive. The microstructure of hardened cement paste specimens with 1 Hs and 2 Hs additive is denser compared with reference specimens without the additives. The maximum compressive strength of the specimens with 10  wt.  % of 2 Hs reached up to 101  MPa under laboratory conditions. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|The Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project is {{investigating}} Yucca Mountain, Nevada, {{as a potential}} site for a high-level nuclear waste repository. An important aspect of this evaluation is to understand the geologic history of the site including the diagenetic processes that are {{largely responsible for the}} present-day chemical and physical properties of the altered tuffs. This study evaluates the use of K/Ar geochronology in determining the alteration history of the zeolitized portions of Miocene tuffs at Yucca Mountain. Clinoptilolite is not generally regarded as suitable for dating because of its open structure and large ion-exchange capacity. However, it is the most abundant zeolite at Yucca Mountain and was selected for this study to assess the feasibility of dating the <b>zeolitization</b> process and/or subsequent processes that may have affected the zeolites. In this study we examine the ability of this mineral to retain all or part of its K and radiogenic Ar during diagenesis and evaluate the usefulness of the clinoptilolite K/Ar dates for determining the history of alteration...|$|E
40|$|A {{synoptic}} {{review of}} the studies of well-known occurrences of palagonite tuffs is presented. Included are palagonite tuffs from Iceland, and pillow-lava palagonite complexes from Columbia River basalts and from the central Oregon coast. Additional petrologic and x-ray defraction data for selected samples are presented. Petrologic evidence shows that basaltic glass of aqueous tuffs and breccias consists of sideromelane, which is susceptible to palagonitization. It is shown that palagonitization is a selective alteration process, involving hydration, oxidation and <b>zeolitization.</b> Some of the manganese nodules dredged from the Pacific Ocean floor contain nucleus of palagonite-tuff breccias or of zeolite. A brief megascopic and microscopic description of nodules from the south Pacific, the Mendocino ridge and the 'Horizon' Nodule from the north Pacific is presented. Petrographic studies of palagonite-tuff breccias of manganese nodules and other palagonites suggest that migration and segregation of metallic elements occur during and subsequent to palagonitization. During the palagonitization of sideromelane, nearly 30 percent of sea water is absorbed. The hydration of sideromelane is also accompanied by oxidation of iron and other elements. These oxides may be released either in colloidal form or in true solution and tend to precipitate first from the unstable palagonite...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative X-ray powder {{diffraction}} {{methods have}} been used to analyze 108 samples from drill core UE- 25 UZ{number_sign} 16 at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. This drill hole, located within the imbricate fault zone east of the potential Yucca Mountain repository site, confirms the authors` previous knowledge of gross-scale mineral distributions at Yucca Mountain and provides insight into possible shallow pathways for hydrologic recharge into the potential host rock. Analyses of samples from UE- 25 UZ{number_sign} 16 have shown that the distribution of major zeolitized horizons, of silica phases, and of glassy tuffs are similar to those noted in nearby drill cores. However, the continuous core and closer sample spacing in UE- 25 UZ{number_sign} 16 provide a more exact determination of mineral stratigraphy, particularly in hydrologically important units such as the Paintbrush bedded tuffs above the Topopah Spring Tuff and in the upper vitrophyre of the Topopah Spring Tuff. The discovery of matrix <b>zeolitization</b> in the devitrified Topopah Spring Tuff of UE 25 UZ{number_sign} 16 shows that some unexpected mineralogic features can still be encountered in the exploration of Yucca Mountain and emphasizes the importance of obtaining a more complete three-dimensional model of Yucca Mountain mineralogy...|$|E
