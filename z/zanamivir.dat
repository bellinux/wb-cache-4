25|$|As of 2009, no {{influenza}} {{has shown}} {{any signs of}} resistance in the US. Since then, genes expressing resistance to <b>zanamivir</b> were found in Chinese people infected with avian influenza A H7N9 during treatment with <b>zanamivir.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Zanamivir</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of infections caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses, but in otherwise-healthy individuals, benefits overall appear to be small. It decreases the risk of one's getting symptomatic, but not asymptomatic influenza. The combination of diagnostic uncertainty, the risk for virus strain resistance, possible side effects and financial cost outweigh the small benefits of <b>zanamivir</b> for the prophylaxis and treatment of healthy individuals.|$|E
25|$|Patients who are {{vaccinated against}} {{streptococcus}} pneumoniae, health professionals, nursing-home residents and pregnant {{women should be}} vaccinated annually against influenza. During an outbreak, drugs such as amantadine, rimantadine, <b>zanamivir</b> and oseltamivir have been demonstrated to prevent influenza.|$|E
25|$|Some of the university's notable {{research}} achievements {{include the}} world's first IVF pregnancy, the first seatbelt legislation, {{the discovery of}} the anti-influenza drug Relenza (<b>Zanamivir),</b> the discovery that nerve stem cells could be derived from embryonic stem cells {{and the development of a}} single-use oral anti-malaria drug.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2009 in Nature Biotechnology emphasized {{the urgent need for}} augmentation of oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) stockpiles with additional antiviral drugs including <b>zanamivir</b> (Relenza®). This finding was based on a performance evaluation of these drugs supposing the 2009 H1N1 'Swine Flu' neuraminidase (NA) were to acquire the Tamiflu-resistance (His274Tyr) mutation which is currently widespread in seasonal H1N1 strains.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two groups}} of {{antiviral}} drugs available for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza neuraminidase inhibitors such as Oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu) and <b>Zanamivir</b> (trade name Relenza) as well as adamantanes such as amantadine and rimantadine. Due to {{the high rate of}} side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.|$|E
25|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) inclusively {{recommends}} {{those six}} months and older to get a yearly vaccination to protect from influenza A viruses (H1N1) and (H3N2) and up to two influenza B viruses (depending on the vaccination). Comprehensive protection starts by ensuring vaccinations are current and complete. The three FDA-approved neuraminidase antiviral flu drugs available in the United States, recommended by the CDC, include: oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), <b>zanamivir</b> (Relenza®), and peramivir (Rapivab®).|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} in {{the life cycle of}} a virus is the release of {{completed}} viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by antiviral drug developers. Two drugs named <b>zanamivir</b> (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) that have been recently introduced to treat influenza prevent the release of viral particles by blocking a molecule named neuraminidase that is found on the surface of flu viruses, and also seems to be constant across a wide range of flu strains.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} antigenicities of the seed strains and wild viruses do not match, {{vaccines}} fail {{to protect the}} vaccinees. In addition, {{even when they do}} match, escape mutants are often generated. Drugs available for the treatment of influenza include Amantadine and Rimantadine, which inhibit the uncoating of virions by interfering with M2, and Oseltamivir (marketed under the brand name Tamiflu), <b>Zanamivir,</b> and Peramivir, which inhibit the release of virions from infected cells by interfering with NA. However, escape mutants are often generated for the former drug and less frequently for the latter drug.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} becomes sick with swine flu, {{antiviral}} drugs {{can make the}} illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care {{at home or in}} a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or <b>zanamivir</b> (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs. The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to amantadine and rimantadine.|$|E
2500|$|Animal and lab {{studies suggest}} that Relenza (<b>zanamivir),</b> {{which is in the}} same class of drugs as Tamiflu, may also be {{effective}} against H5N1. In a study performed on mice in 2000, [...] "zanamivir was shown to be efficacious in treating avian influenza viruses H9N2, H6N1, and H5N1 transmissible to mammals". In addition, mice studies suggest the combination of <b>zanamivir,</b> celecoxib and mesalazine looks promising producing a 50% survival rate compared to no survival in the placebo arm. While no one knows if <b>zanamivir</b> will be useful or not on a yet to exist pandemic strain of H5N1, it might be useful to stockpile <b>zanamivir</b> as well as oseltamivir {{in the event of an}} H5N1 influenza pandemic. Neither oseltamivir nor <b>zanamivir</b> can currently be manufactured in quantities that would be meaningful once efficient human transmission starts. In September, 2006, a WHO scientist announced that studies had confirmed cases of H5N1 strains resistant to Tamiflu and Amantadine. Tamiflu-resistant strains have also appeared in the EU, which remain sensitive to Relenza.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zanamivir</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} and prevent influenza caused by influenza A and B viruses. It is a neuraminidase inhibitor and {{was developed by the}} Australian biotech firm Biota Holdings. It was licensed to Glaxo in 1990 and approved in the US in 1999, only for use as a treatment for influenza. In 2006, it was approved for prevention of influenza A and B. [...] <b>Zanamivir</b> was the first neuraminidase inhibitor commercially developed. It is currently marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the trade name Relenza as a powder for oral inhalation.|$|E
2500|$|Many nations, {{as well as}} the World Health Organization, {{are working}} to {{stockpile}} anti-viral drugs in preparation for a possible pandemic. Oseltamivir is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form. [...] <b>Zanamivir</b> is also considered for use, but it must be inhaled. Other anti-viral drugs {{are less likely to be}} effective against pandemic influenza.|$|E
2500|$|Hirst {{noticed that}} {{hemagglutination}} tended to wear off over time, and in 1942, {{he discovered that}} influenza virus has an intrinsic enzymatic activity that can release the virus from its attachment to red blood cells. This was a ground-breaking discovery, as previously a key distinction between viruses and bacteria had been that viruses were believed to lack enzymes. Hirst demonstrated that red blood cells once de-agglutinated could not be re-agglutinated, and correctly deduced that the enzyme destroys a receptor for the virus on the red blood cells. This enzyme, then {{referred to as the}} [...] "receptor-destroying enzyme" [...] was later shown to be the influenza neuraminidase, another viral envelope glycoprotein, which acts as a sialidase. Like hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is essential for the influenza life cycle, being required for the progeny virus to leave the host cell. Neuraminidase is the target of the neuraminidase inhibitor class of antiviral drugs, which include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and <b>zanamivir</b> (Relenza).|$|E
50|$|When first marketed in the US in 1999/2000, <b>zanamivir</b> {{captured}} only 25% of the influenza antiviral market, {{despite a}} huge promotional campaign. By {{the end of}} that season, Tamiflu was outselling <b>zanamivir</b> 3:1. During that season, <b>zanamivir</b> experienced worldwide safety warnings involving the risk of bronchospasm and death. Glaxo then reduced the marketing of <b>zanamivir,</b> and Tamiflu's dominance increased. More than US$20 million worth of <b>zanamivir</b> sold by Glaxo in the first US season was returned to the company in the next two seasons because its sales to patients were far less than expected.|$|E
50|$|As Biota {{was a small}} company, it did {{not have}} the {{resources}} to bring <b>zanamivir</b> to market by itself. In 1990, <b>zanamivir</b> patent rights were licensed to Glaxo, now GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The license agreement entitled Biota to receive a 7% royalty on Glaxo's sales of <b>zanamivir.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Zanamivir</b> can {{be found}} under tradenames such as Relenza™, Verenza and Z-Flu DPI. <b>Zanamivir</b> is used for {{patients}} 5 years and older. It is given as one 10 mg dose, twice {{a day for the}} treatment of influenza. In the prevention of influenza, <b>zanamivir</b> is given as one 10 mg dose, once a day for 10 days after contacting with an infected person or up the 28 days (during influenza epidemic). The most common side effect of <b>Zanamivir</b> is reported to be rash.|$|E
50|$|The {{bioavailability}} of <b>zanamivir</b> is 2%. After inhalation, <b>zanamivir</b> {{is concentrated}} in the lungs and oropharynx, where up to 15% of the dose is absorbed and excreted in urine.|$|E
50|$|Resistance to <b>zanamivir</b> {{has been}} low for both {{seasonal}} and pandemic viruses compare to oseltamivir. Molecular structure of <b>zanamivir</b> has a guanidino group, this group {{interacts with the}} E119 residue in the active center pocket. Resistance to <b>zanamivir</b> can be because of mutations that effect binding affinity between the enzyme and the inhibitor. Mutation at the E119 residue {{has been shown to}} reduce the inhibitors efficiency in vitro.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zanamivir</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of infections caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses, but in otherwise-healthy individuals, benefits overall appear to be small.

50|$|<b>Zanamivir</b> analogues are {{designed}} to improve the therapeutic use. Replacing the carboxylate group at the C1 to phosphonate group led the drug to be more potent with high affinity to form ionic interaction with the active site. Additionally, the click-chemistry reaction was used to synthesize the C4-triazole-modified <b>zanamivir</b> analogue that shows inhibitory activity close to <b>zanamivir.</b> Laninamivir is designed by replacing C7 hydroxy moiety with small lipophilic group, -OCH3, which resulted in an excellent inhibitory activity. The C8 and C9 diol {{play an important role}} in the binding affinity with neuraminidase, prolonging the effect. The polymer scaffolds at the C7 position of <b>zanamivir</b> via an alkyl ether has gained more attention as this showed enhanced antiviral activity.|$|E
5000|$|Since October 1, 2008, the CDC {{has tested}} 1,146 {{seasonal}} influenza A (H1N1) viruses for resistance against oseltamivir and <b>zanamivir.</b> It {{was found that}} 99.6% of the samples were resistant to oseltamivir while none were resistant to <b>zanamivir.</b> In 853 samples of 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) virus only 4% showed resistance to oseltamivir, while none of 376 samples showed resistance to <b>zanamivir.</b> [...] A study conducted in Japan during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic concluded that infants exposed to either oseltamivir or <b>zanamivir</b> had no short term adverse effects. [...] Both amantadine and rimantadine {{have been found to}} be teratogenic and embryotoxic (malformations and toxic effects on the embryo) when given at high doses in animal studies.|$|E
50|$|In adults {{there was}} no {{increased}} risk of reported adverse events in trials. There was little evidence of the possible harms associated with the treatment of children with <b>zanamivir.</b> <b>Zanamivir</b> has not been known to cause toxic effects and has low systemic exposure to the human body.|$|E

5000|$|GlaxoSmithKline, Inc. Évreux, France: Influenza Neuraminidase {{inhibitor}} RELENZA (<b>Zanamivir)</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2006, Germany {{announced}} it would buy 1.7 million doses of <b>zanamivir,</b> {{as part of its}} preparation strategy against bird flu. [...] "Germany's purchase shows that countries are starting to take a balanced view of influenza preparedness," [...] said Simon Tucker, head of research at Melbourne-based Biota, where <b>zanamivir</b> was originally developed.|$|E
5000|$|Oseltamivir and <b>Zanamivir</b> - {{antiviral}} drugs used in {{the treatment}} and prophylaxis of influenza ...|$|E
50|$|As of 2009, no {{influenza}} {{had shown}} {{any signs of}} resistance in the US. A meta-analysis from 2011 found that <b>zanamivir</b> resistance had been rarely reported. Antiviral resistance can emerge during or after treatment with antivirals in certain people (e.g., immunosuppressed). In 2013 genes expressing resistance to <b>zanamivir</b> (and oseltamivir) were found in Chinese patients infected with avian influenza A H7N9.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zanamivir</b> {{works by}} binding to the active {{site of the}} {{neuraminidase}} protein, rendering the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others. It is also an inhibitor of influenza virus replication in vitro and in vivo. In clinical trials, <b>zanamivir</b> was found to reduce the time-to-symptom resolution by 1.5 days if therapy was started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|In otherwise-healthy individuals, {{benefits}} overall {{appear to}} be small. <b>Zanamivir</b> shortens the duration of symptoms of influenza-like illness (unconfirmed influenza or 'the flu') by less than a day. In children with asthma there was no clear effect on the time to first alleviation of symptoms. [...] Whether it affects the risk of one's need to be hospitalized or {{the risk of death}} is not clear. There is no proof that <b>zanamivir</b> reduced hospitalizations or pneumonia and other complications of influenza, such as bronchitis, middle ear infection, and sinusitis. <b>Zanamivir</b> did not reduce the risk of self reported investigator mediated pneumonia or radiologically confirmed pneumonia in adults. The effect on pneumonia in children was also not significant.|$|E
50|$|Neuraminidase {{has been}} {{targeted}} in structure-based enzyme inhibitor design programmes that {{have resulted in}} the production of two drugs, <b>zanamivir</b> (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu). Administration of neuraminidase inhibitors is a treatment that limits the severity and spread of viral infections. Neuraminidase inhibitors are useful for combating influenza infection: <b>zanamivir,</b> administered by inhalation; oseltamivir, administered orally; and under research is peramivir administered parenterally, that is through intravenous or intramuscular injection.|$|E
50|$|Peramivir has a guanidino group {{similar to}} <b>zanamivir</b> and a {{hydrophobic}} group similar to oseltamivir. Mutations that effect {{the efficiency of}} oseltamivir and <b>zanamivir</b> can also effect peramivir efficiency. Resistances to peramivir have been seen at the mutation of H274Y residue in vitro. One of these resistances is associated with cross-resistance to peramivir and oseltamivir. Peramivir is approved in Japan as Rapiacta and also available in South Korea as Peramiflu.|$|E
50|$|The {{two classes}} of {{antiviral}} drugs used against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and <b>zanamivir)</b> and M2 protein inhibitors (adamantane derivatives).|$|E
5000|$|...Only <b>Zanamivir</b> and Oseltamivir are FDA approved. Peramivir {{is used in}} Japan and South Korea. Laninamivir is used in Japan only.|$|E
50|$|New NA {{inhibitor}} analogues were synthesized, {{based on}} <b>Zanamivir,</b> Oseltamivir and Peramivir, with rational structure-based drug design {{and can be}} categorized into four groups.|$|E
50|$|Beau and {{coworkers}} assembled the core dihydropyran framework of <b>zanamivir</b> congeners via {{a combination of}} PBM reaction and Iron(III)-promoted deprotection-cyclization sequence. A stereochemically-defined α-hydroxyaldehyde 2, diallylamine and a dimethylketal-protected boronic acid 1 is coupled to form the acyclic, stereochemically-defined amino-alcohol 3, which then undergoes an Iron(III)-promoted cyclization to form a bicyclic dihydropyran 4. Selective opening of the oxazoline portion of the dihydropyran intermediate 4 with water or timethylsilyl azide then furnish downstream products that have structures resembling the <b>Zanamivir</b> family members.|$|E
