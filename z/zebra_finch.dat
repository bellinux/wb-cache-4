25|$|Gene {{knockdown}} of FOXP2 in Area X of the {{basal ganglia}} in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation. Overexpression of FoxP2 was accomplished through injection of adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) into Area X of the brain. This overexpression produced similar effects {{to that of}} knockdown; juvenile <b>zebra</b> <b>finch</b> birds were unable to accurately imitate their tutors. Similarly, in adult canaries higher FOXP2 levels also correlate with song changes.|$|E
25|$|The FOXP2 gene {{is highly}} conserved in mammals. Human gene differs from {{non-human}} primates by {{the substitution of}} two amino acids, threonine to asparagine substitution at position 303 (T303N) and asparagine to serine substitution at position 325 (N325S). In mice it {{differs from that of}} humans by three substitutions, and in <b>zebra</b> <b>finch</b> by seven amino acids. One of the two amino acid difference between human and chimps also arose independently in carnivores and bats. Similar FOXP2 proteins can be found in songbirds, fish, and reptiles such as alligators.|$|E
25|$|Studies on <b>zebra</b> <b>finch</b> {{have shown}} that nuclei in the {{auditory}} thalamus, two steps up from the cochlea, do not passively relay input from peripheral sensory structures into higher forebrain structures. Thalamic nuclei show different patterns of gene expression in response to different stimuli, implicating them {{in the process of}} acoustic discrimination. Neurons in the nucleus ovoidalis (Ov) have receptive fields that are tuned to respond to the specific combination of spectral and temporal features present in syllables of conspecific song. Stimulus-selective tuning is determined by the receptor proteins and ion channels characterizing synapses of these neurons. Neurons can selectively respond to time-based differences between songs (e.g. syllable length or syllable-interval length) if they are post-synaptic to either fast-release (ionotropic) or slow-release (metabotropic) glutamate receptors.|$|E
40|$|Memorisation brings along costs, {{therefore}} certain benefits must outweigh these costs. <b>Zebra</b> <b>finches</b> {{are able}} to memorise songs, this takes place both early in life and throughout life. Males use memories of songs {{in order to develop}} an own song. However, female <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> do not sing, and therefore song memorisation in females must serve other purposes. We discussed the functions of song memorisation in female <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> based on current literature. We explored the functions of song memorisation in recognition and female mate choice. It is shown that female <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> {{are able to}} recognise conspecifics, their own subspecies and their mate. Furthermore, song memorisation in female <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> could play a role in mate choice. Females learn to prefer songs of tutored males of their own subspecies by memorising songs. Besides, avoiding inbreeding and finding a local mate could be functions of song memorisation as well, but further research needs to clarify this. Concluding, to some extent, recognition and mate choice seem to be functions of song memorisation. Why birdsong evolved remains a major question, although the functions of song memorisation could shed light on this problem...|$|R
40|$|In avian species, {{high levels}} of {{prolactin}} (PRL) released from the anterior pituitary are associated with reproductive behaviors such as incubation and rearing of young. We studied reproduction-associated PRL levels in breeding and nonbreeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches.</b> The general hypothesis of this dissertation was: The general pattern of PRL release in <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> is similar to other avian species, but differences in regulation of release can be expected due to the unique breeding environment in which these animals live.;The research was divided into four parts: (1) Determining the pattern of PRL release and secretion in response to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP); (2) Determining PRL and growth hormone (GH) presence and distribution in the anterior pituitary; (3) Determining differences in PRL molecular weight isoforms in the anterior pituitary during different phases of reproduction; and (4) Determining the effects of dopaminergic agents and anti-VIP antibodies in regulating PRL release.;Plasma PRL levels were low in nonbreeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> and high in breeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches.</b> Males and females did not differ. Exogenous VIP raised PRL levels in nonbreeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> to a level comparable to breeding finches. The VIP-induced PRL rise occurred rapidly and had a prolonged effect. <b>Zebra</b> <b>finches</b> {{who were in the}} parental stage of reproduction showed only a slight increase in plasma PRL following VIP injection.;PRL-immunoreactive (IR) cells were concentrated in the cephalic lobe and along the ventral margin of the anterior pituitary (AP) and extended into the caudal lobe in birds of all reproductive conditions. GH-IR cells were concentrated in the caudal lobe of the AP and also extended into the cephalic lobe. <b>Zebra</b> <b>finches</b> with previous reproductive experience had significantly more PRL-IR cells in the AP than inexperienced birds, regardless of breeding status at the time sampled. Breeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> tended to have more PRL-IR cells than nonbreeders. There were no differences in the number of PRL-IR or GH-IR cells in the APs of birds of different ages or sex, and neither PRL-IR nor GH-IR cell counts correlated with plasma PRL levels. Further, the anterior pituitary of breeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> expressed two molecular weight isoforms of PRL, compared with only one found in nonbreeding birds.;Given alone, BROMO and DOMP produced little change in plasma PRL of nonbreeding birds. Nonbreeders receiving VIP + DOMP had higher post-injection PRL levels than other treatment groups, with females responding more robustly than males. Among breeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches,</b> only females receiving DOMP alone had significantly higher post-injection plasma PRL levels than controls. All other treatments given to breeding <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> resulted in plasma PRL levels that were intermediate between controls and females that had been given DOMP. Antibodies against VIP at the dose used were ineffective at changing plasma PRL levels in breeding birds.;These are the first detailed studies on factors regulating plasma PRL release in <b>zebra</b> <b>finches.</b> Based on these findings, we hypothesize that <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> are more responsive to agents that stimulate PRL secretion rather than to inhibitory agents, and this may be part of the suite of characteristics that allow for their opportunistic breeding strategy. Additionally, we have conducted one of the few studies examining the effects of previous reproductive experience separate from age and have found that experience may induce long-lasting anatomical changes in the pituitary that prime it for future reproductive events...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{study of}} <b>zebra</b> <b>finches,</b> it was {{determined}} that those who were fed a lower quality diet laid eggs that were lighter and less nutrient rich than those <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> who were fed a higher quality diet. Therefore, those fed a lower quality diet produced more sons and those fed high quality produced more daughters (bigger, more nutrient-rich eggs) because in nature female offspring need more nourishment than males to survive and grow. Males need less nourishment because they do not lay eggs. Since <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> can increase the survivability rate of their species, this {{can be seen as a}} pre-birth parental care adaptation. (Nicholas B. Davies) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} the ability to distinguish song types {{has not yet been}} fully characterized by researchers in the field of neuroethology, but it has been demonstrated that at least five different structures within the auditory pathway contain neurons that preferentially respond to conspecific song. The structure of neural networks, the morphology of neurons, and the receptor and ion channel complement of pre-synaptic connections cause some neurons to respond maximally to a particular stimulus frequency, phase, amplitude or temporal pattern, and this is known as spectral-temporal tuning. Tight spectral-temporal tuning in the auditory pathway provides the central nervous system of songbirds with the ability to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific songs. Tuning characteristics of auditory neurons have been best characterized in <b>zebra</b> <b>finch</b> (Taeniopygia guttata), canary (Serinus canaria), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and barn owl (Tyto alba).|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} led by Zhang Fucheng examined fossils with preserved melanosomes (organelles which contain colors). By studying such fossils with an electron microscope, they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil Confuciusornis specimen, IVPP V13171. They reported the presence of melanosomes were of two types: eumelanosomes and pheomelanosomes. This indicated that Confuciusornis had hues of grey, red/brown and black, possibly something like the modern <b>zebra</b> <b>finch.</b> It was also the first time an early bird fossil has been shown to contain preserved pheomelanosomes. However, a second research team failed to find these reported traces of pheomelanosomes. Their 2011 study also found a link between the presence of certain metals, like copper, and preserved melanin. Using a combination of fossil impressions of melanosomes and the presence of metals in the feathers, the second team of scientists reconstructed Confuciusornis with darkly colored body feathers and upper wing feathers, but found no trace of either melanosomes or metals in the majority of the wing feathers. They suggested that the wings of Confuciusornis would have been white or, possibly, colored with carotenoid pigments. The long tail feathers of male specimens would have also been dark in color along their entire length.|$|E

40|$|<b>Zebra</b> <b>finches</b> {{have been}} a rich {{experimental}} system for studying neurobiological questions of relevance to human health for decades. In particular, finches are the leading nonhuman model organisms for investigating the biological basis of vocal learning, a critical behavioral substrate for speech acquisition. In addition, <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> are an ideal system {{for the study of}} brain asymmetry, hormonal control of brain development, physiological function of sleep, sex differences in the brain, behavioral-induced gene expression, and adult neurogenesis, among other questions. Despite their importance for neurobiology, the usefulness of finches as an experimental system has been restricted by a lack of genetic manipulation methods. To overcome this barrier, our laboratory has developed methods for generating transgenic birds, including <b>zebra</b> <b>finches.</b> The successful implementation of this transgenic technology by multiple research laboratories has the potential to dramatically accelerate the progress of our understanding of the genetic basis of complex biological processes such as vocal learning. Moreover, the ability to genetically manipulate <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> could also be used to generate novel genetic models for human disorders that cannot be studied elsewhere or that can be more easily studied in this small bird. Here, we describe a protocol to generate transgenic <b>zebra</b> <b>finches</b> using recombinant lentiviruses...|$|R

2500|$|The entire genome of the {{domestic}} fowl (Gallus gallus) was sequenced in 2004 and was followed in 2008 by the genome of the <b>zebra</b> <b>finch</b> (Taeniopygia guttata). [...] Such whole genome sequencing projects allow for studies on evolutionary processes involved in speciation. Associations between the expression of genes and behaviour may be studied using candidate genes. Variations in the exploratory behaviour of great tits (Parus major) {{have been found to}} be linked with a gene orthologous to the human gene DRD4 (Dopamine receptor D4) which is known to be associated with novelty-seeking behaviour. The role of gene expression in developmental differences and morphological variations have been studied in Darwin's finches. The difference in the expression of Bmp4 have been shown to be associated with changes in the growth and shape of the beak.|$|E
