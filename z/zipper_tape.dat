25|$|On metal toothed zippers, the {{cut edges}} of the {{rubberized}} fabric of the <b>zipper</b> <b>tapes</b> are susceptible to fraying along the exposed weave. if not trimmed, the frayed edges can accelerate damage to the weave and eventually delaminate the edge.

50|$|The imagery Green {{has used}} {{throughout}} his entire career, {{and continues to}} use to this day, is drawn from illustrated textbooks and advertising of the forties and fifties that touch on technological and roadside Americana, with overt themes of sexual symbolism. Imagery includes ice cream cones, bridges, incomplete bridges, mirrors, scissors, women's painted fingernails, passionate couples, tires, moons floating over water, puzzle pieces, silhouettes of a plane flying overhead, searchlights, tornados, women's nylon-covered legs, wood grain, leather cords, screws, cables, knots, <b>zippers,</b> <b>tapes,</b> stitches, Necker cubes, and other optical illusions. The paintings tend to have torn or stitched imagery that evokes the trompe l'oeil tradition; transparent and solid planes overlap, too, achieving {{a high level of}} spatial complexity. Though the illusory depth of his paintings is not all that deep, the viewer still finds himself looking at, into, and through his paintings.|$|R
5000|$|Two way {{open-ended}} zippers Instead {{of having}} an insertion pin and pin box at the bottom, a two way open-ended zipper has a puller on {{each end of the}} <b>zipper</b> <b>tape.</b> Someone wearing a garment with this kind of zipper can slide up the bottom puller to accommodate more leg movement without stressing the pin and box of a one-way open-ended zipper. It is most commonly used on long coats.|$|E
5000|$|A metal zipper is a zipper, zip, zip {{fastener}} or {{fly with}} its binding edges consisting of individual {{pieces of metal}} that are molded into shape and set at regular intervals on the <b>zipper</b> <b>tape.</b> Metal zippers are mainly made of Brass, Nickel and Aluminium, and given their durability, they are mostly used in jeans, work-wear, heavy luggage and heavy-duty garments that must withstand high strength and tough washing. The metal zipper is the oldest type of workable zipper, having been invented by Gideon Sundback as an improvement of Whitcomb Judson's [...] "Clasp Locker" [...] that majorly consisted of a hook-and-eye shoe fastener.|$|E
5000|$|Invisible zippers {{have the}} teeth {{hidden behind a}} tape, so that the zipper is invisible. It is also called the Concealed zipper. The tape's color matches the garment's, as does the slider's and the puller's. This kind of a zipper is common in skirts and dresses. Invisible zippers are usually coil zippers. They are also seeing {{increased}} use by the military and emergency services because {{the appearance of a}} button down shirt can be maintained, while providing a quick and easy fastening system. A regular invisible zipper uses a lighter lace-like fabric on the <b>zipper</b> <b>tape,</b> instead of the common heavier woven fabric on other zippers.|$|E
25|$|Metal toothed {{watertight}} zippers rely {{on pressure}} {{between the two}} rubberized contact surfaces of the <b>zipper</b> <b>tapes</b> alongside the teeth for sealing. To get this pressure, the slider needs to press the two faces together while closing, and this increases friction between the slider and the teeth, so the zipper requires more force to close than regular zippers. If the two rows of open teeth are lined up and close together {{in front of the}} pull it will prevent misalignment which can permanently damage the sealing edge, and allow the zipper to be closed with less effort. Friction can be reduced by suitable lubrication which is usually done with a waterproof wax or grease which remains on the zipper when wet. There should not be an excessive buildup of lubricant which would stick to particles of grit and cause wear and additional friction. The plastic tooth zippers have less friction than the metal teeth and need less force to close.|$|R
2500|$|Yet another {{potential}} {{benefit of the}} blanket sleeper {{is that it may}} help prevent infants from removing or interfering with their diapers during the night. [...] This can also apply to older children with certain developmental disabilities, such as Angelman syndrome. [...] In particular, parents of Angelman children have been known to take such additional measures as cutting the feet off the sleeper and putting it on backwards, and/or covering the <b>zipper</b> with duct <b>tape.</b> [...] Some specialty locking clothing and other adaptive clothing purveyors offer blanket sleepers, with or without feet, for adults with dementia or other disabilities, for similar reasons.|$|R
5000|$|Metal zippers are {{the classic}} zipper type, found mostly {{in jeans and}} pencil cases today. The teeth are not a coil, but are {{individual}} pieces of metal molded into shape and set on the <b>zipper</b> <b>tape</b> at regular intervals. Metal zippers are made in brass, aluminum and nickel, according to the metal used for teeth making. All these zippers are basically made from flat wire. A special type of metal zipper is made from pre-formed wire, usually brass but sometimes other metals too. Only a few companies {{in the world have}} the technology. This type of pre-formed metal zippers is mainly used in high grade jeans-wear, work-wear, etc., where high strength is required and zippers need to withstand tough washing.|$|E
50|$|A plastic zipper, {{also known}} as a Delrin zipper, is a zipper made with {{polyester}} tape and molded POM elements. Delrin is a high-grade plastic that is molded in a form over the individual side of the <b>zipper</b> <b>tape.</b> These zippers are light in weight and can be colored to match the product they are fabricated for. They are more commonly known as molded zippers and have a larger bulk than coil zippers. Individually coupling of the teeth in these zippers interlocks seamlessly. In fact, they are almost similar to metal zippers in design because of the individually positioned teeth along the tape. The teeth are smartly injection molded onto a pre-woven, dyed tape. The degree of self-lubrication and sturdiness of Delrin zippers is far better than an equivalent size of coil zipper.|$|E
