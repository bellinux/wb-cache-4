40|$|Line Spectrum Pair (LSP) {{representation}} of Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) parameters {{is widely used}} in speech coding applications. An efficient method for LPC to LSP conversion is Kabal’s method. In this method the LSPs are the roots of two polynomials P' p (x) and Q' p (x), and are found by a <b>zero</b> <b>crossing</b> search followed by successive bisections and interpolation. The precision of the obtained LSPs is higher than required by most applications, {{but the number of}} bisections cannot be decreased without compromising the <b>zero</b> <b>crossing</b> search. In this paper, it is shown that, in the case of 10 th-order LPC, five intervals containing each only one <b>zero</b> <b>crossing</b> of P' 10 (x) and one <b>zero</b> <b>crossing</b> of Q' 10 (x) can be calculated, avoiding the <b>zero</b> <b>crossing</b> search.

5000|$|A <b>zero</b> <b>cross</b> circuit (or zero {{crossing}} circuit) is an electrical circuit that starts operation with the AC load voltage {{at close to}} 0 Volts in the AC cycle. This is in relation to solid state relays, such as triacs and silicon controlled rectifiers. The purpose of the circuit is to start the triac conducting very near the time point when the load voltage is crossing zero volts (at the beginning or the middle of each AC cycle represented by a sine wave), so that the output voltage begins as a complete sine-wave half-cycle. In other words, if the controlling input signal is applied at any point during the AC output wave other than {{very close to the}} zero voltage point of that wave, the output of the switching device will [...] "wait" [...] to switch on until the output AC wave reaches its next zero point. This is useful when sudden turn-on {{in the middle of a}} sine-wave half cycle could cause undesirable effects like high frequency spikes for which the circuit or the environment is not expected to handle gracefully.|$|E
5000|$|Tension in {{a string}} is a non-negative scalar quantity. Zero tension is slack. A string or rope is often {{idealized}} as one dimension, having length but being massless with <b>zero</b> <b>cross</b> section. If there are no bends in the string, as occur with vibrations or pulleys, then tension is a constant along the string, equal to {{the magnitude of the}} forces applied by the ends of the string. By Newton's Third Law, these are the same forces exerted on the ends of the string by the objects to which the ends are attached. If the string curves around one or more pulleys, it will still have constant tension along its length in the idealized situation that the pulleys are massless and frictionless. A vibrating string vibrates with a set of frequencies that depend on the string's tension. These frequencies can be derived from Newton's laws of motion. Each microscopic segment of the string pulls on and is pulled upon by its neighboring segments, with a force equal to the tension at that position along the string. tension [...] where [...] is the position along the string.|$|E
