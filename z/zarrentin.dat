The traffic {{was subject to}} the Interzonal traffic regulations, that between West Germany and West Berlin followed the special regulations of the Transit Agreement (1972).|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War, {{the line}} to Bad Oldesloe was {{interrupted}} at the Inner German border west of <b>Zarrentin.</b> The Berlin-Hamburg Railway lost importance {{as a result of}} the border. From the 1960s to the late 1980s, a single pair of express trains, an interzonal train from Hamburg to Dresden, continuing to Leipzig, stopped in Hagenow Land each day.|$|E
5000|$|In the 11th century, the Slavic {{settlement}} of Zarnethin was at <b>Zarrentin.</b> It could translate vaguely to [...] "place of evil" [...] or [...] "black site", indicating a former ritual place. In 1139/1143 {{the place was}} reigned by Henry of Badewide, a Saxon count. From the late 12th century on, many Germans settled here. The Ratzeburger Zehntregister mentions the place in 1230.|$|E
50|$|The {{cities were}} divided such that Schwerin received: Wismar, {{along with all}} the princely houses, Schwerin, Parchim, Waren and Kröpelin; the noble towns of Brüel, Malchow and Dassow, as well as Dömitz and <b>Zarrentin.</b> Güstrow received: Güstrow, Laage, Krakow, Malchin, Robel, Teterow, Neubrandenburg, Friedland, Woldegk, Penzlin, Sülze and Marlow. It also gained the Elbe (despite its {{remoteness}} from Güstrow) as a result of gaining the Amt of Boizenburg.|$|E
50|$|Naturschutzgebiet Nieklitzer Moor (Nieklitzer Moor Nature reserve) is a 53 hectare broad Naturschutzgebiet in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It {{is located}} to the {{southwest}} of <b>Zarrentin</b> am Schaalsee, north of Gallin and was established on March 21, 1977. The propose of this reserve is protection and development of largely nutrient poor mire. The field condition currently has an unsatisfactory assessment. Profound drainage measures are adversely affecting this area and lead to almost completely removing peat-like vegetation. An inspection in the protected areas is not possible.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the cathedral}} chapter of Ratzeburg with its provost or dean and twelve canons, {{there were in}} the diocese the Benedictine Abbeys of St. George, Ratzeburg (refounded in 1093), and of Wismar, where Benedictines {{expelled}} from Lübeck founded a monastery in 1239; also convents of the same order at Eldena founded in 1229, by Bishop Gottschalk of Ratzeburg, and burnt in 1290, at Rehna founded in 1237 by Prince-Bishop Ludolfus, and at <b>Zarrentin</b> founded in 1243.

These were replaced on 20 November 1982 {{by a new}} autobahn crossing at <b>Zarrentin</b> (E)/Gudow (W). On 1 January 1988, the new Stolpe checkpoint opened on this route to West Berlin. This is part of today's Hohen Neuendorf (E)/Berlin-Heiligensee (W).|$|E
50|$|Passenger {{services}} to <b>Zarrentin</b> ended in 2000, only Hagenow Stadt station is served. Hagenow Land station {{is the main}} station {{of the town and}} is served by the Regional-Express service RE 1 between Rostock and Hamburg via Schwerin (timetable route number 100), which is the more important service. On timetable route number 172, passenger trains operated by Ostdeutsche Eisenbahn GmbH (ODEG) run from Hagenow Stadt via Hagenow Land and Ludwigslust to Neustrelitz. Connections to Berlin always require a change of trains, usually in Ludwigslust station. Freight operations at Hagenow Land station have been abandoned.|$|E
5000|$|The pair {{of tracks}} from the {{direction}} of Schwerin runs directly from the northeast towards the northwestern side of Hagenow Land station and later connect with the line towards Hamburg. This track layout and the location of Hagenow are shown on an isometric map of 1879. [...] About 300 m behind the point where the routes from Schwerin and Ludwigslust converge, a single-track line branches off on a tight 90 degree turn to the north-west towards <b>Zarrentin</b> via Hagenow Stadt station. Originally, the line of the Hagenow Land-Bad Oldesloe railway—known as the Kaiserbahn or “Emperor Railway"—continued via Ratzeburg to Bad Oldesloe.|$|E
50|$|Between 1945 and 1982 Nostorf's {{component}} {{village of}} Horst served as East German inner German border crossing for cars travelling along F 5 between the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany (till 1949, thereafter the East German Democratic Republic), or West Berlin and the British zone of occupation (till 1949) and thereafter the West German Federal Republic of Germany. The traffic {{was subject to}} the Interzonal traffic regulations, that between West Germany and West Berlin followed the special regulations of the Transit Agreement (1972). In 1982 the border crossing was closed in favour of a new crossing following the route of today's Bundesautobahn 24 in <b>Zarrentin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gunzelin III {{was the son}} of Count Henry I and his wife, Audacia. He {{inherited}} the County of Schwerin when his father died in 1228. As his was still a minor at the time, his mother acted as his guardian and regent. She ensured that he would hold the county of Schwerin as a feudal fief. After the Battle of Bornhöved (1227), Duke Otto I of Brunswick and Luneburg was held captive in Schwerin. As a condition for his release, he had to confirm Gunzelin III as the holder of the fiefs Schwerin held from Brunswick. During this period, all feudal transactions of the County were sealed by both Gunzelin and his mother. On 1 November 1246, they jointly founded <b>Zarrentin</b> Abbey and donated some land to it.|$|E
50|$|The {{nature reserve}} {{is part of}} the Schaalsee European Bird Reserve {{designated}} in 1992 (EU No. DE 2231-401). It has an area of c. 86 hectares and incorporates part of the town of <b>Zarrentin</b> am Schaalsee in the local subdistricts (Germarkungen) of Boissow, Techin, Neuhof and Neuenkirchen. The reserve aims to protect and preserve a narrow, partially boggy, erosion valley along Lakes Boissow and Neuenkirchen (Boissower See and Neuenkirchener See), linked by a roughly 250 metre long stream, as well as its associated belt of reeds, forested valley sides, carrs and the moorland and areas of mineral soil used for pasture. The status of the land in the reserve is classified as satisfactory. The intrusion of nutrients from the adjacent agricultural areas and fishing have adverse effects.A footpath along the east shore and an observation tower offer views of the reserve.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1945 British forces {{captured}} the district territory, which in September 1944 had been determined in the London Protocol {{to become part}} of the British Zone of Occupation. On November 13, 1945 the British general Colin Muir Barber and the Soviet general major Nikolay Grigoryevich Lyashchenko (Николай Григорьевич Лященко) signed the Barber Lyashchenko Agreement ( [...] , also Gadebusch Agreement) in Gadebusch, redeploying some municipalities of the Duchy of Lauenburg District and neighbouring Mecklenburg, then part of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. Thus some eastern suburbs of Ratzeburg, such as Ziethen in Lauenburg, Mechow, Bäk and Römnitz became part of the district, while the Lauenburgian municipalities of Dechow, Groß and Klein Thurow (now component parts of Roggendorf) as well as Lassahn (now a component part of <b>Zarrentin</b> am Schaalsee) were ceded to Mecklenburg. The redeployment was accomplished on November 26, the respective occupational forces had until November 28 to withdraw to their respective new zonal territories.|$|E

The redeployment was accomplished on 26 November, the respective occupational forces had to withdraw until 28 November to their new zonal territory. The British occupational forces provided all the inhabitants of villages to be ceded to the Soviet zone to be evacuated, if they wished so, including all their chattels by vehicles provided by the British forces. All displaced people (usually formerly forced labourers under the prior Nazi rule) in these villages and other eventual foreigners - except of Soviet citizens among them - were obligatorily to be relocated, while Soviet displaced people would have to stay.|$|E
