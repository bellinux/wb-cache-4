2500|$|The Woods Lake Fault, running past Lake Chaplain, {{corresponds}} {{closest to}} the mapped position of {{the southern end of}} Cheney's Mount Vernon Fault. [...] However, subsequent mapping shows that the Woods Creek Fault (WCF), a four-mile wide strip of oblique-slip and strike-slip faults just to the west and passing directly under Sultan, appears to be the more significant fault, and better aligned with Mount Vernon. Both of these faults (and some others) appear to terminate against the left-lateral Sultan River Fault at the western margin of the NNE-striking Cherry Creek Fault Zone (CCFZ; see next section). The principal <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>faulting</b> extends from the Woods Creek Fault to the Granite Falls Fault Zone (GFFZ), slightly offset from the WCF and running under the town of Granite Falls.

40|$|We {{identify}} and characterize the active Seattle fault zone (SFZ) east of Lake Washington with newly acquired seismic reflection data. Our results focus on structures {{observed in the}} upper 1 km below the cities of Bellevue, Sammamish, Newcastle, and Fall City, Washington. The SFZ appears as a broad <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>faulting</b> and folding at the southern boundary of the Seattle basin and north edge of the Seattle uplift. We interpret the Seattle fault as a thrust fault that accommodates north‚Äìsouth shortening by forming a fault-propagation fold with a forelimb breakthrough. The blind tip of the main fault forms a synclinal growth fold (deformation front) that extends at least 8 km east of Vasa Park (west side of Lake Sammamish) and defines the south edge of the Seattle basin. South of the deformation front is the forelimb breakthrough fault, which was exposed in a trench at Vasa Park. The Newcastle Hills anticline, a broad anticline forming the north part of the Seattle uplift east of Lake Washington, is interpreted to lie between the main blind strand of the Seattle fault and a backthrust. Our profiles, on the northern limb of this anticline, consistently image north-dipping strata.

40|$|The {{integrated}} {{evaluation of}} borecores from the Mez≈ësas-Furta fractured metamorphic hydrocarbon reservoir suggests significantly distinct microstructural and rock mechanical features within the analysed fault rock samples. The statistical {{evaluation of the}} clast geometries revealed the dominantly cataclastic nature of the samples. Damage <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fault</b> can be characterised by an extremely brittle nature and low uniaxial compressive strength, coupled with a predominately coarse fault breccia composition. In contrast, the microstructural manner of the increasing deformation coupled with higher uniaxial compressive strength, strain-hardening nature and low brittleness indicate a transitional interval between the weakly fragmented damage zone and strongly grinded fault core. Moreover, these attributes suggest this unit is mechanically the strongest part <b>of</b> the <b>fault</b> <b>zone.</b> Gougerich cataclasites mark the core <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fault,</b> with their widespread plastic nature and locally pseudo-ductile microstructure. Strain localization tends to be strongly linked with the existence <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> gouge ribbons.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Prior to serpentinization, the ultramafic {{rocks of}} the ophiolitic Highland Border Suite were {{depleted}} harzburgites, dunites, and orthopyroxenites. They {{may have been}} the residual mantle after melting of primary lherzolite that produced the basaltic rocks of the Suite. Serpentinization f these peridotites occurred at low temperatures (75 + 50 ~ and produced pseudo-morphic-textured lizardite serpentinites in which the minor-element compositions ofthe primary phases were preserved in the lizardite grains. Olivine was almost completely serpentinized before orthopyroxene was hydrated. Concomitant peripheral teration of chrome-spinels, during serpentinization of orthopyroxene, caused release of Cr and A 1 cations which were incorporated into the lizardite. Under greenschist-facies conditions (c. 350 ~ at 3 - 4 kbar), the lizardite serpentinites were subsequently metamorphosed and recrystallized to non-pseudomorphic-textured antigorite serpentinites. Post-metamorphic processes included high-level brittle deformation that resulted in fracturing and cross-fibre chrysotile vein-formation, and ductile shearing (T 200 ~ P> 2 kbar) which produced talc-chrysotile shear zones. THE mafic and ultramafic rocks that outcrop along the Highland Border Fracture Zone (H. B. F. Z.) [...] The Highland Border Suite (Ikin, 1979) [...] have been interpreted asophiolitic remnants ofa Caledonian marginal basin of Cambrian or early Ordovician age (Henderson and Robertson, 1982; Curry et al., 1982; Ikin, 1983). Rocks of the Suite occur as tectonically emplaced fault-bounded slivers and pods varying in width from 30 - 500 m, and separated one from another by as much as 35 km. The H. B. F.

40|$|Mechanical and magmatic {{processes}} exert first-order {{control on}} the architecture and evolution of rifts. As a continental rift develops towards a new oceanic spreading centre, extension that is initially accommodated in a broad <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>faulting</b> and ductile stretching must transition towards a narrow zone of focused magmatic intrusion. The Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), part of the East African Rift System, is an ideal location to study this transition because it captures rifting processes during continental breakup. In this contribution we synthesise geochemical data from scoria cones in the Wonji Fault Belt (WFB) and Silti-Debre Zeyit Fault Zone (SDFZ) in the MER to provide new constraints {{on the development of}} mantle melting columns and magmatic plumbing systems since the onset of rifting. We utilize the extensive geophysical and geochemical databases, collected in the Ethiopian Rift, to show that geochemical evidence of heterogeneity in the depth of the mantle melting column which produced Quaternary rift basalts correlates with lithospheric structure. When combined with existing observations of asymmetry across the rift in terms of depth of melting column and magmatic plumbing systems, it is evident that the mechanical structure of the rift, defined during the initial stages of breakup, has played a dominant role in the initial development of magma assisted rifting in the MER. Surface structures and crustal-scale geophysical studies have suggested the WFB is analogous to a sea-floor spreading centre. However, the geochemical characteristics of rift basalts are consistent with mantle tomography that shows no evidence beneath the MER for passive magmatic upwelling beneath discrete rift segments as is observed in the ocean basins. Collectively, the Ethiopian data show that the distribution of mantle melts during the initiation of magma assisted rifting is fundamentally influenced by lithospheric structures formed during earlier syn-rift stretching...|$|E
40|$|With {{financial}} support from the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Layman Energy Associates, Inc. (LEA) has completed a program of geothermal exploration at the Truckhaven area in Imperial County, California. The exploratory work conducted by LEA included the following activities: compilation of public domain resource data (wells, seismic data, geologic maps); detailed field geologic mapping at the project site; acquisition and interpretation of remote sensing imagery such as aerial and satellite photographs; acquisition, quality control and interpretation of gravity data; and acquisition, quality control and interpretation of resistivity data using {{state of the art}} magnetotelluric (MT) methods. The results of this exploratory program have allowed LEA to develop a structural and hydrologic interpretation of the Truckhaven geothermal resource which can be used to guide subsequent exploratory drilling and resource development. Of primary significance, is the identification of an 8 kilometer-long, WNW-trending zone of low resistivity associated with geothermal activity in nearby wells. The long axis of this low resistivity zone is inferred to mark a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>faulting</b> which likely provides the primary control on the distribution of geothermal resources in the Truckhaven area. Abundant cross-faults cutting the main WNW-trending zone in its western half may indicate elevated fracture permeability in this region, possibly associated with thermal upwelling and higher resource temperatures. Regional groundwater flow is inferred to push thermal fluids from west to east along the trend of the main low resistivity zone, with resource temperatures likely declining from west to east away from the inferred upwelling zone. Resistivity mapping and well data have also shown that within the WNW-trending low resistivity zone, the thickness of the Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary section above granite basement ranges from 1, 900 ‚Äì 2, 600 meters. Well data indicates the lower part of this sedimentary section is sand-rich, suggesting good potential for a sediment-hosted geothermal reservoir in porous sands, similar to other fields in the region such as Heber and East Mesa. Sand porosity may remain higher in the eastern portion of the low resistivity zone. This is based on its location hydrologically downstream of the probable area of thermal upwelling, intense fracture development, and associated pore-filling hydrothermal mineral deposition to the west...|$|E
