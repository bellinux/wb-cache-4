5|$|The Dzordzor Chapel {{was built}} {{on the bank of the}} Makuchay River at Dzordzor by Bishop <b>Zachariah</b> in 1314 on very modest lines, making use of the vestiges of an earlier {{religious}} monument dated between the 10th and 12th centuries. During the period of Ottoman rule, some parts of the building were destroyed. Later, the chapel came under threat of submergence from a proposed dam and had to be shifted to a new location upstream.|$|E
5|$|According to unverified reports it is {{believed}} that St. Thaddeus was buried {{at the site of the}} St. Thaddeus Monastery in the 1st century A.D., and that St. Gregory was responsible for establishing a monastery here in the 4th century. However, there is recorded proof that St. Thaddeus Monastery dates to the 7th century. It was the second Armenian church to be built, following the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and was the seat of the diocese in the 10th century. It was destroyed in an earthquake in 1319 and was rebuilt due to the efforts of Bishop <b>Zachariah</b> in the 1320s.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Civil Service Commission {{had limited}} success. Some cabinet members {{implemented}} a merit system that {{increased the number}} of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage. Delano, however, exempted his department from competitive examinations, and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform. <b>Zachariah</b> Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, reformed the Interior Department and fired corrupt clerks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The same year, Grant fired Attorney General George Henry Williams after his wife was discovered to be involved in a bribery scandal, and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should offer free public schooling to all children; he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment, which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations.|$|E
50|$|Some historians, {{particularly}} Pauline Allen, {{allege that}} Evagrius’s Chalcedonian theological stance directly influenced his selection of information, {{in order to}} defend Chalcedonian-aligned political agents against negative reputation. Whitby, however, emphasizes the legal scholar's acceptance and inclusion of information written by other historians who adopted opposing stances, when he discerned that their accounts were reliable. For example, Evagrius Scholasticus relies heavily on <b>Zachariah’s</b> textual study of history {{even though he was}} a monophysite, occasionally omitting minor facets of his work that explicitly promote his theology, but largely considering him to be dependable. Allen also reasons that Evagrius built on <b>Zachariah’s</b> work because his was the only comprehensive historical account of events taking place from Theodoret of Cyrus’s time till his own era. Unfortunately, however, <b>Zachariah’s</b> original manuscripts have been lost.|$|R

5|$|Similarly, it is {{recorded}} that Saint Stepanos Monastery was first established in 649 A.D. {{and a new}} building constructed at the same location in the 10th century. It was a major Christian church during the history of Armenian independence and development. After it suffered damages due to earthquake, it was rebuilt by Bishop <b>Zachariah</b> in the 1320s. During the entire 14th century, it was the centre of influence in the region for Christian missionary work. This period marked the creation of literary manuscripts and paintings on religious themes. The monastery was rebuilt {{during the period from}} 1819 to 1825 and again became a center of religious activity. It was refurbished in the 1970s, and again during the period from 1983 to 2001.|$|E
5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} <b>Zachariah,</b> father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
5|$|With Sam {{closing in}} on Lilith, Castiel and <b>Zachariah</b> imprison Dean within an idyllic waiting room, where he will be made {{comfortable}} until the time comes for him to play his role in stopping the Apocalypse. Dean refuses to remain idle, and continually requests {{to be able to}} see Sam, which is denied. Once Dean discovers the angels are allowing the Apocalypse to happen, he implores for Castiel to help him stop the final seal from being broken. Though Castiel refuses at first, he returns ready to help not long after. He takes Dean to see the prophet Chuck for information on Sam. Their presence does not fall in line with Chuck's Gospel, so the Archangel Raphael begins to descend. Castiel sends Dean to Sam, remaining behind to hold back the archangel and any others who might come. He is subsequently killed, with his host's body being blown to pieces.|$|E

25|$|One day she is {{with one}} of the sailors, when his needle snaps. Charlotte offers to get a new one for him from the forecastle, where the crew sleeps. While looking for the needle, she sees a pistol in the trunk, and a round robin on the table. After contemplating whether or not to tell the captain, Charlotte's fear drives her to inform him. Captain Jaggery heads off the rebellion, {{shooting}} the stowaway Mr. Cranick, who held a grudge against the captain for lashing his arm so much it had to be amputated. Charlotte is distressed as Captain Jaggery and 1st mate Mr. Hollybrass whipped <b>Zachariah</b> 50 lashes. Charlotte tries to protect <b>Zachariah</b> by grabbing the whip, but accidentally hits the captain's face. Jaggery is enraged and whips <b>Zachariah</b> mercilessly, leading to his death and funeral.|$|E
5000|$|Ivan's {{repeated}} {{invitations to}} Ghisolfi {{seem to indicate}} that he hoped the latter's services would be valuable to him in extending Russian influence on the Black Sea. Yet it is strange that during a period of more than eighteen years Ghisolfi did not succeed in reaching Russia. Whether the fact that Ghisolfi was a Jew {{had anything to do with}} the impediments put in his way, it is difficult to ascertain, for no mention of him is to be found in Jewish writings. The different spellings of <b>Zachariah's</b> name in Italian and Russian documents—"Guizolfi," [...] "Guigursis," [...] and [...] "Guilgursis"—may be attributed to errors of the Russian scribes.|$|R

She is ordered to the brig, where she finds <b>Zachariah,</b> who has been hiding there since he was thrashed nearly to death. Captain Jaggery holds a trial and conveniently finds her guilty of Mr. Hollybrass' murder after accusing Charlotte of being unnatural in many aspects of her life, and comparing this to the unnatural murder of Hollybrass. Captain Jaggery tells Charlotte that he won't be the jury; instead the crew will be the jury. As Charlotte has vowed to expose his cruelty when they land, he threatens to hang her unless she will align herself with him and become a respectable young woman again.|$|E

25|$|<b>Zachariah</b> – <b>Zachariah</b> is the ship's cook who is cast in {{the role}} of the noble character. Early on, he offers Charlotte his {{friendship}} as well as a small knife for her protection. He cares for Charlotte during her first days of seasickness, and seems to be respected by the crew, although he is at times the butt of their jokes because he is the only black person on board. He tells Charlotte that he left his home in Africa as a teenager, and had been a sailor ever since. He has never lived in America and has never been a slave. At the end of the book, it becomes clear that he does not realize what his social status would be, even as a free man in Providence, Rhode Island.|$|E

25|$|She {{finds out}} that <b>Zachariah</b> is {{actually}} alive and {{has been living in}} the jail of the Seahawk with the help of another sailor, Keetch, who supplies him with food. With Zachariah's help, she escapes the prison and plans to steal the captain's guns and usurp his title. Instead, she finds the captain waiting for her. The Captain says that he has been waiting for her all along. Keetch had told him everything. Jaggery reveals that he himself had killed Hollybrass, but claims that he had been threatened and {{had no choice but to}} murder him. Not wanting to lose his title, he blames the death on Charlotte. He tells her she has three choices. She can 1) take the muskets and disrespect her family and herself by killing Captain Jaggery, 2) put on her proper clothing and wait at the docks like a proper lady, forgetting all about the fights, and begging him for mercy in front of the crew, or 3) consent to be hanged. She refuses to take any of the choices, and flees the cabin. Jaggery attempts to kill her in front of the crew, but falls off the ship's bowsprit to his death while chasing Charlotte, despite Charlotte's awkward attempt to save him. <b>Zachariah</b> tells the crew that a new captain must be named, and that it should be Charlotte, because she has done what they could not. She is elected by the crew, but serves primarily as a figurehead due to her lack of experience. <b>Zachariah</b> openly exercises the powers of the captain, after she insists on it. They land in Providence, Rhode Island, 12 hours later.|$|E

25|$|Based on very meager information, Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker {{suggests}} in The First Americans that Copernican astronomy, {{although not}} taught formally until later, started to emerge at Harvard College in 1670.

However, as early as 1659, one Harvard graduate, <b>Zachariah</b> Brigden, began to promote the new astronomy in the New England almanacs.
