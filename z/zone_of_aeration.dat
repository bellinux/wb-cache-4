40|$|The {{water table}} {{is the level}} at which the {{groundwater}} pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. It may be conveniently visualized as the 'surface ' of the groundwater in given vicinity. It usually coincides approximately with the 'phreatic surface', but can be many feet above it. As water infiltrates through pore spaces in the soil, it first passes through the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration,</b> where the soil is unsaturated. At increasing depths water fills in more spaces, until the zone of saturation is reached. The ability of the aquifer to store groundwater is dependent on the primary and secondary porosity and permeability of the rock or soil. The form of a water table may change and vary due to seasonal changes, topography and structural geology. In some regions, winter precipitation is often higher than summer precipitation and so the groundwater storage is not fully recharged in summer...|$|E
40|$|Investigators {{who were}} closely {{associated}} with five groundwater monitoring programs were asked to critically examine their studies {{as a guide to}} others involved in similar projects. The particular question to be answered was, "What monitoring techniques should have or could have been implemented?" given that time and money were not constraints. The case studies involved contamination of aquifers from oil field brine disposal, plating waste disposal, landfill leachate, nitrate from multiple sources, and recharge from an oxidation pond. Among the general recommendations of the investigators, resulting from the process of critical evaluation of their associated projects, were the following: establish interdisciplinary committees to set up the monitoring program; maximize the density of well network; use alternative methods to wells; completely analyze the samples, including heavy metals; thoroughly examine the hydrogeology of the problem site; use tracers; develop predictive computer models of the flow system; monitor in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration,</b> where applicable; develop innovative methodologies; and continue monitoring until the problem is thoroughly quantified...|$|E

40|$|Organized spatial {{distribution}} of plants (plant zonation) in salt marshes {{has been linked to}} the soil aeration condition in the rhizosphere through simplistic tidal inundation parameters. Here, a soil saturation index (ratio of saturation period to tidal period at a soil depth) is introduced to describe the soil aeration condition. This new index captures the effects of not only the tidal inundation period and frequency but also the flow dynamics of groundwater in the marsh soil. One-dimensional numerical models based on saturated flow with the Boussinesq approximations and a two-dimensional variably saturated flow model were developed to explore the behaviour of this new soil aeration variable under the influence of spring-neap tides. Simulations revealed two characteristic <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>aeration</b> across the salt marsh: a relatively well aerated near-creek zone and a poorly aerated interior zone. In the near-creek zone, soils undergo periodic wetting and drying as the groundwater table fluctuates throughout the spring-neap cycle. In the interior, the soil remains largely water saturated except for neap tide periods when limited drainage occurs. Although such a change <b>of</b> soil <b>aeration</b> condition has been observed in previous numerical simulations, the soil saturation index provides a clear delineation <b>of</b> the <b>zones</b> that are separated by an 2 ̆ 7 inflexion point 2 ̆ 7 on the averaged index curve. The results show how the saturation index represents the effects of soil properties, tidal parameters and marsh platform elevation on marsh soil <b>aeration.</b> Simulations <b>of</b> these combined effects have not been possible with traditional tidal inundation parameters. The saturation index can be easily derived using relatively simple models based on five non-dimensional variables. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The water {{movements}} in the unsaturated zone, together with the water holding capacity of this zone, are {{very important for the}} water demand of the vegetation, {{as well as for the}} recharge of the ground water storage. A fair description of the flow in the unsaturated zone is crucial for predictions of the movement of pollutants into ground water aquifers. Unsaturated flow processes are in general complicated and difficult to describe quantitatively, since they often entail changes in the state and content of soil water during flow. The formulation and solution of unsaturated flow problems very often require the use of indirect methods of analysis, based on approximations or numerical techniques. In this paper, various discretization schemes have been presented for modelling of unsaturated flow. Subsurface formations containing water may be divided vertically into several horizontal zones according to how large a portion of the pore space is occupied by water. Essentially, we have a zone of saturation in which all the pores are completely filled with water, and an overlaying <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration</b> in which the pores contain both gases (mainly air and water vapour) and water. The latter zone is called the unsaturate...|$|E
40|$|Foiba (plural, foibe) {{is a term}} {{derived from}} the northeastern Italian karst region. The word is here {{suggested}} for use in preference to other terms referring to vertical cavities in soluble rocks. Foiba {{is defined as a}} cavity in relatively soluble rock which is natural, solutional, tends toward a cylindrical shape, and possesses walls which normally approach verticality. In laboratory experiments, limestone blocks were treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, and cavities resembling foibe were produced. Vertical walls developed only when a less soluble layer capped the limestone block or when the acid source was stationary, allowing acid to drip to the area directly below. Water analyses from foibe in central Kentucky and Missouri indicate that the water has had less residence time in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration</b> than other waters percolating through the rocks and entering the caves. In central Kentucky, foibe seem to be developed by migrating underground waterfalls held up by less soluble layers or by water moving directly down joints below less soluble layers. In Missouri, foibe are formed by joint enlargement below chert layers. Those foibe in the ceilings of caves are complicated by the enlargement of {{the lower part of the}} joints by cave streams during fluctuating water table conditions. In limestone caves of Kansas, foibe are formed in a similar manner as in Missouri. The foibe of the gypsum caves of Kansas are formed mainly on the sides of steep collapse sinkholes and lack joint control although they form beneath less soluble layers in the gypsum. Dripping water is necessary for the development of vertical walls by solution. Less soluble layers seem to be the unique feature which allows water to drip and pour into foibe. The floors of foibe are formed by less soluble layers or near the water table. If foibe intersect previously formed cave passages, no floors may develop...|$|E

Knowledge of the hydrodynamics within a fluidized bed {{on the local}} scale {{is important for the}} improvement of scale-up and process efficiencies. This knowledge is lacking due to limited observational technologies at the local scale. This paper uses X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging to describe the local time-average gas holdup differences of annular hydrodynamic structures that arise through axisymmetric annular flow in a 10. 2 [*]cm and 15. 2 [*]cm diameter cold flow fluidized bed. The aeration scheme used is similar to that provided by a porous plate and hydrodynamic results can be directly compared. Geldart type B glass bead, ground walnut shell, and crushed corncob particles were studied at various superficial gas velocities. Assuming axisymmetry, the local 3 D time-average gas holdup data acquired through X-ray CT imaging was averaged over concentric annuli, resulting in a 2 D annular and time-average gas holdup map.

40|$|The Alvord Valley Known Geothermal Resources Area (KGRA), located {{east of the}} Steens Mountain-Pueblo Mountains fault {{block in}} southeastern Oregon, is within the {{northern}} Basin and Range province. This investigation focuses on three thermal areas in the Alvord Basin: Borax Lake and the hot springs north of Borax Lake, Alvord Hot Springs and Mickey Springs. Mickey Springs and the springs north of Borax Lake are boiling at the surface (94 and 95 ° C, respectively). Inflow temperatures to Borax Lake, measured {{at a depth of}} 30 m, are greater than 100 ° C. Surface temperatures for Alvord Hot Springs and a flowing well northeast of Borax Lake are 78 and 59 ° C, respectively. Thermal fluids issue from Quaternary lacustrine and alluvial deposits. While silica sinter deposits are present at all three thermal areas, sinter is not presently being deposited. Minor calcite is being deposited at the springs north of Borax Lake. The springs discharge from N to NEstriking, high-angle, basin-bounding faults along the base of Steens Mountain and Mickey Mountain and NE-striking intrabasinal faults south of Alvord Lake. The thermal waters are dilute sodium-bicarbonate waters with significant amounts of sulfate and chloride. Conservative element plots (B, F, and Li vs. Cl) indicate good correlation between Cl and the other conservative elements. These correlations could result from mixing of thermal water with a dilute cold water or fluid evolution due to increased fluid-rock interaction, evaporation, and steam loss due to boiling. The small variations in chloride concentrations of thermal fluids during the sampling period argues against mixing of thermal fluids with cold water. The geothermal system is a hot-water rather than a vapordominated system. The ỎD content of thermal fluids is similar to the ỎD content of local cold water wells, springs, basinal pore fluids at a depth of 4 to 5 m, and perennial streams. Similarities in ỎD values indicate recharge for geothermal fluids is precipitation from the Steens Mountain fault block. The Ỏ 18 content of thermal fluids is shifted 2 to 3 °/oo {{to the right of the}} world meteoric water line indicating fluid-rock interaction at elevated temperatures in the reservoir. Tritium contents indicate relatively long residence times and/or low-velocity circulation of meteoric water through basement rocks. Values range from 0 to 0. 25 T. U. The application of two end-member models, which calculate fluid residence times, generate a minimum of 57 years and a maximum of greater than 10, 000 years. Estimated reservoir temperatures based on cation and silica geothermometry are between 170 and 200 °C. Oxygensulfate isotope geothermometer estimates indicate reservoir temperatures between 198 and 2072 ̆ 7 C for Borax Lake and Alvord Hot Springs. Mickey Springs and a flowing well northeast of Borax Lake yield temperature estimates of 168 and 150 ° C, respectively. These values indicate partial reequilibration of the isotopic system. The Ỏ 13 C contents of carbon dioxide and methane of gas discharges from the thermal areas are similar to geothermal fluids from other sites. The Ỏ 13 C of methane indicate 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 geothermal methane for Alvord Hot Springs and Mickey Springs (- 27. 8 and - 27. 6, respectively). The Ỏ 13 C of CH 4 for springs north of Borax Lake (- 33. 6) indicates a small amount of thermogenic methane may be contributed by thermal alteration of organics in basinal sediments. The Ỏ 13 C contents for C 02 at Alvord Hot Springs and Borax Lake are within the range expected for atmospheric, fumarolic, or mantle derived C 02 (- 6. 5 and - 6. 6, respectively). The Ỏ 13 C content of C 02 from Mickey Springs is isotopically lighter than gas released from fumaroles or the mantle (- 9. 4). N 2 /Ar ratios for Mickey Springs and Borax Lake gases (39. 2 and 40. 8, respectively) indicate interaction with airsaturated ground water during flow through the the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>aeration.</b> Helium is enriched relative to Ar and N 2 in gas discharges from Alvord Hot Springs, indicating longer fluid residence times and/or increased crustal interaction at high temperatures. Ratios of B/Cl indicate the fluid reservoir is hosted in volcanic rocks. The Li/Cs ratios for the Borax Lake thermal area are consistent with a reservoir located in rhyoli tic rocks. The 228 Ra/ 226 Ra content of Borax Lake thermal fluids (1. 14 ± 0. 13 dpm/kg) indicates interaction with volcanic rocks for Borax Lake. The 228 Ra/ 226 Ra content of thermal fluids from Alvord Hot Springs and Mickey Springs (0. 38 0. 02 and 0. 17 0. 09) are lower than those expected for volcanic rocks and may indicate local uranium accumulation in the reservoir or zones of upflow. The 87 Sr / 86 Sr values for thermal waters and stratigraphic uni ts indicate the fluid reservoir is located in volcanic rocks beneath Steens Basalt. Equilibration of fluids in these units argues for thermal water circulation depths of 2 to 2. 5 km in the Borax Lake thermal area, greater than 3 km in the Alvord Hot Springs area and 1 to 2 km in the Mickey Springs area. Data presented in this study do not preclude a single large deep reservoir system discharging at these three thermal areas in the Alvord basin. Differences in the chemical and isotopic composition of discharge from the three thermal areas are produced during upf low from the reservoir. During upflow, thermal waters follow a complex pathway of vertical and lateral fractures which includes short residence times in shallow reservoirs before reaching the surface.
