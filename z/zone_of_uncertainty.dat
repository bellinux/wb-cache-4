40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} receiver/data loggers for monitoring the presence/absence of radiocollared animals in discrete areas. Our primary objective was to determine how variation in transmitter signal strength affected the size of area being monitored. This information will help researchers better manage the uncertainty related to determining an animal’s location relative to a discrete boundary. We used an adjustable attenuator to measure signal strength to determine the minimum number of decibels (dB) required to eliminate detection of a radio signal by receiver/data loggers. We quantified how dB varied depending upon orientation of the transmitter on the animal and distance from receiver/data logger (radius of detection). Based upon this signal strength variation, we then calculated a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (i. e., {{the area in which}} detection of a radio signal was uncertain at a particular radius of detection).

The ability to discriminate differences in tactile stimuli, such as textures, is commonly and characteristically impaired after stroke. Assessment of tactile discrimination is cur-rently compromised by measures that are not quantitative and standardized, do not as-sess active touch sensibility, or are not suitable for use in clinical settings with stroke patients. Therefore, a test that addressed these limitations was developed. The Tac-tile Discrimination Test required subjects to discriminate differences in finely graded plastic ridged surfaces using a three-alternative forced choice design. Test-retest reli-ability, based on a sample of 35 stroke patients, was high (r = 0. 92), and changes of the magnitude of 27 percent spatial increase (PSI) can be detected with 95 percent confidence, which is sufficiently accurate for clinical monitoring.

Indeed, most research from the commercial sector suggests that this initial stage of leadership is critical to subsequent and long-term success in the same organisation. It is more than a question of credibility, though it is that at a minimum. It impacts on the confidence, actualisation and motivation of self and others.

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} people are living longer and {{projections}} indicate that {{a greater number of}} frail elders will require support from the residential aged care sector. Registered nurses are the principal health care professional with sustained oversight of residents and make many of the clinical decisions that affect the health and outcomes of care of the residents. This thesis explains the clinical decisions that registered nurses make in the New Zealand residential aged care sector. The study was undertaken using a critical realist case study framework. This case study describes the clinical decisions the registered nurses make and explains the social structures through causative factors that intersect to cause, redirect, or block the clinical decisions. The data collection methods were participant observation, interview, and document analysis in three residential care facilities. Fourteen registered nurses participated in the study. Data analysis included reasoning processes whereby patterns from the data were reviewed within current knowledge, and explanations developed. The clinical decisions represent the comprehensive nature of nursing practice in this sector. Physical and mental health, and the management of behavioural issues in the context of gerontology are significant foci of nursing frail elders. Three causative factors inherent to the social structure of residential aged care were identified that generate, redirect, or block the clinical decisions. These causative factors are: the relationships the registered nurses develop with the resident, their family, and the general practitioner, which are embedded within the registered nurse role; the specific context of the residential aged care sector in which risk aversion, financial constraints, and limited support {{for the development of the}} registered nurses prevails; and the individuality of each registered nurse whose knowledge and agency affects their concern for, and management of, the residents. This thesis presents a comprehensive explanation of the complexity of the registered nurses’ clinical decisions. It identifies that some clinical decisions reside within a zone of certainty, as the registered nurse makes the decision to act or to not act. Other clinical decisions reside within the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> as the registered nurse experiences indecision, and may ‘wait and watch’ or seek advice.

40|$|Thin rim gears need {{accurate}} {{design as}} cracks nucleated at the tooth root fillet may propagate {{in a safe}} way (through the tooth) or in catastrophic way (through the rim). Crack propagation direction is mainly influenced by both wheel geometry parameters and crack initiation point. For specific geometry configurations, crack propagation path may be influenced also by other parameters such as the centrifugal load. For this reason, in this work the effect of centrifugal load (proportional to wheel speed), related to the bending one, has been investigated. The stress field at the tooth root fillet and near the crack has been considered to evaluate the crack initiation point and to explain the propagation direction. This research activity {{has been carried out}} by means of numerical models (traditional 2 D and 3 D finite elements and extended finite elements (XFEM)).

40|$|Within a CIS environment, {{the proper}} use of {{information}} requires the identification of the uncertainty associated with it. As such, there has been a substantial amount of research dedicated to describing and quantifying spatial data uncertainty. Recent advances in sensor technology and image analysis techniques are making image-derived geospatial data increasingly popular. Along with development in sensor and image analysis technologies have come departures from conventional point-by-point measurements. Current advancements support the transition from traditional point measures to novel techniques that allow the extraction of complex objects as single entities (e. g., road outlines, buildings). As the methods of data extraction advance, so too must the methods of estimating the uncertainty associated with the data. Not only will object uncertainties be modeled, but the connections between these uncertainties will also be estimated. The current methods for determining spatial accuracy for lines and areas typically involve defining a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> around the measured line, within which the "actual " line exists with some probability.

40|$|Restriction of {{participation}} to small {{groups and the}} absence of strategies for scaling up is identified by several authors as {{one of the biggest problems}} of participatory approaches. Dissatisfaction with these limitation led to the recognition of the need for partnerships with agricultural organisations. The aim of this article is to discuss the problems and opportunities of partnership among farmers, researchers and extensionists and their organisations to promote rural development. Partnership is introduced as a specific form {{of participation}}, in which organisations are involved. Its impacts go beyond the micro social level to include the meso and the macro levels. However, in the transition from participation at the microsocial level of action to meso and macrosocial levels we can observe an increase in the problems between different actors, in which cooperation is made difficult by the power relations, competition and indirect communication through intermediaries. A participatory experience in the Brazilian state of Pará is analysed: a research project in a partnership between a research organisation and a farmers' organisation in the Transamazonian region. An assessment of the causes of conflicts among the partners revealed that the most important questions of power were related to the distribution of financial resources and the competition for prestige among farmers. A major problem, however, was the lack of clarity over the type of partnership, which may take different forms ranging from distant to close. In this case, the partnership was too close. Distance increases the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> diminishes dependence and hence reduces the power element in the relationship. On the other hand, antagonisms are especially strong in a close link between parties in which one cannot relinquish. Thus, the type of partnership in this experience was an inadequate form of achieving cooperation among the subsystems of th...|$|R
40|$|This paper employs {{data from}} {{selected}} sample survey {{areas in the}} northern Fertile Crescent to demonstrate how initial urbanization developed along several pathways. The first, during the Late Chalcolithic period, was within a dense pattern of rural settlement. There followed a profound shift in settlement pattern {{that resulted in the}} formation of large walled or ramparted sites (‘citadel cities’) associated with a more dynamic phase of urbanization exemplified by short cycles of growth and collapse. By the later third millennium BC, the distribution of larger centres had expanded to include the drier agro-pastoral zone of northern and central Syria, termed here the ‘zone of uncertainty’. This configuration, in turn, formed the context for Middle Bronze Age settlement, and the pattern of political rivalries and alliances that typified the second millennium BC. Evidence is marshalled from archaeological surveys and landscape analyses to examine these multiple paths to urbanization from the perspectives of (a) staple production within major agricultural lowlands; (b) the shift towards higher risk animal husbandry within climatically marginal regions; (c) changes in local and inter-regional networks (connectivity); and (d) ties and rights to the land. Textile production forms the core of the proposed model, which emphasizes how the demand for wool and associated pasture lands opened up new landscapes for agro-pastoral production and settlement. The resultant landscapes of settlement are then compared with the picture in the southern Levant where a more restricted <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> may have limited the opportunities for agro-pastoral production...|$|E

40|$|Syskonbädd, or “Sibling’s bed” in English, is a {{short story}} or drama, written by Swedish author Stina Aronson and {{originally}} published in 1931 under the pen name Sara Sand. While the story did not attract wide attention for many years, it has recently been republished and performed on stage, as well as aired on the radio. The plot is centered on Harriet, a woman who starts {{to see the world}} with different eyes, in a less strict and organized way. Her new view is welcomed neither by her husband nor society, and the book starts with Harriet’s escape from a “rest home”, where she has been placed by her husband in order for her to return to her old self. During the escape, Harriet meets several people, some like herself who believe that the world was meant to be different, and some who strive to maintain the social structure.   Swedish literature scholar Eva Adolfsson argues that Aronson’s later works take place in a landscape on the border of the wild, and that both the characters and the story move through such a landscape. I believe that this is also the case for Syskonbädd, one of Aronson’s earlier writings. My essay focuses on the momentum in the book, its double nature, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> that it creates and the possibilities that it presents. Based on this, my thesis is that the idea of a “sibling’s bed” solidarity is a formula that drives the book; it is the engine for all movements. With a starting point in philosopher Gilles Deleuze’s and psychoanalyst Félix Guattari’s theories about literature, philosophy and art, I follow and analyze these different movements; the lines of flight that dissolve and create chaos, as well as the plane of consistency that holds the work together and on which the chaos is visualized. These structural movements constitute my starting point for an analysis also on a hermeneutical level. Harriet escapes from society and from the norms that it enforces. At the same time, she seeks a new kind of community; a connection beyond knowledge that will allow new sensations. In this aspect, the outer movement of escape leads to another kind of motion, a static one, which may take place between people when they meet under such circumstances...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAmong {{the various}} risks {{associated}} with CO 2 storage in deep geologic formations, wells are important potential pathways for fluid leaks and groundwater contamination. Injection of CO 2 will perturb the storage reservoir and any wells that penetrate the CO 2 or pressure footprints are potential pathways for leakage of CO 2 and/or reservoir brine. Well leakage is of particular concern for regions {{with a long history}} of oil and gas exploration because they are top candidates for geologic CO 2 storage sites. This review explores in detail the ability of wells to retain their integrity against leakage with careful examination of the coupled physical and chemical processes involved. Understanding time-dependent leakage is complicated by the changes in fluid flow, solute transport, chemical reactions, and mechanical stresses over decade or longer time frames for site operations and monitoring. Almost all studies of the potential for well leakage have been laboratory based, as there are limited data on field-scale leakage. Laboratory experiments show that CO 2 and CO 2 -saturated brine still react with cement and casing when leakage occurs by diffusion only. The rate of degradation, however, is transport-limited and alteration of cement and casing properties is low. When a leakage path is already present due to cement shrinkage or fracturing, gaps along interfaces (e. g. casing/cement or cement/rock), or casing failures, chemical and mechanical alteration have the potential to decrease or increase leakage risks. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have shown that mineral precipitation or closure of strain-induced fractures can seal a leak pathway over time or conversely open pathways depending on flow-rate, chemistry, and the stress state. Experiments with steel/cement and cement/rock interfaces have indicated that protective mechanisms such as metal passivation, chemical alteration, mechanical deformation, and pore clogging can also help mitigate leakage. The specific rate and nature of alteration depend on the cement, brine, and injected fluid compositions. For example, the presence of co-injected gases (e. g. O 2, H 2 S, and SO 2) and pozzolan amendments (fly ash) to cement influences the rate and the nature of cement reactions. A more complete understanding of the coupled physical–chemical mechanisms involved with sealing and opening of leakage pathways is needed. An important challenge is to take empirically based chemical, mechanical, and transport models reviewed here and assess leakage risk for carbon storage at the field scale. Field observations that accompany laboratory and modeling studies are critical to validating understanding of leakage risk. Long-term risk at the field scale is an area of active research made difficult by the large variability of material types (cement, geologic material, casing), field conditions (pressure, temperature, gradient in potential, residence time), and leaking fluid composition (CO 2, co-injected gases, brine). Of particular interest are the circumstances when sealing and other protective mechanisms are likely to be effective, when they are likely to fail, and the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> between these two extremes...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{industry}} {{has been given a}} great deal of attention after several chemicals have shown global distribution and incidents with high toxic effects. The effects observed with some chemicals poses as a threat to both human health and to the environment, and these threats include effects on society and economy, all aspects of sustainable development. With the publication of Planetary Boundaries, by Rockstr&# 246;m et al. (2009), a new way of looking at human impact and sustainable development was presented. By dividing human impact between nine different categories, and focusing on global resilience, the reader was forced to reflect and consider whether the current human operations could continue as they have, and for how much longer. The framework within Planetary Boundaries is still not yet complete, with two categories not being quantified, Chemical Pollution being one of them. This review investigates whether a boundary for chemical pollution is possible, through a case study of one single chemical. The selected chemical is DDT, and its metabolites. By setting criteria for a chemical boundary, a suggestion for a chemical boundary for DDT was made. An extensive literature search was used to examine the possible toxic responses to different species, to further assess possible thresholds and slow variable impacts on other planetary boundary categories. Thresholds, boundary levels and additional concerns were among the results of this review. General for bird species a 16 - 18 % eggshell reduction, due to DDT exposure, was set as a boundary level indicating population decline and possible threshold impact, loss of bird species. For raptorial birds a less accurate, but indicative level of 16 ppm of DDE in eggs was set as a level with high risk of raptorial bird species loss. Fish has been given both acute and chronic tolerable exposure concentration levels of DDT. DDT levels of 0, 001 &# 181;g/L for chronic exposure for both freshwater and saltwater fish, and 1, 1 &# 181;g/L for freshwater fish and 0, 13 &# 181;g/L for saltwater fish for acute exposure. Going beyond these concentrations might cause the threshold loss of aquatic species. Additional concerns were given to insect diversity, especially the honey bees, and to humans, especially to groups with additional concerns, such as pregnant females, young children and those with HIV/AIDS. With these thresholds and other underlying theories on combined effects and population resilience, DDT was given a placement beyond safe operation, but within a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty,</b> according to the Planetary Boundary framework. A proposal for a boundary level seemed possible for DDT, using literature review as a method, but could be too extensive for several, and needs to be further discussed together with the proposed criteria for which chemicals to be included. It was difficult to define whether the current use of DDT is a threat to sustainable development, due to the presence of the historic use, and that previous use is still being investigated. It is concluded that it is likely that DDT still has the possibility to pose as an irreversible threat to the globe, depending on several factors such as climate change, the chemical cocktail, and habitat change. </p...|$|E

The need for a diagnostic tool that would improve the conventional methods in IBD diagnosis directed the search towards potential immunological markers, since an aberrant immune response against microbial or endogenous antigens in a genetically susceptible host seems to be implicated in IBD pathogenesis. The spectrum of antibodies to different microbial antigens and autoantibodies associated with IBD is rapidly expanding. Most of these antibodies are associated with CD like anti-glycan antibodies: anti-Saccharomices cerevisiae (ASCA) and the recently described anti-laminaribioside (ALCA), anti-chitobioside (ACCA), anti-mannobioside (AMCA), anti-laminarin (anti-L) and anti-chitin (anti-C) antibodies; {{in addition to other}} antibodies that target microbial antigens: anti-outer membrane porin C (anti-OmpC), anti-Cbir 1 flagellin and anti-I 2 antibody. Also, autoantibodies targeting the exocrine pancreas (PAB) were shown to be highly specific for CD. In contrast, UC has been associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (pANCA) and antibodies against goblet cells (GAB). Current evidence suggests that serologic panels of multiple antibodies are useful in differential diagnosis of CD versus UC and can be a valuable aid in stratifying patients according to disease phenotype and risk of complications...|$|R

For many important artists coastal space has figured as a site from which to braid ideas of empire, nation, region, and archipelago. They have been drawn to the coast as a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> geographical <b>uncertainty</b> in which the self-definitions of the nation founder; they have been drawn to it as a peripheral space of vestigial wildness, of island retreats and experimental living; as a network of diverse localities richly endowed with distinctive forms of cultural heritage; and as a dynamically interconnected ecosystem, which {{is at the same time}} the historic site of significant developments in fieldwork and natural science. This collection situates these cultures of the Atlantic edge in a series of essays that create new contexts for coastal study in literary history and criticism. The contributors frame their research in response to emerging conversations in archipelagic criticism, the blue humanities, and island studies, the essays challenging the reader to reconsider ideas of margin, periphery and exchange. These twelve case studies establish the coast as a crucial location in the imaginative history of Britain, Ireland and the north Atlantic edge. Coastal Works will appeal to readers of literature and history with an interest in the sea, the environment, and the archipelago from the 18 th century to the present. Accessible, innovative and provocative, Coastal Works establishes the important role that the coast plays in our cultural imaginary and suggests a range of methodologies to represent relationships between land, sea, and cultural work...|$|R
40|$|The problem <b>of</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in {{input-output}} coefficients is examined, {{using the}} uncertainty in estimating the fertilizer use efficiency as an illustration. An example <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> {{due to lack}} of knowledge on processes involved is the use of different approaches for estimating fertilizer use efficiency in two land use optimization studies. A further problem is uncertainty {{due to lack of}} data; this is illustrated with an example from the Atlantic <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Costa Rica. Very few data are available to determine fertilizer use efficiency and data from regions with similar soil and climate type are not available. Data from non-similar regions may not give a correct assessment of the possibilities in the region. Different concepts and sources of information result in different estimates of coefficients, which might in turn greatly influence the results of the linear programming model. It is therefore concluded that, rather than using one fixed value for a particular input-output coefficient, the effect <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in coefficients on the final results of the model should be examined...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainty in parameters, {{which are}} assumed to be known and do not change their values during the course of {{deterministic}} optimization, can have a great impact on the outcome of an optimization study. Investigations on the development and application of optimization approaches that can accommodate such kind <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in parameters during the course of optimization are, therefore, necessitated. Expected value model (EVM) is one such method which converts the uncertain optimization formulation into a deterministic problem using expected values of the objective functions and constraints based on fuzzy credibility theory. In this work, an industrial grinding model has been adopted under the credibility theory based fuzzy framework to handle several uncertain parameters and shown how the presence <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> leads to an operating <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> varied risk appetite of a decision maker by defining the entire frontier of the uncertain solution regio...|$|R

Groundwater contamination caused by agricultural fertilization {{is a widely}} recognized problem. In Hawaii, nitrogen fertilization from pineapple and sugarcane fields has posed a threat to several basal aquifers and has been implicated in coastal algae blooms. The concentration of nitrate-N in the Pearl Harbor basin {{on the island of}} Oahu was below 2. 3 mg/L in the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s, and has increased to as much as 7. 6 mg/L in 1992 to 1994. The objective of this dissertation research is to develop a practical methodology for realistically estimating nitrate leaching from fertilized agricultural lands. Numerous mechanisms have impact on the distribution and migration of nitrate in the soil. Nitrogen fertilizer undergoes many N transformations and interactions with the soil and the plant after applications. In this study, an analysis of soil samples was performed to understand the leaching process of nitrate in the root <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> three different cropped fields in Hawaii. A detailed discussion is given to address various factors which control the nitrate transport process. To judge the sampling plan in relation to spatial variation, the field measurements were evaluated statistically by an uncertainty index, which is represented as the density of samples required for the estimate of sample mean of the nitrate concentration to fall within a defined limit of accuracy. In order to predict the effect of nitrogen fertilization on the groundwater contamination with very limited input data, a simple, analytical, lumped parameter model (LPM), was developed. The model can estimate the average nitrate leaching from the root zone in response to agricultural practices, N transformations and other related processes. The model was tested against the field data and two detailed numerical models, LEACHM-N and CERES-Maize. It provides an alternative way to assess nitrate leaching from the root zone with acceptable accuracy. A listing of the program is provided in Appendix 2. Owing to the complex nature of nitrogen behavior in the unsaturated <b>zone,</b> some degree <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is involved in the development of modeling approaches. In this study, five major sources <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> were identified. These are: uncertainty due to spatial variation, uncertainty related to the accuracy of the input data, uncertainty due to simplifications in the development <b>of</b> the models, <b>uncertainty</b> due to the modeling parameters, and uncertainty due to the complexity <b>of</b> the unsaturated <b>zone</b> in Hawaii. The impact <b>of</b> these <b>uncertainties</b> on simulation results is evaluated. Water Resources Research Center, University of Hawaii at Mano...|$|R

Efforts {{aimed at improving}} mathematics learning for all students have tended to adopt a deficit-oriented perspective focusing on race-gap analysis or other social identifiers like socioeconomic status, SES, (Domina, et al. 2014; Loveless, 2008). This tendency {{is contrary to the}} view by situated learning theorists who consider learning as a process of becoming a member of a certain community of practice (Wenger, 1998). Doing well or not in a mathematics classroom, according to situated learning theorists, depends {{on the extent to which}} students identify with classroom norms (Boaler, 2002 a, Cobb et al., 2009, Wood, 2013). Learning of mathematics involves students developing mathematical identities influenced by the classroom norms. This study examined the influence of an out-of-school mathematics mentoring and tutoring program known as Prepare 2 Nspire (P 2 N) on 12 high school students’ mathematical identities which served predominantly minority students from first generation, low SES families. This was accomplished by examining the mathematical identities of high school students’ prior to and after participating in P 2 N. A mixed methods design was used. Additionally, in order to provide a richer analysis of the influence of P 2 N on high school students’ mathematical identities, two interpretive frameworks by Cobb et al. (2009) and Nasir and Cooks (2009) were used. Results from this study indicate that less participatory pedagogies lead to high school students identifying themselves in three <b>zones</b> namely, <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> inclusion, <b>uncertainty,</b> and exclusion. Overall, results from this study indicate that mathematical identities are not fixed but fluid and that depending on the kind of pedagogy students can move across various zones. Whether high school students identify themselves with math or not depends on the kind of mathematical pedagogy and access to practice-linked identity resources...|$|R
