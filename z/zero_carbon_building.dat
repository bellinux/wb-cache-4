Most existing studies on design optimization of {{net zero energy building}} (nZEB) are conducted based on deterministic data/information.

This study, therefore, proposed a robust design method for sizing renewable energy systems in nZEB concerning uncertainties in renewable resources and demand load.

40|$|The <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>building</b> (ZCB) {{approach}} is innovative in reducing buildings’ energy consumption and carbon emissions, {{with hundreds of}} ‘zero carbon’ or ‘zero energy’ projects reported worldwide. However, {{very few of them}} are of 10 storeys or above. There is perception that high-rise ZCB is a myth. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a novel sociotechnical framework of design strategies for realising high-rise ZCBs. Through an onerous literature review, only two papers were found to have examined zero energy design strategies for high-rises, rendering a significant gap in knowledge. Also, the lack of a common definition of high-rise ZCBs and the energy/carbon scope hampers the uptake of ZCB design strategies. Another deficiency in literature is the ignorance of the interdependence among possible design strategies. The paper thus develops a socio-technical framework of design strategies, which integrates both technical and social aspects. The technical aspects are: 1) improving energy efficiency; 2) adopting on and off-site renewable energy technologies; and 3) installing carbon offsetting systems. The social perspective should be addressed from the chain of the innovation, diffusion, adoption and implementation of these technologies as well as through engaging the key stakeholders...|$|E

The analysis is structured in three levels and its applicability is showcased through an industry-sourced example of a supermarket building. The first level aims to classify building emissions according to their sources namely electricity consumption, on-site fuel burning, water supply, transport operations and waste management & disposal. The developed carbon fields' analysis technique treats a commercial building as an on-going energy consuming system where different operations (e. g. transport activities) contribute to the building's commercial use as well as to its operational carbon footprint. In the second level, the study compares a food store's carbon footprint across different supply and operation scenarios in order to analyse how each sector can influence emissions. In the third stage, the research details the carbon off-setting achieved by installing a bioenergy combined heat and power (CHP) unit in its premises and thus achieving net <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> performance. Results illustrate the environmental benefits for different CHP capacity solutions. These results show how urban cogeneration plants can de-carbonise UK buildings. However, the UK carbon accounting framework is still evolving and therefore is constantly subject to regulatory changes. Consequently, business stakeholders need to be periodically updated with carbon regulation if they wish to design, manage and sustain <b>zero</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
