Doxorubicin is the precursor to valrubicin (Valstar), myocet, and pirarubicin. Daunorubicin is the precursor to idarubicin (Idamycin), epirubicin (Ellence), and <b>zorubicin.</b>|$|E

Prophylaxis of disseminated intra-vascular coagulation {{was made by}} platelet transfu-sions and heparin. In case of leukemic resistance, patients received a second course with 2 days of rubidazone (arm A) or Amsa (arm B) and 3 days of Ara C. Patients who achieved complete remission (CR) received three consolidation courses with the two drugs used for induction and maintenance therapy for 3 years.

30|$|The {{anthracycline}} antibiotics {{have gathered}} {{attention of the}} chemists due to their outstanding antibacterial and antitumor activities (Hortobagyi 1997). Rhodomycin was the first anthracycline compound identified by H. Brockmann in 1963 (Brockmann & Bauer 1950). Since then {{many members of the}} anthracycline family have been discovered with a broad spectrum of activity. These include daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, <b>zorubicin</b> and aclacinomycin A, all of which are obtained from Streptomyces sp. The clinical use of these drugs, however has been hampered by a number of undesirable side effects, the most serious being the dose related cardiotoxicity (Jones 1993; Rahman et al. 2007). There is therefore, a great interest in related natural or synthetic compounds having improved therapeutic indices. Many efforts have been made to modify the anthracycline molecule with the objective of developing analogues with a wider spectrum of activity and reduced toxicity (Taatjes et al. 1996;Gianni et al. 2008). Also efforts have been directed towards obtaining hybrid anthracyclines with less toxicity. However, the complexity of the structure and biosynthetic pathway of anthracyclines have posed difficulties in these efforts (Jansson et al. 2003).|$|E
