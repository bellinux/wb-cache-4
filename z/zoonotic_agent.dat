40|$|Zoonoses are {{infectious}} diseases {{that can be}} transmitted from animals to humans. Some of the more relevant causes of these {{infectious diseases}} include Salmonella and Campylobac-ter which can be transmitted by foods such as poultry or pork. Zoonoses are a worldwide problem. In 2009 an annual country-wide zoonoses and resistance monitoring plan com-menced in order to collect information regarding the extent of contamination of livestock and food with <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents</b> in Germany. The legal basis {{of this is the}} general administrative regulation on zoonoses in the food chain (AVV Zoonosen Lebensmittelkette) of 18 July 2008. The AVV is based on Directive 2003 / 99 /EC on the monitoring of zoonoses and <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents.</b> According to this, EU Member States are obligated to collect, evaluate and publish data on the emergence of zoonoses and their agents as well as related antibiotic resistances in food, feed and live animals. The AVV Zoonosen Lebensmittelkette stipulates that data are collected by the federal Länder as part of the official control of foodstuffs and livestock according to a representative sam-pling scheme agreed upon by the Government and the Länder. The following BfR Opinion reports on the scientific assessment of the resistance monitoring analysis results in light of consumer health protection. Infections with <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents</b> in humans may require to be treated with antibiotics. Fur-thermore, the resistance of intestinal bacteria and contaminants can be transmitted to other bacteria, which can potentially lead to illness in humans. Thus, the control of bacterial resis-tance to antibiotics is quite relevant for human and animal health.

40|$|Zoonoses {{are those}} {{diseases}} and infections which are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man.

40|$|Fecal wastes from {{a variety}} of farmed {{livestock}} were inoculated with livestock isolates of Escherichia coli O 157, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts at levels representative of the levels found in naturally contaminated wastes. The wastes were subsequently spread onto a grass pasture, and the decline of each of the <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents</b> was monitored over time. There were no significant differences among the decimal reduction times for the bacterial pathogens. The mean bacterial decimal reduction time was 1. 94 days. A range of times between 8 and 31 days for a 1 -log reduction in C. parvum levels was obtained, demonstrating that the protozoans were significantly more hardy than the bacteria. Oocyst recovery was more efficient from wastes with lower dry matter contents. The levels of most of the <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents</b> had declined to below detectable levels by 64 days. However, for some waste types, 128 days was required for the complete decline of L. monocytogenes levels. We were unable to find significant differences between the rates of pathogen decline in liquid (slurry) and solid (farmyard manure) wastes, although concerns have been raised that increased slurry generation as a consequence of more intensive farming practices could lead to increased survival of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents</b> in the environment.

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of this paper, food-borne zoonoses are defined as infections and diseases that are transmissible between animals and humans via foodstuffs. The above definition encompasses not only zoonoses caused by bacterial <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents,</b> but also parasites and prions. Viruses can be transmitted between humans via foodstuffs, but are not considered here mainly because current knowledge about their importance as food-borne <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agents</b> is limited. 2 Public health importance One of the most important public health problems associated with foodstuffs, resulting in millions of cases of human diseases annually. In 2007, over 200, 000 reported confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis and over 150, 000 cases of salmonellosis in the EU. Severity of zoonotic diseases can vary from mild gastrointestinal symptoms to acute renal failure, chronic debilitating diseases (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome), abortion & death.

40|$|We {{generated}} by allelic replacement a dltA mutant of a virulent Streptococcus suis serotype 2 field strain and evaluated {{the contribution of}} lipoteichoic acid (LTA) D-alanylation to the virulence traits of this swine pathogen and <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agent.</b> The absence of LTA D-alanylation resulted in increased susceptibility to the action of cationic antimicrobial peptides. In addition, and {{in contrast to the}} wild-type strain, the dltA mutant was efficiently killed by porcine neutrophils and showed diminished adherence to and invasion of porcine brain microvascular endo-thelial cells. Finally, thedltAmutant was attenuated in both the CD 1 mouse and porcine models of infection, probably reflecting a decreased ability to escape immune clearance mechanisms and an impaired capacity to move across host barriers. The {{results of this study suggest}} that LTA D-alanylation is an important factor in S. suis virulence. Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and a <b>zoonotic</b> <b>agent</b> that is responsible for, among other diseases, meningitis and septicemia (15). In swine, S. suis causes severe losses to the industry (15), while human S. suis infection is emerging as an important public health issue (13).
