The data is available as zip files in tab-separated value format using a CSV extension for easy import into Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet software. Data from 1979 to 2005 {{is available in}} the form of one zip file per year, with the file size gradually increased infrom 14.3 MB in 1979 to 125.9 MB in 2005, reflecting {{the increase in the number}} of news media and the frequency and comprehensiveness of event recording. Data files from January 2006 to March 2013 are available at monthly granularity, with the <b>zipped</b> <b>file</b> size rising from 11 MB in January 2006 to 103.2 MB in March 2013. Data files from April 1, 2013 onward are available at a daily granularity. The data file for each date is made available by 6 AM Eastern Standard Time the next day. As of June 2014, the size of the daily <b>zipped</b> <b>file</b> is about 5-12 MB. The data files use Conflict and Mediation Event Observations (CAMEO) coding for recording events.|$|E
5000|$|A {{directory}} {{is placed}} {{at the end of}} a [...]ZIP file. This identifies what files are in the [...]ZIP and identifies where in the [...]ZIP that file is located. This allows [...]ZIP readers to load the list of files without reading the entire [...]ZIP archive[...]ZIP archives can also include extra data that is not related to the [...]ZIP archive. This allows for a [...]ZIP archive to be made into a self-extracting archive (application that decompresses its contained data), by prepending the program code to a [...]ZIP archive and marking the file as executable. Storing the catalog at the end also makes possible hiding a <b>zipped</b> <b>file</b> by appending it to an innocuous file, such as a GIF image file.|$|E

One complex {{system from the}} early 20 th century {{in the history of}} geography is the development, by Walter Christaller, of a theory of settlement locations: central place theory. The communication of his ideas is in the printed format of the times. There are black and white maps of complex systems of pattern; they tell one story. What might they look like, however, when recast using contemporary capability? How might this capability expand the research frontier? This sequence of images and text examines a single map of Christaller, from a 1941 document, and brings it into the virtual reality of Google Earth¬Æ. When the reader downloads the <b>zipped</b> <b>file,</b> the power of the Internet is harnessed to permit him/her to replicate the results of the article while reading it and to experiment with related ideas at the same time.
