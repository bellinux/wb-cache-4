30|$|The {{range of}} {{variation}} in the conceptual meaning of scaffolding normally results in a state <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> in the operational definition of what really constitutes it in the SLA research and practice. Reviewing these definitions, we have found three contentious points that have been foregrounded above all else. These points are summarized as (1) {{the status of the}} prompter and receptor of scaffolding; (2) the inability <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> language production; and (3) the temporary state of support.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{confusing}} similarity namely, <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> goods and <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> business or origin. Determination <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> goods necessitates the application of either the dominancy or the holistic test. The tests involved in determining likelihood <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> origin are separate and distinct from the tests in determining <b>confusion</b> <b>of</b> goods.|$|R
50|$|In photography, {{the circle}} <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> (CoC) {{is used to}} {{determine}} the depth of field, the part of an image that is acceptably sharp. A standard value of CoC is often associated with each image format, but the most appropriate value depends on visual acuity, viewing conditions, and the amount of enlargement. Usages in context include maximum permissible circle <b>of</b> <b>confusion,</b> circle <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> diameter limit, and the circle <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> criterion.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{experiment}} {{to evaluate the}} role <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> in explaining the dynamics of contributions in public goods experiments. In a learning condition we keep the subjects confused by withholding the information that would be necessary for them to understand the game. The comparison of the results with those of a standard public goods treatment provides a lower bound for the in°uence <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> on contribution dynamics. We ¯nd that learning in the state <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> explains 41 percent of the contribution dynamics in the standard public goods game. This result complements that of Houser and Kurzban (2002) who found {{that all of the}} decrease in contributions {{can be attributed to the}} reduction <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> We argue that their ¯ndings can be seen as an upper bound for the inluence <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> Ralph-C Bayer, Elke Renner and Rupert Sausgruber[URL]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} notion <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> {{as it applies}} to the design of {{intelligent}} machines and suggests that it arises from the social nature of knowledge. It provides a framework for analysing the causes <b>of</b> <b>confusion</b> and shows how confusion normally reveals itself after the cause <b>of</b> the <b>confusion</b> has occurred. This places practical limitations on how intelligent machines can react to confusion when it is noticed.

Back-ground flux from the Solar System’s zodiacal dust and the exozodiacal dust in the target system {{is likely to be}} the largest source of astrophysical noise in direct observations of terrestrial plan-ets in the habitable <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> nearby stars. Furthermore, dust structures like clumps, thought to be produced by dynamical interactions with exoplanets, are a possible source <b>of</b> <b>confusion.</b> In this paper, we qualitatively assess the primary impact of exozodical dust on high-contrast direct imaging at optical wavelengths, such as would be performed with a coronagraph. Then we present the sensitivity of previous, current, and near-term facilities to thermal emission from debris dust at all distances from nearby solar-type stars, as well as our current knowledge of dust levels from recent surveys. Finally, we address the other method of detecting debris dust, through high-contrast imaging in scattered light. This method is currently far less sensitiv...|$|R
