5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} <b>zooming</b> in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|After having {{positioned}} {{to perform a}} visual inspection, the robot performs an acquisition with a pan-tilt-zoom camera. Several steps take place: pointing the camera, sensing the element to be inspected, if needed repointing and <b>zooming</b> with the camera, image acquisition and inspection. Image analysis is used on doors {{to determine whether they}} are open or closed; on {{the presence or absence of}} protection for certain equipment; the state of turbofan blades or the wear of landing gear tires.|$|E
5|$|Scene7 is an American {{software}} company that provides document hosting and interactive publishing {{services such as}} online catalogs, targeted email, video, and image management. Retailers use the company's services to showcase products on their websites and to allow customers to manipulate product images by <b>zooming</b> in and rotating products, simulating the inspection of merchandise in retail stores.|$|E

50|$|Nowadays cameras {{usually have}} iZoom (intelligent <b>zoom)</b> with usually {{additional}} magnification 2x of its optical <b>zoom,</b> but some cameras have 2 options: 1.4x and 2.0x. The iZoom use only {{center of the}} lens and not make any interpolation to original full resolution, so it save its good images quality (optical <b>zoom)</b> in reduced resolution. The terms among camera manufacturers are “Smart Zoom” (Sony), “Safe Zoom” (Canon) and “Intelligent Zoom” (Panasonic and others). There is also camera with digital <b>zoom</b> 7.2x and smartzoom with approximately 30x total <b>zoom</b> (optical <b>zoom</b> 20x and digital <b>zoom</b> 1.5x) for 7MP from 16MP total resolution and also 144x total <b>zoom</b> (optical <b>zoom</b> 20x and digital <b>zoom</b> 7.2x) for VGA 640x480.|$|R

5|$|The big {{dance was}} the film's most {{sustained}} and elaborate sequence, so two cameras were used, with frequent recourse to hand-holding and telephoto <b>zooming</b> in order both {{to sustain the}} documentary-style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers, who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera <b>zooming</b> into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, <b>zooming</b> out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
50|$|Modest camera phones {{use only}} digital <b>zoom</b> {{and have no}} optical <b>zoom</b> at all. Usually cameras have an optical <b>zoom</b> lens, but apply digital <b>zoom</b> {{automatically}} once its longest optical focal length has been reached.

50|$|<b>Zoom</b> ring: This {{control is}} found on most EF <b>zoom</b> lenses. It {{is used for}} {{changing}} the focal length of the lens. The <b>zoom</b> ring usually has certain, common, focal lengths marked on it. To set the <b>zoom</b> ring to any given focal length, one must turn the ring so that the marked focal length matches the <b>zoom</b> index. The <b>zoom</b> index is typically a white, or black, line found next to the <b>zoom</b> ring.|$|R

5|$|The video cuts {{between two}} narratives. In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, are sitting around a campfire, preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person takes a sip, they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid <b>zooming.</b> As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a small {{microscopic}} organism-like figure, eventually <b>zooming</b> out on an animated woman. Dancing in the wind, the opening chorus has the woman gliding through a vast field of clouds, often flying {{in front of the}} sun. A strong force field follows her as she is about to land onto buildings, but intercuts into Utada walking through digitized clouds. The camera then changes positions, aimed towards the singer, and showcases her walking through a large grand hall with purple colored Kachina's in cloaks, hitting drums to the songs beat. She walks into a large cathedral-like infrastructure and summons numerous pink kachina's dancing to the tune.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} verse, {{it has the}} {{spacecraft}} traveling past the moon, whilst Utada cleans up the mess the passengers left on their tables. By the second pre-chorus, several passengers play ping pong, as Utada exercises. The second chorus has Utada dancing inside a party, whilst intercut scenes of different stop motion animations are seen. In the bridge section, it has a close-up of Utada {{in front of a}} forest-like backdrop again, and also has Utada sitting on a swing. The final chorus has the spacecraft falling onto the ground, and creates a vast field of flowers, trees, and grass. The final scene has the camera <b>zooming</b> out of the spacecraft next to a tree, riddled with vines and flowers. The music video and the behind the scenes video was included on her DVD compilation Single Clip Collection Vol. 3 (2000).|$|E
50|$|The DX series {{cameras were}} the first EasyShare models released. It was {{originally}} a very basic point and shoot camera series, compatible with the original EasyShare Camera Dock. The CX series eventually replaced the lower-end DX models, and the newer DX-Series models had more advanced features and higher megapixel resolution and <b>zoom</b> features. The DX series is now discontinued; the higher-end DX Series models eventually became the Z-Series. Models in the DX series were the last Kodak consumer digital cameras to use CompactFlash external memory cards. Models include the DX3215, DX3500(2.2 mp, 38 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX3600 (2.2 mp, 35-70mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX3900 (3.3 mp, 35-70 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX4330 (3.1 mp, 38-114 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak EasyShare DX4530(5.2 mp, 38-114mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX4900 (4.1 mp, 35-70mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak EasyShare DX6440 (4.23 mp, 33-132 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak EasyShare DX6490 (4.23 mp, 38-380 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), DX7440 (4.0 mp, 33-132 mm <b>zoom</b> lens), Kodak <b>Zoom</b> Digital Camera DX7590 (5.0 mp, 38-380 mm <b>zoom</b> lens) and the DX7630 (6.2 mp, 39-117 mm <b>zoom</b> lens).|$|R

5|$|That night, FBI agents wait at {{the concert}} hall for Barnett's arrival. Barnett, who goes {{completely}} unseen due to his youthful appearance, poses as a piano tuner. He shoots Scully in the chest during the recital and then flees, taking the cellist hostage. Mulder doesn't hesitate this time around and fires at Barnett, fatally wounding him. Scully is revealed to have survived the attack, having worn a bullet-proof vest. Despite the efforts of doctors and a mysterious CIA agent to resuscitate Barnett, he dies, and takes the secrets of Ridley's research to the grave. The episode ends with the camera <b>zooming</b> in on locker number 935 in a train station, implying the secrets along with Barnett's precaution, a bomb, are contained within and one day will be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} panning view of a fence and people with {{umbrellas}} on the left, eventually <b>zooming</b> out on an audience looking through it in the rain. Both Volkova and Katina are then shown singing to the track in Catholic school uniforms. Throughout {{the majority of the}} visual, the girls are featured performing erratic behaviour, which includes them banging against a fence, yelling for help towards the audience, and occasionally laughing at them. While continuing to sing to each other during the second chorus, they subsequently start to kiss, and the audience slightly stares at their actions. Following this, several members of the public start to talk to each other, whilst a shot with the camera looking up Volkova's skirt and exposing her underwear is shown during the process.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the third-person {{perspective}} in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore {{in the home}} consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase {{which leads to the}} room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and <b>zooming.</b> To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent {{back to the beginning of}} the current loop.|$|E

5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It was easy to fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of <b>zooming</b> upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and <b>zooming</b> in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts <b>zooming</b> backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E

5|$|A {{more recent}} {{critical}} review of contemporary sources doesn't require a supposed typo in 1771 {{to explain this}} shorter measurement for the mizzen whilst {{at the same time}} offers supporting evidence of its cap being at the taller supposed normal height. Sydney Parkinson's sketches and paintings of Cooks Bark Endeavour along with the 1771 Woolwich Yard Bark Endeavour spar measurements National Maritime Museum in Greenwich NMM ZAZ6594, and other contemporary sources suggest that the shorter mizzen mast was not stepped in the hold/keelson, but instead was stepped in the lower deck 10ft above this as was sometimes done. This would bring its standing height at the cap to within a supposed normal height of around 8– 9ft below the main mast cap and approx 5.5ft below the foremast cap when comparing the heights of the standing mast tops (excludes top and gallant masts) from the level of the water line. Whereas the shorter mizzen stepped in the hold on the keelson instead of the lower deck would make the standing mizzen cap 18ft below the main mast cap which is clearly not the case when critically examining Sydney Parkinson's drawings and the contemporary painting titled HMS Endeavour off the coast of New Holland, by Samuel Atkins c. 1794 {{at the top of this}} page. <b>Zooming</b> this painting also reveals that the position of the mizzen channel is forward to inline with the mast which it is when looking at the angle of the mizzen chainplates on the original as fitted draught NMM ZAZ7844. Using these mizzen chainplate angles from this as fitted draught it is possible to extrapolate where the top of the standing mast could be and combined with the similar shroud angles Sydney Parkinson drew in his sketch of the larboard quarter of Endeavour support this theory of the shorter standing mizzen stepped in the lower deck which would make its standing cap 10 foot higher than if stepped in the hold.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, <b>zooming</b> out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E

3000|$|... “Zoom in/out” {{feature is}} used by a user to interactively select a location. Intuitively, an {{attacker}} may need to explore more before selecting a location.

User performance {{and the number of}} <b>zoom</b> in was found to be negatively correlated for legitimate and adversarial users. In other words, users who <b>zoomed</b> in more were less likely to answer correctly, which was expected. This could be due to the fact that, if a user is not sure about his/her answer, he/she is more likely to perform more <b>zoom</b> in on the map.
