25|$|Biotechnology is the {{application}} of scientific and engineering principles to the processing of materials by biological agents to provide goods and services. From its inception, biotechnology has maintained {{a close relationship with}} society. Although now most often associated with the development of drugs, historically biotechnology has been principally associated with food, addressing such issues as malnutrition and famine. The history of biotechnology begins with <b>zymotechnology,</b> which commenced with a focus on brewing techniques for beer. By World War I, however, <b>zymotechnology</b> would expand to tackle larger industrial issues, and the potential of industrial fermentation gave rise to biotechnology. However, both the single-cell protein and gasohol projects failed to progress due to varying issues including public resistance, a changing economic scene, and shifts in political power.|$|E
25|$|Biotechnology {{arose from}} the field of <b>zymotechnology</b> or zymurgy, which began as a search for a better {{understanding}} of industrial fermentation, particularly beer. Beer was an important industrial, and not just social, commodity. In late 19th-century Germany, brewing contributed as much to the gross national product as steel, and taxes on alcohol proved to be significant sources of revenue to the government. In the 1860s, institutes and remunerative consultancies were dedicated to the technology of brewing. The most famous was the private Carlsberg Institute, founded in 1875, which employed Emil Christian Hansen, who pioneered the pure yeast process for the reliable production of consistent beer. Less well known were private consultancies that advised the brewing industry. One of these, the Zymotechnic Institute, was established in Chicago by the German-born chemist John Ewald Siebel.|$|E
