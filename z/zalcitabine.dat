50|$|<b>Zalcitabine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in the 1960s by Jerome Horwitz and subsequently developed as an anti-HIV agent by Samuel Broder, Hiroaki Mitsuya, and Robert Yarchoan at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Like didanosine, {{it was then}} licensed because the NCI may not market or sell drugs. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) thus licensed it to Hoffmann-La Roche.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, while {{conducting}} {{research for the}} Karmanos Institute, Horwitz synthesized a compound that was to become known as zidovudine (AZT) - an antiviral drug used to treat HIV patients; Zidovudine was initially developed {{as a treatment for}} cancer. Horwitz was also first to synthesize stavudine (d4T) and <b>zalcitabine</b> (ddC) - two other reverse transcriptase inhibitors used in the treatment of HIV patients.|$|E
50|$|It is {{phosphorylated}} in T {{cells and}} other HIV target cells into its active triphosphate form, ddCTP. This active metabolite {{works as a}} substrate for HIV reverse transcriptase, and also by incorporation into the viral DNA, hence terminating the chain elongation due to the missing hydroxyl group. Since <b>zalcitabine</b> is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor it possesses activity only against retroviruses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zalcitabine</b> was {{the third}} {{antiretroviral}} {{to be approved by}} the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It was approved on June 19, 1992 as a monotherapy and again in 1996 for use in combination with zidovudine (AZT). Using combinations of NRTIs was in practice prior to the second FDA approval and the triple drug combinations with dual NRTIs and a protease inhibitor (PI) were not far off by this time.|$|E
50|$|Mitsuya {{was born}} in Sasebo, Nagasaki and {{received}} his M.D. and Ph.D. from Kumamoto University. He joined the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, in 1982, working initially on Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 before switching his attention to HIV. His identification of AZT as an anti-HIV drug, {{as well as the}} anti-HIV properties of didanosine and <b>zalcitabine,</b> was made in 1985. He was appointed Professor of Hematology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology at Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical And Pharmaceutical Sciences.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with his}} colleagues Drs. Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), he co-developed the first {{effective}} treatments for HIV/AIDS. With his colleagues, he conducted the first clinical trials of zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), <b>zalcitabine</b> (ddC), and lamivudine (3TC). These trials {{were the first}} to demonstrate that administration of anti-retroviral drugs could reverse the declines in CD4 cells and immunologic impairment caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Dr. Yarchoan also conducted the first trials of combination anti-HIV therapy.|$|E
5000|$|... 2´,3´-dideoxyinosine or {{didanosine}} {{is converted}} into dideoxyadenosine in vivo. Its development {{has a long}} history. In 1964 dideoxyadenosine, the corresponding adenosine analogue of <b>zalcitabine</b> was synthesised. Dideoxyadenosine caused kidney damage so didanosine was prepared from dideoxyadenosine by enzymatic oxidation (see table 1). It {{was found to be}} active against HIV without causing kidney damage. Didanosine was approved by the FDA for the treatmentof HIV-1 in October 1991.Zalcitabine and didanosine are both obligate chain terminators, that have been developed for anti-HIV treatment. Unfortunately, both drugs lack selectivity and therefore cause side-effects.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} years of the AIDS epidemic, he co-developed {{zidovudine}} (AZT), didanosine (ddI), and <b>zalcitabine</b> (ddC), which were the first effective drugs licensed for the treatment of AIDS. In 1989, he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to be Director of the NCI. In this position he oversaw the development of a number of new therapies for cancer including paclitaxel (Taxol). After leaving the NCI, Dr. Broder became Senior Vice President for Research and Development at the IVAX Corporation in Florida, a position he held until 1998 when he joined Celera Genomics. He is now Chief Medical Officer of Celera.|$|E
5000|$|... of {{lamivudine}} can {{be traced}} back to the mid-1970s while Bernard Belleau was investigating sugar derivatives. Lamivudine was developed as the sulfur analogue of <b>zalcitabine</b> (see table 2). It was initially synthesized as a racemic mixture (BCH-189) and analysis showed that both positive and negative enantiomers of BCH-189 (2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine) had in vitro activity against HIV. Lamivudine is the negative enantiomer and is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue. The 3' carbon of the ribose ring of 2'-deoxycytidine has been replaced by a sulfur atom because it had greater anti-HIV activity and is less toxic than the positive enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|Certain drugs {{require an}} acid stomach pH for absorption. Others require the basic pH of the intestines. Any {{modification}} in the pH could change this absorption. In {{the case of}} the antacids, an increase in pH can inhibit the absorption of other drugs such as <b>zalcitabine</b> (absorption can be decreased by 25%), tipranavir (25%) and amprenavir (up to 35%). However, this occurs less often than an increase in pH causes an increase in absorption. Such as occurs when cimetidine is taken with didanosine. In this case a gap of two to four hours between taking the two drugs is usually sufficient to avoid the interaction.|$|E
5000|$|Nucleoside analogs are a {{class of}} {{antiviral}} drugs that work by inhibiting viral nucleic acid synthesis. The nucleoside analogs acyclovir (ACV), zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), <b>zalcitabine</b> (ddC), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), trifluridine, cidofovir, adefovir, and tenofovir (TDF) [...] are substrates of the OAT1 transporter. This may result in the buildup of these drugs in the proximal tubule cells. At high concentrations, these drugs inhibit DNA replication. This, in turn, may impair the function of these cells and may {{be the cause of}} antiviral induced Fanconi syndrome. The use of stavudine, didenosine, abacavir, adefovir, cidofovir [...] and tenofovir has been associated with Fanconi syndrome. Clinical features of tenofovir-induced Fanconi syndrome include glycosuria in the setting of normal serum glucose levels, phosphate wasting with hypophosphatemia, proteinuria (usually mild), acidosis, and hypokalemia, with or without acute renal failure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1981 the {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first reported. Two years later the etiological link to AIDS, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was identified. Since the identification of HIV the development of effective antiretroviral drugs and the scientific achievements in HIV research has been enormous. Antiretroviral drugs {{for the treatment of}} HIV infections belong to six categories: Nucleoside and nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, entry inhibitors, co-receptor inhibitors and integrase inhibitors. The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 has been the main foundation for the development of anti-HIV drugs. The first nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor with in vitro anti-HIV activity was zidovudine. Since zidovudine was approved in 1987, six nucleosides and one nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) have been approved by FDA. NRTIs approved by the FDA are zidovudine, didanosine, <b>zalcitabine,</b> stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir and emtricitabine and the only nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) approved is tenofovir (see table 4).|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{mechanisms}} of NRTI resistance. The first being reduced incorporation of the nucleotide analog into DNA over the normal nucleotide. This results from mutations in the N-terminal polymerase domain of the reverse transcriptase that reduce the enzyme’s affinity or ability to bind to the drug [...] A prime example for this mechanism is the M184V mutation that confers resistance to lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC). [...] Another well characterized set of mutations is the Q151M complex found in multi-drug resistant HIV which decreases reverse transcriptase’s efficiency at incorporating NRTIs, but does not affect natural nucleotide incorporation. The complex includes Q151M mutation along with A62V, V75I, F77L, and F116Y. [...] A virus with Q151M alone is intermediately resistant to zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), <b>zalcitabine</b> (ddC), stavudine (d4T), and slightly resistant to abacavir (ABC). [...] A virus with Q151M complexed with the other four mutations becomes highly resistant to the above drugs, and is additionally resistant to lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC).|$|E

Twenty of the isolates were SI and 18 were non-SI (NSI) at baseline. After 44 weeks of <b>zalcitabine</b> treatment, the SI and NSI phenotypes were maintained in 16 and 17 patients, respectively. One patient had an NSI-to-SI phenotypic switch, while SI-to-NSI reversion occurred in 4 children (20 %). Isolates from 30 of these patients were analyzed by in vitro drug susceptibility assay: Mean IC 50 values were 0. 14 mM at baseline and 0. 18 mM following <b>zalcitabine</b> treatment.

40|$|<b>Zalcitabine</b> {{population}} pharmacokinetics {{were evaluated}} in 44 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients (39 males and 5 females) in our immunodeficiency clinic. Eighty-one blood {{samples were collected}} during routine clinic visits for the measurement of plasma <b>zalcitabine</b> concentrations by radioimmunoassay (1. 84 ± 1. 24 samples/patient; range, 1 to 6 samples/patient). These data, along with dosing information, age (38. 6 ± 7. 13 years), sex, weight (79. 1 ± 15. 0 kg), and estimated creatinine clearance (89. 1 ± 21. 5 ml/min), were entered into NONMEM to obtain population estimates for <b>zalcitabine</b> pharmacokinetic parameters (4). The standard curve of the radioimmunoassay ranged from 0. 5 to 50. 0 ng/ml. The observed concentrations of <b>zalcitabine</b> in plasma ranged from 2. 01 to 8. 57 ng/ml following the administration of doses of either 0. 375 or 0. 75 mg. A one-compartment model best fit the data. The addition of patient covariates did not improve the basic fit of the model to the data. Oral clearance {{was determined to be}} 14. 8 liters/h (0. 19 liter/h/kg; coefficient of variation [CV] = 23. 8 %), while the volume of distribution was estimated to be 87. 6 liters (1. 18 liters/kg; CV = 54. 0 %). We were also able to obtain individual estimates of oral clearance (range, 8. 05 to 19. 8 liters/h; 0. 11 to 0. 30 liter/h/kg) and volume of distribution (range, 49. 2 to 161 liters; 0. 43 to 1. 92 liters/kg) of <b>zalcitabine</b> in these patients with the POSTHOC option in NONMEM.
