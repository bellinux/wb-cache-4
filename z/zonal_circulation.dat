40|$|ABSTRACT. Satellite imagery has {{substantially}} {{improved the}} quality of sea-ice observation over the last decades. Therefore, for a 25 year period, a statistical study based on the monthly Arctic sea-ice data and the monthly mean 700 mbar maps of the Northern Hemisphere was carried out to establish the relationships between sea-ice conditions and the general circulation of the atmosphere. It was found that sea-ice conditions have two opposing effects on the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> intensity, depending on the season. Heavier than normal ice in winter causes stronger than normal <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> in the subsequent months, whereas heavier than normal ice in the summer [...] fall causes weaker <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> in the subsequent months. Analyzing the two sectors, the Atlantic and Pacific ones separately, a negative correlation was found, which means a heavy ice year in the Atlantic Ocean is normally associated with a light one in the Pacific Ocean and vice versa...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the low-frequency (annually averaged) salinit and oxygen concentrations in the Baltic Sea and the atmospheric circulation has been statistically analyzed. It {{has been found that}} salinity, as well as oxygen, tend to evolve coherently at all depths. Furthermore, salinity and oxygen anomalies are in general negatively correlated. This behaviour is related to a common forcing by the large-scale atmospheric circulation, mainly by the strength of the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> over the North Atlantic: a stronger <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> is related to decreased salinities in all depths (probably through increased rainfall), hence to a weakened stratification. Stronger inflows of oxygenated North Sea waters may also contribute to positive oxygen anomalies. A simulation with a global climate model driven by increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse-gases indicates that the North Atlantic <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> may become stronger in the next century. These changes could then bring decreased salinities and improved oxygen conditions in the Baltic Sea. (orig.) 32 refs.

40|$|The {{structure}} and variance of the equatorial <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation,</b> as {{characterized by the}} atmospheric mass flux in the equatorial zonal plane, is examined and inter-compared in simulations from 9 CMIP 3 coupled climate models with multiple ensemble members and the NCEP-NCAR and ERA- 40 reanalyses. The climate model simulations analyzed here include twentieth century (20 C 3 M) and twenty-first century (SRES A 1 B) simulations. We evaluate the 20 C 3 M modeled zonal circulations by comparing them {{with those in the}} reanalyses. We then examine the variability of the circulation, its changes with global warming, and the associated thermodynamic maintenance. The tropical <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> involves three major components situated over the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. The three cells are supported by the corresponding diabatic heating extending deeply throughout the troposphere, with heating centers apparent in the mid-troposphere. Seasonal features appear in the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation,</b> including variations in its intensity and longitudinal migration. Most models, and hence the multi-model mean, represent the annual and seasonal features of the circulation and the associated heating reasonably well. The multi-model mean reproduces the observed climatology better than any individual model, as indicated by the spatial pattern correlation and mean square difference of the mass flux and the diabatic heating compared to the reanalysis based values. Projected changes in the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> under A 1 B forcing are dominated by mass flux changes over the Pacific and Indian oceans. An eastward shift of the Pacific Walker circulation is clearly evident with global warming, with anomalous rising motion apparent over the equatorial central Pacific and anomalous sinking motions in the west and east, which favors an overall strengthening of the Walker circulation. The <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> weakens and shifts westwards over the Indian Ocean under external forcing, whereas it strengthens and shifts slightly westwards over the Atlantic Ocean. The forced circulation changes are associated with broad SST and atmospheric diabatic heating changes in the tropics. Linear trends of these forced circulation changes, as characterized by regional spatial maximum amplitudes of mass fluxes and their longitudes over the three oceans, are statistically significant at the 5 % level for 2000 – 2099 for the multi-model mean. However, wide differences of the trends are apparent across the models, because of both deficiencies in the simulation of the circulations in different models and the high internal variability of the circulations...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss a}} Numerical Spectral Mode (NSM) that {{extends from the}} ground up into the {{thermosphere}} and incorporates Hines' Doppler spread parameterization (DSP) for small scale gravity waves (GW). This model is applied to describe the seasonal variations in the mean <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation,</b> the semi-annual and quasi-biennial oscillations (SAO and QBO), as well as the tides and planetary waves in the middle atmosphere. Initial results showed that this model can reproduce the salient features observed, including the QBO extending into the upper mesosphere inferred from UARS measurements. The model has now been extended to simulate also: (a) the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> of the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, and (b) the upwelling at equatorial latitudes associated with the Brewer Dobsen circulation that affects the dynamics significantly as pointed out by Dunkerton. Upward vertical winds increase the period of the QBO observed from the ground. To compensate for that, one needs to increase in the model the eddy diffusivity and the GW momentum flux, bringing the latter closer to values recommended in the DSP. This development is conducive to extending the QBO and SAO to higher latitudes through global scale momentum redistribution. Multi-year interannual oscillations are generated through wave filtering by the solar driven annual oscillation in the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation.</b> In a 3 D version of the model, wave momentum is absorbed and dissipated by tides and planetary waves. A somewhat larger GW source (well within the DSP range) is then required to generate realistic QBO and SAO amplitudes. Since GW momentum is deposited in the altitude regime of increasing winds, the amplitude of the diurnal tide is amplified and its vertical wavelength is reduced at altitudes between 70 and 120 km. Wave filtering by the mean <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> causes the GW flux to peak during equinox, and this produces a large semi-annual variation in the tide that has been observed on UARS. Without the diurnal tide, the semidiurnal tide would also be modulated in this way. But the diurnal tide filters out the GW preferentially during equinox, so that the semidiurnal tide tends to peak during solstice. Under the influence of GW, the tides are modulated significantly by planetary waves that are generated preferentially during solstice in part due to baroclinic instability...|$|E

40|$|Major {{advances}} {{in our understanding}} of the dynamics of Earth’s thermosphere (≈ 90 - 500 km) during the past 25 years are reviewed. Since the thermosphere is primarily an externally-forced system, a broad overview of the energy input, conversion and transport mechanisms in the ionosphere-thermosphere system is first provided. This serves as background and context for the non-specialist. Then, several broad areas of progress are in turn discussed in some detail: (i) the role of solar thermal tides in imposing significant longitudinal variability in the lower thermosphere (≈ 100 - 150 km), and affecting the <b>zonal</b> mean <b>circulation</b> at these altitudes; (ii) the <b>zonal</b> mean <b>circulation</b> of the thermosphere, the changes in O and N 2 relative densities that accompany it, and the competing roles of solar radiative heating and Joule (ohmic) heating in determining the overall structure of this circulation; (iii) polar and auroral thermosphere dynamics, and connections to relevant magnetosphere and ionosphere processes; and (iv) the global response to geomagnetic disturbances, i. e., relatively sudden injections of energy and momentum from the magnetosphere.

The reduction of the blocking frequency over the Atlantic and the increased frequency of easterly upper-level flow poleward of 60 °N are well explained by the changes of mean <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation.</b> In winter and autumn an additional downstream shift of the frequency maximum is simulated. This is also seen in {{a subset of the}} CMIP 5 models with RCP 8. 5. To explain this downstream shift requires the inclusion of the changing variance.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea is a semi-enclosed sea, {{connected}} to the Atlantic Ocean through the Gibraltar Strait and subdivided in two different regions by the Sicily Strait. The geographical extension of the basin, the surface heat flux, and the water inflow from the Gibraltar Strait {{are some of the}} basic factors determining its horizontal and vertical circulation. In the Mediterranean strong salinity and temperature zonal gradients contribute to maintain the zonal-vertical circulation, while meridional-vertical cells are equally forced by winds and deep water mass formation in three regions, the Gulf of Lyon, the southern Adriatic and the Cretan Sea areas. The objective of this thesis is to study how these cells combine together to form the Mediterranean conveyor belt system. This has never been attempted before so the conclusions are necessarily preliminary. In the first part we discuss the vertical <b>zonal</b> and meridional <b>circulation</b> by reconstructing the Wust Mediterranean vertical salinity and temperature structures in an attempt to evaluate the water mass structure consistent with modern data. Our results confirm that Wust depicted vertical circulation from scarce data is reproduced by the past 27 years observations.

The first one, eulerian, allowed us to observe vertical structures that were already reported in the literature. Recent studies in the Atlantic Ocean have shown that gyres and eddies have an important influence in the isopycnal vertical circulation. This is called the residual circulation which was computed in this study for the first time.

40|$|A {{realistic}} parameterization {{scheme for}} the deposition of gravity-wave {{momentum in the}} middle atmosphere has been incorporated into the 2 D version of a global-scale Numerical Spectral Model of the Earth's middle atmosphere. Here we present early results, obtained with only the simplest assumptions for the incident gravity-wave spectrum - that it is azimuthally isotropic (i, e., identical flux in the four cardinal directions), globally uniform, and unchanging with season - and with essentially `'untuned'' values of tunable parameters. This model reproduces reasonably well the observed anomalous latitudinal temperature distribution and the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> of the upper mesosphere during solstice, just as other models do. It also produces relatively large oscillations in the mean <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> of the middle atmosphere at low latitudes, descending in altitude with time. In the mesosphere and upper stratosphere, the dominant period is semi-annual and the maximum amplitude is about 20 mis near a height of 50 km.

The stations have been clustered into two distinct regions and a hybrid one. They {{are referred to}} as the southwestern Europe precipitation Atlantic regime (SEPAR) and the southwestern Europe precipitation Mediterranean regime (SEPMER), with the hybrid regime referred to in terms of the mean amplitude ratios between semiannual and annual rainfall components.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{the second part of}} a work aimed at {{studying}} the climate and variability of the large scale stratospheric circulation by comparing atmospheric statistics from a simulation performed with a general circulation model and from global analyzed observations. Part I (Manzini and Bengtsson, 1994) focused on December-February, while here the remaining part of the seasonal cycle is discussed. The March-May climatological seasonal mean <b>zonal</b> mean <b>circulation</b> is found to be reasonably well simulated. In the Northern hemisphere stratosphere, very weak westerly winds and high interannual variability characterize both the observed and model data, suggesting that the final stratospheric warming in the Northern hemisphere occurs in a realistic way in the model. The simulation of the <b>zonal</b> mean <b>circulation</b> during the June-August is relatively successful, although a winter cold bias of moderate amplitude and vertical extent is found. In comparison with the boreal winter, the interannual variability of the austral winter is smaller at high latitudes, in the simulation {{as well as in the}} observed state. Although the structure of the observed variability is captured by the model, its magnitude is underestimated, especially in August. Significant discrepancies between the model results and the analyzed observations are found during the final vortex breakdown (September-November) in the Southern hemisphere, apparently caused by insufficient large scale orographic forcing from the Antarctic continent in the current low resolution model.

40|$|A nonlinear, 3 D, time {{dependent}} numerical spectral model (NSM) is discussed, {{extending from}} the ground up into the thermosphere. The NSM incorporates the Doppler spread parameterization (DSP) for small scale gravity waves (GW) developed by Hines and is applied in a study of the diurnal tides and the mean <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation,</b> interacting self consistently. Our model results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Due to absorption of GW momentum in the regime of increasing horizontal winds, the amplitude of the fundamental diurnal tide is amplified at altitudes between 80 and 120 km. (2) The semidiurnal ride is also amplified in this way when it is excited without the diurnal tide. With the diurnal tide, however, the amplitude of the semidiurnal tide is reduced. Wave filtering causes strong nonlinear coupling between the two tidal components. (3) The annual variation in the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> causes GW filtering to produce a strong semiannual variation in the diurnal tide, which is observed on UARS (4) Preliminary results show large seasonal modulations of the semidiurnal tide that appear in part to be caused by GW filtering associated with the seasonal variations in the diurnal tide.

40|$|Signatures of the 11 -year solar activity/irradiance cycle are {{observed}} in the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) of the lower stratosphere. At these altitudes, the QBO is understood {{to be the result}} of "downward control" exerted by the wave mean flow interactions that drive the phenomenon. It is reasonable then to speculate that the QBO is a natural conduit to lower altitudes of solar activity variations in radiance (SAV). To test this hypothesis, we conducted experiments with a 2 D version of our Numerical Spectral Model that incorporates Hines' Doppler Spread Parameterization for small-scale gravity waves (GW). To account for the SAV, we change the solar heating rate on a logarithmic scale from 0. 1 % at the surface to 1 % at 50 kin to 10 % at 100 km. With the same GW flux, we then conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the magnitude of the solar activity irradiance effect (SAE) on the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> at low latitudes. The numerical results obtained show that, under certain conditions, the SAE is significant in the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> and does extend to lower altitudes where the SAV is small. The differences in the wind velocities can be as large as 5 m/s at 20 kin. We carried out two numerical experiments with integrations over more than 20 years: 1) With the QBO period "tuned" to be 30 months, of academic interest but instructive, the seasonal cycle in the solar forcing [through the Semi-annual Oscillation (SAO) ] acts as a strong pacemaker to produce a firm lock on the period and phase of the QBO. The SAE then shows up primarily as a distinct but relatively weak amplitude modulation. 2) With the QBO period between 30 and 34 (or less than 30, presumably) months, the seasonal phase lock is weak compared with (1). The SAV in the seasonal cycle then causes variations in the QBO period and phase, and this amplifies the SAE to produce relatively large variations in the wind field. We conclude that, under realistic conditions as in (2), the solar seasonal forcing, with activity variations in radiance, causes the phase and period of the QBO to change to produce a relatively large solar activity effect in the <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> at low latitudes and low altitudes...|$|E

40|$|We discuss {{results for}} the diurnal and semidiurnal tides {{obtained}} from our 3 -D, time dependent numerical spectral model (NMS), extending {{from the ground up}} into the thermosphere, which incorporates Hines' Doppler spread parameterization of small scale gravity waves (GW). In the DSP, GW momentum (and energy) are conserved as the waves modulate the background flow and are filtered by the flow. As a consequence, the GW interaction tightly couples the dynamic components of the middle atmosphere with strong non-linear interactions between mean <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation,</b> tides and planetary waves to produce complicated patterns of variability much like those observed. The major conclusions are: (1) Since GW momentum is deposited in the altitude regime of increasing winds, the amplitude of the diurnal tide is amplified and its vertical wavelength is reduced at altitudes between 80 and 120 km. Wave filtering by the mean <b>zonal</b> <b>circulation</b> (with peak velocities during solstice) causes the GW flux to peak during equinox, and this produces a large semi-annual variation in the tide that has been observed on UARS. (2) Without the diurnal tide, the semidiurnal tide would also be modulated in this way. But the diurnal tide filters out the GW preferentially during equinox, so that the semidiurnal tide, at higher altitudes, tends to peak during solstice. (3) Under the influence of GW, the tides are modulated also significantly by planetary waves, with periods between 2 and 30 days, which are generated preferentially during solstice in part due to baroclinic instability...|$|E

40|$|The new Horizontal Wind Model (HWM 07) {{provides}} a statistical {{representation of the}} horizontal wind fields of the Earth's atmosphere from the ground to the exosphere (0 - 500 km). It represents over 50 years of satellite, rocket, and ground-based wind measurements via a compact Fortran 90 subroutine. The computer model {{is a function of}} geographic location, altitude, day of the year, solar local time, and geomagnetic activity. It includes representations of the <b>zonal</b> mean <b>circulation,</b> stationary planetary waves, migrating tides, and the seasonal modulation thereof. HWM 07 is composed of two components, a quiet time component for the background state described in this paper and a geomagnetic storm time component (DWM 07) described in a companion paper...|$|R
40|$|Rainfall {{production}} {{is the fundamental}} variable within the Earth's hydrological cycle because it is both the principal forcing term in surface water budgets and its energetics corollary, latent heating, is the principal source of atmospheric diabatic heating. Latent heat release itself {{is a consequence of}} phase changes between the vapor, liquid, and frozen states of water. The properties of the vertical distribution of latent heat release modulate large-scale meridional and <b>zonal</b> <b>circulations</b> within the tropics - as well as modifying the energetic efficiencies of midlatitude weather systems. This paper focuses on the retrieval of latent heat release from satellite measurements generated by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observatory, which was launched in November 1997 as a joint American-Japanese space endeavor. Since then, TRMM measurements have been providing an accurate four-dimensional account of rainfall over the global tropics and sub-tropics, information which can be used to estimate the space-time structure of latent heating across the Earth's low latitudes. The paper examines how the observed TRMM distribution of rainfall has advanced an understanding of the global water and energy cycle and its consequent relationship to the atmospheric general circulation and climate via latent heat release. A set of algorithm methodologies that are being used to estimate latent heating based on rain rate retrievals from the TRMM observations are described. The characteristics of these algorithms and the latent heating products that can be generated from them are also described, along with validation analyses of the heating products themselves. Finally, the investigation provides an overview of how TRMM-derived latent heating information is currently being used in conjunction with global weather and climate models, concluding with remarks intended to stimulate further research on latent heating retrieval from satellites...|$|R
