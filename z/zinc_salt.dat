2500|$|The {{monetary}} unit is the dinar, at about 1.33 per dollar U.S.A. (recently a fairly constant rate), with inflation estimated pp.4.5% for 2006. Tunisia's per capita annual income was approximately 8,900 dollars (U.S.A.) in 2006. Between 1988 and 1998 the economy more than doubled. The economy grew at 5% per {{year during the}} 1990s (the best in North Africa), but hit a 15-year low of 1.9% in 2002 (due to drought {{and a decline in}} tourism), but it regained a 5% rate for 2003–2005; it was said to be 4%–5% for 2006. [...] Tunisia's economy is diverse. Its products are primarily from light industry (food processing, textiles, footwear, agribusiness, mining commodities, construction materials) and from agriculture (olives, olive oil, grains (wheat and barley), tomatoes, citrus, sugar beets, dates, almonds, figs, vegetables, grapes, beef dairy), as well as livestock (sheep, goats) and fishing. Other production comes from petroleum and mining (phosphates, iron, oil, lead, <b>zinc,</b> <b>salt).</b> Tunisia is self-sufficient in oil, but not in natural gas. A very significant portion of the economy derives from the tourist industry. Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) was composed of approximately 12.5% agriculture, 33.1% industry, and 54.4% services. Exports went to France 29%, Italy 20%, Germany 9%, Spain 6%, Libya 5%, U.S.A. 4%. Imports came from France 25%, Italy 22%, Germany 10%, Spain 5%. An association agreement with the European Union will move Tunisia toward full free trade with the EU by 2008.|$|E

In this study the effect of encapsulated zinc acetate on protein diffusion through PLG films was investigated. PLG films, with and without encapsulated zinc acetate, were degraded in Hepes buffer for different periods of time. The films were subsequently subjected to various kinds of analyses: diffusion properties (using a diffusion cell), porosity (using scanning electron microscopy) and thickness (using light microscopy and an image-analysis program). Encapsulated zinc acetate had a considerable effect and increased the diffusion coefficient of lysozyme through PLG films degraded for 18 days or longer. Films containing zinc acetate became porous, while those without zinc acetate only developed cavities on the surface. <b>Zinc</b> <b>salts</b> may thus be used as release-modifying agents.
