[...] After earning a PhD in Solid State Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, {{he went on}} to research battery technology at the Centre for Energy Studies in the IIT, and later at the Technische Universit√§t, Vienna. He published a paper on a <b>zinc-chlorine</b> <b>battery</b> [...] and a speculative paper on why the human sense organs are located where they are.|$|E
40|$|Cost {{effectiveness}} {{characteristics of}} conventional-, metal gas-, and high energy alkali metal-batteries for wind generated energy storage are considered. A lead-acid battery {{with a power}} density of 20 to 30 watt/hours per pound is good for about 1500 charge-discharge cycles {{at a cost of}} about $ 80 per kilowatt hour. A <b>zinc-chlorine</b> <b>battery</b> that stores chlorine as solid chlorine hydrate at temperatures below 10 C eliminates the need to handle gaseous chlorine; its raw material cost are low and inexpensive carbon can be used for the chlorine electrode. This system has the best chance to replace lead-acid. Exotic alkali metal batteries are deemed too costly at the present stage of development...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} pore-size {{distribution}} in flow-through porous electrode is investigated theoretically for uniform, log-normal, and bimodal pore-size distributions. Mass transfer within the pores and subsequent electrode kinetics {{are taken into}} account and side reactions are allowed. The analysis is applied to metal ion removal (silver and copper) in a flow-through porous electrode. Pore-size distribution is important when the operation is fully or partially mass-transfer limited and the counterelectrode is located upstream. Uniform pore-size distribution gives the lowest outlet concentration. F low-through porous electrodes are widely used in electrochemistry, especially in cases where the reactants are at low concentrat ions and a large specific area is needed. These electrodes are finding applications in trace metal ions removal processes and flow batteries, such as the <b>zinc-chlorine</b> <b>battery</b> and redox batteries. Mathematical model ing and design methods are highly desirable because of the complexity of flow-through po...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{dissolution of}} zinc in acidic zinc chloride solution {{have been investigated}} {{in order to understand}} and optimize its performance in <b>zinc-chlorine</b> hydrate <b>battery.</b> Polarisation experiments were carried out using pure zinc rods and electrodeposited zinc as electrods. For a concentration change of zinc chloride from 0. 5 to 1. 5 M. the exchange current densities were found to vary from 1. 4 to 2. 4 mA/cm 2 in the case of cast zinc rod electrodes, and from 2. 2 to 6. 2 mA/cm 2 in the case of electrodepasited zinc; this increase is attributed to the greater reactivity as well as the increased surface area of the freshly electrodeposited zin...|$|R
50|$|Zinc-cerium {{batteries}} are {{a type of}} redox flow battery first developed by Plurion Inc. (UK) during the 2000s. In this rechargeable battery, both negative zinc and positive cerium electrolytes are circulated though an electrochemical flow reactor during the operation and stored in two separated reservoirs. Negative and positive electrolyte compartments in the electrochemical reactor are separated by a cation-exchange membrane, usually Nafion (DuPont). The Ce(III)/Ce(IV) and Zn(II)/Zn redox reactions {{take place at the}} positive and negative electrodes, respectively. Since zinc is electroplated during charge at the negative electrode this system is classified as a hybrid flow battery. Unlike in zinc-bromine and <b>zinc-chlorine</b> redox flow <b>batteries,</b> no condensation device is needed to dissolve halogen gases. The reagents used in the zinc-cerium system are considerably less expensive than those used in the vanadium flow battery.|$|R
