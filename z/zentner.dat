40|$|In an {{extension}} of <b>Zentner’s</b> (2005) research on Ideal Mate Personality Concept, the researchers explored the relationship between marital satisfaction and the congruence between the individual’s ideal mate and real mate (on characteristics of Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness). Step-wise multiple regression {{was used to measure}} the strength {{of the relationship between the}} predictor variables (congruence, and similarity) and marital satisfaction...|$|R
50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} town was also the {{location}} of a Court, and of an administrative office responsible for mines and iron production. Mining was still significant in this period. It was run partly by state-owned and partly by privately owned firms. In addition to silver ore (of which in 1885 227 <b>zentners</b> tonnes were produced), nickel, bismuth and uranium ore were also extracted. There were also other industries: an enormous tobacco factory employed 1,000 women. In addition, there was the manufacture of gloves and corks and of bobbin lace.|$|R
50|$|Already in 1931, {{the coal}} mine could be restarted, first with 45 and later with 60 workers. Two thirds of their salary was paid in Wära and one third was in Reichsmark. To boost the open {{acceptance}} of Wära banknotes, open lectures {{of the idea}} and function of Wära were held. Hebecker met the early mistrust of the Wära from local inhabitants by opening a service shop and supplying it with goods from companies already belonging to the Wära currency agency. The local inhabitants reacted to this and soon started also accepting Wära currency. Hebecker could sign a transfer contract with the Sirius company in Deggendorf, with 1500 <b>Zentners</b> (7.5 tons) of coal per day.|$|R

50|$|In 1885, {{two months}} after the {{completion}} of the Franconian Forest Railway, a 7.6 kilometre long Sekundärbahn branch was opened that ran from the Upper Franconian town of Ludwigsstadt to the south Thuringian village of Lehesten. The slate quarries at Lehesten, which in 1880 manufactured 646,226 <b>zentners</b> of roofing and housing slates as well as slate tables, were particularly interested in a railway connexion. A state treaty between the Kingdom of Bavaria und the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen was required, however, to establish the line; this was signed on 16 June 1884. The brunt of the cost (0.515 million marks) was borne by Saxe-Meiningen, the construction and operation of the branch line was carried out by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Construction began in September 1884 and the line was opened on 1 December 1885.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{before the}} famous Northeast Blackout of 1965, Dan Ingram {{noted that the}} studio's {{electric}} power was fluctuating and began having fun with the slowed-down music. After playing [...] "Everyone's Gone to the Moon" [...] by Jonathan King, he quipped it was played [...] "in the key of R." [...] Ingram then proceeded to run some recorded commercials and a portion of Si <b>Zentner's</b> [...] "Up a Lazy River", backtimed to the news, while commenting on how {{everything seemed to be}} running slower than normal. During the 6 pm newscast, WABC left the air as the outage settled in for real. http://www.musicradio77.com/images/ing11-9-65blackout.mp3 Ingram later drove out to the transmitter site in Lodi, New Jersey, with a box of records, and continued his show from the backup studio housed there.|$|R
5000|$|An aircheck of New York City {{radio station}} WABC from November 9, 1965 reveals disc jockey Dan Ingram doing {{a segment of}} his {{afternoon}} drive time show, during which he notes that a record he's playing (Jonathan King's [...] "Everyone's Gone to the Moon") sounds slow, as do the subsequent jingles played during a commercial break. Ingram quipped that the King record [...] "was in the key of R." [...] The station's music playback equipment used motors that got their speed timing from {{the frequency of the}} powerline, normally 60 Hz. Comparisons of segments of the hit songs played {{at the time of the}} broadcast, minutes before the blackout happened, in this aircheck, as compared to the same song recordings played at normal speed reveal that approximately six minutes before blackout the line frequency was 56 Hz, and just two minutes before the blackout that frequency dropped to 51 Hz. As Si <b>Zentner's</b> recording of [...] "(Up a) Lazy River" [...] plays in the background [...] - [...] again at a slower-than-normal tempo [...] - [...] Ingram mentions that the lights in the studio are dimming, then suggests that the electricity itself is slowing down, adding, [...] "I didn't know that could happen". When the station's Action Central News report comes on at 5:25 pm ET, the staff remains oblivious to the impending blackout. The lead story is still Roger Allen LaPorte's self-immolation at United Nations Headquarters earlier that day to protest American military involvement in the Vietnam War; a taped sound bite with the attending physician plays noticeably slower and lower than usual. The newscast gradually fizzles out as power is lost by the time newscaster Bill Rice starts delivering the second story about New Jersey Senator Clifford P. Case's comments on his home state's recent gubernatorial election.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s <b>Zentner</b> put {{together}} his own studio big band and signed with Bel Canto Records. The <b>Zentner</b> band began recording for Liberty Records in 1959 releasing numerous successful pop/jazz albums during the 1960s and touring steadily {{with a large}} well-rehearsed outfit. He also briefly recorded for RCA Victor. <b>Zentner</b> was a tireless promoter and claimed to have played 178 consecutive one-night performances when the band was at its peak. His ensemble was voted [...] "Best Big Band" [...] for 13 straight years by Down Beat, and <b>Zentner</b> himself was voted Best Trombonist in Playboy Jazz Readers' Poll. <b>Zentner</b> {{was known for his}} bold, brash and bright playing with great breath control and distinctive vibrato. In 1962, his album Up a Lazy River (Big Band Plays the Big Hits, Vol. 2) (arranged by Bob Florence) won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.|$|E
50|$|The German <b>Zentner</b> is pound-based, {{and thus}} since {{metrication}} {{is defined as}} 50 kg, whereas the Austrian and Swiss <b>Zentner</b> since metrication has been re-defined as 100 kg. In Germany a measure of 100 kg is named a Doppelzentner.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>zentner</b> (German <b>Zentner,</b> from Latin centenarius, {{derived from}} centum meaning [...] "hundred") is an {{obsolete}} {{name for a}} unit of mass which was used predominantly in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, although it was also sometimes used in the United Kingdom [...] - [...] for example, {{as a measure of}} the weight of certain crops including hops for beer production [...] - [...] and similar units were used in Scandinavia. Like the notion of hundredweight, the <b>zentner</b> is the weight of 100 units, where the value of the unit depends on the time and location. Traditionally the unit was one hundred pounds (German Pfund), or roughly 50000 grams [...] - [...] the precise value being context-dependent [...] - [...] making one <b>zentner</b> equal to about 50 kilograms.|$|E
50|$|On 16 February 1890, tenders for {{the track}} were released. Lot I and II passed through Pullach, Solln, Thalkirchen and Sendling. This would employ about 300 men. Lot III {{included}} Hohenschäftlarn and Baierbrunn, employing 200 men. Zell, Irschenberg Icking {{and were in}} lot IV, employing 250 to 300 men. The last contract section, which included the section from Weidach to Wolfratshausen, would also use a construction locomotive, which was locomotive 15 of the LAG. The concession for the construction and operation of the Isar Valley Railway was issued to the LAG by Prince Regent Luitpold on 21 April 1890. Construction work started on 27 May 1890 between Thalkirchen and Wolfratshausen. The work proceeded quickly. In February 1891, the Loisach bridge at Wolfratshausen was put into operation. This contained 6000 <b>Zentners</b> of iron. On 24 May, the first trial run was made, accompanied by the press, between Thalkirchen and Ebenhausen. The completion of the line between Ebenhausen and Wolfratshausen was delayed because there were repeated landslides in the Schlederleite section, just north of Wolfratshausen. The official trial run on the section from Thalkirchen to Ebenhausen was held on 9 June. A day later, the section was opened. The section from Ebenhausen to Wolfratshausen was taken into operation on 27 July 1891. The trains were mostly well utilised on weekends and holidays, {{as many of the}} inhabitants of Munich used the railway for excursions, so the Isar Valley Railway carried up to 20,000 people on holidays. Still in its opening year only 292,000 passengers used the railway. There were previously negotiations between the City of Munich and the LAG over the route between Thalkirchen and Munich. The negotiations dragged on because the LAG wanted to build a tram line from Sendlinger Tor to the station of the Isar Valley Railway. This project had not been approved by the city. This complicated the negotiations. Once a contract had been concluded, the LAG had to pay 209,565.48 gold marks for the land. In addition, any road that was affected on this section had to be replaced. It was not possible to start construction until after the opening of the first section to Ebenhausen. The city of Munich claimed that the late start of the work was not its fault. The transport of freight between Munich South and Thalkirchen started on 10 April 1892. Passenger services began on 1 June 1892 as the station building of the Isar Valley Railway was not ready until that time. The first repairs on the line were necessary as early as 8 September 1892. The bridges were not approved for double-heading, as the iron girders were too weak. This restriction could only be lifted if the bridge’s supports were strengthened. In order to serve the emerging villa colony of Prinz-Ludwigs-Höhe, a station was built there in 1893. Freight operations started shortly after the opening of the line in 1892 and in 1893, the largest loads occurred because, after an infestation of the Forstenrieder Park by Black Arches caterpillars, the damaged wood had to be removed quickly. So in 1893, the freight traffic was at full capacity with about 4,500 wagon loads. In the following years, freight traffic decreased again until it rose again after 1900.|$|R
