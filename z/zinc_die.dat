In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the rapid {{change in the}} morphologic integrity of zinc-treated astroglia. Among the early cellular events occurring in zinc-treated astroglia, strong activation of p 38 MAPK and JNK was evident. Although inhibitors of p 38 (SB 203580 and SB 202190) or JNK (SP 600125) did not protect zinc-insulted astroglia from cell death, the p 38 inhibitors, but not the JNK inhibitor, suppressed actin filament and cell morphology disruption. The Ca 2 + ionophore, A 23187, also suppressed actin filament and cell morphology disruption, but not cell death, of zinc-insulted astroglia. However, A 23187 did not inhibit p 38 MAPK activation in zinc-treated astroglia.

One-year-old plants of clone UPASI- 9 were grown in these pots and the trial was continued for 136 days. The plants grown in soil containing 2000 mg Zn kg- 1 died within 15 days, while the plants supplied with 1000 mg Zn kg- 1 <b>zinc</b> <b>died</b> within 36 days after imposing treatments.

The typical toxicity symptoms were browning of leaves along the midrib starting from about 1. 5 to 2. 0 cm from the petiole towards the leaf tip and extending throughout the leaf. Addition of zinc increased the translocation of manganese to leaves, while it suppressed the uptake of magnesium. Although there is no report of antagonism between zinc and iron at the absorption sites of roots and during translocation process to stem, the leaf analysis indicated an antagonism.

40|$|Increased {{levels of}} {{intracellular}} zinc have {{been implicated in}} neuronal cell death in ischaemia, epilepsy and traumatic brain damage.

40|$|Copper strike baths are {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} plating industry as they present {{the ability to}} plate adherent copper layers on less-noble metal substrates such as steel and <b>zinc</b> <b>die</b> castings. However, {{in the last few}} years, due to environmental controls and safety policies for operators, the plating industry has been interested in replacing the toxic cyanide copper strike baths with environmentally friendly baths. A broad bibliographic review showed that the published papers, referring to the new nontoxic copper strike baths, are patents, having little or no emphasis focused on electrodeposition mechanisms. Therefore, it was decided to study the copper electrodeposition mechanism from a strike alkaline bath prepared {{with one of the most}} nontoxic chelating agents cited in many patents which is the 1 -hydroxyethane- 1, 1 -diphosphonic acid, known as HEDP. This acid forms very stable water soluble complexes with Cu(2 +) ions, thus cupric sulfate was used for preparing the plating bath. The results obtained through a cyclic voltammetry technique showed that Cu(2 +) ion reduction to Cu from an HEDP electrodeposition bath occurs via a direct reduction reaction without a formation of Cu(+) intermediates.

This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} assessment of magnetic-assistance electrochemical finishing using an effective design system and magnetic {{force to the}} electrolyte to assist the dregs discharge on <b>zinc</b> alloy beyond <b>die</b> casting by electrochemical finishing as a finish process on the freeform surface of castings. An outer shell of toy vehicle is taken for instance in the experiment. A small distance between the two magnets or large magnetic field intensity provides larger magnetic force and discharge ability. A higher current rating with magnetic-assistance can avoid the difficulty of dreg discharge, thus reducing the finish time. Pulsed direct current can slightly promote the finishing effect, but the machining time is increased. Thus the magnetic-assistance electrochemical finishing without pulsed current is recommended for the finish process. It is a great contribution that the magnetic-assistance electrochemical finishing just needs quite short to make the freeform surface of workpiece smooth and bright...|$|R
40|$|More than 13 {{million tons}} of zinc were {{produced}} in 2013 worldwide. According to the IZA (International Zinc Association) 60 % of this is used for galvanizing to protect steel from corrosion thus prolonging the service life of steel products significantly. About 15 % of world zinc consumption goes into the production of zinc base alloys, mainly to supply the die casting industry, 14 % goes into the production of brass and bronze and 8 % into the production of compounds including zinc oxide and zinc sulfate. The remainder is used for zinc alloys, mainly rolled, utilized in semi-manufactured applications including coinage and architectural applications. <b>Zinc</b> <b>die</b> casting alloys have been used since the early 1920 ies and {{are part of the}} stable world zinc consumption.

The objectives of this thesis {{is to develop}} the 1 st and 2 nd order tool life model when machining modified AISI P 20 tool steel and to investigate the relationship between cutting parameters; cutting speed, feedrate, axial depth, radial depth with tool life. This prediction model was then compared with the results obtained experimentally. By using Response Surface Method (RSM) of experiment, first and second order models were developed with 95 % confidence level. The 1 st order and 2 nd order tool life prediction model was developed {{with the aid of}} MINITAB software. Modified AISI P 20 tool steel were selected as the material in this thesis which commonly used to make plastic injection mold, <b>zinc</b> die-casting, extrusion <b>dies,</b> blow molds, and other structural components. From the results, it is observed that the 2 nd order tool life model gives less error percentage compared to the 1 st order. Comparing with the 1 st order model, 2 nd order model gives more accurate value because the average error % shows it has smaller value, which is 0. 59 %. From both generated regression equation, the relationship between the four cutting parameters with tool life for 1 st and 2 nd order model are, the tool life increase with reduction of cutting speed, feedrate, and radial depth excluding the axial depth. For end-milling of P 20 tool steel, the optimum conditions that is required to maximize the coated carbide tool life are as follow: cutting speed of 140 m/s, federate of 0. 1 mm/rev, axial depth of 1. 5 mm and radial depth of 2 mm. Using these parameters, a tool life of 39. 46 min was obtained. This value for tool life was obtained from the 2 nd order model.
