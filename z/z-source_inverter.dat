40|$|For the {{renewable}} energy sources whose outputs vary continuously, a <b>Z-source</b> current-type <b>inverter</b> has been proposed as a possible buck-boost alternative for grid-interfacing. With a unique X-shaped LC network connected between its dc power source and <b>inverter</b> topology, <b>Z-source</b> current-type <b>inverter</b> is however expected to suffer from compounded resonant complications {{in addition to those}} associated with its second-order output filter.
