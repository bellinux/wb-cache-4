40|$|Objectives. Spondylolysis is {{traditionally}} {{thought to be}} a diagnosis of adolescence and childhood, and is ascribed to mechanical stress through the immature pars interarticularis. Over the last 4 yr we have noted a presentation of spondylolysis in association with hypertrophic <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joint</b> disease in the lumbar spine in an older age group. Methods. Records of 94 patients presenting with low back pain were examined. A pattern of intense <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joint</b> uptake in association with extended uptake in the pars interarticularis was ascribed as degenerative spondylolysis. Results. The ages of the 94 cases ranged from 33 to 80 yr (mean 64 yr). There were 53 males and 41 females. In the group with degenerative spondylolysis the mean age was 72 yr, with four females and two males. None of these six patients gave a history of childhood spinal disease or back pain and all were relatively inactive in terms of current participation in sport.

40|$|Objectives To {{analyze the}} size and density of {{cervical}} <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joint</b> spaces in asymptomatic subjects using computed tomography (CT) and plain film radiography. The joint spaces were analyzed before manipulation without traction, before manipulation with manual traction, after manipulation without traction, and after manipulation with manual traction. The data obtained before the manipulation were compared with data obtained after the manipulation to determine if significant alterations occurred. Design Twenty-two asymptomatic subjects were placed into 1 or more of 6 possible experimental groups. In all experimental groups, except for experiment 1, the subjects underwent: (step 1) a premanipulation radiograph and/or CT scan, (step 2) a premanipulation plus traction radiograph and/or CT scan, (step 3) a postmanipulation radiograph and/or CT scan, and (step 4) a postmanipulation plus traction radiograph and/or CT scan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{relevance}} of degenerative changes in the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) and the joints in the lower limb and lumbar spine using age estimation methods. We also examined the shape of the auricular surface to determine the effect of degenerative changes on each joint. A total of 200 iliac auricular surfaces from 100 Japanese male skeletons were examined macroscopically in accordance with conventional methods of age estimation. From the obtained estimated age, we calculated the deflection values, which represented the degree of degenerative changes of the joints. For comparison, we used osteophyte score data of the hip, knee, and zygapophyseal joints in lumbar spines from previous studies which had used the same bone specimens. As a quantitative indicator of auricular surface morphology, we defined the constriction ratio (CR) of the auricular surface and compared the CR values obtained with various measured values. Degenerative changes in the SIJ were positively correlated with those in both the hip joint and <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joint,</b> but a correlation with knee joints was found only on the left side. In skeletons from individuals aged ≥ 60 years as time of death, the CR was significantly different between the group with high scores and those with low scores in both the hip and sacroiliac joints.

Background: Cervical spine meniscoids {{are thought}} to {{contribute}} to neck pain and hypomobility in individuals with chronic whiplash-associated disorder (WAD); however, their morphology has not been studied in a clinical population. Objectives: To investigate cervical spine meniscoid morphology in individuals with chronic WAD. Methods: Twenty volunteers with chronic WAD (mean ± SD age, 39. 3 ± 11. 0 years; 10 female) and 20 age- and sex-matched controls (age, 39. 1 ± 10. 6 years) underwent cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging. Lateral atlantoaxial and <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joints</b> (C 2 - 3 to C 6 - 7) were inspected for meniscoids. Length of meniscoid protrusion was measured and composition (adipose/fibrous/fibroadipose) assessed. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and linear and logistic regression (P<. 05). Results: Meniscoids were identified in the chronic WAD (n = 317) and control (n = 296) groups. At the lateral atlantoaxial joints, median meniscoid length was greater {{in the control group}} (ventral, 6. 07 mm; dorsal, 7. 24 mm) than the WAD group (ventral, 5. 01 mm; P =. 06 and dorsal, 6. 48 mm; P<. 01).

40|$|BackgroundThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the diagnostic value and clinical benefits of lumbar <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joint</b> injections in patients with chronic lower back pain. MethodsTwo hundred and seventy-seven patients (136 males and 141 females, aged 15 – 82 years) with chronic lower back pain were enrolled in the trial and met the following criteria: pain for more than 1 year; no root signs; and no history of back surgery. Under fluoroscope, a 0. 8 – 1. 5 mL mixture of lidocaine, betamethasone dipropionate and iopamidol (1 : 1 : 0. 5) was injected into each joint after intra-articular localization of the needle tip was confirmed. A questionnaire with a pain scale was administered immediately or the day after injection, and then after 1, 3, 6 and 12 weeks. Partial arthrograms were reviewed by a radiologist. ResultsFour hundred and forty-nine joint injections were performed in 277 patients (L 3 - 4, n = 76; L 4 - 5, n = 272; L 5 -S 1, n = 101). Bilateral injections were performed in 117 patients (42. 2 %). The study group comprised 204 patients (73. 6 %) with an excellent or good response, whereas the control group comprised the remaining 73 patients (26. 4 %). The rates of good response in the study group were 72. 1 % (147 / 204) after 3 weeks, 40. 7 % (83 / 204) after 6 weeks, and 31. 4 % (64 / 204) after 12 weeks. Partial arthrograms revealed 25 patients (9. 0 %) with synovial cysts (L 3 - 4, n = 3; L 4 - 5, n = 14; L 5 -S 1, n = 8); 23 of these patients (92. 0 %) had a good response to the injections. Five of the 6 patients with spondylolysis (83. 3 %), having abnormal communication between the injected and contiguous joint, had a good response to the injections.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{cervical}} <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joints</b> may be {{a primary}} source of pain in up to 60 % of individuals with chronic whiplash associated disorders (WAD) and {{may be a}} contributing factor for peripheral and centrally mediated pain (sensory hypersensitivity).

The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine if there is a change in measures indicative of sensory hypersensitivity in patients with chronic WAD grade II following a medial branch block (MBB) procedure in the cervical spine. Methods Measures of sensory hypersensitivity were taken via quantitative sensory testing (QST) consisting of pressure pain thresholds (PPT's) and cold pain thresholds (CPT's). In patients with chronic WAD (n = 18), the measures were taken at three sites bilaterally, pre- and post- MBB. Reduced pain thresholds at remote sites have been considered an indicator of central hypersensitivity. A healthy age and gender matched comparison group (n = 18) was measured at baseline. An independent t-test was applied to determine if there were any significant differences between the WAD and normative comparison groups at baseline with respect to cold pain and pressure pain thresholds. A dependent t-test was used to determine whether there were any significant differences between the pre and post intervention cold pain and pressure pain thresholds in the patients with chronic WAD.

After sterilizing and draping of skin, four paracentral mini-incisions were made about 4.5  cm lateral to the midline. Under fluoroscopy guidance, Jamshidi needle was accurately inserted into vertebrae through pedicle route, then its inner stylet was removed to allow placement of kirschner wire. Fixed-diameter working channel with 20 -mm diameter (METRx II) was inserted down to the <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joint</b> following sequentially placing dilators over {{each other through the}} incision. Partial facetectomy was performed using rongeur from lateral to medial to expose posterolateral part of spinal canal. The rest of ipsilateral facet, lamina and lateral margin of ligamentum flavum were removed to accomplish sufficient canal decompression, then working channel was tilted to contralateral side where indicated through the same incision to perform further canal decompression. After thorough discectomy and well preparation of endplates, autologous bone graft from resected local bony structures, including facet and lamina were packed in disc space, and interbody cage (polyetheretherketone, PEEK) filled with it was also placed medially, then screws and rods were inserted percutaneously.

40|$|There are {{currently}} no initial guides for {{the diagnosis of}} somatic referred pain of lumbar <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joint</b> (LZJ) or sacroiliac joint (SIJ). We developed a classification system of LZJ and SIJ pain, the "pain distribution pattern template (PDPT) " depending on the pain distribution patterns {{from a pool of}} 200 patients whose spinal pain source was confirmed. We prospectively applied the PDPT to determine its contribution to clinical decision-making for 419 patients whose pain was presumed to arise from the LZJs (259 patients) or SIJs (160 patients). Forty-nine percent (128 / 259) of LZJ and 46 % (74 / 160) of SIJ arthopathies diagnosed by PDPT were confirmed by nerve blocks. Diagnostic reliabilities were significantly higher in Type A and C patterns in LZJ and Type C in SIJ arthropathies, 64 %, 80 %, and 68. 4 %, respectively. For both LZJ and SIJ arthropathies, favorable outcome after radiofrequency (RF) neurotomies was similar to the rate of positive responses to diagnostic blocks in Type A to Type D, whereas the outcome was unpredictable in those with undetermined type (Type E).

The patients were diagnosed originally as myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), cervical herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP), and whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). Patients with the zygapophyseal joints pain of C 5 - 6 and C 6 - 7 were classified by their pain origin as MPS, HNP, and WAD. All patients had been undergone cervical zygapophyseal joints injections with the mixture of lidocaine and triamcinolone unilaterally or bilaterally through the posterior approach under C-arm imaging guide. The therapeutic effects were compared with reduction of numeric rating scale (NRS) of pain before and immediately after blockade and symptom-free periods in each group after 12 months. Symptom durations before injections were 16. 1 ± 9. 6, 4. 6 ± 1. 9 and 4. 1 ± 1. 1 months in each MPS, HNP, and WAD groups. The reductions of NRS immediately after the blockade among the three groups were not different. However, the symptom-free duration after blockade lasted longer in the HNP group {{than the other two}} groups. In patients with cervical zygapophyseal pain syndromes, the analgesic effect from cervical facet joint blocks lasted longer in cervical HNP than MPS or WAD...|$|E
40|$|The human {{spinal column}} {{is a complex}} {{structure}} composed of 24 individual vertebrae plus the sacrum. The principal functions of the spine are to protect the spinal cord, to provide mobility to the trunk and to transfer loads from the head and trunk to the pelvis. By nature of a natural sagittal curvature and the relatively flexible intervertebral discs interposed between semi-rigid vertebrae, the spinal column is a compliant structure which can filter out shock and vibrations {{before they reach the}} brain. The intrinsic, passive stability of the spine is provided by the discs and surrounding ligamentous structures, and supplemented by the actions of the spinal muscles. The seven intervertebral ligaments which span each pair of adjacent vertebrae and the two synovial joints on each vertebra (facets or <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joints)</b> allow controlled, fully three-dimensional motion...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{cervical}} <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joints</b> may be {{a primary}} source of pain in up to 60 % of individuals with chronic whiplash associated disorders (WAD) and {{may be a}} contributing factor for peripheral and centrally mediated pain (sensory hypersensitivity). Sensory hypersensitivity {{has been associated with}} a poor prognosis. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine if there is a change in measures indicative of sensory hypersensitivity in patients with chronic WAD grade II following a medial branch block (MBB) procedure in the cervical spine. Methods Measures of sensory hypersensitivity were taken via quantitative sensory testing (QST) consisting of pressure pain thresholds (PPT's) and cold pain thresholds (CPT's). In patients with chronic WAD (n = 18), the measures were taken at three sites bilaterally, pre- and post- MBB. Reduced pain thresholds at remote sites have been considered an indicator of central hypersensitivity. A healthy age and gender matched comparison group (n = 18) was measured at baseline. An independent t-test was applied to determine if there were any significant differences between the WAD and normative comparison groups at baseline with respect to cold pain and pressure pain thresholds. A dependent t-test was used to determine whether there were any significant differences between the pre and post intervention cold pain and pressure pain thresholds in the patients with chronic WAD. Results At baseline, PPT's were decreased at all three sites in the WAD group (p < 0. 001). Cold pain thresholds were increased in the cervical spine in the WAD group (p < 0. 001). Post-MBB, the WAD group showed significant increases in PPT's at all sites (p < 0. 05), and significant decreases in CPT's at the cervical spine (p < 0. 001). Conclusions The patients with chronic WAD showed evidence of widespread sensory hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli. The WAD group revealed decreased sensory hypersensitivity following a decrease in their primary source of pain stemming from the cervical <b>zygapophyseal</b> <b>joints.</b> Full Tex...|$|R
