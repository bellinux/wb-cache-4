5000|$|John Cena has {{expressed}} {{gratitude for the}} online phenomenon in interviews, feeling proud for at least being [...] "accepted" [...] by others as a popular culture figure. The WWE made their own Unexpected Cena video compiling the wrestler's most remembered moments of him interrupting matches. This time, however, the <b>Z</b> Morning <b>Zoo</b> host announcing his name is replaced with Jim Ross doing so, and {{the volume of the}} song is toned down, which a writer felt did not get the humor of the meme. On June 29, Cena and Cricket Wireless brought the meme to life by surprising many of his fans during a fake audition.|$|R
5000|$|Elvis Duran and the Morning Show (formerly {{known as}} The <b>Z</b> Morning <b>Zoo)</b> is an American {{syndicated}} weekday morning radio program hosted by Elvis Duran.

5000|$|Unexpected John Cena, {{also known}} as simply Unexpected Cena or And His Name is John Cena, refers to an Internet meme and a form of {{trolling}} involving videos that first garnered popularity on video-sharing services such as Vine and YouTube {{in the summer of}} 2015. Born and inspired by numerous prank calls done on the <b>Z</b> Morning <b>Zoo</b> show in 2012, the clips, noted by one writer to symbolize frustration of fans of WWE regarding American wrestler John Cena's over-publicity, depict a snippet of a popular film, TV series, song or other form of media that gets interrupted by Cena's entrance video, as an announcer yells [...] "And his name is John Cena!" [...] and his theme song [...] "The Time Is Now", often played loudly. The meme was very well received by journalists and Cena himself.|$|R
5000|$|Unexpected John Cena was {{influenced}} from prank calls {{done on the}} <b>Z</b> Morning <b>Zoo</b> show in 2012, which also involved announcing Cena's name and playing his theme song [...] "The Time Is Now". The humor of the Unexpected Cena videos come from how unpredicted John Cena's entrance video is, spoofing his over-publicity and using it towards an unrelated situation of everyday life as a scene stealer. The videos also represent the irritation of some fans of WWE about his extreme popularity. Ever since competing at WrestleMania 21 in 2005, the American wrestler has been considered {{to be one of}} the most popular wrestlers ever and a poster boy of WWE. His notability has stemmed from him being able to win every fight; he even garnered negative attention for winning the twenty-first annual Royal Rumble event from 2008 when he started at number 30 and had a torn pectoralis major muscle, yet was able to beat several wrestlers to such a degree that their wrestling careers were ruined, or [...] "buried", by him.|$|R
