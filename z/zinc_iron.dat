According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, <b>zinc,</b> <b>iron,</b> copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid.

The mining of coal – once a major employer in Scotland has declined in importance since the later half of the 20th century, due to cheaper foreign coal and the exhaustion of many seams.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{recovering}} zinc {{from low}} grade oxidized zinc ore {{has been a}} matter of discussion. In this paper, the investigation for recovering <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> from gossan ores was carried out. In generally, the conventional physical separation methods, such as flotation, gravity separation and magnetic separation, were used to treat the low grade ore, and flotation is the most commonly used method for beneficiation and pretreatment of oxidized zinc minerals. However, gravity separation and magnetic separation are used to deal with the gossan ores because of the special zinc oxide ore bearing iron 40. 2 % in this study. The effects of grinding fineness and magnetic intensity were investigated, respectively. The results show that the grade of <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> increase slightly, and the best result is that the grade of <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> are 13. 35 % and 40. 25 %, the recovery of <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> are 53. 45 % and 52. 19 %...|$|R
40|$|Effects of the stored dust-like <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> {{containing}} wastes of {{the mining}} and processing industry consist {{of the loss}} of valuable components and environmental pollution. Thus, the goals of the research were to analyse ecological conditions under the technogenic impact at the waste storage site and to study transformations of the stored dust-like <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> containing wastes in the active supergene zone. Materials are based on the physical laboratory-modelled infiltration of the atmospheric precipitation waters through the <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> containing wastes. Methods include systematically-structured analysis of wastes and there disposal site and laboratory techniques (X-ray fluorescence and atomic emission spectrometry). On the basis of laboratory research and field observations of the environmental components in the impact area of the storage of dust-like <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> containing wastes, the article describes regularities of formation of hydrogeochemical halos of contamination by heavy metals and iron.

Babbage, Herschel, Harris, &c. The iron has additional power in the latter kind of experiments, because of its ordinary magnetic relations, and its place relative to magneto-electric action of the kind now under investigation cannot be ascertained by such trials.

Most zincs, when put into dilute sulphuric acid, leave more or less of an insoluble matter upon the surface in the form of a crust, which contains various metals, as copper, lead, <b>zinc,</b> <b>iron,</b> cadmium, &c., in the metallic state. Such particles, by discharging part of the transferable power, render it, as to the whole battery, local; and so diminish the effect. As an indication connected with the more or less perfect action of the battery, I may mention that no gas ought to rise from the zinc plates. The more gas which is generated upon these surfaces, the greater is the local action and the less the transferable force. The investing crust is also inconvenient, by preventing the displacement and renewal of the charge upon the surface of the zinc. Such zinc as, dissolving in the cleanest manner in a dilute acid, dissolves also the slowest, is the best; zinc which contains much copper should especially be avoided. I have generally found rolled Liege or Mosselman's zinc the purest; and to the circumstance of having used such zinc in its construction attribute in part the advantage of the new battery (1134.).|$|E

40|$|Phosphate and sulfate are {{essential}} macro-elements for plant growth and development, and deficiencies in these mineral elements alter many metabolic functions. Nutritional constraints are {{not restricted to}} macro-elements. Essential metals such as <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> have their homeostasis strictly genetically controlled, and deficiency or excess of these micro-elements can generate major physiological disorders, also impacting plant growth and development. Phosphate and sulfate on one hand, and <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> on the other hand, are known to interact. These interactions have been partly described at the molecular and physiological levels, and are reviewed here. Furthermore the two macro-elements phosphate and sulfate not only interact between themselves but also influence <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> nutrition. These intricated nutritional cross-talks are presented. The responses of plants to phosphorus, sulfur, <b>zinc</b> or <b>iron</b> deficiencies have been widely studied considering each element separately, and some molecular actors of these regulations have been characterized in detail. Although some scarce reports have started to examine the interaction of these mineral elements two by two, a more complex analysis of the interactions and cross-talks between the signaling pathways integrating the homeostasis of these various elements is still lacking. However, a MYB-like transcription factor, PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR 1), emerges as a common regulator of phosphate, sulfate, <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> homeostasis, and {{its role as a}} potential general integrator for the control of mineral nutrition is discussed...|$|R

Combined <b>zinc</b> and <b>iron</b> supplementation is one of the strategies used to prevent these deficiencies. Zinc has an inhibitory effect on iron absorption. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the duration of the inhibitory effect of <b>zinc</b> on <b>iron</b> absorption. Fifteen healthy subjects were selected to participate in the study. Subjects received a water solution with 0. 5 mg of elemental iron, as ferrous sulfate, given alone or with zinc (11. 71 mg), as zinc sulfate, in a molar ratio 20 : 1 <b>zinc</b> to <b>iron,</b> provided simultaneously with iron or 30 and 60 minutes before iron administration. The double radioisotopic technique was used to measure iron absorption. An inhibitory effect of <b>zinc</b> on <b>iron</b> absorption was observed when both mineral were given simultaneously; however, this inhibitory effect was not observed when zinc was administered 30 or 60 minutes before (analysis of variance for repeated measures, F = 5. 96, P b. 002; ScheffeÂ´ post hoc test, P b. 006). In conclusion, <b>zinc</b> administration with <b>iron</b> in aqueous solution leads to the inhibition of iron bioavailability. However, this inhibitory effect lasts less than 30 minutes.
