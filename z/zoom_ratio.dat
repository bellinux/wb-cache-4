50|$|This lens has an EF type mount, {{that fits}} the Canon EOS line of cameras. It was {{introduced}} in January 1993. Featuring the highest <b>zoom</b> <b>ratio</b> (10x) of any interchangeable SLR lens at the time, the lens was and is popular among photojournalists. It has now been superseded by the Canon EF 28-300mm lens. When used on a digital EOS body with a field of view compensation factor of 1.6x, such as the Canon EOS 7D, it provides a narrow field of view, equivalent to a 56-560mm lens mounted on a 35mm frame body.|$|E

The zoom lens had a focal length variable from 25 mm to 150 mm, with a <b>zoom</b> <b>ratio</b> rated at 6:1. At its widest angle, it had a 43-degree field of view, while in its extreme telephoto mode, it had a 7-degree field of view.

50|$|Designers of zoom lenses {{with large}} <b>zoom</b> <b>ratios</b> often trade {{one or more}} aberrations for higher image sharpness. For example, {{a greater degree of}} barrel and pincushion {{distortion}} is tolerated in lenses that span the focal length range from wide angle to telephoto with a focal ratio of 10× or more than would be acceptable in a fixed focal length lens or a zoom lens with a lower ratio. Although modern design methods have been continually reducing this problem, barrel distortion of greater than one percent is common in these large-ratio lenses. Another price paid is that at the extreme telephoto setting of the lens the effective focal length changes significantly while the lens is focused on closer objects. The apparent focal length can more than halve while the lens is focused from infinity to medium close-up. To a lesser degree, this effect is also seen in fixed focal length lenses that move internal lens elements, rather than the entire lens, to effect changes in magnification.|$|R
5000|$|Zoom lenses {{are often}} {{described}} by the ratio of their longest to shortest focal lengths. For example, a zoom lens with focal lengths ranging from 100 mm to 400 mm may {{be described as a}} 4:1 or [...] "4×" [...] zoom. The term superzoom or hyperzoom is used to describe photographic zoom lenses with very large focal length factors, typically more than 5× and ranging up to 19× in SLR camera lenses and 83× in amateur digital cameras. This ratio can be as high as 300× in professional television cameras. As of 2009, photographic zoom lenses beyond about 3× cannot generally produce imaging quality on par with prime lenses. Constant fast aperture zooms (usually 2.8 or 2.0) are typically restricted to this zoom range. Quality degradation is less perceptible when recording moving images at low resolution, which is why professional video and TV lenses are able to feature high <b>zoom</b> <b>ratios.</b> Digital photography can also accommodate algorithms that compensate for optical flaws, both within in-camera processors and post-production software.|$|R

High definition imaging and zooming are widely adopted when observers want to capture more detail information of targets. The optical zooming can provide high <b>zoom</b> <b>ratio</b> detail images of target {{as well as}} maintain imaging definition, however, it fails to obtain full view of scene when zoomed, and the field of observation decreases to region of target. Digital zooming is an effective approach to keep the balance between imaging field and visual detail information.

40|$|Abstract—With {{rapid growth}} of {{cellular}} systems, energy con-sumption has become a critical issue. The existing cellular network planning is performance-oriented, {{whose objective is to}} satisfy peak traffic requirements, without too much consid-erations on energy efficiency. Unfortunately, real-world traffic profiles have indicated that in most time, most of the cells are in low utilization. Switching off certain cells in low traffic period for some time is proved energy-efficient. To switch off cells, remaining operating cells need to extend their coverage by cell zooming to guarantee service. However, such zooming might be insufficient, depending greatly on cell configurations. In this paper, we consider energy efficiency in cellular network planning. We introduce a new parameter for traffic estimation, which is low traffic time ratio τ. In order to switch off more cells for insufficient cell zooming, two solutions are feasible: to deploy smaller but more cells or to implement coverage extension technologies. We focus on former solution to determine cell configurations and propose an evaluation method to determine whether certain cell deployment is energy-efficient and how much energy it could save, compared with traditional planning. It is shown that when cell <b>zooming</b> <b>ratio</b> is reaching sufficient for certain switching-off scheme, deploying more cells could be more energy-efficient. Also, after exceeding the threshold, the larger the parameter τ is, the more energy-efficient our solution is. I...|$|R

40|$|Session 9 : Short-Reach Metro and Access Networks and Related Components IUltrafast optical {{spectrum}} monitoring {{is one of}} the most challenging tasks in observing ultrafast phenomena, such as the spectroscopy, dynamic observation of the laser cavity, and spectral encoded imaging systems. However, conventional method such as {{optical spectrum}} analyzer (OSA) spatially disperses the spectrum, but the space-to-time mapping is realized by mechanical rotation of a grating, so are incapable of operating at high speed. Besides the spatial dispersion, temporal dispersion provided by dispersive fiber can also stretches the spectrum in time domain in an ultrafast manner, but is primarily confined in measuring short pulses. In view of these constraints, here we present a real-time spectrum analyzer called parametric spectro-temporal analyzer (PASTA), which is based on the time-lens focusing mechanism. It achieves a 100 -MHz frame rate and can measure arbitrary waveforms. For the first time, we observe the dynamic spectrum of an ultrafast swept-source: Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) laser, and the spectrum evolution of a laser cavity during its stabilizing process. In addition to the basic single-lens structure, the multi-lens configurations (e. g. telescope or wide-angle scope) will provide a versatile operating condition, which can zoom in to achieve 0. 05 -nm resolution and zoom out to achieve 10 -nm observation range, namely 17 times <b>zoom</b> in/out <b>ratio.</b> In view of the goal of achieving spectrum analysis with fine accuracy, PASTA provides a promising path to study the real-time spectrum of some dynamic phenomena and non-repetitive events, with orders of magnitude enhancement in the frame rate over conventional OSAs. © 2013 Copyright SPIE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{moving screen}} {{technique}} for pattern centre localisation is revisited. A cross-correlation based iterative procedure is developed to find both the zoom factor and the zoom centre (which {{is also the}} pattern centre) between two EBSD diffraction patterns acquired at two camera positions. The procedure involves two steps: first, a rough estimate of the pattern centre position and <b>zoom</b> factor (the <b>ratio</b> of the two detector distances) is obtained by cross-correlating the entire images. Then, based on this first estimate, cross-correlation of smaller regions of interest (ROIs) gives the displacement field which is interpreted as a zoom factor misfit coupled with a zoom centre position misfit. These misfits are iteratively decreased until the displacement field is reduced to the noise level. The procedure is first applied to simulated patterns and it is shown that the iterative procedure converges very rapidly to the exact solution with an accuracy better than 1 / 100 th of pixel. The potential of this technique for experimental patterns is discussed and recommendations for new EBSD detectors are proposed...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increased}} requirement on the ultrafast measurement technology, how {{to resolve the}} spectral dynamics has the top priority on the research list, since spectrum is an essential carrier {{for most of the}} physical or chemical phenomena. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, if a function () contains no frequencies higher than Hz, it is completely determined by giving its ordinates at a series of points spaced 1 /(2) seconds apart. Since most of the conventional optical spectrum analyzers (OSAs) are operated with the sampling rate (or frame rate) of 5 Hz, it results in the resolvable bandwidth of the spectrum dynamic is less than 2. 5 Hz. With the development of the space-time duality, the analogy transforms the conventional spatial dimension into the time axis, and the well-known spatial models inspire us in performing their counterparts in the time domain. As {{one of the most powerful}} tools in achieving ultrafast time axis information, time-lens plays a more and more important role in the single-pixel imaging system. By fully analyzing the diploma of the previous optical spectrum resolving mechanisms, in this thesis, for the first time, we raised up the concept the parametric spectrotemporal analyzer (PASTA), which is based on the time-lens focusing mechanism. Here the spectrum resolving frame rate is increased to 100 MHz, then the observable spectrum dynamic bandwidth could be 50 MHz, which is sufficient for most of the ultrafast phenomena. In the PASTA system, the time-lenses are implemented with the fiber optical parametric amplifier (FOPA) based parametric mixer, which provides higher conversion efficiency and repetition rate. On the other hand, the dispersion based dispersive Fourier transformation (DFT) technology generates the swept-pump for the FOPA, as well as the temporal dispersion medium. This research in this thesis is a fundamental study on the newly PASTA system, from its origin and the theoretical background, to the implementation techniques and operation performances. From its implementation, its principles are strongly related with the combination of the dispersion and the Kerr nonlinear effects, especially the swept-pump FOPA in the time-lens part. The DFT technique, in generating the fast swept-source, has also find its applications in the ultrafast serial time-encoded amplified microscopy (STEAM) and swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) systems. Finally, the single-lens PASTA prototype is capable of resolving 5 -nm wavelength range with 0. 03 -nm resolution under 100 -MHz frame rate. Moreover, besides the singlelens PASTA, the telescope/wide-angle configurations have also been investigated experimentally to achieve the spectrum <b>zoom</b> in/out <b>ratio</b> as high as 17 times, here we have obtained the sharpest resolution of 5 pm (< 1 GHz) with the telescope configuration, and the widest observation range of 9 nm with the wide-angle configuration. My research efforts presented in this thesis mainly leverage the ultrafast characteristics of the time-lens system, from theory to implementation, and achieve the real-time optical spectrum analysis – the PASTA system. PASTA is not only essential in observing some non-repetitive ultrafast phenomena, but also provides a potential solution for the frequency to time transformation in some ultrafast bio-medical imaging systems. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} theoretical and experimental exploration of active reflective components specifically for large-aperture adaptive optical zoom systems. An active reflective component can change its focal length by physically deforming its reflecting surface. Adaptive optical zoom (AOZ) utilizes active components {{in order to}} change magnification and achieve optical zoom, as opposed to traditional zooming systems that move elements along the optical axis. AOZ systems are theoretically examined using a novel optical design theory that enables a full-scale tradespace analysis, where optical design begins from a broad perspective and optimizes to a particular system. The theory applies existing strategies for telescope design and aberration simulation to AOZ, culminating {{in the design of}} a Cassegrain objective with a 3. 3 X <b>zoom</b> <b>ratio</b> and a 375 mm entrance aperture. AOZ systems are experimentally examined with the development of a large-aperture active mirror constructed of a composite material called carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The active CFRP mirror uses a novel actuation method to change radius of curvature, where actuators press against two annular rings placed on the mirror's back. This method enables the radius of curvature to increase from 2000 mm to 2010 mm.
