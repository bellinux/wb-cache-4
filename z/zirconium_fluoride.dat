40|$|The {{reprocessing}} {{of commercial}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) generates a Zircaloy cladding hull waste which requires disposal as a high level waste in the geologic repository. The hulls are primarily contaminated with fission products and actinides from the fuel. During fuel irradiation, these contaminants are deposited in {{a thin layer of}} zirconium oxide (ZrO{sub 2 }) which forms on the cladding surface at the elevated temperatures present in a nuclear reactor. Therefore, if the hulls are treated to remove the ZrO{sub 2 } layer, a majority of the contamination will be removed and the hulls could potentially meet acceptance criteria for disposal as a low level waste (LLW). Discard of the hulls as a LLW would result in significant savings due to the high costs associated with geologic disposal. To assess the feasibility of decontaminating spent fuel cladding hulls, two treatment processes developed for dissolving fuels containing zirconium (Zr) metal or alloys were evaluated. Small-scale dissolution experiments were performed using the ZIRFLEX process which employs a boiling ammonium fluoride (NH{sub 4 }F) /ammonium nitrate (NH{sub 4 }NO{sub 3 }) solution to dissolve Zr or Zircaloy cladding and a hydrofluoric acid (HF) process developed for complete dissolution of Zr-containing fuels. The feasibility experiments were performed using Zircaloy- 4 metal coupons which were electrochemically oxidized to produce a thin ZrO{sub 2 } layer on the surface. Once the oxide layer was in place, the ease of removing the layer using methods based on the two processes was evaluated. The ZIRFLEX and HF dissolution processes were both successful in removing a 0. 2 mm (thick) oxide layer from Zircaloy- 4 coupons. Although the ZIRFLEX process was effective in removing the oxide layer, two potential shortcomings were identified. The formation of ammonium hexafluorozirconate ((NH{sub 4 }) {sub 2 }ZrF{sub 6 }) on the metal surface prior to dissolution in the bulk solution could hinder the decontamination process by obstructing the removal of contamination. The thermal decomposition of this material is also undesirable if the cladding hulls are melted for volume reduction or to produce waste forms. Handling and disposal of the corrosive off-gas stream and ZrO{sub 2 }-containing dross must be addressed. The stability of Zr{sup 4 +} in the NHF{sub 4 }/NH{sub 4 }NO{sub 3 } solution is also a concern. Precipitation of ammonium <b>zirconium</b> <b>fluorides</b> upon cooling of the dissolving solution was observed in the feasibility experiments. Precipitation of the solids was attributed to the high fluoride to Zr ratios used in the experiments. The solubility of Zr{sup 4 +} in NH{sub 4 }F solutions decreases as the free fluoride concentration increases. The removal of the ZrO{sub 2 } layer from Zircaloy- 4 coupons with HF showed a strong dependence on both the concentration and temperature. Very rapid dissolution of the oxide layer and significant amounts of metal was observed in experiments using HF concentrations {ge} 2. 5 M. Treatment of the coupons using HF concentrations {le} 1. 0 M was very effective in removing the oxide layer. The most effective conditions resulted in dissolution rates which were less than approximately 2 mg/cm{sup 2 }-min. With dissolution rates in this range, uniform removal of the oxide layer was obtained and a minimal amount of Zircaloy metal was dissolved. Future HF dissolution studies should focus on the decontamination of actual spent fuel cladding hulls to determine if the treated hulls meet criteria for disposal as a LLW...|$|R

The solids are moved to storage bins and the combustion gases and fine particles are swept from the bed to an atmospheric protection system. This atmospheric protection system includes a cyclone to collect larger particles; a nitric acid scrubber to cool gases and collect small particles; a condenser to reduce water content; silica gel beds to adsorb volatile ruthenium, water, and hydrocarbons; and a series of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters to collect minute particles.

As part of the viability study, an initial analysis of the reactor core physics performance was performed, including coolant reactivity effects, fuel burnup cycle length, and transient behaviors. Considerable attention was given to the coolant void reactivity feedback effects, which are highly dependent on salt composition and core geometry. The coolant void coefficient ranges from negative for lighter element salts such as lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride, to substantially positive for heavier element salts such as sodium fluoride and <b>zirconium</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Due to the large thermal inertial of the graphite-moderated core and coolant pool, and the excellent passive decay heat removal characteristics of the system, temperature transients appear to be very slow and relatively benign. Detailed results of the physics analyses and future development needs will be presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} develop a waste form for disposing of the <b>zirconium</b> <b>fluoride</b> fission product waste stream. Fluorapatite, a naturally-occurring fluorinated calcium phosphate, {{has been identified as}} a potential matrix for the entombment of this waste stream. If the efficacy of fluorapatite-based wastestorage can be demonstrated, then new and potentially more efficient options for handling and separating high-level wastes, based on fluoride-salt extraction, will become feasible. The research effort has been divided along two parallel paths: the Fabrication Path, led by collaborators at the Khlopin Radium Institute (KRI) in St. Petersburg, Russia; and the Characterization Path, led by researchers from UNLV. The Fabrication Path is focused on examining and evaluating various techniques for fabricating synthetic fluorapatite; synthesizing synthetic fluorapatite; and examining the impacts of waste loading and other fabrication process factors on the performance of the synthetic fluorapatite as a potential waste form. The Characterization Path is focused on adapting and refining the X-ray spectroscopy techniques currently used to characterize borosilicate glass for use in examining the fluorapatite system. This path will also encompass the examination of the ceramic and synthetic mineral waste forms created at KRI, with subsequent examination of these techniques {{to develop a}} molecular- level understanding of natural fluorapatite and other fluorine-bearing natural phases as natural analogs for the waste form. These techniques will also be used to examine the changes in surface chemistry caused by environmental degradation of these materials...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new system}} for multiple object spectroscopy and integral field spectroscopy at near-infrared wavelengths using optical fibers. Both modes of the SMIRFS instrument have been tested at the UK Infrared Telescope with the CGS 4 infrared spectrograph. The modular system includes a common optical system to image the fiber slit onto the cold slit inside the CGS 4 cryostat. The multiobject mode consists of 14 interchangeable fused silica or <b>zirconium</b> <b>fluoride</b> fibers each with a field of 4 arcsec. The integral field mode consists of 72 fused silica fibers coupled with a lenslet array to give a contiguous field of 6 x 4 arcsec with 0. 6 arcsec sampling. We describe the performance of both modes. For the multiobject mode, the feasibility and desirability of using fluoride fibers to extend the wavelength range into the K-band is discussed. For the integral field mode, the performance is compared with theoretical expectation with {{particular attention to the}} effect of Focal Ratio Degradation in the fibers. These results demonstrate the feasibility of multiobject and integral field spectroscopy in the near-infrared using lenslet-coupled fiber systems. Although SMIRFS in an experimental system working with a spectrograph not designed for this purpose, the throughput and uniformity of response are good. SMIRFS points the way forward to systems with much larger numbers of elements.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory has {{proposed}} a new extraction procedure to handle TRISO-coated fuels, the Fluoride Extraction Process (FLEX). The FLEX process is designed to separate the uranium in the fuel from the actinides and most fission products {{by taking advantage of}} the unique properties of uranium hexafluoride (UF 6). In the FLEX process, the used TRISO fuel is reacted with <b>zirconium</b> <b>fluoride</b> salt, forming UF 6 and the fluoride salts of the actinides and fission products. At process temperatures, the UF 6 volatizes into a gas, and is released from the molten salt mixture. This leaves behind the actinides and most fission products in a fluoride salt, which is subsequently processed using pyrochemical techniques to recover the actinides and other long lived fission products for transmutation. The UF 6 is then cooled, causing it to sublime into solid form, which is then further processed for disposal or reuse. The research effort was divided along two parallel paths: the Fabrication Path, led by collaborators at the Khlopin Radium Institute (KRI) in St. Petersburg, Russia; and the Characterization Path, led by researchers from UNLV.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} program was the investigation and application of noncontact temperature measurement techniques using optical techniques and optical fiber methods. In particular, a pyrometer utilizing an infrared optical light pipe and a multiwavelength filtering approach was designed, revised, and tested. This work was motivated {{by the need to}} measure the temperatures of small metallic pellets (approximately 3 mm diameter) in free fall at the Microgravity Materials Processing Drop Tube at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. In addition, research under this program investigated the adaptation of holography technology to optical fiber sensors, and also examined the use of rare-earth dopants in optical fibers for use in measuring temperature. The pyrometer development effort involved both theoretical analysis and experimental tests. For the analysis, a mathematical model based on radiative transfer principles was derived. Key parameter values representative of the drop tube system, such as particle size, tube diameter and length, and particle temperature, were used to determine an estimate of the radiant flux that will be incident on the face of an optical fiber or light pipe used to collect radiation from the incandescent falling particle. An extension of this work examined the advantage of inclining or tilting the collecting fiber to increase the time that the falling particle remains in the fiber field-of-view. Those results indicate that increases in total power collected of about 15 percent may be realized by tilting the fiber. In order to determine the suitability of alternative light pipes and optical fibers, and experimental set-up for measuring the transmittance and insertion loss of infrared fibers considered for use in the pyrometer was assembled. A <b>zirconium</b> <b>fluoride</b> optical fiber and several bundles of hollow core fiber of varying diameters were tested. A prototype two-color pyrometer was assembled and tested at Virginia Tech, and then tested on the Drop Tube at Marshall Space Flight Center. Radiation from 5 mm diameter niobium drops falling in the Drop Tube was successfully detected, and recorded for later analysis. Subsequent analysis indicated that the imaging of light output from the light pipe onto the detector active areas was not identical for both detectors...|$|E
