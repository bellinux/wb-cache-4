50|$|On {{the lowest}} end is short-dated loans to {{government}} and government-guaranteed entities (usually semi-independent government departments).

40|$|Before 1970, {{approximately}} 6 % of multi-transfused recipients {{acquired a}} transfusion-transmitted Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The safety improvements since then have been tremendous. From {{a level of}} a few infections per 1000 donations, the risk today, depending on the screening algorithm and additional measurements performed, has decreased to around 1 : 500, 000 to 1 : 1, 000, 000, an improvement greater than 1000 -fold compared to 50 years ago. This enormous gain in safety has been achieved through many factors, including development of increasingly more sensitive Hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg) assays; the adoption in some countries of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) screening; an improved donor selection procedure; HBV vaccination programs; and finally the introduction of HBV nucleic acid testing (NAT). Because {{there is a tendency}} in transfusion medicine to add one safety measure on top of another to approach the ultimate goal of <b>zero</b> <b>risks,</b> costs become increasingly a matter of debate. It is obvious that any new measure in addition to existing methods or measures will have very poor cost effectiveness. Therefore each country needs to perform its own calculation based on the country’s own epidemiology, resources, political and public awareness of the risks, in order to choose the correct and most cost-efficient measures. Ideally, each country would make decisions regarding implementation of additional blood safety measures in the context of both the perceived benefit and the allocation of overall health care resources...|$|R
50|$|This area of {{business}} ethics usually {{deals with the}} duties of a company to ensure that products and production processes do not needlessly cause harm. Since few goods and services can be produced and consumed with <b>zero</b> <b>risk,</b> determining the ethical course can be problematic. In some case consumers demand products that harm them, such as tobacco products. Production may have environmental impacts, including pollution, habitat destruction and urban sprawl. The downstream effects of technologies nuclear power, genetically modified food and mobile phones may not be well understood. While the precautionary principle may prohibit introducing new technology whose consequences are not fully understood, that principle would have prohibited most new technology introduced since the industrial revolution. Product testing protocols have been attacked for violating the rights of both humans and animals.|$|E
5000|$|The Tier 1 {{capital ratio}} is {{the ratio of}} a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-{{weighted}} assets (RWA). Risk-weighted assets are the total of all assets held by the bank weighted by credit risk according to a formula determined by the Regulator (usually the country's central bank). Most central banks follow the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) guidelines in setting formulae for asset risk weights. Assets like cash and currency usually have <b>zero</b> <b>risk</b> weight, while certain loans have a risk weight at 100% of their face value. The BCBS {{is a part of}} the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Under BCBS guidelines total RWA is not limited to Credit Risk. It contains components for Market Risk (typically based on value at risk (VAR) [...] ) and Operational Risk. The BCBS rules for calculation of the components of total RWA have seen a number of changes following the Financial crisis of 2007-08.|$|E
50|$|The study {{supposedly}} {{had some}} merit, mainly regarding the takeaways {{that could be}} made based on the results. The results brought the benefit of understanding that lead paint quality/condition was more harmful than concentration of lead in paint due to increased likelihood of ingesting paint or dust from decaying paint. The growing criticism raised the concern that if <b>zero</b> <b>risk</b> was required in public health research then many problems could not be rigorously addressed, leaving the public collectively at risk. It was argued by the defense that the target population itself would still have a higher chance of exposure to lead poisoning regardless whether the study was implemented or not. Therefore, any of the techniques that proved effective and low cost would benefit more of the population in the long run. Thus, risk exposure guidelines could be revised as a sort of compromise. The idea of minimal risk to the patient was revisited and questioned to what extent a study’s procedure incurred risk, leading to changes in guidelines on how studies are conducted such as the degree of parental knowledge of study and more attention on current guidelines to avoid oversight of what minimal risk is acceptable.|$|E
5000|$|In the game's normal {{difficulty}} mode, {{the player}} {{is given the}} option to choose between using X and using Zero, each lending their own advantages and disadvantages.
