40|$|Zein is a "yellowish" colored maize storage {{prolamine}} {{that shows}} {{great interest in}} a number of industrial applications such as food, food coating and food packaging. Nanofibers generated by electrospinning from solution exhibit an array of unique features and properties that distinguish them from other 1 -D nanostructures fabricated using other nanotechnology techniques. This paper presents a complete study reporting on the effect of changing a number of unprecedented process parameters such as polymer concentration, solvent content, flow-rate, applied voltage, needle tip-to-collector distance and pH in order to control fiber size and end morphology. The results indicated that modifying the process parameters led to "white" colored <b>zein</b> <b>fiber</b> networks with fiber diameters ranging from less than a 100 nm (smaller nanometric morphologies ever reported for zein) to above 1 μm. Sample morphologies as determined by SEM and AFM tended to exhibit tubular-like shapes but more complex fiber morphologies such as nanobeads were also observed. Acidifying the alcohol zein solution yielded ribbon like morphologies which exhibited higher glass transition temperature than zein fibers obtained from pure alcohol solutions. On the contrary, alkaline solutions of zein yielded low solution viscosity and hence a faulty electrospinning experience. Fiber networks were seen to have increased thermal properties compared to solvent cast films due to probably their particular molecular structure and a high solvent removing efficiency. Finally, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy nicely showed that the zein secondary structure, particularly the α-helix length, is different depending on the electrospinning conditions applied and that this must influence the observed end properties of the protein fiber networks. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Incorporating active agents, {{reinforcing}} structure by crosslinking, thus changing release properties, can {{be listed}} as possible modifications in preparation methods of biopolymer fibers. This study introduces oleuropein, {{major component of}} olive leaf extract (OLE), as a natural functional crosslinker for electrospun <b>zein</b> <b>fibers,</b> owing to its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Incorporation of OLE causes morphological and structural changes indicated by a decrease in fiber diameter up to 27 %, an increase in intensity of NH bending region due to interaction with -OH groups and observation of characteristic oleuropein bands. Extract addition also enhances thermal stability. <b>Zein</b> <b>fibers</b> without OLE is fully degraded at 600 C, whereas 10 % of OLE loaded <b>zein</b> <b>fibers</b> is left undegraded. Fifty percent of initial phenolic content loaded into fibers is released which indicate the effect of OLE incorporation as accumulation of oleuropein. OLE-incorporated fibers immersed in PBS are less fused than pure <b>zein</b> <b>fibers,</b> due to the crosslinking effect...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new method of {{cross-linking}} electrospun <b>zein</b> <b>fibers</b> using citric acid as a non-toxic cross-linker {{to enhance the}} water stability and cytocompatibility of <b>zein</b> <b>fibers</b> for tissue engineering and other medical applications. The electrospun structure has many advantages over other types of structures and protein-based biomaterials possess unique properties preferred for tissue engineering and other medical applications. However, ultrafine fiber matrices developed from proteins have poor mechanical properties and morphological stability in the aqueous environments required for medical applications. Efforts {{have been made to}} improve the water stability of electrospun protein scaffolds using cross-linking and other approaches, but the current methods have major limitations, such as cytotoxicity and low efficiency. In this research electrospun <b>zein</b> <b>fibers</b> were cross-linked with citric acid without using any toxic catalysts. The stability of the cross-linked fibers in phosphate-buffered saline and their ability to support the attachment, spreading, and proliferation of mouse fibroblast cells were studied. The cross-linked electrospun fibers retained their ultrafine fibrous structure even after immersion in PBS at 37 °C for up to 15 days. Citric acid cross-linked electrospun zein scaffolds showed better attachment, spreading, and proliferation of fibroblast cells than uncross-linked electrospun <b>zein</b> <b>fibers,</b> cross-linked <b>zein</b> films, and electrospun polylactide fibers...|$|R
30|$|Zein was {{dissolved}} in ethanol and kept under vigorous stirring overnight at room temperature. Various concentrations (1.2, 1.9, and 2.5  g) of progesterone were {{dissolved in}} ethanol {{for an hour}} at room temperature. Both solutions were mixed for an hour. Progesterone-loaded <b>zein</b> <b>fibers</b> prepared by electrospinning were spun using a voltage of 24  kV, working distance of 12  cm, and feed rate of 2  μL min− 1. Electrospinning processes were carried out under ambient conditions (24 [*]±[*] 3  °C with relative humidity 57 [*]±[*] 4 %) [14].|$|R
5000|$|Historically, zein {{has been}} used in the {{manufacture}} {{of a wide variety of}} commercial products, including coatings for paper cups, soda bottle cap linings, clothing fabric, buttons, adhesives, coatings and binders. The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name [...] "Vicara". [...] With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, <b>zein</b> <b>fibers</b> have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.|$|R

Topography and surface morphology of micrometer and nanometer scaled fibrous biomaterials are crucial for bioactive component encapsulation, release, promoting cell proliferation and interaction within biological environment. Specifically, for drug delivery and tissue repair applications, surface engineering provides control on both aspects in tandem. In this study, the bioactive component (ganoderma lucidum spore polysaccharide (GLSP)) was loaded into <b>zein</b> prolamine (ZP) <b>fiber</b> matrices via coaxial electrospinning (CES) technique. During the CES process, various outer layer enveloping fluids were used to modulate fiber topography in-situ (from 2 D to 3 D). SEM and water contact angle tests indicate enveloping media impact electrospun fiber diameter (ranging from 400 nm to 3. 0 μm) and morphologies (from flat ribbon-like to solid cylindrical structures), with the latter impacting GLSP release profile. Furthermore, CCK- 8 assay assessment indicates fibroblast cell proliferation (L 929 cell line), while cell extension was also observed for modified ZP fibers. The results demonstrate potential applications of modified fiber morphologies, which are tailored in-situ without impacting chemical stability and encapsulation...|$|R
