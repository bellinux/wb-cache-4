50|$|Of the {{secondary}} or ultra-accelerators the main categories are the thiurams and the dithiocarbamates. In vulcanization of tire compounds {{they are used}} as small addition to sulfenamides to boost the speed and state of cure.They have a very fast vulcanization speed and therefore, next to boosters in tire compounds they are used as main accelerator in EPDM compounds and in latex compounds. EPDM compounds have much less cure sites than natural rubber or SBR, and therefore need a rapid vulcanization system to have sufficient cure speed. Latex is cured at relatively low temperature (100- 120 °C)and therefore need an inherently rapid accelerator.The major thiurams used are TMTD (tetramethylthiuram disulfide) and TETD(tetraethylthiuram disulfide), They are produced by the reaction between dimethylamine or diethylamine and carbon disulfide. The major dithiocarbamates are the zinc salts ZDEC (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate) and ZDBC (<b>zinc</b> <b>dibutyldithiocarbamate).</b>|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{disulfide}} is neurotoxic and {{is identified}} as a reproductive and developmental toxicant by authoritative sources. 1 - 5 Evidence comes from laboratory animal testing as well as supportive data from epidemiological studies of workplace exposures in men and women. Exposure Carbon disulfide is a thermal decomposition product of <b>zinc</b> <b>dibutyldithiocarbamate,</b> a chemcial used in rubber production. Consequently, it may be present in rubber as a degredation product. 6 The most prominent industrial use of carbon disulfide is {{in the production of}} viscose rayon fibers. Carbon disulfide is also used in the production of carbon tetrachloride and cellophane, and as a solvent for rubber, sulfur, oils, resins, and waxes. 2 Carbon disulfide was detected at low concentrations in 4 out of 4 balloon samples in consumer product testing by the Danish EPA. 7 It was detected in 1 out of 2 natural rubbe...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} involving {{stability parameter}} mapping and stability vector analysis is developed {{for assessing the}} effect of an additive on polymer performance. The potential usefulness of the method is illustrated by applying it to (i) DSC oxidative induction time (OIt) data for medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) formulations made using two levels of carbon black and base-stabilized with Irgafos 168 ™ (tris-(2, 4 -di-tert-butylphenyl) -phosphite) and Irganox 1010 ™ pentaerythrityl-tetrakis-(3 -(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) propionate), and (ii) chemiluminescence OIt data for low-density polyethylene (LDPE) containing 0. 2 % (w/w) of Chimassorb 944 ™ and 0. 5 % (w/w) or 1. 0 % (w/w) of dicumyl peroxide cross-linking agent and base-stabilized with 0. 2 % (w/w) of various commercial antioxidants. The proposed method is validated using data from a previous study on MDPE and is applied to a preliminary investigation of LDPE destabilization by dicumyl peroxide. The results suggest that a styrenated phenolic stabilizer blended with <b>zinc</b> <b>dibutyldithiocarbamate</b> and zinc stearate is an effective system for stabilizing LDPE {{in the presence of}} dicumyl peroxide...|$|E
40|$|The {{study reveals}} an energy-, resource- and {{eco-friendly}} method for preparation of sulfur-containing lubricant additives via interaction of fatty acid ethyl esters of rapeseed oil with elemental sulfur. The structure of synthesized compounds under various reactants ratio (5 – 50 wt. % of sulfur), duration (30 – 240 min) and {{temperature of the}} process (160 – 215 °С) was investigated using various analytical techniques. According to the established data, aside from addition to double bonds, the side reaction of hydrogen substitution at α-methylene groups near these bonds occurs and induces the formation of conjugated systems and chromophoric sulfur-rich derivatives. Also, we found that increase of process duration evokes growth of polysulfane chains, {{in contrast to the}} raise of temperature, which leads to the formation of sulfur-containing heterocycles and hydrogen sulfide, as a result of elimination. Influence of accelerators on sulfurization of fatty acid ethyl esters was also examined. The most effective among them are mixtures of <b>zinc</b> <b>dibutyldithiocarbamate</b> with zinc oxide or stearic acid, which soften synthesis conditions and doubly decrease duration of the high-temperature stage. In addition, sulfur-containing compositions of ethyl esters and α-olefins, vulcanized esters by benzoyl peroxide, nonylphenols and zinc dinonyl phenyl dithiophosphate were designed. The study identified that lithium lubricant with sulfurized vulcanized esters provides improved tribological properties, in comparison with base lubricant or lubricant with the non-modified product. </span...|$|E
