40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} {{the framework of}} <b>z-codes</b> theory. The main contribution consists in {{an extension of the}} algorithm of Sardinas and Patterson for deciding whether a finite set of words X is a z-code. To improve the efficiency of this test we have found a tight upper bound on the length of the shortest words that might have a double z-factorization over X. Some remarks on the complexity of the algorithm are also given. Moreover, a slight modification of this algorithm allows us to compute the z-deciphering delay of X...|$|E

However, {{little is known about}} the way psychosocial stressors uniquely combine to create risk for different expressions of child and adolescent psychopathology. The purpose of this study was to determine whether core dimensions of stressful psychosocial situations are differentially associated with childhood generalized anxiety disorder and oppositional defi ant disorder.

Results: Multigroup discriminant analysis extracted two signifi cant dimensions within the psychosocial variables assessed. Function 1 was characterized by overprotection, parental pressures and acute life events and was associated with GAD. Function 2 was characterized by parental abuse/hostility and interpersonal stress and was associated with ODD. Both dimensions were able to correctly classify 89. 7 % of the cases, compared to 35. 9 % by chance. Conclusions: The results indicate that specifi c psychosocial dimensions are differentially related to childhood GAD and ODD. This may be useful in targeting at-risk populations for preventive intervention as well as informing more accurate alignment of psychosocial resources for treatment. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Administrative {{data are}} widely used to study health systems and make {{important}} health policy decisions. Yet {{little is known about}} the influence of coder characteristics on administrative data validity in these studies. Our goal was to describe the relationship between several measures of validity in coded hospital discharge data and 1) coders' volume of coding (â‰¥ 13, 000 vs. Methods This descriptive study examined 6 indicators of face validity in ICD- 10 coded discharge records from 4 hospitals in Calgary, Canada between April 2002 and March 2007. Specifically, mean number of coded diagnoses, procedures, complications, <b>Z-codes,</b> and codes ending in 8 or 9 were compared by coding volume and employment status, as well as hospital type. The mean number of diagnoses was also compared across coder characteristics for 6 major conditions of varying complexity. Next, kappa statistics were computed to assess agreement between discharge data and linked chart data reabstracted by nursing chart reviewers. Kappas were compared across coder characteristics. Results 422, 618 discharge records were coded by 59 coders during the study period. The mean number of diagnoses per record decreased from 5. 2 in 2002 / 2003 to 3. 9 in 2006 / 2007, while the number of records coded annually increased from 69, 613 to 102, 842. Coders at the tertiary hospital coded the most diagnoses (5. 0 compared with 3. 9 and 3. 8 at other sites). There was no variation by coder or site characteristics for any other face validity indicator. The mean number of diagnoses increased from 1. 5 to 7. 9 with increasing complexity of the major diagnosis, but did not vary with coder characteristics. Agreement (kappa) between coded data and chart review did not show any consistent pattern with respect to coder characteristics. Conclusions This large study suggests that coder characteristics do not influence the validity of hospital discharge data. Other jurisdictions might benefit from implementing similar employment programs to ours, e. g. : a requirement for a 2 -year college training program, a single management structure across sites, and rotation of coders between sites. Limitations include few coder characteristics available for study due to privacy concerns. </p...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) is {{revising}} the tenth {{version of the}} International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD- 10). This includes a reconceptualization of the definition and positioning of Gender Incongruence of Childhood (GIC). This study aimed to: 1) collect the views of transgender individuals and professionals regarding the retention of the diagnosis; 2) see if the proposed GIC criteria were acceptable to transgender individuals and health care providers; 3) compare results between two countries with two different healthcare systems to see if these differences influence opinions regarding the GIC diagnosis; and 4) determine whether healthcare providers from high-income countries feel that the proposed criteria are clinically useful and easy to use. A total of 628 participants {{were included in the}} study: 284 from the Netherlands (NL; 45. 2 %), 8 from Flanders (Belgium; 1. 3 %), and 336 (53. 5 %) from the United Kingdom (UK). Most participants were transgender people (or their partners/relatives; TG) (n = 522), 89 participants were healthcare providers (HCPs) and 17 were both HCP and TG individuals. Participants completed an online survey developed for this study. Overall, the majority response from transgender participants (42. 9 %) was that if the diagnosis would be removed from the mental health chapter it should also be removed from the ICD- 11 completely, while 33. 6 % thought it should remain in the ICD- 11. Participants were generally satisfied with other aspects of the proposed ICD- 11 GIC diagnosis: most TG participants (58. 4 %) thought the term Gender Identity Disorder should change, and most thought Gender Incongruence was an improvement (63. 0 %). Furthermore, most participants (76. 1 %) did not consider GIC to be a psychiatric disorder and placement in a separate chapter dealing with Gender and Sexual Health (the majority response in the NL and selected by 37. 5 % of the TG participants overall) or as a Z-code (the majority response in the UK and selected by 26. 7 % of the TG participants overall) would be preferable. In the UK, the majority response (35. 8 %) was that narrowing the GIC diagnosis was an improvement, while the NL majority response (49. 5 %) was that this was not an improvement. Although generally the results from HCPs were in line with the results from TG participants some differences were found. This study suggests that, although in an ideal world a diagnosis is not welcomed, several participants felt the diagnosis should not be removed. This is likely due to concerns about restricting access to reimbursed healthcare. The choice for positioning of a diagnosis of GIC within the ICD- 11 was as a separate chapter dealing with symptoms and/or disorders regarding sexual and gender health. This was the overall first choice for NL participants and second choice for UK participants, after the use of a Z-code. The difference reflects that in the UK, <b>Z-codes</b> carry no negative implications for reimbursement of treatment costs. These findings highlight the challenges faced by the WHO in their attempt to integrate research findings from different countries, with different cultures and healthcare systems in their quest to create a manual that is globally applicable...|$|E

Directly analyzing the entanglement [or the primitive path (PP) ] network of the system via the <b>Z-code,</b> we quantified several important topological measures: (a) the PP contour length Lpp, (b) the number of entanglements Zes per chain, (c) the end-to-end length of an entanglement strand des, (d) the number of carbon atoms per entanglement strand Nes, and (e) the probability distribution for each of these quantities.

The {{aim of this study}} was to gather the opinions of transgender individuals (and their relatives/partners) and clinicians in the Netherlands, Flanders (Belgium) and the United Kingdom regarding the proposed changes and the clinical applicability and utility of the ICD- 11 criteria of `Gender Incongruence of Adolescence and Adulthood' (GIAA). A total of 628 participants were included in the study: 284 from the Netherlands (45. 2 %), 8 from Flanders (Belgium) (1. 3 %), and 336 (53. 5 %) from the UK. Most participants were transgender people (or their partners/relatives) (n = 522), 89 participants were healthcare providers (HCPs) and 17 were both healthcare providers and (partners/relatives of) transgender people. Participants completed an online survey developed for this study. Most participants were in favor of the proposed diagnostic term of `Gender Incongruence' and thought that this was an improvement on the ICD- 10 diagnostic term of 'Transsexualism'. Placement in a separate chapter dealing with Sexual- and Gender-related Health or as a <b>Z-code</b> was preferred by many and only a small number of participants stated that this diagnosis should be excluded from the ICD- 11. In the UK, most transgender participants thought there should be a diagnosis related to being trans. However, if it were to be removed from the chapter on Âªpsychiatric disordersÂº, many transgender respondents indicated that they would prefer it to be removed from the ICD in its entirety. There were no large differences between the responses of the transgender participants (or their partners and relatives) and HCPs. HCPs were generally positive about the GIAA diagnosis; most thought the diagnosis was clearly defined and easy to use in their practice or work. The duration of gender incongruence (several months) was seen by many as too short and required a clearer definition. If the new diagnostic term of GIAA is retained, it should not be stigmatizing to individuals. Moving this diagnosis away from the mental and behavioral chapter was generally supported.
