New-found germ plasm has been also described in previtellogenic sturgeon oocytes as Balbani cytoplasm. It contains precursors of germinal granules so called nuage. Germinal granules {{have been detected}} {{as a part of}} primordial gonocytes (PGCs) and according to some studies it play the role in the formation PGCs. PGCs are embryonic cells from which the gametes are differentiated. These cells has potential to transmit genetic information to the next generation. PGCs or subsequently spermatogonia therefore have the potential to be of value for gene banking and cryopreservation, particularly via the production of donor gametes with germ?line chimeras. Nevertheless the first step for successfully transplantation is visualization of PGCs. It is usually done using injection of GFP (green fluorescent protein) mRNA conjugated with mRNA, such as vasa and nanos, to the area of egg with PGC precursor localization (nuage) early after fertilization. Electron microscopic observation at this study revealed three main principal layers (a topmost alveolar layer, a <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> externa and a downmost layer as an <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> interna), a layer of cortical granules in unfertilized eggs and a perivitelline space in fertilized eggs; then germ plasm, containing nuage, which was dispersed only in the vegetal pole of ovulated sturgeon eggs. In addition, we observed formation interspace between the <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> externa and <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> interna.

40|$|Abstract. - The {{zebrafish}} (Danio rerio) is {{an extremely}} dynamic organ in which follicles undergo asynchronous development. The oocytes of zebrafish ovary are observed in various phases. The oocyte development of zebrafish was divided into four stages (primary growth, cortical alveolus-previtellogenic, vitellogenic and mature oocyte). Zebrafish follicles contain only a single layer of granulosa cells that are separated from the oocyte by the vitelline envelope (<b>zona</b> <b>radiata).</b> The follicular epithelium and theca of oocytes in zebrafish differentiates during the primary growth phase. Histological analysis revealed that the <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> is formed during the vitellogenic growth stage.

40|$|Environmental estrogens have {{recently}} caused great concern {{because of their}} ability to mimic natural hormones and influence vital endocrine functions in humans and wildlife. The induction of vitellogenin (Vtg) synthesis by environmental estrogens in viviparous vertebrates has been proposed as an effective and sensitive biomarker of estrogenicity. Immunochemical analysis of plasma from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) exposed to 4 -nonylphenol (NP) or to effluent from oil refinery treatment plant (ORTP), shows that NP and ORTP effluent induces Vtg and <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> proteins (Zrp) in a dose-dependent manner.

A requirement of 4 M urea {{to maintain the}} purified protein in soluble state rendered it unsuitable for biological studies. Purification of re-folded r-bmZPB without urea and devoid of lower molecular weight fragments was achieved by following an alternate meth-odology that involved purification of inclusion bodies to ho-mogeneity and solubilization {{in the presence of}} a low concen-tration of chaotropic agent (2 M urea) and high pH (pH 12). The solubilized protein was refolded in the presence of oxidized and reduced glutathione. The circular dichroism spectra re-vealed the presence of both a helical and b sheet components in the secondary structure of the refolded r-bmZPB. The binding of the refolded r-bmZPB to the spermatozoa was evaluated by an indirect immunofluorescence assay and also by direct binding of the biotinylated r-bmZPB. The binding was restricted to the principal segment of the acrosomal cap of capacitated bonnet monkey spermatozoa. In the acrosome-reacted spermatozoa a shift in the binding pattern of r-bmZPB was observed and it bound to the equatorial segment, postacrosomal domain, and midpiece region. Binding of biotinylated r-bmZPB was inhibited by cold r-bmZPB as well as by monoclonal and polyclonal an-tibodies generated against r-bmZPB.

40|$|The oocyte is the {{starting}} point for a new generation. Most of the machinery for DNA and protein synthesis needed for the developing embryo is made autonomously by the fertilized oocyte. However, in fish and in many other oviparous vertebrates, the major constituents of the egg, i. e. yolk and eggshell proteins, are synthesized in the liver and transported to the oocyte for uptake. Vitellogenesis, the process of yolk protein (vitellogenin) synthesis, transport, and uptake into the oocyte, and zonagenesis, the synthesis of eggshell <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> proteins, their transport and deposition by the maturing oocyte, are important aspects of oogenesis. The many molecular events involved in these processes require tight, coordinated regulation that is under strict endocrine control, with the female sex steroid hormone estradiol- 17 β in a central role. The ability of many synthetic chemical compounds to mimic this estrogen can lead to unscheduled hepatic synthesis of vitellogenin and <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> proteins, with potentially detrimental effects to the adult, the egg, the developing embryo and, hence, to the recruitment to the fish population.

The outer surface of the unfertilised egg was smooth, whereas the fertilised egg acquired a network of projections on the vegetal hemisphere. Moreover, different patterns of ornamentation on the egg surface were evident. This pattern of ornamentation varied with the progress of embryonic development. The micropyle of the C. gariepinus egg consisted of a funnel-shaped vestibule, from the bottom of which a cylindrical micropylar canal extended.

Cells were treated with doses of 1, 5, and 10 microM 4 -nonylphenol (4 -NP), o, p'-DDT, lindane ([gamma]-HCH), and bisphenol A (BPA), which all induced zr proteins and vitellogenin in an approximate dose-dependent manner. Hepatocytes were also treated with combinations of xenoestrogens at 1 or 2 microM, resulting in elevated levels of both zr proteins and vitellogenin, compared to single treatment. The estrogenic activity of the mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA) and its metabolites [alpha]-ZEA) and ss-zearalenol (ss-ZEA) ], with regard to zonagenesis and vitellogenesis, was assessed in this assay system. Mycotoxins were used at concentrations of 10, 100, or 1, 000 nM. All induced zr proteins and vitellogenin, with [alpha]-ZEA being the strongest inducer. When cells were treated with xenoestrogens or mycotoxins in combination with an estrogen receptor inhibitor (ICI 182, 780), the induction of both zr proteins and vitellogenin was inhibited in all cases. Thus, the reported estrogen effects are bonafide estrogen responses. <b>Zona</b> <b>radiata</b> proteins were more responsive than vitellogenin to both xenoestrogens and mycotoxins.

Compared to ovaries from wild specimens, in cultured S. senegalensis 1 the follicular layer showed the appearance of sialic acid (Neu 5 Ac) linked to Galβ 1, 3 GalNAc in perinucleolus stage and the lack of Neu 5 Acα 2, 6 Gal/GalNAc residues 2, the <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> expressed mannosylated glycans in cortical alveoli stage 3, the cortical alveoli, during the late vitellogenic phase, revealed the presence of Neu 5 AcGalβ 1, 3 GalNAc, Neu 5 Acα 2, 6 Gal/GalNAc as well as asialogalactosides 4, yolkglobules expressed mannosilated oligosaccharides only in the late vitelogenic phase 5, the oocyte nucleoplasm did not show sialilated and fucosilated glycans. These findings demonstrate that the glycan pattern of fish ovarian follicles is affected by culture-rearing conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{histology}} and ultrastructure of the ovarian maturation {{process in}} Caspian roach, Rutilus caspicus, was studied. A total 170 female specimens {{were collected from}} the Gharasoo River, Bandar Turkmen, the southern Caspian Sea to evaluate its maturation cycle. Based on the results, its ovarian follicle’s development could classified into six stages by distinct characteristics. Minimum and maximum diameter of oocytes were recorded in the chromatin-nucleolus and maturation stages as 56. 34 ± 3. 74 and 918. 83 ± 14. 82 µm, respectively. The <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> was observed from the cortical alveoli stage and its maximum diameter measured in the secondary vitellogenesis stage as 93. 11 ± 23. 0 µm. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) reached to its peak in mid-March and its sharp drop in the late April showed its spawning period from late March or early April {{till the end of}} April. A positive correlation was found between the GSI and HSI in the vitellogenesis stage. The results also revealed Caspian roach as iteroparous synchronous spawner...|$|E
40|$|Background, Aims and Scope. Man-made Endocrine Disruptors (EDs) range {{across all}} continents and oceans. Some {{geographic}} areas are potentially more threatened than others: {{one of these}} is the Mediterranean Sea. Levels of some xenobiotics are much higher here than in other seas and oceans. In this paper we review the final results of a project in which the hypothesis that Mediterranean top predator species (such as large pelagic fish and marine mammals) are potentially at risk due to EDs was investigated. Methods. In a four-year survey on the Mediterranean population of swordfish (Xiphias gladius), the potential toxicological effects of organochlorine compounds (OCs) on specimens of swordfish and tuna fish (Thunnus thynnus thynnus), caught in the spawning seasons from 1999 to 2002 in the Straits of Messina, Sicily (Italy), were investigated using vitellogenin (Vtg), <b>Zona</b> <b>radiata</b> proteins (Zrp), and cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) activities (EROD, BPMO). Tissues (skin and blubber) were obtained from Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis and Balaenoptera physalus from the western Ligurian Sea, between Corsica and the French-Italian coast, and Ionic Sea using biopsy darts launched with a crossbow. Benzo(α) pyrene monoxigenase (BPMO) activity was mesured in biopsies and cholrinated hydrocarbon levels were detected. Results and Discussion. We illustrate the need to develop and apply sensitive methodological tools, such as biomarkers (Vitellogenin, <b>Zona</b> <b>Radiata</b> proteins and CYP 1 A activities) for evaluation of toxicological risk in Xiphias gladius and Thunnus thynnus thynnus), and nondestructive biomarkers (CYP 1 A activities and fibroblast cell culture in skin biopsy), for the hazard assessment of threatened marine mammals species (Stenella coeruleoalba, Tursiops truncatus, Delphinus delphis and Balaenoptera physalus) exposed to EDs. Conclusion. The present research shows that: a) Vtg and Zrp can be used as diagnostic tools for fish stocks hazard assessment in the Mediterranean Sea; b) that CYP 1 A 1 (BPMO) induction in cetaceans skin biopsy may be an early sign of exposure to EDs such as OCs and a potential alert for transgenerational effects. Recommendation and Outlook. This research represents a warning signal of the potential reproductive alterations in marine top predators and suggest the need for continuous monitoring to avoid reductions in population and biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E
40|$|Macro- and {{microscopic}} ovarian {{features of}} Hemiodus microlepis, H. ternetzi and H. unimaculatus were analyzed. Based on these features we proposed an ovarian maturation scale. The nine {{stages of the}} preliminary macroscopic fieldwork scale were reduced to five after microscopic analysis of ovaries. The microscopic analysis indicated a group-synchronous oocyte development common to the three species that were characterized as iteroparous synchronous spawners with a total spawning type. The remarkable thickness of the <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> layer and the large size of vitellogenic oocytes of Hemiodus ternetzi distinguished this species from the others. Características macro- e microscópicas dos ovários de Hemiodus microlepis, H. ternetzi e H. unimaculatus foram analisadas. Com base nestas características foi proposta uma escala de maturação. Após a análise microscópica dos ovários, a escala macroscópica preliminar de nove estádios, utilizada em campo, foi reduzida a cinco. A análise microscópica indicou que o desenvolvimento grupo-sincrônico dos ovócitos foi comum às três espécies, caracterizadas como iteróparas de desova total. A notável espessura da zona pelúcida e o maior tamanho dos ovócitos vitelogênicos de Hemiodus ternetzi diferenciaram esta espécie das demais...|$|E
40|$|Human {{activity}} has spread trace amounts of chemically stable endocrine-disrupting pollutants throughout the biosphere. These compounds have generated a background level of estrogenic activity {{that needs to}} be assessed. Fish are adequate sentinels for feminization effects as male specimens are more sensitive than humans to exogenous estrogenic compounds. High mountain lakes, the most distant environments of continental areas, only receive semi-volatile compounds from atmospheric deposition. We analyzed the expression levels of estrogen-regulated genes in male fish from these mountain lakes in Europe. Incipient feminization involving expression of estrogen receptor and <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> genes revealed a widespread diffuse estrogenic impact. This effect was correlated with the concentrations of some organochlorine compounds in fish and was consistent with the persistent occurrence of these tropospheric pollutants in the most remote planet regions. These results should be of general concern given the increasing endocrine disruption effects in human populations. © 2015, Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.

40|$|In this study, the {{morphological}} and histological {{studies of}} male and female gonads in mudskipper, Periophthalmus waltoni Koumans, 1941 from Helleh estuary (Bushehr Province, southwestern Iran) were performed to determine its gonadal development stages and histo-morphological characteristics. Sampling was done from April 2010 to March 2011 and a total of 81 individuals were collected by hand net. The gonads of specimens were removed, their sexes determined and then fixed in 10 % formalin solution after checking their morphology and measuring their weights, lengths and widths. Six stages of gonadal development in females and four stages in males were determined based on macroscopic and microscopic observations and reproductive indices. In female, increasing of the ovary size is occurred because of the accumulation of yolk materials in oocytes, and in the last stages, little folding in ovary was observed. Formation of <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> and yolk granules in the third stage, and increasing thickness of this layer and yolk granules were observed from stage three to stage six. In male, gradual developments of the sperm cells were observed from stage one onward...|$|E
40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{development of}} the egg of the Perth herring, Nematalosa vlaminghi, has been related to the gross changes observed in the ovary. The patterns {{of change in the}} diameter of the oocyte, oocyte nucleus, yolk vesicles and yolk granules and the thickness of the theca, granulosa and <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> have been quantified. Three modes were present in frequency histograms of the diameter of oocytes in sexually-mature females, two of which corresponded to opaque and hyaline yolked-oocytes. The mean number of hyaline oocytes was 20430, which represented 35 % of the mean number of all yolked oocytes (57610). Seasonal trends in gonadosomatic indices, together with the changes in the macroscopic and microscopic condition of the ovaries, demonstrated that spawning activity reached a peak in December-January. The place of capture of mature animals and 0 + recruits showed that breeding occurred near the top end of the upper estuary. During the ensuing weeks, the young fish dispersed throughout the upper and middle estuary while the older fish moved out to sea...|$|E

Nominal exposure concentrations were 6 ng l- 1 EE 2, 0. 3 % v/v or 0. 03 % v/v sewage effluent. The fish were bred using within treatment crosses during the final weeks of the exposures. At {{the end of the}} breeding trials expression of hepatic <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> protein (Zrp) and vitellogenin (Vtg) mRNA were determined using two newly developed cDNA probes, and were used to indicate oestrogenic exposure. Exposure to 6 ng l- 1 EE 2 induced Zrp and Vtg mRNA expression in male and female sand goby, impaired male maturation and reproductive behaviour, reduced female fecundity, egg fertility and reduced fertile egg production of the exposed population by approximately 95 %. Exposure to sewage effluent (0. 3 % v/v) caused increased mortality, increased female Zrp and Vtg mRNA expression, and reduced population egg production by approximately 45 % compared to 0. 03 % v/v effluen...|$|E
40|$|Juvenile {{rainbow trout}} were given {{intraperitoneal}} (IP) injections of (i) octylphenol (OP) and butylbenzylphthalate (BBP) or (ii) octylphenol and estradiol (E). Both pairs of compounds were administered singly and in combination, at two different dose levels. Modulation of the hepatic estradiol receptor (ER) binding capacity and induction of hepatic <b>zona</b> <b>radiata</b> proteins (Zrp) were utilised {{as indicators of}} estrogenic effect. In treatment (i) OP caused a significant (approx 2 -fold) upregulation of the ER and a significant (approx 3 - 5 fold) increase in Zrp at both doses compared to control, vehicle-injected fish. In contrast, {{no effect on the}} ER was observed in BBP-treated fish, but plasma Zrp levels were significantly reduced. No synergistic effect was observed on ER modulation or Zrp induction in fish receiving OP and BBP in combination. In treatment (ii) both OP and E caused a significant (approx 2 -fold) upregulation of the ER and a significant (approx 6 - 7 fold) increase in plasma Zrp at both dose levels compared to controls. The effect of OP and E in combination, on both ER modulation and induction of Zrp, was additive and not synergistic...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 4501 A (CYP 1 A) monoxygenase, {{vitellogenin}} (Vtg) and <b>Zona</b> <b>radiata</b> proteins (Zrp) {{are frequently}} used as biomarkers of fish exposure to organic contaminants. In this work, swordfish liver sections {{obtained from the}} Mediterranean Sea, the South African coasts (South Atlantic and South Western Indian Oceans) and the Central North Pacific Ocean were immunostained with antisera against CYP 1 A, Zrp, and Vtg. CYP 1 A induction was found in hepatocytes, epithelium of the biliary ductus and the endothelium of large blood vessels of fish from the Mediterranean Sea and South African waters, but not from the Pacific Ocean. Zrp and Vtg were immunolocalized in hepatocytes of male swordfish from the Mediterranean Sea and from South African waters. Plasma Dot-Blot analysis, performed in Mediterranean and Pacific specimens, revealed the presence of Zrp and Vtg in males from Mediterranean but not from Pacific. These results confirm previous findings about the potential exposure of Mediterranean swordfish to endocrine, disrupting chemicals and raise questions concerning the possible presence of xenobiotic contaminants off the Southern coasts of South Africa in both the South Atlantic and South Western Indian Oceans...|$|E
