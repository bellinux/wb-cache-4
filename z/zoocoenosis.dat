50|$|Zootope is {{the total}} habitat {{available}} for colonisation within any certain ecotope or biotope by animal life. The community of animals so established constitutes the <b>zoocoenosis</b> of that ecotope.|$|E
40|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna {{associated with}} littoral sandy substrata in the volcanic Lake Bracciano (Italy), utilized as water supply {{for the city}} of Rome, was analysed for one year in twelve sampling stations distributed along the entire lacustrine perimeter. The <b>zoocoenosis</b> comprised 103 identified taxa mainly belonging to oligochaetes, chironomids, nematodes and cladocerans. Oligochaetes and nematodes accounted for most of the collected organisms (76 %), followed by a high proportion of copepods (13 %). Several other smaller but important groups ensured the diversification of the community. The analysis of a series of simple parameters (diversity indices, NIT ratio, densities of bioindicator taxa), that previous investigations revealed as useful for quality monitoring, provided a diagnosis of acceptable water quality in the marginal area ofthe lake, and contributed to indicating a mesotrophic condition...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{of the relationships}} between the form of grazing land or pasture—a form that is expressed by its architecture in the ecosystem—and the dynamics of discharge in the pasture used by cattle. The objective of searching and demonstrating relationships of this nature is to establish a conceptual framework that will help the phytogeneticist make decisions on the improvement of species destined for pasture. The first part of this study analyzes pasture architecture with regard to the form of phytocoenosis and the design of improved forms. Also presented is a general function of architecture that allows a description of plant form. The second part of the study describes and compares diverse discharge models. These models are applicable to specific processes of a biotic and abiotic nature. From this background, one deduces a general function of pasture discharge that is analyzed in its turn as a forage flow from phytocoenosis to <b>zoocoenosis.</b> Some parameters related to discharge such as grazing intensity and use intensity, as well as ecological cost of the harvest, are included in the study. Finally, the discharge of an annual Mediterranean meadow is described {{as an example of the}} process...|$|E
40|$|Spring bloom of cold-water centric and pennate diatoms was {{observed}} in two {{different areas of the}} southeastern Barents Sea in April 2000 : ice-free waters off the Kolguev Island northern shelf and the eastern Pechora Sea near the Karskie Vorota (Kara Gate) Straight in polynyas and ice-free patches in one-year-old ice. Maximal values of phytoplankton abundance and biomass were found at the ice edge. The bloom was localized in shallow water areas with depths less than 50 m in mixing zones of waters of different origin: warm Atlantic, cold coastal, and Arctic (Litke current) waters. Ice melting was among factors inducing the phytoplankton bloom. Each area had a specific phytocoenosis, whose structure was determined by water origin and ice conditions. In the western Kara Sea, under a solid (up to 30 cm thick) ice cover (i. e., under conditions of a hydrological winter), a spring phytoplankton succession {{was observed}} from its initial stage. In areas located close to the ice-cover edge, simultaneously with the mass phytoplankton bloom, the early spring <b>zoocoenosis</b> development manifested itself in mass spawning of euphausiids and mass appearance of Cirripedia nauplii and bottom polychaete larvae...|$|E
40|$|Infernão Lake, {{located within}} the Jataí Ecological Station in Luiz Antônio Municipal {{district}} (São Paulo State, Brazil), {{is one of the}} most typical ox-bow lake of the Mogi-Guaçu River, and it presents, as the main feature, its great quantity of aquatic macrophytes, whose intensive development, in the last years practically covered the whole mirror of water. With the purpose to point out the compo-sition and to establish the relative participation of the phytophilic <b>zoocoenosis</b> that inhabits the different macrophytes of that lake, a collection program of the main vegetation stands was established. The collections, were carried out randomly, during dry season (1994), in stands of Salvinia auriculata, Utricularia sp., Cabomba piauhyensis, Eichhornia azurea and Scirpus cubensis being used specific methodology for each vegetable type. The analysis of the different macrophytes showed the pres-ence of 4, 130 macroinvertebrates of 28 families, in which Chironomidae (Diptera) and Naididae (Oligo-chaeta) were the most representative, contributing on the average with 51 % and 25 % of the total fauna. Asheum, Beardius, Chironomus, Goeldichironomus, Parachironomus and Polypedilum were the most abundant Chironomidae genera. Species of the genus Dero (Dero) and D. (Aulophorus) represented the most typical Naididae of the phytofauna. With clear faunistic gradient from the shore to the cente...|$|E
