5000|$|Well, I guess I {{experiment}} {{more than}} I think I do. I had a <b>Zoom</b> <b>box</b> in my control room {{one day and}} I was mucking about with something. Suddenly, I thought I should stick the E-bow on the strings and see what would happen. It sounded great, so we started writing a little duet for the E-bowed acoustic guitar Gibson J-200 and a keyboard. We never finished the piece, but Jon Carin keyboardistdecided to sample the E-bowed guitar part. We kept the sample and ended up {{using it as a}} loop on [...] "Take It Back", and again on [...] "Keep Talking". David Gilmour, 1994 ...|$|E

40|$|The domain {{is always}} a {{rectangular}} box, either {{because it is the}} physical domain or because it is the numerical zoom. The selection of the numerical zoom is done by the user within the public domain visualization software medit. A patch to the software has been written for us by P. Frey which allows to select a region with the mouse. Then the automatic triangulation of the zoom domain is done within the open source tool freefem 3 D and the boundary condition u_ 2 = 0 are applied automatically on the <b>zoom</b> bounding <b>box.</b> Therefore the mesh in the zoom region {{has nothing to do with}} the mesh at one level up. The computation of the integrals in the variational formulations involves products of functions defined on different meshes; quadrature points are used within each element of both triangulations...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{orbits of}} stars and dark matter out to three {{effective}} radii for 42 galaxies formed in cosmological <b>zoom</b> simulations. <b>Box</b> orbits always dominate at the centers and z-tubes become important at larger radii. We connect the orbital structure to the formation histories and specific features (e. g. disk, counter-rotating core, minor axis rotation) in two-dimensional kinematic maps. Globally, fast rotating galaxies with significant recent in situ star formation are dominated by z-tubes. Slow rotators with recent mergers have significant box orbit and x-tube components. Rotation, quantified by the λ_R-parameter often originates from streaming motion of stars on z-tubes but sometimes from figure rotation. The observed anti-correlation of h_ 3 and V_ 0 / σ in rotating galaxies can be connected to a dissipative formation history leading to high z-tube fractions. For galaxies with recent mergers in situ formed stars, accreted stars and dark matter particles populate similar orbits. Dark matter particles have isotropic velocity dispersions. Accreted stars are typically radially biased (β≈ 0. 2 - 0. 4). In situ stars become tangentially biased (as low as β≈ - 1. 0) if dissipation was relevant during the late assembly of the galaxy. We discuss the relevance of our analysis for integral field surveys and for constraining galaxy formation models. Comment: 21 pages, 19 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Chart Update Mash up (ChUM™) {{consists}} of various APIs/Technologies that when brought together allow for intuitive georeferenced visualization of the Critical Chart Updates {{published by the}} Office of Coast Survey (OCS). Each component of ChUM™ will be described in this paper with an explanation of how each piece works together to form ChUM™. Figure 1 shows the basic building blocks that make up ChUM™. At {{the base of the}} structure (in blue) is the data that OCS disseminates to the public via its website/web-services: Raster Nautical Charts, the CRIT data (critical corrections to the chart), and the Coast Pilot. There are three 3 rd party API’s (Application Programming Interface) /plug-ins that are used: the Google Maps API v 3, the DataTables plug-in, and the NauticalChartsAPI (NCAPI). The NCAPI is an API created by the University of California, San Diego’s Coastal Observing Research and Development Center (CORDC) and it deals directly with fetching and preparing the Raster Nautical charts for use in Google Maps. The DataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery JavaScript library and it is populated with data from the OCS CRIT data. The NauticalChartsAPI UI (User Interface), NCAPIUI, was created by combining the NCAPI, DataTables, and the Coast Pilot data into one API that contained widgets for an intuitive interface that is similar in look and function as the Google Maps widgets. Google Map API is used for its geo-referenced environment and for its familiar controls that are built-in: namely, the panning, <b>zooming,</b> markers/info <b>boxes</b> and various background-overlay options...|$|R
