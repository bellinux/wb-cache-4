A {{systematic}} theoretical {{study of}} 4 d transition metal nitride, PdN {{has been carried}} out using ab initio full potential LAPW method (FP-LAPW) within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). PdN crystallizes in <b>zinc-blende</b> <b>structure,</b> which is found to be most stable one. We have calculated the ground state properties in terms of lattice constant (a 0), Bulk modulus (B 0) and its Pressure derivative (B 0 ’). The electronic properties such as band structure and density of states reveal that PdN is metallic in nature with large overlap of Pd-d electron at Fermi level. The elastic constant are in good agreement with previous theoretical results for <b>zinc-blende</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|E

Gallium oxynitride nanowire was directly observed {{to have a}} biphasic wurtzite and <b>zinc-blende</b> <b>structure.</b> There was a stacking disorder of several atomic layers between the two phases.

40|$|We {{prove that}} CdS nanocrystals can be {{thermodynamically}} stabilized in both wurtzite and zinc-blende crystallographic phases at will, {{just by the}} proper choice of the capping ligand. As a striking demonstration of this, the largest CdS nanocrystals (similar to 15 nm diameter) ever formed with the <b>zinc-blende</b> <b>structure</b> have been synthesized at a high reaction temperature of 310 degrees C, in contrast to previous reports suggesting the formation of zinc-blende CdS only in the small size limit (< 4. 5 nm) or at a lower reaction temperature (<= 240 degrees C). Theoretical analysis establishes that the binding energy of trioctylphosphine molecules on the (001) surface of zinc-blende CdS is significantly larger than that {{for any of the}} wurtzite planes. Consequently, trioctylphosphine as a capping agent stabilizes the zinc-blende phase via influencing the surface energy that {{plays an important role in}} the overall energetics of a nanocrystal.

30|$|In small {{diameter}} III–V nanowires (NWs), {{where the}} surface-to-volume ratio is rather large, one can expect surface effects {{in addition to}} effects caused by quantum confinement to govern properties of these NWs. It {{is also important to}} trace a link between morphology and different properties of such NWs in order to open a way to their integration in various applications [1, 2]. Even though in most cases III–V compounds have the <b>zinc-blende</b> <b>structure,</b> in the case of NWs both the zinc-blende and wurtzite structures are observed [2] because of larger density of surface dangling bonds for the <b>zinc-blende</b> <b>structure</b> as confirmed by first principles calculations [3 - 10]. However, high quality NWs in the <b>zinc-blende</b> <b>structure</b> mainly oriented along the 〈 111 〉 directions can be grown by different methods involving the vapor-liquid-solid and vapor-solid growth mechanisms [1, 2, 11]. It is found that their cross section is hexagonal with { 011 } or { 112 } facets [12 - 20], while a triangular-like morphology with { 112 } facets can also occur [15 - 17, 21]. Theoretical predictions on stability of zinc-blende GaP, GaAs, InP and InAs NWs showed that they were close in total energy independently of morphology [3 - 10]. Moreover, investigations of electronic properties of bare GaAs, InP and InAs NWs, which had only { 011 } facets, indicated metallic properties because the Fermi level crossed some bands originated from states of surface atoms at edges [3, 5, 10, 22]. However, passivation of dangling bonds by different chemical species was widely used to investigate a band-gap variation with NW diameter [7, 8, 22 - 27], while bare zinc-blende NWs with { 112 } facets and any bare wurtzite NW turned out to be semiconductors without passivation [3, 5, 9, 10].|$|E
