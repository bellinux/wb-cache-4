50|$|Patients {{whom are}} {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma have approximately 80-100% chance of developing bone complications {{due to an}} increase in activity and/or formation of osteoclasts and a decrease activity of osteoblasts.

40|$|Background: <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> is used {{to prevent}} the bone loss {{associated}} with antioestrogen treatments in subjects with breast cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> may have anticancer activity in its own right. This anticancer possibility with <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> has not been investigated extensively in clinical trials. Objectives/methods: This evaluation is of a large clinical trial that investigated the effect of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> on cancer outcomes in premenopausal women with breast cancer.

40|$|Previous studies {{suggested}} that bisphosphonate <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> exerts an antitumor effect by {{interacting with the}} microenvironment. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism behind the anti-breast cancer effect of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid.</b> Here we showed that <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> did not influence in vitro human breast cancer cell survival, but did affect human stromal cell survival. Breast cancer cell death in co-culture with stromal cells was analyzed in vitro by fluorescent microscopy and flowcytometry analysis. In co-culture, the addition of stromal cells to breast cancer cells induced tumor cell death by <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> which was abolished by transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta. In the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane model, <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> reduced the breast cancer cells fraction per tumor only {{in the presence of}} human stromal cells. <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> decreased TGF-beta excretion by stromal cells and co-cultures. Moreover, supernatant of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> treated stromal cells reduced phospho-Smad 2 protein levels in breast cancer cells.

40|$|Introduction: The {{effect of}} <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> a potent and novel bisphosphonate, on tooth {{movement}} and orthodontically induced root resorption in osteoporotic animals systemically treated with <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> as similarly used in postmenopausal patients {{has not been}} elucidated. Therefore, this study was undertaken. Methods: Fifteen 10 -week-old female Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: ovariectomy, ovariectomy + <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> and control. Only the ovariectomy and ovariectomy + <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> groups underwent ovariectomies. Two weeks after the ovariectomy, <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> was administered only to the ovariectomy + <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> group. Four weeks after the ovariectomy, 25 -g nickel-titanium closed-coil springs were applied to observe tooth movement and orthodontically induced root resorption. Results: There were {{significant differences in the}} amounts of tooth movement and orthodontically induced root resorption between the ovariectomy and the control groups, and also between the ovariectomy and the ovariectomy + <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> groups. There was no statistically significant difference in tooth movement and orthodontically induced root resorption between the ovariectomy + <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and the control groups. <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited significantly more tooth movement and significantly reduced the severity of orthodontically induced root resorption in the ovariectomized rats. The ovariectomy + <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> group showed almost the same results as did the control group in both tooth movement and orthodontically induced root resorption. Conclusions: <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits excessive orthodontic tooth movement and also reduces the risk of severe orthodontically induced root resorption in ovariectomized rats. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 612 号 学位授与年月日:平成 25 年 9 月 19 日Author: Irin Sirisoontorn, Hitoshi Hotokezaka, Megumi Hashimoto, Carmen Gonzales, Suwannee Luppanapornlarp, M.

40|$|Background: In non-small cell {{lung cancer}} (NSCLC) KRAS-mutant status is a {{negative}} prognostic and predictive factor. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates inhibit prenylation of small G-proteins (e. g. Ras, Rac, Rho) and thus may affect proliferation and migration. In our preclinical work, we investigated the effect of an aminobisphosphonate compound (<b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid)</b> on mutant and wild type KRAS-expressing human NSCLC cell lines. Material and methods: Membrane association of K-Ras was examined by Western-blot. In vitro cell viability, apoptotic cell death and migration were measured in NSCLC lines with different molecular background. The in vivo effect of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> was investigated in a SCID mouse subcutaneous xenograft model. Results: We confirmed that <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> was unable to inhibit the prenylation of mutant K-Ras unlike in the case of wild type K-Ras. In case of in vitro proliferation, the KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cell lines showed resistance to <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> wild-type KRAS-cells proved to be sensitive. Combinatory application of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> enhanced the cytostatic effect of cisplatin. <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> did not induce significant apoptosis. In xenograft model, <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> significantly reduced the weight of wild type KRAS-EGFR expressing xenograft tumor by decreasing the proliferative capacity. Futhermore, <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> induced VEGF expression and improved in vivo tumor vascularization. Conclusions: The in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effect of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> was based on the blockade of cell cycle in wild-type KRAS expressing human NSCLC cells. The <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> induced vascularization supported in vivo cytostatic effect. Our preclinical investigation suggests that patients with wild type KRAS-expressing NSCLC could potentially benefit from aminobisphosphonate therapy. ...|$|E

40|$|Bisphosphonates {{have played}} an {{important}} role in the treatment of breast cancer, mainly in patients with bone metastasis, by reducing the risk of fracture, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia. <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> the most frequently used intravenous agent, has been traditionally administered on a monthly dosing schedule.

40|$|Previous {{data suggest}} that {{lipophilic}} statins such as fluvastatin and N-bisphosphonates such as <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> both inhibitors of the mevalonate metabolic pathway, have anti-cancer effects in vitro and in patients.

Both <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and fluvastatin showed activity in the ATP-TCA against breast and ovarian cancer, though fluvastatin alone was less active, particularly against breast cancer. The combination of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and fluvastatin was more active than either single agent in the ATP-TCA with some synergy against breast and ovarian cancer tumour-derived cells.

40|$|Bone metastases {{represent}} common {{long term}} complications {{of patients with}} breast cancer. <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> an amino-bisphosphonate and mevalonate pathway inhibitor, is an established agent {{for the treatment of}} bone metastases. Direct antitumor effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> have been proposed in breast cancer. Statins are another group of mevalonate pathway inhibitors that have been repeatedly discussed for potential anti-tumor activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis, whether these agents regulate adhesion of breast cancer cells to extracellular matrix components. Treatment of breast cancer cells with <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and atorvastatin, significantly impaired MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cell adhesion on the αvβ 3 ligands gelatin and vitronectin, but had no effect on collagen type 1 (α 2 β 1 -ligand) and fibronectin (α 5 β 1 -ligand). Anti-adhesive effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> were fully reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP). Furthermore, effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and atorvastatin were mimicked by a specific inhibitor of geranylgeranylation GGTI- 298. Functional (using integrin array) and quantitative (using FACS) integrin analyses on MDA- 231 cells following <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> exposure revealed decreased levels of αv and αvβ 3 expression. In addition to its effects on integrin mediated adhesion of breast cancer cells, the presence of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> caused pronounced morphological changes in MDA- 231 cells as seen by F-actin and vinculin rearrangement. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase was inhibited by <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid.</b> In both cases, changes were fully reversed by GGPP. These results emphasize the role of mevalonate pathway mediated impairment of geranylgeranylation in the anti-adhesive effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> in breast cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{a highly}} {{effective}} treatment in Paget's disease for persistent bone pain and prevention of further progression of the disease. The commonest electrolyte abnormality is hypocalcemia. To {{the best of our}} knowledge this is the first case of hyperkalemia secondary to <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> to be published in the world literature. The commonest arrhythmia related to <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> is atrial fibrillation. Case presentation We describe the case of an 80 -year-old Caucasian man, with a history of ischemic heart disease, who had an in-hospital cardiac arrest related to hyperkalemia. Increasing potassium levels were noted following his first <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> infusion for symptomatic control of bone pain secondary to Paget's disease. Our patient suffered a cardiac arrest 10 days following the <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> infusion. Our patient's biochemistry and electrocardiogram output were monitored until his death 26 days after his cardiac arrest. Our patient developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the post-resuscitation period and there was persistent hyperkalemia that required prolonged treatment with calcium resonium. All other possible causes of hyperkalemia were excluded. Conclusion In our patient's case persistent hyperkalemia and life-threatening arrhythmias were associated with use of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid.</b> These side effects have not been reported before and the causative mechanism is far from clear as there are no obvious systemic effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid.</b> The combination of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> with predisposing factors such as structural heart disease might account for the clinical picture we witnessed. As a result, electrolyte monitoring should be adopted early in <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> use. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism of hyperkalemia and identify the target group of patients where <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> can be safely administered. Great caution is advised in patients with underlying heart conditions. </p...|$|E

However, its use in extraskeletal malignancy is limited due to rapid uptake and accumulation within bone. Polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C) ] is a synthetic double-stranded RNA with direct antitumor cytotoxicity if it can be delivered to tumor cells intracellularly. Methods: Cationic lipid-coated calcium phosphate nanoparticles (LCP) were developed to enable intracellular codelivery of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and poly (I:C). LCP codelivering <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and poly (I:C) were prepared using an ethanol injection method. Briefly, the ethanol solution of lipids was rapidly injected into newly formed calcium phosphate crystals containing poly (I:C) and <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> and the mixture was then sonicated briefly to form LCP. The LCP were fully characterized for mean diameter size and zeta potential, efficiency in loading <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> cytotoxic effect in a B 16 BL 6 melanoma cell line in vitro, and antitumor effect in B 16 BL 6 melanoma-bearing mice. Results: LCP with a mean diameter around 200 nm and a narrow size distribution (polydispersity index 0. 17) and high <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> encapsulation efficiency (94 %) were achieved. LCP loaded with <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and poly (I:C) had significantly greater antitumor activity than the free drugs in the B 16 BL 6 melanoma cell line (P &lt; 0. 05). Furthermore, codelivery of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and poly (I:C) by LCP had higher cytotoxicity than delivering poly (I:C) alone by LCP (P &lt; 0. 05), indicating a synergism between <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and poly (I:C). Finally, the antitumor study in melanoma-bearing mice also demonstrated synergism between <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and poly (I:C) codelivered by LCP. Conclusion: Cationic lipid-coated calcium phosphate nanoparticles constructed for codelivery of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and double-stranded RNA poly (I:C) had better antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.

All patients had fever during the first 6 to 48 hours after the first infusion. There were no renal side effects, apart from asymptomatic hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia at 48 and 72 hours after <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> infusion. The minimal clinical side effects were easily manageable. (Med J Indones 2008; 17 : 127 - 30) Keywords: <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> osteogenesis imperfecta, side effects </p...|$|E
40|$|Bisphosphonates {{are well}} {{established}} {{in the management of}} breast-cancer-induced bone disease. Recent studies have suggested that these compounds are effective in preventing the development of bone metastases. However, it is unclear whether this reflects an indirect effect via an inhibition of bone resorption or a direct anti-tumour effect. The breast cancer cell lines, MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of the bisphosphonate, <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> for varying time periods, in {{the presence or absence of}} paclitaxel. The effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> were determined by assessing cell number and rate of apoptosis by evaluating changes in nuclear morphology and using a fluorescence nick translation assay. <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in cell number (P< 0. 001) and a concomitant increase in tumour cell apoptosis (P< 0. 005). Short-term exposure to <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> was sufficient to cause a significant reduction in cell number and increase in apoptosis (P< 0. 05). These effects could be prevented by incubation with geranyl geraniol, suggesting that zoledronic acid-induced apoptosis is mediated by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway. Treatment with <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and clinically achievable concentrations of paclitaxel resulted in a 4 – 5 -fold increase in tumour cell apoptosis (P< 0. 02). Isobologram analysis revealed synergistic effects on tumour cell number and apoptosis when <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> and paclitaxel were combined. Short-term treatment with <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid,</b> which closely resembles the clinical setting, has a clear anti-tumour effect on breast cancer cells. Importantly, the commonly used anti-neoplastic agent, paclitaxel, potentiates the anti-tumour effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid.</b> These data suggest that, in addition to inhibiting bone resorption, <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> has a direct anti-tumour activity on breast cancer cells in vitro. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is widely}} used as {{adjuvant}} chemotherapy {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer. However, previous trials reported inconsistent findings regarding their clinical efficacy and safety. We carried out a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> on disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and drug-related toxicities. Methodology and Principal Findings: We systematically searched Medline, EmBase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists of articles and proceedings of major meetings for relevant literatures with a time limit of Dec. 1, 2011. Randomized controlled trials evaluated the effects of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> on OS, DFS, and RFS compared with control were eligible for inclusion in our research. Of 175 identified studies, we collected data from 7 randomized controlled trials of <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> that had OS, DFS, and RFS reported as one of the endpoint. Overall, we noted that patients receiving <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> therapy had significant longer OS than the group with non-zoledronic acid therapy (HR, 0. 85, 95 %CI, 0. 73 to 1. 00, P = 0. 047). Furthermore, <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> therapy also had a clear effect on frature events (RR, 0. 66, 95 %CI, 0. 52 to 0. 84, P, 0. 001). Subgroup analysis indicated that <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> therapy showed a great beneficial effect on disease recurrence in patients with early-stage breast cancer, however, it also significantly increased the harm of disease recurrence in patients with advanced breast cancer. Bone pain, neutropenic fever, pyrexia, rash were more frequent in the <b>zoledronic</b> <b>acid</b> therap...|$|E
