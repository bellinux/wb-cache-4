Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, <b>zinc</b> <b>dust,</b> or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{study on}} PVC-based {{materials}} (PVC = poly (vinyl chloride)) pyrolysis; {{in the presence}} of various amounts of steelmaking dust was performed. Dust from steel manufacture employing zinc plated scrap contains a considerable amount of zinc oxide (ZnO) and its utilization in metallurgy is quite complicated. However, the dust can react with hydrogen chloride (HCl) released from heated PVC in the temperature range of 200 – 400 °C. Material balance of the pyrolysis process was studied by thermogravimetry, and the data obtained were compared with the results of larger laboratory oven experiments. In excess of PVC, the amount of captured HCl stoichiometrically corresponds to the content of ZnO; additional HCl is probably captured by FeCl 2, while FeCl 3 is not formed at elevated temperatures. In excess of the dust, the captured amount of HCl is approximately 100 %. The suggested co-pyrolysis seems to be a promising method to prevent the formation of dangerous chlorinated organic compounds during the thermal treatment of waste PVC.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a feasibility study of recycling manganese furnace dust generated in production of ferromanganese and silicomanganese at Tasmanian Electrometallurgical Company, Australia. Dried man-ganese furnace dust contains about 20 wt % of carbon, in average 33. 4 wt % of manganese and 1. 3 wt % of zinc. Manganese in the dust {{is in the form}} of MnO, Mn 3 O 4 and MnCO 3; zinc is mainly in the form of ZnO and ZnSO 4. Analysis of the <b>zinc</b> balance with <b>dust</b> recycling showed that to keep zinc intake at the acceptable level, it should be partly removed from the dust. In the reduction laboratory experiments, zinc oxide was reduced to zinc vapour by tar of the <b>dust.</b> Reduction of <b>zinc</b> oxide started at 800 oC and zinc removal rate increased with increasing temperature; removal of zinc was close to completion at 1100 oC. Optimal conditions for removing <b>zinc</b> from the <b>dust</b> include temperature in the range 1000 - 1150 oC, inert gas atmosphere and furnace dust frac-tion in the furnace dust-manganese ore mixture above 60 %. In the sintering of manganese ore with addition of manganese dust in the sintering pot, zinc was reoxidised and deposited in the sinter bed. Removal of zinc in the sintering pot tests was in the range 4 - 17 %. Up to 30 % zinc removal was achieved from the bottom layer of the sinter bed. It can be concluded that zinc removal will be low during the processing of manganese fur-nace dust in the sinter plant. The zinc removal rate will be the highest when pelletised manganese furnace dust is added to the bottom layer of the sintering bed...|$|R

Altogether 133 workers had been employed by the company from the time production was started in 1948 {{until the end of}} 1972. Workers with more than three years employment were included in the study, and three cases of bronchial carcinoma were found among the 24 workers who fulfilled this requirement. Based on the data of the Cancer Registry of Norway the risk of bronchial cancer for a corresponding group of the general population was found to be 0. 079, which gives a risk ratio for exposed workers of approximately 38. The average age of the cancer patients was as low as 50 years at the time of diagnosis.
