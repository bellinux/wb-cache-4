40|$|Abstract Poly(acrylic acid) + <b>zinc</b> <b>diacetate</b> hybrid com-posites {{have been}} {{prepared}} by precipitation from aqueous solutions and drying. The lowest glass transition tempera-ture Tg determined by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) is 392 °C, providing a service temperature range un-usually large for polymer-based materials (PBMs). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that thermal de-composition begins some 10 – 20 K above each Tg. The al-ternating current impedance was determined in the nitro-gen atmosphere from 370 °C to 530 °C. Dynamic dielectric measurements were performed between 20 °C and 350 °C, also under nitrogen. In contrast to typical PBMs, {{there is evidence of}} ionic conduction in some of the composites. The dynamic dielectric properties depend on the composi-tion. The materials obtained are usable in medical applica-tions and as high durability low friction coatings.
