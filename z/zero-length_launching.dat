50|$|Thrust {{augmentation}} {{has taken}} many forms, most commonly to supplement inadequate take-off thrust. Some early jet aircraft needed rocket assistance {{to take off}} from high altitude airfields or when the day temperature was high. A more recent aircraft, the Tupolev Tu-22 supersonic bomber, was fitted with four SPRD-63 boosters for take-off. Possibly the most extreme requirement needing rocket assistance, and which was short-lived, was <b>zero-length</b> <b>launching.</b> Almost as extreme, but very common, is catapult assistance from aircraft carriers. Rocket assistance has also been used during flight. The SEPR 841 booster engine was used on the Dassault Mirage for high altitude interception.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Air Force, the Bundeswehr's Luftwaffe, and the Soviets' VVS all {{conducted}} {{experiments in}} <b>zero-length</b> <b>launching.</b> The first manned aircraft to be ZELL-launched was an F-84G in 1955. The Soviets' main interest in ZELL was for point defense-format protection of airfields and critical targets using MiG-19s. The American tests with the F-84s started with using the Martin MGM-1 Matador solid-fuel boost motor of some 240 kilonewton (52,000 lbf) thrust output, which burned out seconds after ignition and dropped {{away from the}} manned fighter {{a second or two}} later; the larger F-100 Super Sabre and MiG-19/SM-30 [...] "Farmer" [...] tests (with the SM-30 using the Soviet-design PRD-22R booster unit) used similar short-burn solid fueled boost motors, of much more powerful 600 kN (135,000 lbf) thrust-class output levels. [...] All works upon ZELL aircraft were abandoned due to logistical concerns and the increasing efficiency of guided missiles.|$|E

50|$|Two similar <b>zero-length</b> <b>launch</b> {{experimental}} {{programs were}} {{carried out by the}} US Air Force and by the Soviet VVS at around the same time in the late 1950s, both using high-thrust, short burn duration booster designs of very similar appearance and function. The US Air Force used a modified Republic F-84, designated EF-84G, which used the MGM-1 Matador cruise missile's solid fuel booster. The Soviet VVS used a modified MiG-19 fighter, designated SM-30, launched from a special launcher, and using a nearly identical solid-fueled rocket booster design to that of the EF-84G. The F-100 and F-104 were also used for <b>zero-length</b> <b>launch</b> experiments.|$|R
50|$|The <b>zero-length</b> <b>launch</b> {{system or}} <b>zero-length</b> {{take-off}} system (ZLL, ZLTO, ZEL, ZELL) was a system whereby jet fighters and attack aircraft {{were intended to}} be placed on rockets attached to mobile launch platforms. Most zero length launch experiments took place in the 1950s, during the Cold War.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the <b>zero-length</b> <b>launch</b> concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|R
5|$|EF-84E: Two F-84Es were {{converted}} into test prototypes, to test various methods of air-to-air refueling. EF-84E 49-2091 {{was used as}} a probe-and-drogue test aircraft. The probe was mid-span on the port wing. Production aircraft with probes (removable) had the probe fitted to the auxiliary wing tanks. EF-84E 49-2115 {{was used as a}} FICON test aircraft with a B-36 host. EF-84E 49-1225 and EF-84E 51-634 were test aircraft for the ZELMAL (<b>Zero-length</b> <b>launch,</b> Mat landing) experiments version for point defense, used the booster rocket from MGM-1 Matador cruise missile.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of a <b>zero-length</b> <b>launch</b> system is {{the elimination of the}} need for a vulnerable airfield for takeoffs. In the event of a sudden attack, air forces could field effective air defenses and launch airstrikes even with their own airbases destroyed. Although launching aircraft using rocket boosters proved to be relatively trouble-free, if aircraft were required to land at the same base, a runway was still required. Bulky mobile launching platforms also proved to be expensive to operate and difficult to transport. Security would also have been an issue with mobile launchers, especially if equipped with nuclear-armed strike fighters.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, the British {{developed}} mixed-power jet designs employing both rocket and {{jet engines}} {{to cover the}} performance gap that existed in turbojet designs. The rocket was the main engine for delivering the speed and height required for high-speed interception of high-level bombers and the turbojet gave increased fuel economy {{in other parts of}} flight, most notably to ensure the aircraft was able to make a powered landing rather than risking an unpredictable gliding return. The Saunders-Roe SR.53 was a successful design, and was planned for production when economics forced the British to curtail most aircraft programs in the late 1950s. Furthermore, rapid advancements in jet engine technology rendered mixed-power aircraft designs like Saunders-Roe's SR.53 (and the following SR.177) obsolete. The American Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor (the first U.S. fighter to exceed Mach 1 in level flight) met a similar fate for the same reason, and no hybrid rocket-and-jet-engine fighter design has ever been placed into service. The only operational implementation of mixed propulsion was Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO), a system rarely used in fighters, such as with the <b>zero-length</b> <b>launch,</b> RATO-based takeoff scheme from special launch platforms, tested out by both the United States and the Soviet Union, and made obsolete with advancements in surface-to-air missile technology.|$|R
