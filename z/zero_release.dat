40|$|Abstract This paper proposes an {{efficient}} exact algorithm {{for the general}} single-machine scheduling problem where machine idle time is permitted. The algorithm is an exten-sion of the authors ’ previous algorithm for the problemwith-out machine idle time, {{which is based on}} the SSDP (Succes-sive Sublimation Dynamic Programming) method. We first extend our previous algorithm to the problem with machine idle time and next propose several improvements. Then, the proposed algorithm is applied to four types of single-machine scheduling problems: the total weighted earliness-tardiness problem with equal (<b>zero)</b> <b>release</b> dates, that with distinct release dates, the total weighted completion time problem with distinct release dates, and the total weighted tardiness problem with distinct release dates. Computational experi-ments demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing exact algorithms and can solve instances of the first three problems with up to 200 jobs and those of the last problem with up to 80 jobs...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{quantification}} of biofilm formation on hydrogel protective coatings for optical sensors and cameras {{has been developed}} using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis. In conjunction with these measurements {{the release of the}} fouling resistant cationic surfactants benzalkonium chloride, tallowbenzyldimethylammonium chloride and dicocodimethylammonium chloride was measured, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), to enable correlation to be made between release and biofilm resistance and thus determine the active lifetime of such coatings. Results indicate that the twin-chained material, dicocodimethylammonium chloride, produced superior biofouling resistance as, at the 12 week time point, little fouling was detected on this coating. The hydrogel containing the long-chained tallowbenzyldimethylammonium chloride (mainly C- 16 and C- 18 chains) was the next best fouling resistant material, withstanding biofilm formation for 9 weeks. This correlates with the fact that each of these materials had an extremely slow to <b>zero</b> <b>release</b> rate, due to their irreversible binding to the hydrogel over the experimental timescale. In comparison the shorter chained benzalkonium chloride (mainly C- 12 and C- 14). showed signs of biofilm formation at the 3 week time point...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} the vaginal administration of drospirenone silicone IVR. The in vitro release characteristics of matrix-type and reservoir-type IVR were compared under sink conditions in 21 days. At the same time, API excipients compatibility and preformulation study was performed by HPLC, IR, and DSC methods. Biocompatibility of reservoir system was evaluated by tolerability on tissue level in rats. It was found that, under strong light exposure, high temperature, and high humidity conditions, drospirenone and excipients had no significant interactions. The daily release of reservoir-type IVR was about 0. 5 mg/d sustaining 21 days, which significantly decreased the burst effect compared with the matrix system. When drospirenone was modified by the PVPk 30 in the reservoir system formulation, the daily release rate increased to 1. 0 mg/d sustaining 21 days. The cumulative release of reservoir-type IVR was fitted to <b>zero</b> <b>release</b> equation. In addition, biocompatibility of drospirenone IVR system in this dosage is safe.

30|$|The {{release of}} Ca from the Sinemurian {{siltstone}} {{could be explained}} well by calcite dissolution and ion exchange (Fig.  6). The strong correlation with Fe, Mn, and Si release under anoxic conditions suggests that Ca was sorbed to the surfaces of the respective hydroxides and amorphous silica. In contrast, Ca release from the Hettangian sandstone differed significantly under oxic and anoxic conditions: oxic release was up to 0.95  mg/L (0.05  mg/g sediment, Fig.  2), indicating that nearly all available mobile Ca was released (Fig.  1), while anoxic release was zero. This was due to sorption reactions, as initial simulations proved that the Hettangian sandstone contains no calcite. The <b>zero</b> <b>release</b> under anoxic conditions suggests that no competitive adsorptions of Na and Ca occurred. Instead, {{it is likely that}} Ca was desorbed under oxic conditions because the pH fell below the Ca adsorption edge due to pyrite dissolution (Davis and Kent 1990). Since no Ca was released under anoxic conditions despite the dissolution of Fe and Mn hydroxides, and no correlations between Ca and Fe or Mn were found, it is likely that Ca was sorbed to clay minerals or organic matter rather than to hydroxides. This assumption was not tested by numerical simulations, because the sorbing surface was unknown.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{previous}} research work, {{it is expected}} that dry recuperation of the metals in chromated copper arsenate (CCA) -treated wood waste can be achieved by low-temperature pyrolysis if a combination of pyrolysis temperature and residence time can be found, for which the two requirements: (1) zero-emission of metals, and (2) metal agglomeration are satisfied. To determine the working conditions for zero metal release, pyrolysis experiments with precisely controlled temperature and residence time and accurately known input metal concentrations of the CCA-treated wood samples, were conducted. Temperatures lower than 327 °C are considered, since the release of arsenic is thought to be controlled by the reduction reaction of As 2 O 5 to As 2 O 3, which occurs sharply at 327 °C. Metal retentions are calculated based on the measured metal concentrations in the pyrolysis residue and in the dried CCA-treated wood. The results suggest that pyrolysis at 300 °C for 20 min gives rise to <b>zero</b> <b>release</b> for the three metals (Cr, Cu, and As), while pyrolysis at 320 °C leads to nonnegligible metal releases. Thus, the experimental results suggest that the decomposition temperature of As 2 O 5 is lower than 320 °C. However, due to the high experimental uncertainty the observations are inconclusive. For future industrial applications, this study already shows that very careful control of process parameters will be required to ensure a zero arsenic emission. Moreover, this study indicates that an arsenic sampling and analysis method has to be developed and validated to be able to measure the arsenic emissions directly with high accuracy, instead of measuring metal retentions in the solid residue. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Nanomaterials {{technology}} {{can serve as}} a non-invasive and biocompatible platform for the delivery of a broad range of therapeutics, and has many applications in the veterinarian and other primary industries. The creation of smart, stimuli-responsive systems that respond to subtle changes in the local cellular environment is likely to yield long-term solutions to many of the current delivery problems. One such example is the effective targeted delivery and controlled release of biocides such as imidacloprid, and fipronil. In Australia, the timber industry is worth an estimated $ 10 billion per year. Termites pose a great problem to the industry, causing up to $ 2 billion damage to the housing industry alone. The project aims to develop micro/nano encapsulation technology for targeted delivery and controlled release of biomolecules using mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) as the carriers. In developing the biocide-delivery system to target the entire termite colony, the system will increase the efficiency of delivery and reduce the amount of biocide released into the environment. These novel coated particles, with the encapsulated biocides, will be gathered as food by termites at aggregation stations and carried back to the colony. Once ingested, the biocide will be orally transferred to nest-mates and after a controlled delay, released inside the body of the termites. Herein we report for the first time agricultural biocide loaded into porous structure of silica nanoparticles. To achieve further controlled delivery, ethyl cellulose coated MSNs were successfully synthesised using novel S/W/O/W emulsion technology. The controlled delay is expected to allow the biocide to be distributed throughout the colony before release. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and Fourier Transform Infra-red spectrometry (FTIR) were used to characterise the particles. Biocide release from ethyl cellulose coated composite particles showed slower sustained release than uncoated particles. Finally, these composite microparticles were tested in a lab scale in-vivo study where release of both imidacloprid and fipronil was tested against termites and mortality rates were compared between pure biocides, nanoparticles formulations and microparticles. We believe that this novel method can be applied {{to a wide variety of}} inorganic nanoparticles to achieve controlled release. Moreover, these particles are utilised for loading and controlled release of biological molecules such as drugs, genes, DNA etc. We have developed pH and enzyme responsive drug delivery systems based on MSNs. Chitosan was used to develop highly efficient pH responsive nanoparticulate system based on phosphoramidate chemistry. Construction of efficient chitosan coating relies on covalent bonding between phosphonate groups on the surface of the mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and amino groups on chitosan using phosphoramidate bonding. To evaluate the efficiency of this controlled release system, ibuprofen was loaded onto MSNs and its release was evaluated over different pH conditions. In comparison with uncoated particles, coated particles showed sustained release over 48 hours proving the pH responsiveness of the system. Further, we developed MSNs based enzyme responsive drug delivery system using 3 D cubic MCM- 48 nanoparticles. MCM- 48 nanoparticles were first functionalised by iodopropyl group to achieve high reactivity towards nucleophiles. Sulfasalazine a pro-drug of sulfapyridine and 5 -amino salicylic acid was attached to the above mentioned group via nucleophilic substitution reaction to form highly stable azo-reductase responsive nanoparticulate system. We proved that this system only responds to azo-redctase present inside colon with <b>zero</b> <b>release</b> in absence of enzyme, irrespective of the pH of the solution. Through its multi-perspective approach, this thesis has demonstrated the promises of the developed novel mesoporous silica nanoparticles in advancing agricultural and biomedical applications...|$|E
