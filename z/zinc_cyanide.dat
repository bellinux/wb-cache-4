Electrodeposited zinc coatings have some special characteristics which cannot be achieved by any other at such a low cost. Zinc can be plated from alkaline cyanide, sulphate, chloride, fluoborate, pyrophosphate and non-cyanide <b>zinc</b> electrolytes. <b>Cyanide</b> based electrolytes pose serious problems in effluent disposal due to their inherent toxicity. Recent trend is to deposit zinc from alkaline zincate baths because of the stringent pollution control measures enforced all over the world. The success of the zincate electrolytes mainly depends on the incorporation of organic additives. In their absence the deposit obtained from alkaline zincate baths are powdery and dark. Generally the addition agents employed are organic in nature. Sixteen addition agents are chosen and studied their influence on deposit characteristics, hydrogen permeation cathode efficiency, cathodic polarization adsorption behavior and corrosion resistance in acid sulphate and non-cyanide zincate electrolytes. The techniques employed for the study are Hull cell, electro permeation measurements, capillary electrometer, impedance measurements, galvanostatic polarization, Tafel extrapolation technique, and SEM studies. Addition agents selected are thiourea and its derivatives, gelatin, dextrin, p-naphthol benzaldehyde, glucose, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, tetraethylene pentammine and pyridine. It is found from the above studies that in acid bath glucose, dextrin, tetraethylene pentammine and pyridine produce bright deposits and in alkaline bath only CTAB and gelatin are capable of producing white adherent deposits. Additives which produce low permeation of hydrogen during deposition in acid baths are dextrin and pyridine. In alkaline bath gelatin gives low permeation current of good correlation has been obtained between hydrogen permeation and porosity of the deposit and also between hydrogen permeation and current efficiency.

40|$|Molecular {{framework}} materials - materials constructed like atomic scaffolding where anionic polyatomic linkers join cationic metal nodes - {{have great}} currency in contemporary functional material design. In this thesis the structures and properties of transition metal cyanides are investigated, {{focusing on the}} impact of mechanical and configurational degeneracy. These related phenomena give rise to materials with unusual and extreme negative mechanical responses on the one hand, and exotic structural states on the other. The mechanical response of primary interest here is negative linear compressibility (NLC), a rare but desirable property where a material actually expands in one direction against increasing hydrostatic pressure. The performance of NLC materials|for use in areas such as sensitive pressure sensing, actuators, and development of artificial muscle|critically depends on the intrinsic NLC response. Until recently very few NLC materials were known and, of those, the expansion was small in comparison to the normal contraction of common engineering materials. Here I show that several dicyanometallate frameworks, those based on the almostlinear [M(CN) 2] - (M = Ag, Au) linker, exhibit a prolonged NLC response up to ten times larger than established NLC candidates. Using two structure design modifications - soft-mode frustration to prevent structure collapse and supramolecular motifs that enhance compressibility - both the range over which NLC is observed and the magnitude of response have been increased. In the former, the extended perovskite-like system KM[M'(CN) 2] 3 is used as a model system, whilst 'spring'-like supramolecular interactions in zinc(II) dicyanoaurate(I), Zn[Au(CN) 2] 2, gives rise to an exceptional response - the first report of 'giant' NLC. Variable-pressure studies on the canonical isotropic negative thermal expansion (NTE) material <b>zinc</b> (II) <b>cyanide</b> reveals both its intrinsic phase transition behaviour, giving insight into the mechanism of NTE, and NLC {{as a result of the}} improper ferroelastic phase transition at 1. 52 GPa. This investigation resolves several discrepancies and contradictions in the field and suggests the mechanical responses of isostructural frameworks may be understood in terms of underlying dynamic instabilities, in much the same way as for many conventional ceramic materials. In the second part of this thesis, configurational degeneracy is explored focusing on structural disorder. Beginning with a summary of well-characterised examples of disorder in molecular frameworks, I go on explore the collective states arising from degeneracy in the 'simple' chain cyanides AgCN, AuCN and (Ag 1 / 2 Au 1 / 2) CN. By considering chains as geometric objects with simple pairwise interactions, we find the emergence of complex structural states that are directly related to the XY magnetic structures on a triangular lattice. Structurally degenerate states appear inherent in a range of framework materials; many possibilities exist in this field for targeting, enhancing and coupling counterintuitive mechanics and complex states with other functionalities. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} lead-zinc flotation {{process has}} been practised since 1912, yet selectivity in the process remains a significant technical issue in many operations. The minerals processing operation at Zinifex Limited's Century Mine, which uses differential flotation, began in November 1999 and the flotation behavior of the ore remains a major research interest. The present study was aimed to determine the possible mechanisms of sphalerite recovery during carbon pre-flotation and lead flotation in this operation including identification of the variables that affect these two flotation stages and also identify depressants for sphalerite that offer better selectivity during these stages. To achieve this aim, the study was undertaken in two stages: a review of literature related to selectivity during lead-zinc flotation, and an experimental program consisting of bench-scale flotation tests wherein the various experimental variables were systematically varied. A comparison between the data generated {{to those of the}} plant was also undertaken. The review of literature revealed four basic mechanisms of sphalerite recovery: activation of the sphalerite surface, composite particle flotation with galena and gangue, graphitic inclusions in the mineral surface and entrainment in the froth. The depression or rejection of sphalerite on the other hand could be affected by grinding, froth washing and the use of chemical depressants including <b>cyanides,</b> <b>zinc</b> sulfate, abraded iron and iron sulfate, sodium sulfide, sodium sulfite and metabisulfite, and organic depressants derived from selective collectors. The results from the experimental program indicate that: (a) activation of the sphalerite surface as a mechanism of sphalerite recovery during lead flotation was not significant at the Century Mine concentrator, (b) the recovery of sphalerite during the carbon pre-flotation was predominantly due to a bulk flotation action and entrainment in the froth, (c) composite particle recovery was a significant contributing factor in the recovery of sphalerite in lead flotation, and (d) mineral oxidation was only significant for galena and occurred mostly during pre-flotation, but the use of cyanide adequately counters any effect on sphalerite recovery. The investigation on the variables that affect the pre-flotation and lead flotation circuits revealed that: (a) reducing the pulp density and the amount of frother added during pre-flotation significantly reduced the bulk flotation action and entrainment of sphalerite in the froth, b) grinding the ore finer (P 80 = 40 μm) reduced the recovery of sphalerite as composite particles during lead flotation, and (c) the pulp pH was best maintained at natural pH during pre-flotation and at an elevated alkaline pH (pH 9. 5) during lead flotation for optimal selectivity.

40|$|A novel gas rnembrane-ion {{exchange}} process (GM-IX) {{is described}} to treat metal plating wastewaters containing <b>zinc</b> <b>cyanide</b> and recover usable forms of zinc and cyanide. The process uses a strongly basic {{anion exchange resin}} to selectively concentrate the metal cyanides from dilute plating wastes. Following exhaustion, the resin is regenerated under acidic conditions. The metal cyanide complexes are broken down {{as a result of}} HCN production under these acidic conditions, and the acidic regenerant containing the HCN is recirculated through a gas rnenbrane module that is supplied with a caustic stripping solution. Volatile HCN migrates across the gas perneable membranes to be absorbed and neutralized in the NaOH solution. The products of the process include concentrated sodium cyanide solution containing some excess sodium hydroxide, and concentrated acidic zinc sulfate solution that can be treated by an electrowinning process to recover zinc metal and a reusable acid for regeneration. Results of mass transfer studies indicate that the rate of HCN transfer across the gas permeable membrane is rapid and complete. The transfer is largely limited by diffusion within the lumen of the hollow fibers but also is influenced by the reaction rate of HCN with base outside the fibers. The gas permeable membrane provides the basis for effective separation and recovery of cyanide from zinc and cadmium plating wastes. Initial ion exchange is necessary to concentrate dilute metal cyanide solutions such as rinsewaters, but if the wastewater is already concentrated, only acidification is required. Th e <b>zinc</b> <b>cyanide</b> precipitate formed in the resin during regeneration was found to be Zn(CN) 2 (s), Recovery of cyanide from acidified zinc and cadmium cyanide solution is fast and complete when the solution pH is sufficiently acidic to convert the cyanide to the HCN form; above pH 2. 0 the rate of cyanide recovery was slowed by the 1 ow percentage of HCN present at equilibrium. In concentrated <b>zinc</b> <b>cyanide</b> solutions such as may be encountered during regeneration a lower pH is required to convert all the complexed cyanide to HCN. To achieve good regeneration, a strong acid solution and sufficient contact time must be provided to ensure complete cyanide removal. A kinetic model interfaced with a chemical equilibrium model successfully predicted the rate of cyanide recovery as a function of operating pH. Agreement between the predicted and the observed cyanide recovery rates indicated that the dissolution rates of Zn(CN) 2 (s), does not appear to limit the cyanide recovery rate. Rather, the rate is controlled by the cyanide speciation equilibria. Solutions containing copper and silver cyanides are Iess readily treated. The use of organic acids to catalyze the breakdown of these metal cyanides may aid these less tractable solutions. Cyanide cannot be completely recovered simply by acidification of concentrated copper cyanide solutions because of the formation of a cuprous cyanide precipitate. With addition of FeC 13,, cuprous cyanide precipitate can be oxidized and cyanide can be completely recovered in the NaCN form. Water Resources Research Cente...|$|E

In the present work the elution of copper-, iron-, and zinc-cyanocomplexes from polyacrylic- and polystyrene-based resins was studied. It was found that iron and copper cyanides are easily eluted from polyacrylic- and polystyrene-based ion exchange resins using either SCN- or NO 3 -. However, elution of the <b>zinc</b> <b>cyanide</b> complex from polystyrene-based resins was poor when using nitrate solution as eluant. Besides, an increase in elution temperature from 25 °C to 50 °C improved the elution of iron and zinc cyanides from polystyrene-based resins using a nitrate eluant; however temperature did not have any significant effect on other metal cyanocomplexes or for elution using thiocyanate. It was therefore proposed that the optimal combination of resin-eluant was site-specific, and depends on the features of the effluent, processing temperature, eluant concentration, and ion exchange resin under consideration...|$|E
40|$|The optimum {{conditions}} for electroplating zinc from its fluoborate solution ~have been deduced bya systematic {{study of the}} effects of all types of variables on its plat-ing characteristics. The best deposits of zinc are obtained from a bath containing 180 g/ 1 of zinc fluoborate, 30 g/ 1 of ammonium fluoborate, 25 g/ 1 of boric acid, and 1. 0 g/ 1 of beta naphthol at a pH of 5. 0 to 5. 4 and temperatures of 20 ~ 176 and at current densities of 4. 3 to 9. 7 amp/dm 2 (40 to 90 amp/ftD. The deposits which are obtained on steel, brass, orcopper are uniform, fine grained, dherent, and of pleasing appearance. The current efficiency of the process approximates 98 to 100 per cent cathodic and 102 to 105 per cent anodic. The bath is nonpoisonous, stable, and easily controlled. The new bath is comparable to the <b>zinc</b> <b>cyanide</b> bath, and is vastly superior to the zinc sulfate bath...|$|E
40|$|Secondary and {{tertiary}} alkylzinc bromides can {{be generated}} from the direct oxidative addition of Rieke zinc to secondary and tertiary alkyl bromides in high yield. These organozinc reagents {{have been found to}} undergo copper-catalyzed conjugate addition, cross-coupling with acid chlorides, and carbocupration to activated alkynes. Secondary and tertiary alkylzinc bromides can react in a 1, 4 -addition mode directly to α,β-unsaturated ketones in the presence of Lewis acids without the need for a copper catalyst. ^ The reduction of <b>zinc</b> <b>cyanide</b> by lithium naphthalenide yields an active form of zinc which undergoes oxidative addition to alkylchlorides with the tolerance of some functionality. ^ Reaction of dihalobenzenes and 2, 5 -dibromothiophene with Rieke magnesium, Rieke zinc, and Rieke calcium at low temperature affords a mono-organometallic intermediate which upon subsequent treatment with an electrophile provides a mono-functionalized aromatic product in excellent chemical yield. ^ The direct formation of organomanganese bromides can be accomplished under mild conditions from the direct oxidative addition of Rieke manganese to alkyl and thienyl bromides. ...|$|E
