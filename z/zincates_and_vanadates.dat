40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} <b>vanadate</b> <b>and</b> the stable peroxovanadate {{compound}} bpV(pic) on insulin binding and degradation were investigated in rat adipocytes {{under conditions of}} ongoing receptor cycling. Both bpV(pic) <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> increased 125 I-insulin binding to intact cells through an increase in apparent receptor affinity. The maximal effect of bpV(pic) was to increase binding ∼ 4 -fold (EC 50 0. 06 ± 0. 01 mM), whereas vanadate increased binding ∼ 2 -fold (EC 50 1. 4 ± 0. 2 mM). Removal of cell surface insulin-receptor complexes with trypsin showed that the effects on binding exerted by bpV(pic) <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> were due to a similar increase in both cell surface binding and intracellular accumulation of radioactivity. Both bpV(pic) <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> inhibited the degradation of 125 I-insulin in medium containing 1 % bovine serum albumin. The ratio of degraded/intact intracellular 125 I-insulin was also markedly reduced by these agents, suggesting that they inhibit intracellular insulin-degrading proteases. Similar to previous findings with vanadate, bpV(pic) stimulated glucose transport and, at low concentrations, enhanced insulin sensitivity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that both bpV(pic) <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> inhibit insulin degradation. In addition, they significantly enhance cell surface insulin binding in rat fat cells and this is associated with an improved insulin sensitivity...|$|R

However, it activates IRS- 1 associated PI 3 -kinase, {{suggesting that it}} mimics insulin effects by stimulating signaling elements downstream of PI 3 -kinase. Here we analysed the stimulation of MAPK by insulin <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> <b>and</b> observed that both elicit a rapid 3. 5 – 4 fold activation which is abolished by wortmannin and PD 98059. Simultaneous addition of insulin <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> does not result in an additive effect neither on MAPK nor in MEK. Whereas insulin action is transient, vanadate stimulation lasts up to 20 min. In insulin-resistant adipocytes from old rats, insulin stimulates poorly MAPK, whereas a normal activation is achieved with vanadate. We conclude that: (a) insulin <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> use a common signaling pathway from PI 3 -kinase to MEK <b>and</b> MAPK; (b) <b>vanadate</b> but not insulin, elicits a sustained activation of both enzymes; (c) this pathway is functional in old rat adipocytes. <br /...|$|R

The cast samples were polished using different grits (60 [*]μm– 1200 [*]μm) before plating. The effects on adhesion, appearance, and quantity of EN deposits on substrates were studied.

T 84 cell monolayers grown on collagen-coated filters were mounted in Ussing chambers to measure short circuit current(ISC). Serosal addition of AlF 4 - or vanadate to T 84 monolayers produced a sustained increase in ISC. Removal of Ca 2 + from the serosal bathing solution partially inhibited AlF 4 -(-) and vanadate-induced ISC, and readministration of Ca 2 + restored AlF 4 -(-) and vanadate-induced ISC. Carbachol application {{in the presence of}} forskolin, AlF 4 - or vanadate induced a synergistic increase of ISC. Forskolin <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> significantly increased cellular cAMP level, while carbachol and AlF 4 - did not. Carbachol, AlF 4 - <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> significantly increased [Ca 2 +]i. After Na+ in mucosal bathing solution was replaced with K+, and the mucosal membrane of T 84 cell was permeabilized with amphotericin B, AlF 4 -, <b>vanadate,</b> <b>and</b> carbachol increased K+ conductance, but forskolin did not. After sodium chloride in serosal bathing solution was replaced with sodium gluconate and the serosal membrane was permeabilized with nystatin, forskolin, AlF 4 -, <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> increased Cl- conductance, but carbachol did not. AlF 4 -(-) induced ISC was remarkably inhibited by the pretreatment of pertussis toxin(2 micrograms/ml) for 2 hours. These results indicate that AlF 4 - <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> can increase Cl- secretion via simultaneous stimulation of Cl- channel and K+ channel in T 84 cells.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{mechanism by which}} the G-protein activators aluminium fluoride <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> stimulate arachidonic acid release in pig aortic endothelial cells. Our previous study demonstrated a novel Ca(2 +) -independent pathway of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activation stimulated by aluminium fluoride in this model. In the present study, we found that sodium metavanadate stimulated a rapid concentration-dependent release of [3 H]arachidonic acid from prelabelled cells. A more than 3 -fold enhancement of arachidonic acid release was achieved in cells treated with 1 mM vanadate for 20 min. Synthesis of prostaglandin products was similarly enhanced. The release of arachidonic acid was not dependent {{on the presence of}} extracellular Ca 2 +, but did require protein synthesis de novo. Both cycloheximide and actinomycin D completely blocked aluminium fluoride- and vanadate-stimulated arachidonic acid release. Because fluoride <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> are known protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors, it is possible that PLA 2 activation occurred secondarily to changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Both aluminium fluoride <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> stimulated the rapid phosphorylation of 58, 93 and 120 kDa tyrosine-containing protein substrates. However, in contrast with arachidonic acid release, this response was found {{to be sensitive to the}} presence of extracellular Ca 2 + and insensitive to blockers of protein synthesis de novo. Furthermore H 2 O 2 treatment resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the same substrates without a concomitant increase in arachidonic acid release. These results suggest that the effects of aluminium fluoride <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> on PLA 2 are not due to changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation, but do require rapid protein synthesis de novo...|$|R

The association constant of the stable complex M. ADP. Vi, in which M indicates myosin [Goodno, C. C. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Actin-SF- 1 ATPase activity is 90 % inhibited by ADP plus vanadate. The reaction of actin with M. ADP. Vi produces a slow release of ADP <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> <b>and</b> quantitative recovery of ATPase activity. The rate of dissociation of ligands was almost linear in actin concentration; consequently, the rate constant of dissociation could only be roughly estimated as 0. 5 - 1 sec- 1.

Here we have further analysed the insulin-like effects of the combination of SSAO substrates <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> <b>and</b> we have studied the signal-transduction pathway activated in rat adipocytes. We found that several SSAO substrates (benzylamine, tyramine, methylamine, n-decylamine, histamine, tryptamine or beta-phenylethylamine), in combination with low concentrations of vanadate, stimulate glucose transport in isolated rat adipocytes. Furthermore, SSAO substrates together with vanadate stimulated the recruitment of GLUT 4 to the cell surface in isolated rat adipocytes. Benzylamine plus vanadate also stimulated glucose transport and GLUT 4 translocation in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Benzylamine or tyramine in combination with vanadate potently stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of both insulin receptor substrate (IRS) - 1 and IRS- 3. In contrast, benzylamine <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> caused only a weak stimulation of insulin receptor kinase. Benzylamine or tyramine in combination with vanadate also stimulated phosphoinositide 3 -kinase activity; wortmannin abolished the stimulatory effect of benzylamine <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> on glucose transport in adipose cells. Furthermore, the administration of benzylamine <b>and</b> <b>vanadate</b> in vivo caused a rapid lowering of plasma glucose levels, which took place in the absence of alterations in plasma insulin. On the basis of these results we propose that SSAO activity regulates glucose transport in adipocytes. SSAO oxidative activity stimulates glucose transport via the translocation of GLUT 4 carriers to the cell surface, resulting from a potent tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS- 1 and IRS- 3 and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase activation. Our results also indicate that substrates of SSAO might regulate glucose disposal in vivo...|$|R

Vanadyl and diperoxovanadate are capable of forming a Î¼-peroxo-bridged complex that is essentially similar to the synthetic vanadate dimer used in the present experiments.
