25|$|First {{underground}} {{press of}} TWZW started operating in Warsaw in autumn 1940. Before that period, underground presses {{had to rely}} on small, amateurish printing presses. TWZW revolutionized the underground printing scene in occupied Poland, by building new underground presses, and organizing the entire network. By early 1944 TWZW had twelve underground centers, including eight printing presses, as well as a bookbinding center, an offset printing center, a foreign-language publication center, and a chemigraphy (<b>zincography)</b> center. Most of its operations were located in Warsaw. In summer 1944 several centers of TWZW were discovered by the German occupiers. During the Warsaw Uprising in late summer of 1944, remaining TWZW operations in Warsaw went public as Wojskowe Zakłady Wydawnicze (Military Publishing House). Early on during the uprising personnel of TWZW attacked and took control of several large, official printing presses in Warsaw. The last publication of Warsaw TWZW was the 102nd issue of Biuletyn Informacyjny, printed on the night of 3 to 4 October, a day after the insurgents surrendered. TWZW was officially disbanded in January 1945 along with the entire Armia Krajowa.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of his career, Uzanne focused on the lesser-known writers of the 18th century, {{creating}} four volumes of work published by Jouast, and an additional 20+ volumes published by Albert Quantin. He was an admirer of the Goncourt brothers, who were also writers on the subject of 18th-century France. Uzanne looked for mentors who were bibliophiles like him, rather than literary scholars (érudits) like his companions at the Arsenal. While focusing on past subjects, he was very up-to-date on the technical aspects of printing and publishing. His 1879 work Le bric-à-brac de l'amour (literally, A bric-a-brac of love) {{was one of the first}} to employ the gillotage, a <b>zincography</b> technique, and photo-mechanical reproduction. Jackson points out that Uzanne, in Les Zigzags d'un curieux (literally, Zigzags of a Curious Man), divided the book collectors in two groups: those who are interested in the book as if it were a kind of stock market share (valeur de Bourse), a market quotation whose fluctuations [...] "they follow with a gamester's interest", and those—whom he considers [...] "pures"—attracted to the book itself, its contents, rarity or beauty.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zincography</b> is {{frequently}} confused with modern zinc-plate lithographic printing. It directly influenced {{the development of}} photozincography, an early form of photogravure.|$|E
50|$|Chromotypograph is the {{preferred}} description {{for a number of}} process which include {{but are not limited to}} photo color relief, gillotage, chromotype, color relief etching, <b>zincography,</b> chromoxylography, color line block, glyptotype, Dallastint, Dallastype.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of the new}} <b>zincography</b> printing process rendered xylography nearly obsolete as a profession. When the opportunities for employment as an engraver became scarce, Luce shifted his focus to painting full-time in about 1883.|$|E
50|$|He {{finished}} his secondary {{studies at the}} Dobó István Grammar School in Eger from 1963 to 1967. He learned <b>zincography</b> in the Kossuth Press in Budapest. He graduated pedagogy from the Eszterházy Károly College of Eger in 2002.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zincography</b> was a planographic {{printing}} process that used zinc plates. Alois Senefelder first mentioned zinc's lithographic {{use as a}} substitute for Bavarian limestone in his 1801 English patent specifications. In 1834, Federico Lacelli patented a zincographic printing process, producing large maps called géoramas. In 1837-1842, Eugène-Florent Kaeppelin perfected the process to create a large polychrome geologic map.|$|E
50|$|Chromolithography {{was another}} process, {{which by the}} end of the 19th century had become dominant, {{although}} this used multiple prints with a stone for each color. Mechanical color separation, initially using photographs of the image taken with three different color filters, reduced the number of prints needed to three. <b>Zincography,</b> with zinc plates, later replaced lithographic stones, and remained the most common method of color printing until the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|The first Department Director, Ronald Worthy Giblin, F.R.G.S., noted when survey {{began in}} 1896, [...] "It {{so happens that}} 40 metres or 4,000 {{centimetres}} are equal to one sen in Thai units of measurement, so all cadastral plans are plotted, drawn, and printed to a scale of 1:4,000." [...] The department also engages in the production and sale of detailed maps, which initially {{were made by the}} process of <b>zincography.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the German {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939, Goldberg {{managed to escape}} {{to the city of}} Białystok, which was occupied by the Soviet Union. He lived there during the Soviet occupation and worked in <b>Zincography.</b> After the occupation of Bialystok by the Germans in 1941 he was interned in the Białystok Ghetto. There {{he was in charge of}} the drawing of the Judenrats formal posters, which were made in an elegant paintings and hanged on the Councils Building.|$|E
50|$|From {{its first}} appearance, L'Assiette au Beurre {{registered}} as a departure in form from other French humor publications. Each issue {{was made up}} of chiefly two- or three-color-inked cartoons and caricatures, given full- or sometimes double-page placement (instead of the more common quarter page real estate granted to such content in related French publications), with each installment containing a minimum of 16 illustrated pages. Special editions held up to 48 pages. Images were published from original drawings using a <b>zincography,</b> planographic printing process.|$|E
50|$|Vanzo {{presented}} his first exhibition in 1919, at {{the inauguration of}} the Witcomb Gallery in Rosario. In 1941 {{he was invited to}} a joint exhibition that featured Lucio Fontana, Domingo Candia and Emilio Pettorutti at the Riverside Gallery of New York City, and in 1945 he participated in the contest for a Guggenheim scholarship. In 1953 he authored a series of <b>zincography</b> prints based on the theme of the Argentine national gauchesque poem Martín Fierro, which were also exhibited in New York. During his last years he shifted to the topic of tango culture.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} 1921-1924 and 1935-1939, the {{printing}} house developed new areas of competence, such as offset printing, <b>zincography,</b> rotogravure, and became self-sufficient in equipment repair. This was made possible, among other things, by the acquisition in 1928 of a printing press housed in building adjacent to Bydgoszcz's jail facility at Parkowa street. In 1936, the printing facility {{had more than}} 200 machines and employed around 280 people, which represented more than 60% of the employees of the printing industry in the former Pomeranian province. In 1939, {{the number of employees}} increased to more than 600 people.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{abolition}} of the [...] "taxes on knowledge" [...] in 1861, the Advertiser was issued daily. In June 1870, Leng {{was one of the first}} Scottish newspaper proprietors to establish an office in Fleet Street, London, with direct telegraphic communication with Dundee. When stereotyping was adopted, after printing from rolls of paper instead of sheets was introduced, he caused a stereotype-foundry to be erected as a portion of the plant. In 1851 the single machine in use could only produce 350 copies per hour fifty years afterwards Leng had four elaborate machines in operation, each capable of throwing off 20,000 copies per hour. He was the first to attempt illustrations in a daily paper and when the primitive pantographic method was superseded by <b>zincography,</b> he founded a zincographic and photographic studio as part of the office equipment. The difficulty of obtaining an adequate paper supply was overcome in 1893, when the Donside paper-mills were acquired by a private limited liability company, of which Leng was chairman.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s Goldberg {{opened in}} Królewska street in warsaw a {{printing}} house and artistic <b>Zincography</b> studio named [...] "Grafikon". In the workshop, {{where he worked}} alongside his wife Eshter, he designed Hebrew fonts, printing ornaments and lithography and made matrices {{for a number of}} publishing houses and newspapers.Apart from his fondness for rhymingand painting title pages, Goldberg had a special affection for making letters. He aspired to improve the Hebrew typography (especially {{in the context of the}} Jewish print in Poland), because he thought it flawed and believed it impaired the enjoyment of reading, and sought to come up with a new script, that would fit the living word. In 1922 he published the journal published an article in [...] "Kultur Lige"s bibliographic journal Bikher-velt (Book World) on the need for reform and modernization of the Hebrew font. He has spent considerable effort making sketches for letters. His drafts, which he published a Hebrew and Yiddish periodicals, demonstrated great imagination.|$|E

50|$|For years, the Monsohn (later, Monson/Monzon) Press was {{considered}} {{the best and most}} innovative in the country—pioneering in such techniques as gold-embossing and offset printing, among others. Early items for tourists included collections of Flowers of the Holy Land (c. 1910-1918)—pressed local flowers accompanied by scenes from the Eretz Israel countryside and relevant verses from the Bible, edited by Jsac Chagise (or Itzhak Haggis), an immigrant from Vitebsk, and bound in carved olive wood boards. Shortly after World War I Monsohn (now spelled מונזון) used <b>zincography</b> to produce the prints included in the Hebrew Ganenu educational booklets for young children illustrated by Ze'ev Raban of the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design and printed in Jerusalem by Hayim Refael Hakohen (vol. 1, 1919; vols. 2-3, 1920). In 1934 Monsohn moved into the new, western part of Jerusalem, in a shop with four presses and 30 workers, including Abraham-Leib’s sons, David, Yosef, Moshe and Shimon, and his daughter Raytse’s husband, Abraham Barmacz. The concern did business with all sectors of the city’s population, including Arabs, for whom they printed in Arabic. Among their clients were Ginio, Havilio, Elite, Shemen, Dubek, and other renowned national brands, manufacturing products such as wine, candies, oil, and cigarettes. They also printed movie and travel posters, and government posters, postcards and documents. During the Tzena austerity period Monsohn was the exclusive printer of government coupon booklets.|$|E
