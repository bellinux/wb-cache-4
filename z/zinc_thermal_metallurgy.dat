The various methods for applying the zinc have been researched to determine their requirements and their relative advantages and limitations. The application methods identified were: *Hot-dip Galvanising *Electro-Galvanising *Metal Spray *Sherardizing *Organic Zinc Rich Primers *Inorganic Zinc Rich Primers The methods were researched to find the following information: *Application Process *Required Inspections *Known Advantages and Disadvantages *Health, Safety, and Environmental Factors *Required Infrastructure The results of the research {{were used to determine}} which of the coatings could be performed by the business. A criteria matrix was developed and used to determine this. <b>Zinc</b> <b>thermal</b> spray and both organic and inorganic zinc rich primers were deemed the most viable. The corrosion and abrasion resistance of these coatings were tested and compared with the performance of hot dip galvanising due to it being an industry standard. The results highlighted <b>zinc</b> <b>thermal</b> spray as the highest performer with greatest corrosion resistance and superior abrasion resistance over the painted coatings. The costs of the coatings were also compared with the cost of having an external supplier performing hot dip galvanising. It was found that the cost of transport made this uneconomical as expected. The cost of <b>zinc</b> <b>thermal</b> spray again proved to be the highest performer being 25 % less to apply than the painted zinc rich coatings. The net present value for acquiring the infrastructure to perform <b>zinc</b> <b>thermal</b> spray was calculated and proved that the project is worth pursuing.

CCS technology includes carbon dioxide capture on the large point source, transport of captured carbon dioxide stream and storage of carbon into safe geological formations. Among the CCS processes, capture side is developing with many demonstration projects, focusing on the efficiency improvement of wet and dry absorbents, material improvement for membrane, construction cost down, etc. But in transport side, the technology is in the initial stage. In Korea, site surveys are mainly focused and operated on the offshore saline aquifers in the east sea of Korea and rather few surveys are processed in the on land side. For the offshore carbon dioxide geological storage, there are two options for transportation, using pipeline or ship. To utilize the offshore pipeline {{it is possible to}} use high chrome steel alloy to response to seawater corrosion, though the cost for construction might take huge budget for installation mainly cause of material cost. Otherwise, we considered {{it might be possible to}} apply the anti-corrosion coating outside of the carbon steel pipeline to mitigate seawater corrosion and to reduce the cost, so to secure steady and robust operation of offshore carbon dioxide transportation with little concern of corrosion issue. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using carbon steel pipeline with internal phosphate coating and external thermal spray coating as candidate for the offshore carbon dioxide transportation pipeline material. The base material for this study is carbon steel. The pipe internal corrosion test was conducted with fluids of CO 2 mixture with additives of water and SO 2 gas, and the external corrosion was carried out with 3. 5 %w NaCl solution. In the case of internal corrosion, all the specimens resulted in corroded surface with rust covered when SO 2 was injected over 175 ppmv.

The absence of residual carbon in the films suggests a mechanism involving the dissociation of the ZnC bonds in the plasma instead of at the surface. Film growth appears to proceed by the adsorption of particular zinc species, followed by subsequent reaction with oxygen, with the deposition rate being directly proportional to the arrival rate of the particular reactive species.

A significant correlation was observed between congener CB- 118 and Sigma PCB (R- 2 = 0. 65 and p < 0. 01), which suggests that CB- 118 is a good marker congener for emission of Sigma PCB.

Double decomposition reactions permit the synthesis of metallic soaps, which are long-chain carboxylates of metal ions, from alkaline ones such as sodium, potassium or ammonium soaps.

This hardware had been in service on HST since it was installed during the SM 1 mission in December of 1993 yielding one of the longest low Earth orbit exposure times (15. 4 years) of any returned space hardware. The WFPC 2 is equipped with a 0. 8 x 2. 2 m radiator for thermal control of the camera electronics (Figure 1). The space facing surface of the 4. 1 mm thick aluminum radiator is coated with Z 93 <b>zinc</b> orthotitanate <b>thermal</b> control paint with a nominal thickness of 0. 1 0. 2 mm. Post flight inspections of the radiator panel revealed hundreds of micrometeoroid/orbital debris (MMOD) impact craters ranging in size from less than 300 to nearly 1000 microns in diameter. The Z 93 paint exhibited large spall areas around the larger impact sites (Figure 2) and the craters observed in the 6061 -T 651 aluminum had a different shape than those observed in uncoated aluminum. Typical hypervelocity impact craters in aluminum have raised lips around the impact site. The craters in the HST radiator panel had suppressed crater lips, and in some cases multiple craters were present instead of a single individual crater. Humes and Kinard observed similar behavior after the WFPC 1 post flight inspection and assumed the Z 93 coating was acting like a bumper in a Whipple shield. Similar paint behavior (spall) was also observed by Bland 2 during post flight inspection of the International Space Station (ISS) S-Band Antenna Structural Assembly (SASA) in 2008. The SASA, with similar Z 93 coated aluminum, was inspected after nearly 4 years of exposure on the ISS. The multi-crater phenomena could be a function of the density, composition, or impact obliquity angle of the impacting particle. For instance, a micrometeoroid particle consisting of loosely bound grains of material could be responsible for creating the multiple craters. Samples were obtained from the HST largest craters for examination by electron microscope equipped with x-ray spectrometers to determine impactor source (micrometeoroid or orbital debris).

Its initial capacity was 3000 tons of zinc per year, expanded to 4000 tons in 1946. Between 1950 and 1960, capacity was gradually expanded to 28,000 tons a year. In 1955, a unit for producing sulfuric acid was inaugurated. The unit was expanded in 1966, a year that also saw the introduction of a system for agglomerating concentrates of zinc and lead. This was the culmination of a four-year program of thorough restructuring and modernization, with the new equipment having a capacity of 30,000 tons of zinc and 20,000 tons of lead bullion per year.

Die solarthermische Dissoziation von Zinkoxid ist Bestandteil eines geschlossenen Stoffkreislaufs zur Speicherung und Transport von Sonnenenergie in Form des solaren Brennstoffs Zink. Der wohl kritischste Punkt im Design eines Solarreaktors ist die Verhinderung der Rekombination von einmal erzeugtem Zink und Sauerstoff. Auf der Basis von experimentellen Ergebnissen wird ein Modell formuliert, das diesen Prozess quantitativ beschreibt. Damit ergeben sich wichtige Hinweise zur Auslegung eines Hochtemperatursolarreaktors zur rein thermischen Darstellung von Zink aus Zinkoxid. Abstract The solar <b>thermal</b> {{dissociation}} of <b>zinc</b> oxide {{is part of}} {{a closed}} material cycle for the storage and transport of solar energy. The efficiency of the solar step and the whole cycle is in part determined by the obtained zinc yield. Whenever the reoxidation to zinc oxide in a high temperature solar reactor occurs the zinc yield decreases. Due to this fact, {{one of the most critical}} design aspects is the selection of the quench step in order to prevent the back reaction. This study describes the motivation and performance of high temperature solar processes as a means for emission reduced production of sustainable energy carriers. More specificly it is dealing with the production of zinc. Conventional processes are analysed in order to identify the best quench method for a future solar driven zinc production process. Theoretical aspects of the oxidation of zinc at elevated temperatures are given as well as findings from experimental investigations in the solar furnace and a laboratory bench scale electric furnace. In the electric furnace the reaction is studied mainly at various gas temperatures, various ratios of diluting inert gas to zinc, and with various surface areas exposed to zinc and oxygen gas. Experiments indicate that the oxidation of zinc is of a heterogeneous nature and occurs also above the boiling point of zinc if there is a hot surface available. A two dimensional mass transfer model describes well the rate of oxidation as being limited by the rate of the diffusion of the reactants to the reactor wall when zinc and oxygen are diluted in argon in a laminar flow regime. Experiments in the solar furnace show that an inert dilution gas temperature in a region between the dissociation and the quench zones above the boiling point of zinc leads to higher zinc yields than in the case when the dilution gas is below this temperature. Experimental investigations using a zinc-splash-condenser as a means to quench the system zinc/oxygen are showing that condensor efficencies of 8 % can not be exceeded. The study finishes by showing how the above results can be applied towards design aspects of a high temperature solar reactor for the production of <b>zinc</b> by direct <b>thermal</b> splitting of <b>zinc</b> oxide.
