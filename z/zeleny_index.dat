40|$|Organic {{farmers are}} {{interested}} in soil conservation by reduced tillage, techniques well known in conventional agriculture to protect soil quality and limit labor time and energy costs. However, organic farming and reduced tillage can modify weeds, soil structure, and thus soil nitrogen (N) mineralization which strongly influences wheat yield and quality. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze how reduced tillage applied to organic wheat influenced (1) grain yield, protein concentration, and weed infestation; (2) deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination on grain; (3) technological quality parameters such as dry gluten, <b>zeleny</b> <b>index,</b> falling number, and gluten index; (4) protein composition (F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4, and F 5 fractions, and UPP, gliadin/glutenin ratio); and (5) baking test. For this purpose, we analyzed five site-years of data from winter wheat crops where mouldboard ploughing and reduced tillage were compared in three experimental trials (two in France and one in Switzerland). Main results concern wheat yields: the effect of reduced tillage on wheat yield was influenced by several factors such as weed competition. No significant increase in mycotoxin content (DON) due to reduced tillage was detected. Contamination with DON was always below the European threshold for human consumption. The technological quality parameters were less affected by the tillage treatments than grain yield: protein content, gluten index, <b>zeleny</b> <b>index,</b> and falling number showed on average no significant difference between treatments although the protein composition was slightly different. The main results of this study are that the effect of reduced tillage on grain yield depends very much on soil type, weather conditions, and time after conversion, whereas there is only minor impact on wheat quality. This is in contrast to the hypothesis that reduced tillage under organic farming will cause problems in baking quality...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{nitrogen}} leaching in winter after breaking of grass-clover sward {{can be reduced}} by delayed ploughing. The impact of ploughing date (either late autumn or spring) was compared regarding grain yield and baking quality of spring wheat. The field trial was conducted from 2001 to 2003 and from 2006 to 2008 on a trial site with sandy-loamy site conditions nearby Freising, Bavaria. Two varieties of spring wheat were examined. Higher baking quality (protein content, falling number, <b>Zeleny</b> <b>index,</b> wet gluten content, loaf volume) was identified in all years after ploughing in late autumn compared to spring ploughing. On the other hand, grain yield was higher after ploughing in spring {{in two of the}} six environments, but in one year the opposite occurred. This allows the conclusion that baking quality for spring wheat can be influenced by ploughing date in contrast to grain yield...|$|E
40|$|In this study, 36 Spanish wheat genotypes (five modern {{commercial}} cultivars, four cultivars introduced {{after the}} green revolution and 27 landraces from northwestern Spain) were evaluated. Grain (yield, specific weight, protein con-tent and falling number) and flour (yield, protein content, <b>Zeleny</b> <b>index,</b> wet gluten and gluten index) properties were analyzed. Dough behaviour during mixing (DoughLAB) and handling (alveograph) was also considered. An evolution in grain and flour properties was observed over time. In modern cultivars, grain yield was improved owing to higher grain production. In landraces, higher grain yields {{were related to}} larger grain size. Unlike in landraces, an inverse cor-relation between grain yield and protein content was found in modern cultivars. In addition, because of their high pro-tein quality, modern cultivars surpassed landraces in bread-making properties. Landraces showed considerable variabi-lity in protein quality and scored lower curve configuration ratio values than other cultivars with similar strength. Cultivars introduced after the green revolution reached {{the highest levels of}} bread-making quality, a feature attributable to their high protein quality...|$|E

40|$|Two lines, L- 19 - 613 and L- 19 - 626, were {{produced}} {{from the common}} wheat cultivar Longmai 19 (L- 19) by six consecutive backcrosses using biochemical marker-assisted selection. L- 19 (Glu-D 1 a, Glu-A 3 c/Gli-A 1 ?; Gli-A 1 ? is a gene coding for unnamed gliadin) and L- 19 - 613 (Glu-D 1 d, Glu-A 3 c/Gli-A 1 ?) formed a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for HMW-GS, while L- 19 - 613 and L- 19 - 626 (Glu-D 1 d, Glu-A 3 e/Gli-A 1 m) constituted another set of NILs for the LMW-GS/gliadins. The three L- 19 NILs were grown in the wheat breeding nursery in 2007 and 2008. The field experiments were designed using the three-column contrast arrangement method with four replicates. The three lines were ranked as follows for measurements of gluten strength, which {{was determined by the}} gluten <b>index,</b> <b>Zeleny</b> sedimentation, the stability and breakdown time of the farinogram, the maximum resistance and area of the extensogram, and the P andWvalues of the alveogram: L- 19 - 613 > L- 19 - 626 > L- 19. The parameters listed above were significantly different between lines at the 0. 05 or 0. 01 level. The Glu-D 1 and Glu-A 3 /Gli-A 1 loci had additive effects on the gluten <b>index,</b> <b>Zeleny</b> sedimentation, stability, breakdown time, maximum resistance, area, P and W values. Although genetic variation at the Glu-A 3 /Gli-A 1 locus had a great influence on wheat quality, the genetic difference between Glu-D 1 d and Glu-D 1 a at the Glu-D 1 locus was much larger than that of Glu-A 3 c/Gli-A 1 ? and Glu-A 3 e/Gli-A 1 m at the Glu-A 3 /Gli-A 1 locus. Glu-D 1 d had negative effects on the extensibility and the L value compared with Glu-D 1 a. In contrast, Glu-A 3 c/Gli-A 1 ? had a positive effect on these traits compared with Glu-A 3 e/Gli-A 1 m...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine grain yield and some quality traits of 18 bread wheat varieties in dry conditions and location {{in the center of}} Konya in 2009 - 2010 growing seasons. Grain yield and some quality characteristics (protein content, <b>zeleny</b> sedimentation, gluten <b>index,</b> alveograph energy value, alveograph P/L, mixograph development time, mixograph peak height, and mixograph softening value and mixograph total area) were examined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the potential for yield and quality indicators for winter wheat genotypes in terms of pedological and climate condition and applied technology, at ARDS Turda during 2014 – 2015. Depending on the climatic conditions that are associated with applied technology is a decisive factor in successful wheat crop for all genotypes that were studied at Ards Turda during the 2014 – 2016. That’s wy each genotype responded differently to the conditions of the ARDS Turda also through the two levels of fertilisations applied in the winter with fertilizers 20 : 20 : 0, 250 kg/ha assuring 50 kg/ha N and P active substance and second level of fertilisations with 150 kg/ha ammonium nitrate assuring 50 kg/ha N active substance. All genotype that were studied in terms of yield and quality indicators were influenced by the fertilization level.

40|$|The {{ability of}} trifoliate hardened-yam flours to {{partially}} substitute wheat flour in food formulations was assessed. Three varieties of hardened-yam flour were incorporated in wheat flour in proportions of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 %[*](w/w). Samples were evaluated for protein content, Zeleny sedimentation index, Hagberg falling number, functional properties (WAC, WSI, and OAC), and some rheological properties including dough rupture pressure (P), extensibility (L), stability (P/L), and deformation energy (W). Results showed that trifoliate hardened-yam flours {{do not have}} acceptable baking properties as pictured by the low Zeleny sedimentation index and the low Hagberg falling number. Protein quality (<b>Zeleny</b> <b>index,</b> 31) of wheat flour helped to compensate gluten deficit of yam flours, but the amylasic activity determined by the Hagberg falling number could not be adjusted, {{which resulted in a}} loss of extensibility (L) of the paste at 10 % substitution. Multivariate analysis of experimental data regrouped wheat flour and all wheat/hardened-yam treated with kanwa composite flours in one homogeneous cluster. Although wheat/hardened-yam treated with kanwa composite flours had physicochemical and functional properties similar to wheat, the inadequate diastasic activity makes them inappropriate for bread making, marking the strongest influence of that parameter...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{quality was}} studied of wheat flours from three {{varieties}} of Triticum aestivum L. (Arida, Meritto, Verita) {{delivered to the}} mill for three years (2007 – 2009). Physico-chemical parameters observed during the purchase of grain (STN 461100 - 2) were not significantly different. Also milled flours from tested varieties have by processors required ash content, gluten, acceptable <b>Zeleny</b> <b>index,</b> α-amylase activity (falling number), but as the rheological properties of dough from these flours show, these parameters are unsuited enough (un) suitability of material for efficient processing of flour. Rheological evaluation showed that each variety is suitable for different processing direction. Therefore, if we deliberately separate lots of purchased grain, not only by basic physico-che­mi­cal properties listed in the current standards (CSN and STN), but also by their rheological properties, which are important and reliable indicator of {{the direction of the}} end-use processing of wheat flours, the flours {{will be more likely to}} succeed in specific cereal technology. For the production of bread was satisfactory rheological properties of dough from variety Arida. Verita variety is suitable for processing into wafers, and a variety Meritto for producing biscuits and crackers. Verita and Me­rit­to varieties so do not achieved the expected values of the rheological optimum for „classic“ bread processing (bakery products) despite satisfactory gluten content and falling number to use this processing direction. Reported results show us the possibilities of more efficient selection of varieties or lots purchased grain of wheat for use in baking and buscuit industry by using rheological evaluation methods.

40|$|The {{variation}} and path coefficient analysis of bread-making quality traits {{have been studied}} for 145 genotypes of breeding lines, cultivars and landrace varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Bread-making quality traits of genotypes was evaluated indirectly by protein percentage, SDS and Zeleny sedimentation tests, hardness index, test weight, bread volume, grain moisture, and water absorption percentage. Hardness <b>index,</b> <b>Zeleny</b> and SDS sedimentation tests had the highest coefficient of variability (13. 51 %, 11. 83 % and 11. 03 %, respectively). Factor analysis for the genotypes, based on qualitative traits revealed two factors, which explain 98. 23 % of total {{variation and}} were named grain protein index and bread volume factors. The result of correlation analysis indicated positive and significant relationship between protein percentage, SDS sedimentation test and other bread-making quality traits. On {{the first and second}} steps of stepwise regression analysis, protein percentage was the most effective trait in explaining different qualitative trait variations. Path analysis also showed the direct and significant effects of protein percentage, Zeleny sedimentation volume, grain moisture and water absorption percentage, and bread volume on SDS sedimentation test. According to cluster analysis based on qualitative traits, the cultivars and landrace varieties, from the view poit of protein quality and quantity, had the highest potential among other groups (generally breading lines) ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{focuses on}} researching the {{influence}} of natural additives on certain technological characteristics of mixtures used for bread production, more particularly {{the influence of}} N substances in used raw material on selected qualitative parameters of bread. The blends for bread production to be analysed were prepared by mixing wheat flour with an addition of oat, buckwheat, lentil and chickpea wholegrain flour in different portions (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 %). The experiment showed that the addition of natural additives worsened the protein complex of the blends used in bread production (worsening also qualitative parameters known as product volume). The loaves prepared with an addition of buckwheat, oat, lentil and chickpea were evaluated to be of a lesser quality from a technological viewpoint when compared with pure wheat loaves. The lower content of gluten forming proteins and the generally changed protein composition of blends due to additives caused a lower percentage of wet gluten content, its lower extensibility and swelling capacity. The sedimentation value (<b>Zeleny</b> <b>index)</b> decreased proportionally {{with the increase of}} addition until the level was unsatisfactory for raw material intended for bakery purposes. The N content in experimental loaves was higher than in the reference loaves and it increased according to the selected additive and its portion in the blend (more with the addition of lentil and chickpea, less in case of buckwheat and oat) which is considered as positive from a nutritional point of view. But from the technological point of view the additives did not show any positive influence and caused a lower loaf bread volume. The most significant decrease of the loaf bread volume was found with the addition of 50 % of buckwheat (- 45. 6 %). Better results were obtained with a lower portion of the additive: loaf with an addition of 30 % of chickpea (volume decreased by 12. 8 %) > loaf with an addition of 30 % of lentil (volume decreased by 8. 7 %) > loaf with an addition of 10 % of oat (volume decreased by 14. 3 %) > loaf with an addition of 10 % of buckwheat (volume decreased by 22. 7 %). Such products can be considered as technologically good or at least satisfactory. To increase the volume of bread loaves, 3 % of vital wheat gluten was added to blends mixed with a portion of 30 % and 50 % of additives. The results were not adequate however. The only exception was buckwheat, where the loaf volume was satisfactory despite the addition of 30 %.   doi: 10. 5219 / 77    </p...|$|E
