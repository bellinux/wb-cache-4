The zones are clearly {{defined by the}} contrast between the rusticated lower and calmer upper zones, separated by a prominent stringcourse. The heavy and monolithic rustication of the basement and ground-floor <b>zone,</b> <b>tempered</b> by the regular rhythm of arch-headed windows, is a clear reference to the Florentine 15th-century palazzo. The monotony of the ground floor is broken by formal entrances facing Kralja Petra and Cara Lazara streets. The upper zones display less restraint. The strict hierarchy of the first-floor composition pattern is given a more dynamic edge by alternating differently topped windows and accentuating the imposing windows above the entrances. The second-floor zone, simplified by a row of less ornate window openings, is surmounted by a protruding cornice and a balustraded parapet.|$|R
40|$|New {{materials}} {{require the}} use of advanced technology in manufacturing complex shape parts. One of the modern materials widely used in the tool industry for injection molds or hot stamping dies is high conductivity tool steel (HTCS) 150. Due to its hardness (55 HRC) and thermal conductivity at 66 W/mK, this material is difficult to machine by conventional treatment and is being increasingly manufactured by nonconventional technology such as electrical discharge machining (EDM). In the EDM process, material is removed from the workpiece by a series of electrical discharges that cause changes to the surface layers properties. The final state of the surface layer directly influences the durability of the produced elements. This paper presents the influence of EDM process parameters: discharge current Ic and the pulse time ton on surface layer properties. The experimental investigation was carried out with an experimental methodology design. Surface layers properties including roughness 3 D parameters, the thickness of the white layer, heat affected <b>zone,</b> <b>tempered</b> layer and occurring micro cracks were investigated and described. The influence of the response surface methodology (RSM) of discharge current Ic and the pulse time ton on the thickness of the white layer and roughness parameters Sa, Sds and Ssc were described and established...|$|R
50|$|Spiral welding is {{a process}} where a {{continuous}} full penetration MIG weld overlay is used to rebuild damage from wear, erosion, corrosion or cracking, or to increase the dimensions of a component to match an increased dimension on a mating part. Using the Spiral weld process eliminates the possible distortion of the component due to unbalanced stresses from normal welding processes. Spiral welding is a low energy input process, during which individual layers of weld and their associated heat affected <b>zones</b> are <b>tempered</b> and the grain structures refined by subsequent and overlapping temper beads.|$|R

The weld nugget increases and the fracture mode changes from interfacial fracture to nugget plug fracture {{with the increasing}} welding current. There are three distinct zones in the weld joint: weld nugget, heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal. The microstructure of HAZ includes <b>tempered</b> <b>zone</b> (HAZ- 1), incomplete quenching zone (HAZ- 2) and complete quenching zone (HAZ- 3).

40|$|Abstract. High {{flows and}} deep waters {{associated}} with thermal discharge canals invoke safety con-cerns and preclude {{the use of}} conventional fish sampling methodologies. Despite these challenges, {{it is critical that}} assessments of thermal effects from power generation do not rely solely on data collected in the plume, but also focus on fish living in the canal, particularly in regions above the <b>zone</b> of <b>tempering</b> influence. We deployed a fixed underwater videography apparatus to monitor the community composition and abundance patterns of fish in the Nanticoke thermal generating discharge canal on the north shore of Lake Erie from February 1, 1999 until July 31, 1999. We also compared the number of species observed using video to angling surveys, visual observations through the air/water interface and two modified netting procedures. Our results indicate that videography permitted the detection of the most species and the highest number of individuals. Variable visibility was the largest limitation of this approach. The addition of infrared lighting for low light conditions and a series of cameras positioned at several depths would be a cost effective, safe, and efficient method of assessing community structure and behaviour of fish in thermal discharge canals...|$|R
40|$|Double channel torch, {{which allows}} {{concentric}} flow {{of two different}} shielding gases, was designed and manufactured in order to pursue double channel torch {{gas metal arc welding}} of unalloyed structural steel S 235 JR (EN 10025 - 2) with fourteen passes. Tensile and Charpy V-notch tests were realized and the results were compared with those of conventional gas metal arc welding. In order to evaluate mechanical testing results, microstructural analyses were conducted. It was found that the increase with double channel gas metal arc welding process in yield and tensile strengths as well as in toughness tests, especially in subzero temperatures, compared with conventional gas metal arc welding was due to longer columnar grains and finer <b>tempered</b> <b>zone</b> grain structure between passes and due to solidification and less dendritic structure formation in all-weld metal in double channel gas metal arc welding...|$|R

40|$|Back {{tempering}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical problems in laser hardening of extended surfaces. In this type of treatment, several laser tracks are slightly overlapped to obtain a uniform hardened surface. Due to the overlapping, <b>tempered</b> <b>zones</b> are generated on the treated surface with the consequent lack of uniformity in the surface hardness. In this work, a regression model was developed to estimate the loss of hardness due to the tempering effect as a function of the thermal cycle. A specific test, named laser surface treatment test, was designed and executed to reproduce the hardness reduction due to the tempering effect. An analytical thermal model was developed to evaluate the thermal cycle undergone by the material during this test. By the results of the laser surface treatment test combined with the analytical model, a prediction model was estimated. Good agreement was found between predicted and measured hardness decrease, and the identified model could be integrated in a numerical code to evaluate the optimal process parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Laser surface modification, using a {{continuous}} wave CO 2 crosscurrent laser with generated beam power of 1 kW, {{was performed on}} the adamite steel, indefinite chilled cast iron and high speed steel rolls which were applied to the industries. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and micro Vickers hardness test were applied to reveal the microstructural details and hardness profiles of the laser treated zone. The results indicate that, laser treated zones of three roll samples consist of melting zone, phase transformation zone and heat affected zone. After laser treatment, the melting zone have low hardness compared to the phase transformation <b>zone,</b> but after <b>tempering</b> at 540 ℃ for 1 hr, the hardness at the melting zone dramatically increases, because of the formation of the fresh martensite from retained austenite. In contrast, the hardness at the phase transformation zone sharply decreases as fresh martensite changed to tempered martensite.

40|$|The post-weld {{tempered}} microstructure {{of hybrid}} laser-arc welded CA 6 NM, a cast low carbon martensitic stainless steel, was investigated. The microstructural evolutions from the fusion zone {{to the base}} metal were characterized in detail using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and microhardness techniques. The fusion zone, in its post-weld tempered condition, consisted of tempered lath martensite, residual delta-ferrite with various morphologies, reversed austenite and chromium carbides. The reversed austenite, which can be detected through both EBSD and XRD techniques, {{was found to be}} finely dispersed along the martensite lath boundaries, particularly at triple junctions. Based on the EBSD analysis, the orientation relationship between the reversed austenite and the adjacent martensite laths seemed to follow the Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) model. The results also revealed the presence of the reversed austenite in the different regions of the heat affected <b>zone</b> after post-weld <b>tempering.</b> The microindentation hardness distribution was measured, and correlated to the evolution of the corresponding microstructure across the welds.

30|$|Wear {{test results}} of tools made of {{high-speed}} tool steel (nos. 2, 3, 4) are very similar; even hardness of these tools is the same— 61 HRC, {{but the best}} wear performance was reached testing tool no. 4. Microstructural analysis revealed other important issue: tools nos. 2 and 3 were heat treated according to similar schedule; size of austenite grain in both is no. 11 (fine) according to the standard scale. Microstructure of tool no. 4 (Fig.  5 d) differs: tool was tempered at higher temperature or required hardening temperature was not reached, because microstructure consists of tempered martensite and fine uniformly distributed disperse carbides. Course enough primary carbides and light high alloyed trails are observed in the structure that shows segregation of alloying elements in the tool blank. Higher content of retained austenite presents in these segregation <b>zones,</b> showing that <b>tempering</b> process was incomplete; however, it did not affect wear resistance of tool—wear resistance of tool no. 4 is the highest. It is possible to maintain that regimes of heat treatment process influence wear behaviour of tools, {{but it was not}} studied in this research.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring laser cutting, {{the heat}} caused by cutting has thermal {{effects on the}} cutting surface. This results in a {{hardening}} zone directly at the cut edge and an adjacent <b>tempering</b> <b>zone.</b> These zones are often associated with undesirable effects such as surface cracking and fatigue resistance. In the present study, high-power CO 2 laser cutting of steel sheets is considered and the thermal influence of laser cutting and its main operating parameter, laser power, on the microhardness beneath the cutting section is examined using Vickers microhardness tester. The microstructure changes of the cut edge surface and of the cut surface are investigated using optical and electron scanning microscopes. The results show that laser cutting has a thermal effect on the surface microstructure and on the microhardness beneath the cut section. The microstructure and microhardness of the cut edge {{are affected by the}} main input laser cutting parameter, the laser power. Also the microhardness of the affected zone depends on the value of laser power. Microstructure analysis shows that high-power laser cutting leads to the formation of cracks and the average size of grains of the heat affected zone increases with laser power...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{degradation}} of the structural and mechanical parameters of DOMEX 700 MC steel due to welding process. It is focused on evaluation of the mechanical heterogeneities influence at higher strain rate. DOMEX 700 MC presents the microalloyed steel with the increasing utilization mainly for the lightweight construction of the transportation means. The precise characterization of material behavior at high strain rate is of great importance for reliable prediction of welded parts in that application. Evaluation of the local mechanical parameters of experimental welding joints was performed. The three-point instrumented dynamic fracture analyses and instrumented indentation tests were employed to study the elastic-plastic response of critical weldments sublayers. The static vs. dynamic yield strength and energy consumption to fracture was compared in different stages of temper influence. Structural analyses brought {{the information about the}} conducted structural changes in <b>tempered</b> <b>zone.</b> Fractography analyses were focused on evaluation of local differences in fracture behavior influenced by real metallurgy quality.

40|$|Abstract This study {{develops}} {{an explicit}} two-step Lagrangian {{scheme based on}} the renewal-reward pro-cess to capture transient anomalous diffusion with mixed retention and early arrivals in multidimensional media. The resulting 3 -D anomalous transport simulator provides a flexible platform for modeling transport. The first step explicitly models retention due to mass exchange between one mobile zone {{and any number of}} parallel immobile zones. The mobile component of the renewal process can be calculated as either an exponential random variable or a preassigned time step, and the subsequent random immobile time fol-lows a Hyper-exponential distribution for finite immobile <b>zones</b> or a <b>tempered</b> stable distribution for infinite immobile zones with an exponentially tempered power-law memory function. The second step describes well-documented early arrivals which can follow streamlines due to mechanical dispersion using the method of subordination to regional flow. Applicability and implementation of the Lagrangian solver are further checked against transport observed in various media. Results show that, although the time-nonlocal model parameters are predictable for transport with retention in alluvial settings, the standard time-nonlocal model cannot capture early arrivals. Retention and early arrivals observed in porous and fractured media can be efficiently modeled by our Lagrangian solver, allowing anomalous transport to be incorpo-rated into 2 -D/ 3 -D models with irregular flow fields. Extensions of the particle-tracking approach are also discussed for transport with parameters conditioned on local aquifer properties, as required by transient flow and nonstationary media. 1...|$|R
40|$|Within {{this project}} {{possibilities}} were studied to treat hardly accessible geometries of parts with solid-state lasers. The presented {{results show that}} with relativly simple means task oriented beam shaping {{for the purpose of}} laser surface treatment is possible. By this, the result of the treatment, depending on the intensity distribution at the workpiece, can be determined. Using this knowledge ring-shaped seat geometries for balls were hardened without any <b>tempering</b> <b>zone.</b> Areas of a workpiece with an opening larger than 10 - 15 mm can be hardened reproducibly by an immersing optic. As a water cooling system is implemented the thermal load of the optic can be neglected even at extended working periods. For openings smaller than 5 - 10 mm case widths of several millimeters can be produced at internal contours only by an oblique incidence of the laser beam. The usage of a process control system, controlling the temperature within the treated area, was very favorable to achieve high quality of the treatment. The integration of the laser hardening into conventional working machines permits the combination of laser and cutting processes, enabling the complete machining of parts in one single setting. A numeric simulation model was developed to calculate the resulting hardness distribution in the workpiece regarding the local carbon diffusion during the process related to the laser irradiation.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of carbon}} and alloy steels with various carbon contents {{before and after}} the gradient hardening by means of highly concentrated plasma jet have been investigated. It is shown that the resulting structure after the surface hardening has a substantially smaller grain size as compared to the bulk hardening. The steels with different carbon content, that is hypoeutectic steels 45 and 50 HN, eutectic steels – M 76, U 8, hypereutectoid steels – 90 HF, U 10 have been researched. Processing was carried out under the optimal conditions to ensure the highest hardness of the surface without melting. Metalgraphical studies were carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopes. High-dispersed martensite is the main structural component for hypoeutectic steels. Despite the fact that the heating temperature and the cooling rate {{in different parts of the}} plasma exposure zone differ greatly, the structure of the <b>tempered</b> <b>zone</b> is uniform by both the degree of dispersion and by the values of hardness. Plasma treatment of eutectic steels results in fine-grained structure of martensite of mainly lamellar morphology. High-dispersed martensite with microparticles of secondary carbides is characteristic of the hardened zones for hypereutectic steels. But austenite grains do not grow at heating as it usually happens in bulk hardening. The structure of the transition zone corresponds to part-hardened steels. So excess ferrite as well as martensite retains in hypoeutectic steels while excess cementite retains in hypereutectic steels. Eutectic steels are free from the intercritical interval, and the transition zone does not practically develop, there being a very sharp boundary between the zone of full hardening and the parent metal. Due to this structure of the plasma hardening zone of the surface layer there arises 3, 5 [...] . 4, 5 -fold increase in the hardness of the steel as compared with the normalized condition. This is due to the increase in the degree of saturation of the solid solution with alloying elements and carbon, and size-reduction of the hardened structur...|$|R
