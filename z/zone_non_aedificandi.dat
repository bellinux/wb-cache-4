In 1998, the winning design of Gustafson Porter brought together different aspects of Lebanon’s ancient heritage and rich landscapes, thus emphasizing national unity. Entering through an enclosed water garden, the visitor descends into layers from the city’s past, crossing terraces of olive and fruit trees. The two main streets of Roman Berytus, the Cardo and Decumanus Maximus, were discovered here. Their shaded colonnades became busy markets on festival days. At other times, the streets would have been frequented by Law School students and citizens passing to the Forum or visiting temples and churches. During excavations, a sacred platform dating from Phoenico-Persian times was found below the crossing of the Cardo and Decumanus Maximus. The Mamluk-Ottoman layers of this district revealed the sites of various religious cults within a network of narrow alleys. In the late 19th century, straight shopping streets replaced the alleys, while the sites of religious worship were enlarged and became prestigious monuments. Embedded in the fabric of Souk al-Nouriyyeh, the Sayyidat al-Nouriyyeh chapel, once a place of worship attended by Lebanese citizens from various confessions, did not survive the Lebanese Civil War.

40|$|Abstract: The {{sequential}} turbocharging {{technique is}} used to improve the performance of highly rated diesel engines in particular at part loads. However, the transient behaviour of the sequential turbocharging connection/disconnection phases {{may be difficult to}} calibrate and requires an accurate study and development. This may be accomplished, in addition to the necessary experimentation, by means of dynamic simulation techniques. In this paper a model for the dynamic simulation of a sequentially turbocharged diesel engine is presented. A two <b>zone,</b> <b>non</b> adiabatic, actual cycle approach is used for the chemical and thermodynamic phenomena simulation in the cylinder. Fluid mass and energy accumulation in the engine volumes are evaluated by means of a filling and emptying method. The simulation of the turbochargers dynamics combines the use of the compressor and turbine maps with a model of the sequential turbocharging connection/disconnection valves and of their governor system. The procedure is applied to the simulation of the Wärtsilä 18 V 26 X engine, a highly rated, recently developed, sequentially turbocharged marine diesel engine, whose experimental results are used for the steady state and transient validation of the simulation code with particular reference to the sequential turbocharging connection/disconnection phases.

40|$|L'usage quasi systématique de fertilisants sur de grandes {{surfaces}} {{a conduit}} la majorité des aquifères superficiels à un grave niveau de contamination par les nitrates. Des essais de gestion environnementale de cette problématique agricole sont conduits à l'échelle du bassin versant afin d'estimer les flux de nitrates percolant vers la nappe. La présente étude reprend les résultats issus de la modélisation d'un bassin versant dans le but d'appréhender l'évolution de la concentration en nitrates dans les eaux de la nappe. L'importance des conditions hydrogéologiques dans les relations entre <b>zones</b> <b>non</b> saturée et saturée a été mise en évidence par la comparaison des concentrations calculées dans la <b>zone</b> <b>non</b> saturée et observées dans la nappe. En règle générale, les concentrations sont très semblables pour les zones proches des limites amont du bassin, et se différencient de plus en plus vers l'aval du système. Une dilution semble se produire entre les flux percolant des différentes <b>zones</b> <b>non</b> saturées et les flux d'eau et de nitrates s'écoulant dans l'aquifère. Afin de tester cette hypothèse, un modèle de dilution basé sur les flux d'eau et de nitrates dans les <b>zones</b> <b>non</b> saturée et saturée est développé. Appliqué sur l'axe d'écoulement principal du système, le modèle de dilution permet de reproduire adéquatement les concentrations observées dans la nappe à partir de celles calculées dans le sol avec une erreur maximale variant de 1 à 22 %. Le couplage d'un modèle environnemental pour la zone racinaire du sol avec un modèle de dilution simple peut permettre le calcul des concentrations en nitrates dans la zone saturée. Toutefois, la prise en compte des conditions hydrogéologiques du système est nécessaire à un calcul de dilution efficace basé sur les valeurs des flux de percolation. Pesticides and nitrates represent the {{main sources of}} aquifer contamination in agricultural zones. In many regions, nitrate concentration levels reach and exceed the water quality criteria (50 mg NO 3 /L). The increasing use of mineral fertilizers (which has doubled during the 20 last years) and the intensive exploitation of the aquifers for crop irrigation (1, 1 million ha in France) have led to groundwater contamination by nitrates. The dynamics (long-term persistence) and extensiveness (regional contamination) of this contamination make it a sensitive environmental issue. Comprehensive environmental management is {{needed in order to}} limit the increase of the concentration levels and to reduce the extent of the contaminated areas. During the last few years, research has been done in the field of watershed management, from laboratory experiments to field investigations. At the same time, numerous simulation models have been developed at different investigation scales. Banton et al. (1993) developed a model specifically devoted to environmental management. Their model, AgriFlux, is based on a mechanistic approach to the processes, using a stochastic method that takes into account the spatial variability of the parameters. AgriFlux calculates the nitrate concentrations as well as the water fluxes in the unsaturated zone. The concentrations in the unsaturated zone (obtained by modeling or measurement) are generally dissimilar to those observed in the saturated zone (i. e. in the aquifer) because the infiltration water is diluted in the aquifer water. This difference indicates that the concentrations in the unsaturated zone cannot be used to accurately evaluate the actual risk of groundwater contamination. Hydrogeological conditions such as the recharge limits, the flow direction and the flow rate should be incorporated into the evaluation. In this paper, the modeling results obtained previously (Dupuy et al., 1997) with AgriFlux for the La Jannerie watershed are used to determine the concentrations in the aquifer and to compare them with the concentrations measured in the observation wells. This watershed (160 ha) is used exclusively for agriculture. The fractured carbonate strata (Superior Oxfordian) constitute a phreatic aquifer with a vertical extension of about 20 m. First, the temporal evolution of the annual mean concentrations in the aquifer is compared with the evolution of the annual precipitation. The results show that the mean concentrations tend to follow precipitation levels. However, the differences observed at different locations in the watershed cannot be explained by these results. The spatial evolution of the concentrations from the upstream to the downstream part of the aquifer was studied in order to explain the concentration distribution in the watershed. On the main flow line, the concentrations observed from 1985 to 1989 show a decrease from the P 7 well (upstream) to the P 26 well (downstream). This phenomenon can be attributed to two factors. First, denitrification may occur in the aquifer during flow. However, it is recognized in literature that the denitrification rate is usually low and {{a long period of time}} is required to obtain a significant decrease in the nitrate level. The observed attenuation cannot be imputed to this factor alone. The second possible cause is related to the dilution of the nitrates in the water contained in the aquifer. In order to test this hypothesis, a dilution model was elaborated using the watershed division as indicated in Dupuy et al. (1997). In each area, the resulting concentration is obtained by diluting the fluxes of water and nitrate leaching in the unsaturated zone in the fluxes of water and nitrates flowing from the upstream area. The concentrations in the aquifer are calculated from upstream areas to downstream areas for the period between 1985 and 1989. The pattern of the concentration curves obtained in this manner agrees with the trend measured in the different wells. The results clearly show a decrease of the concentration in the aquifer water leached from the unsaturated zone. For the downstream area (well P 26), the calculated concentrations are higher than the observed ones. This difference could be due to the fact that the lateral fluxes (flow convergence into the median part) are not taken into account and the concentrations may thus be overestimated. However, the mean resulting error (12 %) remains low considering the lack of knowledge of the aquifer characteristics. It is therefore possible to accurately estimate the nitrate concentrations in the saturated zone from the concentrations simulated in the unsaturated zone using a simple dilution model. However, this method is only valid for simple hydrogeological conditions...|$|R

L’originalité de ce travail est basée sur le fait que cette plate-forme expérimentale {{permet de}} rendre compte du rôle de la frange capillaire dans les phénomènes de transfert, ce qui est difficilement accessible sur des systèmes réduits de laboratoire ou dans les investigations sur site réel. L’objectif principal est l’évaluation quantitative des mécanismes de transfert de Composés Organiques Volatils (COV) depuis la <b>zone</b> <b>non</b> saturée vers la nappe dans le cas d’une source de pollution localisée en <b>zone</b> <b>non</b> saturée. Le cas du transport du trichloroéthylène (TCE) a été abordé où une analyse comparative du transfert du TCE depuis la <b>zone</b> <b>non</b> saturée vers la nappe via la frange capillaire est présentée en étudiant les deux mécanismes : dispersion et dissolution. Dans la première expérience, la dispersion passive de la pollution par les vapeurs depuis la <b>zone</b> <b>non</b> saturée vers la nappe via la frange capillaire est étudiée. Dans la seconde expérience, l’impact sur la pollution de la nappe du lessivage des vapeurs par une pluie contrôlée est quantifié. Les résultats montrent que la dispersion passive des vapeurs peut causer une pollution significative de l’eau de la nappe, et ce, malgré la lenteur du processus de diffusion dans la partie inférieure de la frange capillaire suffisamment saturée en eau. Le lessivage des vapeurs par la pluie provoque une pollution de nappe plus importante et plus étendue. La quantification des flux de pollution partant de la <b>zone</b> <b>non</b> saturée vers la nappe a été réalisée dans la première expérience en se servant de la méthode de JOHNSON et PANKOW (1992), et du code de calcul (Hydrus) dans la seconde expérience. Les résultats expérimentaux et analytiques mettent en évidence, d’une part, le rôle d’écran joué par la frange capillaire contre le transfert de la pollution vers la nappe, et d’autre part, l’augmentation significative du degré et de l’étendue de la pollution de la nappe en cas de lessivage des vapeurs par les eaux de pluie. Two large-scale experiments {{were conducted on}} a controlled artificial aquifer referred to as SCERES (Site Contrôlé Expérimental de Recherche pour la Réhabilitation des Eaux et des Sols: 25  x  12  x  3  m). The experimental tool SCERES was completely buried in the subsurface {{in order to get}} stable temperature conditions in the aquifer. The hydraulic gradient, flow rate, visualization of the water table and water sampling were managed and monitored in two technical pits located at the upstream and downstream ends of the SCERES basin. It was packed with a main layer of uniform quartz sand and a 0. 5  m-deep drainage layer {{at the bottom of the}} basin having hydraulic conductivities of 8  x  10 ‑ 4 and 6  x  10 ‑ 3  m/s respectively. The quartz sand had a mean grain diameter of 0. 45  mm, a total porosity of 0. 4 and a uniformity coefficient of 2. 1; its longitudinal dispersivity was determined in laboratory column experiments to be approximately 1  mm. The aquifer is composed of a 1  m-thick saturated zone and a 2  m-thick unsaturated zone, making it possible to monitor the propagation of vapours in this zone. The hydraulic gradient of the groundwater was fixed at 0. 003  m/m, which corresponded to a flow rate of 0. 5  m 3 /h and an average velocity of approximately 0. 4  m/day. The thickness of the capillary fringe was estimated to be approximately 0. 25  m as deduced from water profile measurements by exploration with a TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) probe. In the capillary fringe, water saturation at depths of 1. 85 and 1. 95  m was approximately 57 % and more than 90 %, respectively. The contaminant chosen for these experiments was trichloroethylene (TCE), because it is among the most frequently detected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in subsurface environments. TCE as the pure phase was injected 0. 35  m beneath the soil surface of SCERES with an experimental design that maintained a uniform infiltration of TCE in the vadose zone for 15  min. The chosen injection device was built from a stainless steel tank (0. 58  m diameter and 0. 15  m height), on which 31 screened brass rods were fixed at the bottom and separated by a distance of 0. 1  m. Each rod contained four injection holes of 0. 2  mm diameter in the lower extremity (JELLALI, 2000; JELLALI et al., 2001). In order to prevent TCE volatilization from the device during injection, the TCE volume in the injection tank was covered with a 0. 02  m thick water layer. The resulting vapour and aqueous phases were monitored along with temperature and moisture content in order to investigate the mass transfer of VOC from the unsaturated zone to groundwater. The originality of this research was based on the fact that the controlled SCERES site allowed the study of transfer phenomena in the capillary fringe, which is difficult to reach in a reduced laboratory physical model or in a real contaminated site. This characteristic offers an exceptional opportunity for data acquisition in controlled conditions between laboratory and site scales. This aspect is of importance due to the fact that in this capillary zone, water content varies with depth and this situation causes changes in flow rate affecting the intensity of the pollution flux. This study aimed to quantify, in an experimental way, the pollution flux from the unsaturated zone towards the groundwater. In the first experiment, carried out in the summer (July-September), the infiltrated TCE volume was 5  L. In the second experiment, carried out in autumn (October-December), the TCE volume was 3  L in order to increase the distance between the pollution source and the water-table. These volumes were selected on the basis of previous knowledge of TCE residual saturations determined in laboratory column tests (JELLALI, 2000) and in order to obtain a pollution source limited to the unsaturated zone. The first experiment was conducted without water infiltration to study the dispersion of TCE vapours across the capillary fringe, while the second experiment was carried out with a limited rain infiltration in order to investigate the effect of vapour leaching on groundwater pollution. The transport of TCE was monitored in the vadose zone, the capillary fringe and the groundwater where a comparative analysis of two mechanisms of TCE transfer from the unsaturated zone to groundwater via the capillary fringe was carried out: dispersion and dissolution. In both cases, the coupling of measurements of pollutant concentrations in the unsaturated zone, the capillary fringe and the groundwater of SCERES allowed us to take into account the mechanisms intervening near the source area, on a scale close to that of a real pollution problem. The concentration of dissolved TCE was analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) after liquid-liquid extraction with hexane. The online quantitative analysis of TCE vapours was performed by a multigas monitor equipped with a photoacoustic infrared detector. For the first experiment, the TCE mass fluxes from the vadose zone to groundwater were quantified using the method of JOHNSON and PANKOW (1992) where we applied the analytical solution of GRATHWOHL (1998) and incorporated parameters due to the capillary fringe. For the second experiment, we used the numerical code HYDRUS that allowed the simulation of one-dimensional flow in the unsaturated zone. In this example, the TCE mass fluxes leaving the unsaturated zone to the groundwater due to rain infiltration were obtained from the knowledge of the infiltration flow rate and the measured concentrations at the top of the capillary fringe. The observed results indicate that the hydrodynamic dispersion of TCE vapours within the capillary fringe (vertical dispersion) can cause significant groundwater pollution despite the slowness of the aqueous diffusion in the lower region of the highly water saturated capillary fringe. Vapour leaching due to controlled water infiltration causes more significant groundwater pollution in degree and extent than vertical dispersion. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate, on the one hand, the role of the capillary fringe as a barrier against pollution transfer to groundwater when the only mechanism is hydrodynamic dispersion, and on the other hand, significant enhancement of groundwater contamination due to the capture and leaching of vapours from the vadose zone by infiltrating water...|$|R

Nowadays high supercharged diesel engines are developed, characterised by increasing values of b. m. e. p.

The sequential turbocharging solution, however, needs an accurate study and development, in particular as regards the sequential turbocharging connection/disconnection phases.

40|$|Sedimentation {{processes}} in man-made water reservoirs reduce their main asset: the volume storage capacity. This raises engineering, {{environmental and economic}} issues for the communities {{around the world and}} in particular for the areas affected by strong water deficit. Because of Uzbekistan's arid climatic conditions and uneven spatial and temporal water resources distribution, responsive and innovative water availability assessment surveys of all major water reservoirs are required. Bathymetric survey is a traditional method that is carried out for the estimation of reservoir volumes and surface areas for the corresponding reservoir stages in order to assess the water availability. Volume and surface area differences derived from multiple surveys of a reservoir provide storage loss estimates over time due to sedimentation. However, two main factors such as intensive field data measurement and post data-processing often limit the frequency of these surveys. Alternatively, innovative depth measurement technologies coupled with contouring and surface mapping programs provide automated reservoir volume and surface area calculations. This significantly reduces time, work load and financial burdens for reservoir sedimentation projects. This study deals {{with the use of a}} geostatistical approach to assess the reservoir sedimentation in the Akdarya reservoir in Uzbekistan. Geostatistical approach includes (semi-) variogram analysis and interpolation (kriging and simulations (turning bands)) techniques predicting values at unsampled locations for generating digital bathymetric surface models of reservoir bottom conditions in order to calculate volume and surface area at given water elevation. Simulation enables to have range of reservoir volumes and surface areas with the same probability in comparison to the kriging and traditional methods. This gives a real estimation of the water resource availability for operators and managers to sustainably manage natural resources and hydraulic infrastructure.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of chaotic scattering we analyze passive tracer transport in finite systems. In particular, we study models with open streamlines and {{a finite number of}} recirculation <b>zones.</b> In the <b>non</b> trivial case with a small number of recirculation zones a description by mean of asymptotic quantities (such as the eddy diffusivity) is not appropriate. The non asymptotic properties of dispersion are characterized by means of the exit time statistics, which shows strong sensitivity on initial conditions. This yields a probability distribution function with long tails, making impossible a characterization in terms of a unique typical exit time. Comment: 16 RevTeX pages + 6 eps-figures include...|$|R
40|$|We present BeppoSAX {{observations}} of the two FR I type radio galaxies Hercules A (3 C 348) and MRC 0625 - 536 in the energy range 0. 2 - 200 keV. Data analysis shows that the X-ray flux from Hercules A {{is consistent with a}} diffuse thermal plasma emitting at T ≈ 4 - 5 keV with a possible, but somewhat uncertain, contribution of a softer component at T ≈ 3 keV. The non thermal emission from the active nucleus must be significantly smaller than the thermal one, and no indication of relevant core obscuration by a surrounding torus was detected. The flux from MRC 0625 - 536 originates form an extended region and has been fitted to a thermal law with T ≈ 5. 7 keV and with a column density consistent with the galactic absorption. A spatially resolved spectral analysis does not show a relevant variation of the temperature and the metallicity across the diffuse emission <b>zone.</b> A <b>non</b> thermal spectral component, related to the nuclear activity, may be present in the innermost region with some possible amount of local obscuration, contributing 10...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} Feldstein-Horioka {{coefficients}} for 37 African countries using the recently developed Pool Mean Group (PMG), Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) and Dynamic OLS (DOLS) panel cointegration techniques. The empirical findings {{reported in the}} paper reveal that savings and investment are nonstationary and cointegrated series. The estimated coefficients using FMOLS, DOLS and PMG are 0. 38, 0. 58 and 0. 36, respectively for the sample as a whole for the period 1970 - 2006. These results confirm the previous studies that capital was relatively mobile in African countries. In addition, our study shows that there are marked differences in saving-retention coefficients for different country groups in Africa (Franc CFA <b>zone</b> countries and <b>non</b> Franc CFA <b>zone</b> countries; oil producing and non-oil producing countries; civil law and common law countries).

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an Optical Character Recognition {{engine for}} Kannada and English {{character}} recognition is proposed based on zone features. The zone {{is one of}} the old concepts in case of document image analysis research. But this method is good in case of Kannada and English character recognition. The total of 2800 Kannada consonants and 2300 English lowercase alphabets sample images are classified based on the SVM classifier. All preprocessed images are normalized into 32 x 32 dimensions, it is optimum. Then the preprocessed image is divided into 64 <b>zones</b> of <b>non</b> overlapping and <b>zone</b> based pixel density is calculated for each of the 64 zones, there by generating 64 features. These features are fed to the SVM classifier for classification of character images. To test the performance of an algorithm 2 fold cross validation is used. The average recognition accuracy of 73. 33 % and 96. 13 % is obtained for Kannada consonants and English lowercase alphabets respectively. Further the average percentage of recognition accuracy of 83. 02 % is obtained for mixture input of both Kannada and English characters. The recognition accuracy obtained for Kannada consonants is low, because most of the characters are similar in shape. Hence, one may need to add some more dominating features to discriminating the characters. In this direction, the work is in progress. It is an initial attempt for mixture of Kannada and English characters recognition with single algorithm. The novelty of the algorithm is independent of thinning and slant of the characters...|$|R
40|$|The {{concrete}} {{is modeled}} as a material with damage and plasticity, whereat the viscoplastic and the viscoelastic behaviour {{depends on the}} rate of the total strains. Due to the damage behaviour the compliance tensor develops different properties in tension and compression. There have been tested various yield surfaces and flow rules, damage rules respectively to their usability in a concrete model. One three-dimensional yield surface was developed from a failure surface based on the Willam [...] Warnke five-parameter model by the author. Only one general uni-axial stress-strain-relation is used for the numeric control of the yield surface. From that curve all necessary parameters for different strengths of concrete and different strain rates can be derived by affine transformations. For the flow rule in the compression <b>zone</b> a <b>non</b> associated inelastic potential is used, in the tension zone a Rankine potential. Conditional on the time-dependent formulation, the symmetry of the system equations is maintained in spite of the usage of non-associated potentials for the derivation of the inelastic strains. In case of quasi statical computations a simple viscoplastic law is used that is rested on an approach to Perzyna. The principle of equality of dissipation power in the uni-axial and the three-axial state of stress is used. It is modified by a factor that depends on the actual stress ratio and in comparison with the Kupfer experiments it implicates strains that are more realistic. The implementation of the concrete model is conducted in a mixed hybrid finite element. Examples in the structural level are introduced for verification of the concrete model...|$|R

Special attention was devoted to the tempera-ture control {{in order to avoid}} physic-chemical transformation of this low melting point material. Under ultrasonic fa-tigue tests, important heat dissipation takes place at the narrow section of hourglass shape specimen leading to high temperature at this zone. The specimen was calculated to meet the resonance condition with the smallest dimensions at its narrow section, with aim to reduce the temperature gradient at this <b>zone</b> of this <b>non</b> heat conducting material. Tem-perature at narrow section was maintained lower than 45 ˚C using a cooling system with cooling air; under this condi-tion the ultrasonic fatigue tests were performed. Experimental tests were carried out at low loading range (9 %- 12. 5 % of the elastic limit of material) in order to control the highest temperature and to avoid that specimen was out of reso-nance condition. Experimental results are analyzed together with the fracture surfaces and conclusions are presented concerning the ultrasonic fatigue endurance of this polymeric material...|$|R

He is also the husband and second-in-command of Astra, identical twin sister of Supergirl's mother, Alura. As in the comics, he led a separatist movement on Krypton before being apprehended. Non was imprisoned {{with his wife in}} the Phantom Zone when Krypton was destroyed, and he, his wife, and an army of other aliens managed to escape the Phantom Zone when Kara Zor-El's pod first crashes into Earth. Astra leads them with the intention of saving Earth from humanity, but for years they are hunted by the American government's DEO, while Kara Zor-El, known as Kara Danvers on Earth, grows up. Once Kara takes on the mantle of Supergirl, she aids her adoptive sister Alex Danvers, DEO agent, in hunting the Phantom <b>Zone</b> escapees. <b>Non</b> pressures Astra to proceed with her plan to [...] "save" [...] the Earth, despite her knowing that she must kill her niece Kara to succeed. After Astra is killed at the hands of Alex Danvers, Non takes command of the remaining Kryptonians and sets out to do her bidding. Working now with the villainous Indigo, Non decides to proceed with Project Myriad, a Kryptonian program that enables mind control of masses and blocks off ideas of hope and saving. With Supergirl having freed the citizens of National City from the effect, Non decides to take the project a step further and destroy the craniums of every human on Earth. However, before the two can execute their genocidal plan completely, Non and Indigo face Supergirl and her ally Martian Manhunter. As the Manhunter takes on Indigo, Supergirl and Non fight and end up locked in a battle of heat vision. Despite Non overcoming Supergirl's heat vision initially, her emotions soon help Supergirl unleash her full potential, burning his eyes out in the process.|$|R
40|$|Tillage {{is one of}} the {{important}} managing factors that can destroy or improve soil structure. Soil structure is affected by the machines and shape of the wheels. Field experiments were conducted at Hamadan Agricultural Research Station on a coarse loamy mixed mesic Calcixerolic Xerocrepts soil to measure and evaluate the effects of tillage and wheel-induced compaction on selected soil physical properties. Treatments included tillage methods (Moldboard Plow and Chisel Plow, (MP, CP)) performed using three customary tractors in Iran [John Deer (J), Romany (R) and Massey Ferguson (MF) ]. Traffic <b>zone</b> and <b>non</b> traffic <b>zone</b> were other treatments. A split-plot design with three replications was used in a completely randomized arrangement of treatments. Soil samples were taken at the end of wheat growth season in traffic and non- traffic zone and from four layers and compared for bulk density (BD), cone index (CI), and mean weight diameter (MWD). The influence of both tillage methods on BD in most soil depths was not significant, meanwhile, BD was higher in the deeper layers. Wheel traffic did not affect BD significantly, but its effect decreased by increasing the depth. Commonly, conservation tillage increased structural stability as evaluated by MWD. Cone index illustrated the same trend as for BD, with some variation because of it higher sensitivity, so it was significantly was increased in CP rather than in MP for the traffic zone. Such a difference was not observed in non-traffic zone. The CI was also significantly increased in traffic zone compared with non-traffic zone. J significantly increased CI in two first layer in comparing with MF, but there was not significant difference between J and R. The MWD was increased by chisel plow in non-traffic zone and this increment was significant in fourth soil layer (22. 5 - 30 cm). Wheel traffic caused the increase of MWD in the second layer and significant difference was not observed in other layers. Overall, R caused less destruction in soil structure and tillage methods changed some of soil physical properties...|$|R
40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants, many {{components}} {{to be tested}} by non destructive ultrasonic means can be heterogeneous. Welds, for instance, may be described as sets of disoriented anisotropic <b>zones</b> separated by <b>non</b> planar interfaces. Such materials {{have to be considered}} in the calculation of the field because they often lead to beam deviation and distortion effects. Needs for simulation of ultrasonic testing in such media are more and more expressed in order to demonstrate the performances of a given testing configuration or to help the design of new adapted ones. Here a 3 D-model is presented which fulfills such industrial requirements, being able to deal with any arbitrarily shaped transducer, being numerically efficient so that intensive use is allowed (to assist the settings and interpretation of tests in power plants), and being transient so that wideband fields can be computed. This is an extension of the software Champ-Sons previously described a few years ago [1, 2]. Here, a special interest is given to the effects of heterogeneity since the anisotropy has been treated last year [3]. The method used is a pencil method, related to the Geometrical Optics (GO) approximation. This method is presented {{in the first part of}} this paper. Different configurations are studied and then the general case is considered. The second part gives numerical examples of such calculations. Finally, a summary is given...|$|R
40|$|U. S. {{commercial}} airports {{serve as}} gateways for cities competing globally. Local policy-makers can enhance air service in two ways: by providing {{financial support to}} airlines adding destinations, or expanding airport runway capacity to trigger a supply shock. This dissertation investigates the political economy and planning of airport expansions by addressing the following questions: To what extent does expanding airport capacity contribute to the impacts of air service on employment growth at metro area level? To what extent does airport-related employment growth and development occur in areas closer to the airport, and through which mechanisms in terms of airport expansions and planning initiatives? How do decision-makers of airport expansions perceive the impacts of the airport in the regional economy, and integrate this conceptualization in their decisions? The study uses quantitative and qualitative methods. A landscape study of airport expansions leads to statistical analyses of the association between air service, economic growth and airport expansions, and the selection of case studies. A study of airport zones leads to a typology and statistical models describing the role of air traffic in supporting airport zone employment growth. Finally, three case studies are conducted to study how airport expansions are decided and how their impacts are assessed. The positive association between air traffic and economic growth {{does not appear to}} be mediated, on average, by airport expansions. Airport zone employment does not appear to grow faster than in the rest of the metro areas. The concentration of airport-related sectors, transportation, warehousing and car rental, decreases on average between 2002 and 2011, which suggests a diversification of airport <b>zones</b> toward <b>non</b> airport-activity sectors. However, the professional services sectors remain under-represented in the airport zone. Statistical models suggest that passenger traffic and airport location influence airport zone employment. The case studies suggest that the metrics the “airport growth coalition” uses to measure the success of their airport and their air service development strategy are narrower than employment growth. These findings suggest avenues for additional research on the role of air traffic in metropolitan economies and the evolution of airport zones in the U. S. ...|$|R
