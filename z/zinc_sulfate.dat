40|$|This article {{describes}} the consolidation of two Vietnamese portrait paintings that had suffered flaking paint, tenting and blind cleavage. Scientific analysis revealed the presence of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfates</b> {{as a result of}} the degradation processes. This posed consolidation issues since <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfates</b> are very water soluble. A discussion of paint characteristics demonstrates the particular requirements of consolidants. The effect of consolidants and their manner of application on matte paint films is elucidated, followed by a description of testing of consolidants. The only consolidant suitable for use was found to be Aquazol, hence this was tested at length before being used to consolidate the paint layers. Aquazol was also used as a filling and retouching medium. The properties of Aquazol are discussed, and two potential methods of identification of Aquazol, when used as a conservation material, were demonstrated; using Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS) ...|$|R

25|$|A {{galvanic}} cell whose electrodes are zinc and copper submerged in <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> and copper sulfate, respectively, {{is known as}} a Daniell cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{porous pot}} {{version of the}} Daniell cell was invented by John Dancer, a Liverpool {{instrument}} maker, in 1838. It consists of a central zinc anode dipped into a porous earthenware pot containing a <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> solution. The porous pot is, in turn, immersed in a solution of copper sulfate contained in a copper can, which acts as the cell's cathode. The use of a porous barrier allows ions to pass through but keeps the solutions from mixing.|$|E

25|$|The <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> layer {{was clear}} in {{contrast}} to the deep blue copper sulfate layer, which allowed a technician to measure the battery life with a glance. On the other hand, this setup meant the battery could be used only in a stationary appliance, else the solutions would mix or spill. Another disadvantage was that a current had to be continually drawn to keep the two solutions from mixing by diffusion, so it was unsuitable for intermittent use.|$|E
25|$|The gravity cell {{consisted}} of a glass jar, in which a copper cathode sat {{on the bottom and}} a zinc anode was suspended beneath the rim. Copper sulfate crystals would be scattered around the cathode and then the jar would be filled with distilled water. As the current was drawn, a layer of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> solution would form at the top around the anode. This top layer was kept separate from the bottom copper sulfate layer by its lower density and by the polarity of the cell.|$|E
25|$|If {{diagnosed}} {{and treated}} early enough, patients with Wilson's disease may live long and productive lives. Wilson's disease is managed by copper chelation therapy with D-penicillamine (which picks up and binds copper and enables patients to excrete excess copper accumulated in the liver), therapy with <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> or zinc acetate, and restrictive dietary metal intake, {{such as the}} elimination of chocolate, oysters, and mushrooms. Zinc therapy is now the treatment of choice. Zinc produces a mucosal block by inducing metallothionein, which binds copper in mucosal cells until they slough off and are eliminated in the feces. and it competes with copper for absorption in the intestine by DMT1 (Divalent Metal transporter 1). More recently, experimental treatments with tetrathiomolybdate showed promising results. Tetrathiomolybdate {{appears to be an}} excellent form of initial treatment in patients who have neurologic symptoms. In contrast to penicillamine therapy, initial treatment with tetrathiomolybdate rarely allows further, often irreversible, neurologic deterioration.|$|E

The dobesilates were characterized by standard spectral methods and by AAS for metal content and then tested for inhibitory activity against aminopeptidase N.

40|$|Field {{observation}} of lignite strip mine spoils from the Darco mine near Marshall, Texas, revealed that gray spoil materials of various ages were devoid of vegetation. Within the same sites, spoil materials which were non-gray supported several conditions of revegetation.

Gray materials appear to have greater mineral sources of <b>zinc,</b> iron, and <b>sulfate</b> than non-gray spoils, and greater concentrations of zinc, calcium, magnesium, and potassium at all sites. Further, older spoils (17 to 31 years of age) have mean pH values below 5. 0, a more rapid decline in pH, and greater concentrations of <b>zinc,</b> iron, <b>sulfate,</b> and aluminum.
