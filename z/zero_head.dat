40|$|This study {{presents}} an electromagnetically-actuated reciprocating pump for high-flow-rate microfluidic applications. The pump comprises four major components, namely a lower glass plate containing a copper microcoil, a middle PMMA plate incorporating a PDMS diaphragm with a surface-mounted magnet, upper PMMA channel plates, and a ball-type check valve {{located at the}} channel inlet. When an AC current is passed through the microcoil, an alternating electromagnetic force is established between the coil and the magnet. The resulting bi-directional deflection of the PDMS diaphragm causes the check-valve to open and close; thereby creating a pumping effect. The experimental results show that a coil input current of 0. 4 A generates an electromagnetic force of 47 mN and a diaphragm deflection of 108 μm.

This research builds on the earlier projects; ''Development of Highly Integrated Magnetically and Electrostatically Actuated Micropumps'' (SAND 2003 - 4674) and ''Development of Magnetically and Electrostatically Driven Surface Micromachined Pumps'' (SAND 2002 - 0704 P). In this year's LDRD we designed 2 nd generation of surface micromachined (SMM) gear and viscous pumps. Two SUMMiT{trademark} modules full of design variations of these pumps were fabricated and one SwIFT{trademark} module is still in fabrication. The SwIFT{trademark} fabrication process results in a transparent pump housing cover that will enable visualization inside the pumps. Since the SwIFT{trademark} pumps have not been tested as they are still in fabrication, this report will focus on the 2 nd generation SUMMiT{trademark} designs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Water {{is central}} to survival, without water human, plant and animal life would be impossible. Therefore supply of water {{has become one of}} the {{fundamental}} requirements of any society and the need to transfer water has generated the design of various forms of mechanical devices, which can be categorized as pumps. Jet pump is a device that performs its pumping action by the transfer of energy from a high velocity supply jet to one of low velocity suction flow. These two flows mix in the mixing tube and the kinetic energy of the combined flow is converted partially into the pressure energy in the diffuser. The optimization of the design of multi hole nozzle jet pump with various pitch circle diameter (PCD) and five different diameter mixing tubes. The area ratios chosen have been modified and the final area ratios used were R = 0. 20, 0. 28, 0. 36, 0. 43 & 0. 50. From the graphs, head ratio at zero discharge ratios (No), discharge ratio at <b>zero</b> <b>head</b> ratio (Mo) and slope of M-N (m) curve were noted along with the extrapolated values of maximum efficiency (�bep), optimum discharge ratio (Mopt), and optimum head ratio (Nopt) and tabulated. In order to distinguish these nozzle plates from these charts one can conclude that efficiency is higher at lower pitch circle diameter, lower mixing tube diameter and higher area ratios. In the range of experiments conducted highest maximum efficiency was obtained for an area ratio of 0. 43 with 2 holes on 13 PCD with 25. 9 mm mixing tube...|$|E
40|$|Given {{that there}} is {{increasing}} recognition of the effect that submillimetre changes in collimator position can have on radiotherapy beam dosimetry, this study aimed to evaluate the potential variability in small field collimation that may exist between otherwise matched linacs. Field sizes and field output factors were measured using radiochromic film and an electron diode, for jaw- and MLC-collimated fields produced by eight dosimetrically matched Varian iX linacs (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, USA). This study used nominal sizes from 0. 6 × 0. 6 to 10 × 10 cm 215, for jaw-collimated fields,and from 1 × 1 to 10 × 10 cm 216, for MLC-collimated fields, delivered from a <b>zero</b> (<b>head</b> up, beam directed vertically downward) gantry angle. Differences between the field sizes measured for the eight linacs exceeded {{the uncertainty of the}} film measurements and the repositioning uncertainty of the jaws and MLCs on one linac. The dimensions of fields defined by MLC leaves were more consistent between linacs, while also differing more from their nominal values than fields defined by orthogonal jaws. The field output factors measured for the different linacs generally increased with increasing measured field size for the nominal 0. 6 × 0. 6 and 1 × 1 cm 2 fields, and became consistent between linacs for nominal field sizes of 2 × 2 cm 2 25 and larger. The inclusion in radiotherapy treatment planning system beam data of small field output factors acquired in fields collimated by jaws (rather than the more-reproducible MLCs), associated with either the nominal or the measured field sizes, should be viewed with caution. The size and reproducibility of the fields (especially the small fields) used to acquire treatment planning data should be investigated thoroughly as part of the linac or planning system commissioning process. Further investigation of these issues, using different linac models, collimation systems and beam orientations, is recommended...|$|E

40|$|LectureBarrios (2007) {{conducted}} an experimental work in which was {{demonstrated that the}} two-phase stage performance of an electrical submersible pump (ESP) {{is related to the}} impeller gas and liquid flow pattern as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) for a volute-type centrifugal pump. Barrios (2007) proved that the stage head breakdown is a consequence of the gas pocket formation in the impeller channel as in a volute type pump. However, the gas pocket is described as unstable by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a) so a slug-flow-like pattern is observed in the impeller channel at the head breakdown conditions. Barrios (2007) observed that the gas segregates near the back shroud after the gas pocket formation so that it is stable and a gas segregated pattern is observed into the impeller. The discrepancy between both studies may imply that different mechanisms are acting in the gas pocket formation and its stability, which finally affects the stage performance. The objective of this research is to study the gas pocket behavior through the visualization of the flow pattern within an ESP impeller at different operating conditions and fluid properties. Therefore, a series of experimental tests has been conducted utilizing a two-stage prototype at rotational speeds between 600 rpm and 1000 rpm, 2 psig inlet pressure and volumetric gas fraction up to 10 percent. This prototype was built with a transparent acrylic casing to easily observe the flow pattern within the impeller, at the diffuser region and at the impeller inlet region. The gas and liquid flow patterns are observed from videos taken with high speed cameras. Two ports for gas injection have been disposed so the gas can be injected directly to the impeller inlet to get the single stage performance or through the first stage to obtain the multistage performance. A combination of different fluids such as distilled water and air, distilled water and sulfur hexafluoride, and air and a mixture of isopropanol (IPA) and water was utilized in this study. The videos show that the gas pocket is small and located near the front shroud at liquid flow rates higher than stage best efficiency point (BEP). It is formed and dragged out by liquid flowing over the gas pocket as mentioned by Murakami and Minemura (1974 a). The gas pocket becomes stable once it has grown through the channel cross section area when the liquid flow rate is reduced down to BEP. At this operating condition, the gas pocket reduces the upper flowing area and forces the liquid to flow in the remaining area between the gas pocket and the trailing channel face. Further reduction of liquid flow rate below the BEP causes the gas pocket to segregate forcing the liquid to flow underneath as Barrios (2007) mentioned. The gas pocket is formed even at <b>zero</b> <b>head,</b> which demonstrates that it is a consequence of bubble coalescence within impeller channel. The critical gas fraction for the gas pocket formation varies as a function of gas density while its stability and formation {{is a function of the}} surface tension and bubble size...|$|E

An effective treatment that educates parents and school personnel can decrease these rates of absenteeism. This study analyses absenteeism rates in primary aged school children infected with head lice and the effectiveness of the <b>Zero</b> Tolerance <b>head</b> lice treatment program. Success is defined as a decreased time period until children were allowed to return to their scholastic activities. Methods: Retrospective review of absenteeism data acquired over a four-year period for subjects ages 5 to 12 years. Results: 819 subjects were recorded throughout 1999 - 2003. There was an overall decrease in gross days absent in six of seven schools examined. There was a decreased incidence of pediculosis in six of seven schools examined. There was an overall decrease in the mean number of days missed per infected individual in three of the seven school investigated. There was an increase in mean number of days missed in four of the seven schools investigated with standard deviation values as large as 1. 6.
