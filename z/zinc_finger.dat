25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{researchers}} developed <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> nucleases, synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains {{enable them to}} create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> nucleases and TALENs require {{the creation of a}} custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.|$|E

40|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> {{are usually}} {{associated}} with proteins that interact with DNA. Yet in two oocyte-specific Xenopus proteins, TFIIA and p 43, <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> are used to bind 5 S RNA. One of these, TFIIIA, also binds the 5 S RNA gene. Both proteins have nine <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> that are nearly identical with respect to size and spacing. We have determined the relative affinities of groups of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> from TFIIIA for both 5 S RNA and the 5 S RNA gene. We have also determined the relative affinities of groups of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> from p 43 for 5 S RNA. The primary protein regions for RNA and DNA interaction in TFIIIA are located {{at opposite ends of}} the molecule. All <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> from TFIIIA participate in binding 5 S RNA, but <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> from the C terminus have the highest affinity. N-terminal <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> are essential for binding the 5 S RNA gene. In contrast, <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> at the amino terminus of p 43 are essential for binding 5 S RNA...|$|R
40|$|SUMO-binding {{proteins}} {{interact with}} SUMO modified proteins to mediate {{a wide range}} of functional consequences. Here, we report the identification of a new SUMO-binding protein, ZNF 261. Four human proteins including ZNF 261, ZNF 198, ZNF 262, and ZNF 258 contain a stretch of tandem <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> called myeloproliferative and mental retardation (MYM) -type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers.</b> We demonstrated that MYM-type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> from ZNF 261 and ZNF 198 are necessary and sufficient for SUMO-binding and that individual MYM-type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> function as SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs). Our binding studies revealed that the MYM-type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> from ZNF 261 and ZNF 198 interact with the same surface on SUMO- 2 recognized by the archetypal consensus SIM. We also present evidence that MYM-type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> in ZNF 261 contain zinc, but that zinc is not required for SUMO-binding. Immunofluorescence microscopy studies using truncated fragments of ZNF 198 revealed that MYM-type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> of ZNF 198 are necessary for localization to PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). In summary, our studies have identified and characterized the SUMO-binding activity of the MYM-type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> in ZNF 261 and ZNF 198...|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{the number}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> {{increases}} the specificity by increasing {{the number of}} base pairs that the ZFN can bind to. However too many <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> can lead to off-target binding and thus offsite cleavage. This is due to an increased likelihood of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> binding to parts of the genome outside of the gene of interest.|$|R
25|$|Osteoblasts are {{cells that}} group {{together}} to form units, called osteons, to produce bone. Runx2 (which may also be known as Cbfa1), and Osx (a <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> containing transcription factor) are necessary for osteochondroprogenitor cells to differentiate into the osteoblast cell lineage. These factors also {{have a role in}} hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation.|$|E
25|$|The above {{experimental}} expression {{data shows}} many possible findings for CCDC142. Overexpression of SNAI1, a <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> protein, is correlated to {{the reduction of}} CCDC142 expression in Homo sapiens. A Mus musculus knockout of MEKK 2/3, which help regulate helper T cell differentiation, also showed lowered expression of CCDC142. Another Mus musculus experiment focusing on cardiomyopathy in mice showed lower levels of CCDC142 in mice with damaged myocardial cells.|$|E
25|$|Many {{transcription}} factors {{contain a}} structure {{known as a}} <b>zinc</b> <b>finger,</b> this is a structural module where a region of protein folds around a zinc ion. The zinc does not directly contact the DNA that these proteins bind to. Instead, the cofactor {{is essential for the}} stability of the tightly-folded protein chain. In these proteins, the zinc ion is usually coordinated by pairs of cysteine and histidine side-chains.|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} alpha-fetoprotein and <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Materials and Methods. The expressions of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2, nuclear factor-YA, and alpha-fetoprotein mRNA in 63 hepatocellular carcinoma were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and compared with the clinical parameters of the patients. Selectively, silence of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 in HepG 2 cells was detected by RNA interference technique. Results. Alpha-fetoprotein mRNA expression was detected in 60. 3 % of hepatocellular carcinoma cases. <b>Zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 mRNA expression (36. 5 %) was significantly negatively correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration and mRNA expression. A strong positive correlation was found between <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 and nuclear factor-YA mRNA expression (42. 9 %), while the latter was negatively correlated with serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration and mRNA expression. Treatment with <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 small interfering RNA led to 85 % and 83 % silence of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 mRNA and protein expression and 60 % and 61 % reduction of nuclear factor-YA mRNA and protein levels in the HepG 2 cells, respectively. Downregulation of <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 also induced a 2. 4 -fold increase in both alpha-fetoprotein mRNA and protein levels. Conclusions. <b>Zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes 2 can regulate alpha-fetoprotein expression via the interaction with nuclear factor-YA in human hepatocellular carcinoma and {{may be used as}} an adjuvant diagnostic marker for alpha-fetoprotein-negative hepatocellular carcinoma...|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes gene family are nuclear homodimeric {{transcriptional}} repressors that interact with the A subunit of nuclear factor-Y (NF-YA) and contain two C2H2-type <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and five homeobox DNA-binding domains. This gene encodes member 2 of this gene family. In addition to forming homodimers, this protein heterodimerizes with member 1 of the <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and homeoboxes family.|$|R
50|$|The main {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} KLF family {{is the presence of}} three highly conserved Cysteine2/Histidine2 <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> of either 21 or 23 amino acid residues in length, located at the C-terminus of the protein. These amino acid sequences each chelate a single zinc ion, coordinated between the two cysteine and two histidine residues. These <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> are joined by a conserved seven-amino acid sequence; TGEKP(Y/F)X. The <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> enable all KLF proteins to bind to CACCC gene promoters, so although they may complete varied functions (due to lack of homology away from the <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers),</b> they all recognize similar binding domains.|$|R
25|$|The C1 domain - {{immediately}} downstream of the Ras binding domain - is {{a special}} <b>zinc</b> <b>finger,</b> rich in cysteines and stabilized by two zinc ions. It {{is similar to the}} diacylglycerol-binding C1 domains of protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. But unlike PKC, the C1 domains of Raf family kinases do not bind diacylglycerol. Instead, they interact with other lipids, such as ceramide or phosphatidic acid, and even aid in the recognition of activated Ras (GTP-Ras).|$|E
25|$|Generally, efforts {{focused on}} {{administering}} {{a gene that}} causes a needed protein to be expressed. More recently, increased understanding of nuclease function has led to more direct DNA editing, using techniques such as <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> nucleases and CRISPR. The vector incorporates genes into chromosomes. The expressed nucleases then knock out and replace genes in the chromosome. As of 2014 these approaches involve removing cells from patients, editing a chromosome and returning the transformed cells to patients.|$|E
25|$|Most {{attempts}} at genetic repair have traditionally involved {{the use of}} a retrovirus to insert a new gene into a random position on a chromosome. But by attaching zinc fingers (which determine where transcription factors bind) to endonucleases (which break DNA strands), homologous recombination can be induced to correct and replace defective (or undesired) DNA sequences. The first applications of this technology are to isolate stem cells from the bone marrow of patients having blood disease mutations, to correct those mutations in laboratory dishes using <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> endonucleases and to transplant the stem cells back into the patients.|$|E
40|$|Hantaviruses are {{distributed}} worldwide {{and can cause}} a hemorrhagic fever or a cardiopulmonary syndrome in humans. Mature virions consist of RNA genome, nucleocapsid protein, RNA polymerase, and two transmembrane glycoproteins, G 1 and G 2. The ectodomain of G 1 is surface-exposed; however, it has a 142 -residue C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that plays important roles in viral assembly and host-pathogen interaction. Here we show by NMR, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and mutagenesis that a highly conserved cysteine/histidine-rich region in the G 1 tail of hantaviruses forms two CCHC-type classical <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers.</b> Unlike classical <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers,</b> however, the two G 1 <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> are intimately joined together, forming a compact domain with a unique fold. We discuss the implication of the hantaviral G 1 <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> in viral assembly and host-pathogen interaction...|$|R
40|$|The Drosophila CF 2 II protein, which {{contains}} <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> of the Cys 2 His 2 type and recognizes an A+T-rich sequence, behaves in cell culture as an activator of a reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. This activity depends on C-terminal but not N-terminal <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers,</b> as does in vitro DNA binding. By site-specific mutagenesis and binding site selection, we define the critical amino acid-base interactions. Mutations of single amino acid residues at {{the leading edge}} of the recognition helix are rarely neutral: many result in a slight change in affinity for the ideal DNA target site; some cause major loss of affinity; and others change specificity for as many as two bases in the target site. Compared to <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> that recognize G+C-rich DNA, CF 2 II fingers appear to bind to A+T-rich DNA in a generally similar manner, but with additional flexibility and amino acid-base interactions. The results illustrate how <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> may be evolving to recognize an unusually diverse set of DNA sequences...|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses {{replicate}} by converting {{their positive}} sense genomic RNA into double-stranded DNA that is subsequently {{integrated into the}} host genome. This conversion is catalyzed by reverse transcriptase (RT) early after virus entry into the target cell and is chaperoned by the nucleocapsid protein (NC). In HIV- 1, NC is composed of small basic domains flanking two highly conserved CCHC <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> that specifically interact with the genomic RNA and RT. Through specific interactions with the genomic RNA and RT, and possibly with cellular factors, the NC <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> were found to play critical roles in HIV- 1 assembly and budding, and later in proviral DNA synthesis and integration. Therefore, intact NC <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> are needed throughout the virus replication cycle. Here, we report {{for the first time}} that deleting either one or the two NC <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> leads to an unexpected premature viral DNA synthesis in virus producer cells and the production of noninfectious particles with a high level of viral DNA. In addition to providing the first example of reverse transcription during the late steps of HIV- 1 replication, these findings emphasize the fact that the NC <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> are a major target for new drugs against HIV- 1. ...|$|R
25|$|Transcription activator-like {{effector}} nucleases (TALEN) are restriction {{enzymes that}} can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a TAL effector DNA-binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain (a nuclease which cuts DNA strands). Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be engineered to bind to practically any desired DNA sequence, so when combined with a nuclease, DNA can be cut at specific locations. The restriction enzymes can be introduced into cells, for use in gene editing or for genome editing in situ, a technique known as genome editing with engineered nucleases. Alongside <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN is a prominent tool {{in the field of}} genome editing.|$|E
25|$|The simple {{relationship}} between {{amino acid sequence}} and DNA recognition of the TALE binding domain allows for the efficient engineering of proteins. In this case, artificial gene synthesis is problematic because of improper annealing of the repetitive sequence found in the TALE binding domain. One solution to this {{is to use a}} publicly available software program (DNAWorks) to calculate oligonucleotides suitable for assembly in a two step PCR oligonucleotide assembly followed by whole gene amplification. A number of modular assembly schemes for generating engineered TALE constructs have also been reported. Both methods offer a systematic approach to engineering DNA binding domains that is conceptually similar to the modular assembly method for generating <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> DNA recognition domains.|$|E
25|$|Prior to delamination, {{presumptive}} {{neural crest}} cells are initially anchored to neighboring cells by tight junction proteins such as occludin and cell adhesion molecules such as NCAM and N-Cadherin. Dorsally expressed BMPs initiate delamination by inducing {{the expression of}} the <b>zinc</b> <b>finger</b> protein transcription factors snail, slug, and twist. These factors play a direct role in inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing expression of occludin and N-Cadherin in addition to promoting modification of NCAMs with polysialic acid residues to decrease adhesiveness. Neural crest cells also begin expressing proteases capable of degrading cadherins such as ADAM10 and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade the overlying basal lamina of the neural tube to allow neural crest cells to escape. Additionally, neural crest cells begin expressing integrins that associate with extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin, during migration. Once the basal lamina becomes permeable the neural crest cells can begin migrating throughout the embryo.|$|E

The binding of TFIIIA to 5 S RNA and 5 S DNA was studied by using a protease footprinting technique. Brief treatment of free or bound TFIIA with trypsin or chymotrypsin generated fragments which were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fragments retaining the N terminus of TFIIA were identified by immunoblotting with an antibody directed against the N terminus of TFIIIA. Proteolytic footprinting of TFIIIA complexed with 5 S DNA derivatives reinforced other evidence that the three N-terminal <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> of TFIIIA bind most tightly to 5 S DNA. Proteolytic footprinting of TFIIIA in reconstituted 7 S ribonucleoprotein particles revealed different patterns of trypsin sensitivity for TFIIIA bound to oocyte versus somatic 5 S RNA.

40|$|Reverse {{transcription}} of the genomic RNA by {{reverse transcriptase}} occurs soon after HIV- 1 infection of target cells.

Results showed that the two intact zinc-finger structures are required for the temporal control of reverse transcription by NC throughout the virus replication cycle. The N-terminal basic residues also contributed to this new role of NC, while Pro- 31 residue between the <b>zinc</b> <b>fingers</b> and Lys- 59 in the C-terminal region did not.
