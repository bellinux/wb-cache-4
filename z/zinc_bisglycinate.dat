40|$|Zinc supplementation in {{children}} in endemic area of zinc deficiency {{had been reported}} of growth enhancement; however, the results were inconsistence. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of zinc supplementation on growth of school-aged children. A randomized double-blinded controlled trial was conducted in 140 Thai school children. Placebo or <b>zinc</b> <b>bisglycinate</b> (15 mg element zinc) were taken on school day for 6 months. Pre- and posttreatment anthropometric parameters were recorded. Changes in height from the baseline was considered as the primary outcome whereas, changes in other anthropometric parameters were considered as the secondary outcomes. The mean age was 8. 9 years; baseline anthropometric data were not significant different between groups. At the end of study, children in zinc group had significantly higher gain in height (5. 6 ± 2. 4 vs 4. 7 ± 1. 4 cm, respectively; P= 0. 009) and height Z-score (0. 45 ± 0. 37 vs 0. 37 ± 0. 27, respectively; P= 0. 048) than children in control group. No significant differences of other anthropometric parameters were observed. In conclusion, zinc supplementation increased linear growth in Thai schoolaged children over a 6 -month period but it had no effects on other anthropometric parameters...|$|E
40|$|An FDA-regulated, {{prescription}} {{medical food}} (Fosteum; 27 [*]mg natural genistein, 200 [*]IU cholecalciferol, 20 [*]mg citrated <b>zinc</b> <b>bisglycinate</b> (4 [*]mg elemental zinc) per capsule) and an over-the-counter (OTC) supplement (Citracal Plus Bone Density Builder; 27 [*]mg synthetic genistein, 600 [*]mg elemental calcium (calcium citrate), 400 [*]IU vitamin D 3, 50 [*]mg magnesium, 7. 5 [*]mg zinc, 1 [*]mg copper, 75 [*]μg molybdenum, 250 [*]μg boron per two tablets) {{were compared to}} a clinically proven bone formulation (27 [*]mg natural genistein, 400 [*]IU cholecalciferol, 500 [*]mg elemental calcium (calcium carbonate) per tablet; the Squadrito formulation) in an 8 -day steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) study of healthy postmenopausal women (n= 30) randomized to receive 54 [*]mg of genistein per day. Trough serum samples were obtained before the final dose {{on the morning of}} the ninth day followed by sampling at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 [*]hrs. Total serum genistein, after β-glucuronidase/sulfatase digestion, was measured by time-resolved fluorometric assay. Maximal time (Tmax), concentration (Cmax), half-life (T 1 / 2), and area under the curve (AUC) were determined for genistein in each formulation. Fosteum and the Squadrito study formulation were equivalent for genistein Tmax (2 [*]hrs), Cmax (0. 7 [*]μM), T 1 / 2 (18 ± 6. 9 [*]versus[*] 21 ± 4. 9 [*]hrs), and AUC (9221 ± 413 [*]versus[*] 9818 ± 1370 [*]ng·hr/mL). The OTC supplement’s synthetically derived genistein, however, showed altered Tmax (6 [*]hrs), Cmax (0. 57 [*]μM), T 1 / 2 (8. 3 ± 1. 9 [*]hrs), and AUC (6474 ± 287 [*]ng·hr/mL). Differences in uptake may be due to multiple ingredients in the OTC supplement which interfere with genistein absorption...|$|E
