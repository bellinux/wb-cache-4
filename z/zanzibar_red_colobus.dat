2500|$|Ngezi Forest Reserve covers {{an area of}} [...] {{and is in the}} {{north-western}} tip of Pemba Island. It {{was declared}} a reserve in 1950 after most of the area had been denuded for cultivation of cloves. It still has high closed forests known as Ngezi forest extending right up to the beach at Vumawimbi. The forest types reported consist of coral bushes and thickets, thick grasses and bushes in the sandy-loam soils and Mtifutifu soils; dominant plant species are: Odyendea zimmermanni (Mjoho), riverine forest of Barringtonia racemosa (Mtomondo), Milicia spp (Mvule), Alexandrian laurel (Mtondoo), Erythropholem spp (Mwavi), Antiarus spp (Mgulele), Chrisalidocarpus pembanus (Mpapindi) and Terminalia catapa (Mkungu), and mangrove forests. Avifauna recorded consists of 27 bird species in the forests, out of which the endemic species are hadada, the African goshawk, the palm-nut vulture, scops owl, the malachite kingfisher and the Pemba white-eye. Other faunal species consist of Pemba flying fox (large fruit-eating bat), the Pemba vervet monkey, the <b>Zanzibar</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkey, hyrax, Pemba blue duiker (an antelope {{about the size of a}} hare), feral pigs (introduced by the Portuguese), the Javan civet cat (introduced by southeast Asian traders for the production of musk) and marsh mongoose (an endemic carnivore).|$|E

However, {{with help from the}} Government of Australia and CARE Tanzania, Government of Zanzibar established the Jozani Chwaka Bay Conservation Project, in 1995. Zanzibar’s first national park’s maintenance is partly met from the revenue generated from entry fee charged on visitors to the park. This fee is also shared with the Jozani Conservation Society used to construct and operate schools and health clinics for local villages. The park has created many trails through the forest to watch birds and also an elevated board-walk to see the mangrove forest.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In this 3 -year {{investigation}} we documented {{patterns of}} density, diet, and activity of <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys (Procolobus tephrosceles) in six areas {{in or near}} Kibale National Park, Uganda and related these patterns to availability of food resources. There were large differences in the density and behavior of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> among the sites. For example, the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> at one site with a diverse plant community of more than 61 tree species, had a diet that included at least 42 species. In contrast, at a second site <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent 92 % of their feeding time eating from one species that dominated the tree community. The density of important <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> food trees varied among sites from 32 trees/ha to 204 trees/ha, and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density ranged from 0. 70 groups/km 2 to 7. 41 groups/km 2. Among sites, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> density {{was related to the}} cumulative DBH of important food trees, when one apparently anom-alous site was excluded, and populations with more plant species in their diets tended to be those that were found at higher densities. Activity budgets of the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> populations varied markedly among sites. For example, feeding time ranged among sites from 29 to 55 %, and traveling varied from 5 to 20 %. When faced with increased foraging demands, <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> reduced the time spent resting, while the time spent socializing remained fairly constant. Comparative socioecological studies typically contrast species epa-rated by large geographical distances to ensure there is sufficient variation in the environment to detect behavioral responses. The marked ifferences in ecological conditions and <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> behavior we docu-mented over short geographical distances, uggests that small-scale contrasts are a useful tool to examine ecological determinants of behavior and community structure...|$|R

5000|$|The red colobus {{species have}} a smaller larynx {{compared}} to {{other members of the}} Colobinae subfamily. The male's call is more of an alto or soprano in contrast to the low bass of a male's in black-and-white colobus species.

50|$|Pennant's colobus {{was first}} {{described}} in 1838 by George Robert Waterhouse, {{curator at the}} Zoological Society of London's museum, and was named in honour of the naturalist and traveller Thomas Pennant.Three subspecies of this <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> are traditionally recognized: The Bioko <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii pennantii), the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii epieni) and Bouvier's <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus pennantii bouvieri). However, Groves (2007) raised P. p. epieni, and P. p. bouvieri to Piliocolobus epieni and Piliocolobus bouvieri, respectively (this nomenclature has been followed here).

5000|$|From {{the time}} it first became known to science (in 1993) until 2007 or 2008, it was {{considered}} a subspecies of the western <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus badius) and more recently Pennant's colobus (Procolobus pennantii), and its trinomial name was Procolobus badius epieni or Procolobus pennantii epieni. Colin Groves recognized the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> as a full species in 2007, although Groves considered all the <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys, including the Niger Delta <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> {{to be in the}} genus Piliocolobus, rather than Procolobus (this nomenclature has been followed here).

50|$|It is {{not certain}} why the Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> forms these {{associations}} with other species but protection from predators is the most accepted reason. The Ugandan <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is less vigilant, looking out for predators less often, when associated with the red-tailed monkey.

40|$|Primate {{gastrointestinal}} microbial {{communities are}} becoming increasingly appreciated for their relevance to comparative medicine and conservation, but the factors that structure primate “microbiomes ” remain controversial. This study examined a community of primates in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to assess {{the relative importance of}} host species and location in structuring gastrointestinal microbiomes. Fecal samples were collected from primates in intact forest and from primates in highly disturbed forest fragments. People and livestock living nearby were also included, as was a geographically distant population of related <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> in Kenya. A culture‐free microbial community fingerprinting technique was used to analyze fecal microbiomes from 124 individual <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> (Procolobus rufomitratus), 100 individual black‐and‐white colobus (Colobus guereza), 111 individual red‐tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius), 578 human volunteers, and 364 domestic animals, including cattle (Bos indicus and B. indicusB. taurus crosses), goats (Caprus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and pigs (Sus scrofa).

50|$|Another {{remarkable}} behavior {{occurs when}} <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys reach their restless and somewhat nomadic adolescence. This period {{is when the}} young monkeys leave their natal troops and look for another troop to join. This is not easy, as most troops are very suspicious and can get deadly when new monkeys try to join. The <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> monkeys have adapted their behavior by joining troops of green monkeys that are near the potential <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> troops that they wish to join, and living amongst {{them in order to}} spy on their potential new families. In one notable case, an adolescent male <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> spent two years with a green monkey troop in order to spy in safety on a prospective troop in this manner.|$|R
5000|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{is potentially}} confusing. Procolobus foai has, together {{with all other}} red colobuses, been considered a subspecies of Procolobus badius.

50|$|Because the <b>Zanzibar</b> <b>red</b> <b>colobus</b> is {{extremely}} social, {{it has a}} specific call for when it is alone for {{a certain amount of}} time upon which it feels vulnerable or threatened.
