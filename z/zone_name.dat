40|$|Add Time Zone Column to Sites Table Currently, {{the sites}} table has a local_time column {{that is just}} an offset. It is not often used (only 80 out of 5905 sites {{currently}} use it), has integer datatype (so that it can't accommodate half-hour or quarter-hour offsets), and gives no information about local daylight savings time rules. This release replaces the local_time column with the full IANA-compliant time <b>zone</b> <b>name.</b> These names are "daylight-savings-time-agnositic" so that given this name and any UTC date and time, PostgreSQL can correctly compute the corresponding local time at the given site. Motivation Historically, when trait information has been collected and entered into the BETYdb database, it has been unclear what time zone was used to represent the time (in particular, whether local time or UTC time was used). The BETYdb Web interface to the traits table is currently being redesigned to display and allow entry of date and time information in a human-friendly way that automatically takes the dateloc, timeloc, and site time zone into account. Adding complete time zone information to the sites table {{is the first step}} in this process. Visible changes For now, the only change visible to users of the BETYdb web application will be on the sites "show" pages: Instead of displaying the (numerical) "Local Time" field, these pages will instead display the time <b>zone</b> <b>name.</b> Note that sites that span multiple time zones will have NULL in the time_zone column, and the time zone field on the "show" page will be blank for these sites. Steps Needed for Upgrade Database Changes Administrators need to do database migrations! After Git-updating your BETYdb working copy, simply run the one migration included in this release, which removes the (integral) local_time column from the sites table and replaces it with the (textual) time_zone column. The new column will be populated on the EBI site; sync with that site to populate the column on your own site. If you add sites of your own to your own database, you will have to set the time zone manually; the BETYdb web interface does not support editing site time zones. The time <b>zone</b> <b>name</b> should match one of the names returned by the query SELECT name FROM pg_timezone_names, but this is not enforced. To see a list of IANA time zone names, visit [URL] You may also see a list in PostgreSQL by running the query SELECT * FROM pg_timezone_names. (The name column is what you are interested in; the other three columns will change in value with the time of year. In particular, the time zone abbreviations shown in the abbrev column are not daylight-savings-time agnostic.) If you are adding a large number of sites, you may want to (at least temporarily) add a time zone database table which will allow you to populate the time_zone column using an SQL UPDATE statement that derives the time zone from the site geometry column. See the comment [URL] for more information. The database version for this release is 20160523165531.
