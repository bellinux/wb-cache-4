40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} the coercive and legitimate forms {{of power in}} Ukraine. It describes the crisis of legitimacy in Ukraine as a contradiction between a blatantly cruel system of capitalism dominated by a few oligarchs, and the lingering remnants of a Soviet mentality. Two strategies are used by the Government to stoke the crisis. First, increased identification with ethnic or regional groups are instrumentally used by the Government to take attention from economic and class issues. Second, the incorporation of a Soviet meaning of power into the new national identity and presentation of it as core norms, believes, {{and values of the}} people of Ukraine competes with alternative Ukrainian identity concepts. The paper analyzes five main features of the Soviet meanings of power – political, social, and economic paternalism, perception of power as source of profit and violence, and the dual reality of power with the gap between official narratives of power and a real life. The process of incorporation of the Soviet concept of power into national identity is facilitated by the process of national identity formation that helped to preserve the Soviet perception of power, because of the absence of a new ideology, a lack of critical assessment of the Soviet past, an absence of the vision of outcome, an embryonic culture of democracy, and contributions of all the presidents to the preservation of the Soviet meaning of power. People justify the system as legitimate and fair for many reasons: out of historic habit and deemed moral obligations, self-interests and/or a fear of sanctions, identification with the ruler, <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference,</b> an absence <b>of</b> will and self-confidence, desire to support a strong leader based on ambiguity intolerance, hierarchy – enhancing ideologies, and a general tolerance of injustice. The obedience of subjects is connected with the strength of will of the subjects and the social structures of the society. In Ukraine, the society is not united, not organized, has no identity of “us”, no civic accountability, nor even any real interest in such matters. Civil society levels are very low, as reflected by limited opportunities for civic responsibility and participation and few demands from the society...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a general philosophical matheme {{of an investigation}} of ‘law and literature. ’ It claims {{that the experience of}} literature is an encounter that outlives the reader and the normative demand for an understanding.

This event is neither biographical nor a ‘mere’ linguistic event, but rather a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference</b> where both experience their reciprocal desubjectivization. Law destines human life to transmit a holy transcendental patrimony that wishes to dictate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{construct}} and test a theoretical subjective authority continuum model for institutions of higher education. The model designed consisted of two major parts:(1) a model for the classification of subordinates according to one of 16 subordinate types and (2) a subjective authority continuum presented as a horizontal line along which three interrelated zones expand and contract. The three zones on the subjective authority continuum are: (1) <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference,</b> (2) zone of analysis, and (3) zone of rejection. The <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference</b> is characterized as when subordinates carry out administrative requirements without resistance, or thought. The zone of analysis means the subordinate will analyze administrative requirements before complying or not complying. The zone of rejection means the subordinate will not willingly comply with an administrative requirement. Testing of the model was accomplished through the use ofquestionnaire type instrument. Thirty nine potential respondents were sent packets. Each packet included a test instrument. Twenty one of the selectees responded by returning the test instruments. The respondents were selected according to predetermined criteria. No individual identification of respondents was sought or received. The analysis of the responses was accomplished as follows:(1) The respondent was identified according to subordinate type. Subordinate type was determined by specific responses to four questions in part one of the test instrument. The four questions were relevant to three conditions: (a) superior-subordinate relationships, (b) personal professional values, and (c) attitudinal uniformity. There were three levels of combinations which resulted in 16 possible subordinate types. A respondent was identified as one subordinate type only. (2) Four specific situations were then given to respondents. That is, the four questions in part two of the instrument were designed to relate to four situations involving conflict, or a lack of conflict, of the three conditions determined as representative of subjective authority. That is, superior-subordinate relationships, personal professional values, and attitudinal uniformity. (3) Three responses were given for selection and a comments section was provided. The three given responses related directly to the three zones along the subjective authority continuum. The three responses and corrollary zones were:(1) I would ordinarily comply [...] representative of <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference.</b> (2) I would ordinarily take under advisement-representative of the zone of analysis. (3) I would ordinarily reject [...] representative of the zone of rejection. Analysis of the data supported the notion that subordinates can be identified according to type, and that subjective authority does exist within the academic department of the institution of higher education where the study was conducted. Further, operating professionals are sensitive to the three conditions given as necessary for subjective authority to exist. The majority o the respondents indicated a strong preference for superiors to demonstrate a high consideration for subordinates, while preferences for task involvement by superiors in tasks performed by subordinates was mixed. A majority of the respondents also indicated strong influence from personal professional values while all of the respondents which were identified by type, indicated strong influence from colleague attitudinal uniformity. The model is not intended to be a panacea. Other models, theories, and concepts should be considered when using the subjective authority continuum mode. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} we outline two {{possible}} theoretical interpretations for the inconsistency often observed between fertility intentions and fertility behaviour. We draw on socio-psychological models of human behaviour which emphasise {{the role of}} normative-affective factors on decision-making processes. The first interpretation {{is based on the}} observation that family and fertility choices are gradually shifting from a zone where behaviour is normative regulated to a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> normative <b>indifference,</b> where mere rational decision-making based on cost-benefit considerations is at work. The dissonance between fertility choices and declared intentions depends {{on the fact that the}} former are based on rational considerations, while the latter are still constrained by a normative familistic philosophy. The second interpretation assumes the existence of an interposing mechanism in the sequence expectations-behaviour. These mechanisms, as anxiety and avoidance dispositions, filter the passage from individual value orientations in the affective sphere to their actual behaviour. We base our argument on two sets of information. First, we use a survey which allows us to construct empirical indicators of psychological dispositions connected to expectations related to family and fertility behaviours (Abacus 1996, Italy). Second, we analyse 54 non-structured interviews conducted in Northern Italy, which give a detailed picture of the hypothesised mechanisms and suggest new directions for research. ...|$|R

It has been proved that, contrary to management based on power and pressure, modern technologies of influence management are based on application of technologies of compatibility interaction, which constitute a basis of cooperation.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{focus on}} Management Buy-Outs (MBOs) has been upon concluding deals. However, {{substantial numbers of}} MBOs fail to exit and this paper suggests that the time is ripe for attention to be redirected towards post-deal evolution. Three phases in the MBO post-deal process are identified. These are depicted as The Spirit of Optimism, The <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indifference</b> and The Spiral of Mistrust, reflecting, respectively, the moment of contractual agreement, subsequent stagnation and downward slide in performance. As the MBO evolves through these phases of decline, this study focuses upon the interactions of three main parties: The Management Team, The Venture Capitalists and The Investment Bankers. The key objective is to capture the difficulties accruing to these parties as the MBO declines. The failures of the three main parties lie in identities, increasing problems of interaction and lack of communication. By linking micro, meso and macro levels of analysis a novel {{way of looking at}} MBOs is suggested which helps to avoid the trap of focusing only upon the moment the deal is done...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{environmental}} heat stress can be evaluated using a physiological strain index (PSI) that incorporates rectal temperature (T­re) {{and heart rate}} (HR) of a subject during exercise. Athletes interested in the performance benefits of heat acclimation often over-dress during exercise in temperate environments {{in an attempt to}} simulate heat stress, but it is unknown whether this creates a similar level of physiological strain as exercise in the heat. PURPOSE: To compare the PSI of athletes exercising in a HOT (40 C; 30 % RH) environment and with excess clothing in a COOL (15 C; 50 % RH) environment. METHODS: Eight endurance trained athletes were studied (5 M, 3 F; Aged 23 ± 7 years; VO 2 max 59. 8 ± 10. 2 ml/kg/min) during one hour of running at 50 % of their VO 2 max in HOT and COOL environments. In the HOT trial, the clothing was minimal (singlet and shorts). In the COOL trial, multiple insulative and vapor-impermeable layers were worn to impose similar themoregulatory strain as the HOT trial. Tre and HR were recorded at 5 minute intervals and used to calculate PSI = 5 (Tre t− Tre 0) ⋅ (39. 5 − Tre 0) − 1 + 5 (HRt − HR 0) ⋅ (180 − HR 0) − 1. Mean PSI was compared using paired sample t-tests, and PSI values were additionally compared between trials using an a priori <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference</b> of ± 1. RESULTS: PSI rose over time in both environments (HOT: 2. 95 to 8. 71; COOL: 2. 80 to 7. 25) Mean PSI was higher in HOT compared with COOL (6. 00 ± 0. 95 vs 5. 16 ± 1. 10; p=. 042). When comparing mean PSI between HOT and COOL, 5 of 8 subjects tested were within the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>indifference.</b> The 3 subjects that were outside of the zone had the highest initial HR of all the subjects tested. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data suggest that overdressing during a bout of exercise in a temperate environment results in significant increases in PSI, but that the ensemble used did not fully match the HOT condition. By adequately overdressing, athletes may be able to mimic heat stress and potentially obtain the benefits of heat acclimation in a cooler environment...|$|E

Hot spot analysis has been applied in this study to find out where the poor people are clustered by using <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indifference</b> method and distance band of 21000 meters. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was used to examine the type of relationship Standardized Poverty Rate (SPR) have with three explanatory variables of percentage of Non Primary Agricultural Area (NPAA) in each mukim, Road Density of each mukim, and Distance between mukim centroids and district capital city. All of the analyses were done by using ArcGIS 10. 0 software. The research found out that there are hot spots of poor people located in North East of Peninsular Malaysia in Kelantan and Terengganu states. There were positive and negative correlations between different variables and SPR and the type and quality of relationship is changing throughout the whole Peninsular Malaysia. The negative values in GWR maps show negative correlations and the higher negative value there is the stronger negative correlation is there.

40|$|In {{developing}} their equilibrium theories over the decade 1871 - 1881, Jevons (1871), Walras (1874 - 7), and Edgeworth (1881) {{made use of}} some version of a Law, called Law <b>of</b> <b>Indifference</b> by Jevons and Edgeworth and {{often referred to as}} the Law of One Price in connection with Walrasian economics. In Jevons’s theory of exchange, the Law <b>of</b> <b>Indifference</b> is a quasi-tautology playing a fundamental role in both the derivation of the equilibrium conditions and the characterisation of Jevons’s equilibrium concept. In Walras’s pure-exchange model, the Law of One Price, assumed as a postulate and lacking any proper theoretical underpinnings, is no longer confined to equilibrium analysis, as in Jevons, but is so conceived as to embrace Walras’s equilibration analysis, namely, the celebrated tâtonnement construct, too. Finally, in Edgeworth’s theory of exchange, the Law <b>of</b> <b>Indifference,</b> once again restricted to equilibrium analysis only, is made to emerge as a limiting result, produced by the joint operation of Edgeworth’s replication and recontracting mechanisms and associated with the unbounded increase in the size of the economy. One century after Edgeworth’s achievements, Negishi (1982) resumed Jevons’s and Edgeworth’s interpretation of the Law <b>of</b> <b>Indifference</b> as an equilibrium property; yet, parting company with Edgeworth, he tried to prove that the arbitrage mechanism underlying the Law is at work and fully effective even in very small finite economies. The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to reconstruct the various uses of the Law <b>of</b> <b>Indifference</b> and its variants in the diverse theoretical traditions originated by Jevons, Walras, and Edgeworth; secondly, to critically discuss Negishi’s attempt to revive Jevons’s Law <b>of</b> <b>Indifference</b> as a fully micro-founded and extremely powerful equilibrium property of finite competitive economies where arbitraging activities are allowed for.
