25|$|Sauternes are {{characterized}} by the balance of sweetness with the <b>zest</b> <b>of</b> acidity. Some common flavor notes include apricots, honey, peaches but with a nutty note, which is a typical characteristic of noble semillon itself (cf. Australian noble (late-harvest) semillon). The finish can resonate on the palate for several minutes. Sauternes are some of longest-lived wines, with premium examples from exceptional vintages properly kept having the potential to age well even beyond 100 years. Sauternes typically starts out with a golden, yellow color that becomes progressively darker as it ages. Some wine experts, like Ed McCarthy and Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, believe that only once the wine reaches the color of an old copper coin has it started to develop its more complex and mature flavors.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the change <b>of</b> <b>zest</b> for living <b>of</b> early {{adolescents}} who participated in outdoor schools. The effects of school programs were examined. The four types of outdoor schools were the KAMOGAWA Aquarium School which had 28 subjects, the OKINAWA Sea School which had 21 subjects, the HOKKAIDO Nature School which had 18 subjects, and the SHIGAKOGEN Ski School which had 115 subjects. The zest for living inventory by Tachibana (2001) was administered in pre- (before activities) and post- (after activities) design for early adolescents. The zest for living inventory was constituted by 14 sub-scales that have 5 items, and 3 ability-scales were measured by the 14 sub-scales. The major findings were as follows. 1) 7 items of psychological and social ability and 1 item of moral ability <b>of</b> <b>zest</b> for living <b>of</b> early adolescents who participated in KAMOGAWA Aquarium School showed significant change between pre- and post- test. 2) 2 items of psychological and social ability <b>of</b> <b>zest</b> for living <b>of</b> early adolescents who participated in OKINAWA Sea School showed significant change between pre- and post- test. 3) 1 item of psychological and social ability, 4 items of moral ability and 2 items of physical ability <b>of</b> <b>zest</b> for living <b>of</b> early adolescents who participated in HOKKAIDO Nature School showed significant change between pre- and post- test. 4) 7 items of psychological and social ability, 8 items of moral ability and 5 items of physical ability <b>of</b> <b>zest</b> for living <b>of</b> the sixth grade schoolchildren who participated in SHIGAKOGEN Ski School showed significant change between pre- and post-test. 5) The SHIGAKOGEN Ski School showed the biggest change <b>of</b> <b>zest</b> for living <b>of</b> participants than other schools. The result suggested that the outdoor schools effected the change <b>of</b> <b>zest</b> for living <b>of</b> early adolescents, and each school had distinctive effects...|$|R

500|$|Schuster {{retired in}} 1944, and on 22 June {{of that year}} he was raised to the peerage as Baron Schuster, of Cerne in the County of Dorset. By the time he retired Schuster had served as Permanent Secretary for 29 years under 10 Lord Chancellors, records {{that have not yet}} been broken. He also served as High Sheriff of Dorset in 1941. In {{retirement}} he undertook work for the Allied Commission for Austria and [...] "tackled the unexpected with the <b>zest</b> <b>of</b> a young man" [...] despite being 75. He returned to Britain in 1946. He served as Treasurer of the Inner Temple in 1947, and in 1948 and 1949 took his seat in the House of Lords to voice his opinions on legislation, something he had previously been unable to do publicly due to the tradition of Civil Service neutrality. He participated in debates over the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and Criminal Justice Act 1949, and was noted for being polite to the point of obsequiousness. He gave the Romanes Lecture in 1949 on the subject of [...] "Mountaineering" [...] and continued to play an active part in public life, helping reconstruct the Inner Temple after it was bombed in the Second World War. On 27 June 1956 he fell ill at an old Wykehamist dinner and was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where he died the next morning.|$|E
500|$|Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic viewed that track, {{along with}} [...] "All of the Lights" [...] and [...] "Power" [...] have [...] "a certain <b>zest</b> <b>of</b> life" [...] to them, adding {{that all three}} tracks were [...] "beautiful". He also commented that [...] "it is great to see that Kanye is still able to have plenty of fun without losing any of his creativity." [...] Dan Vidal of URB commented [...] "sonically, the joy comes from the triumphant, {{painstaking}} arrangement that undoubtedly went into the production". The Washington Posts Chris Richards mused that [...] "the drums come avalanching on Lost in the World", calling it [...] "the grand finale this album deserves." [...] He continued that [...] "West serves up high drama at a breakneck tempo, with pining melodies crying out for a redemptive moment. But there's no final act of contrition. West is too 'lost in this plastic life.'" [...] Cole Mathew of Slant Magazine described the track as [...] "Kanye's much-anticipated reworking of Bon Iver's [...] "Woods" [...] from his classic EP", and wrote that [...] "it's astounding how he takes the strangest sample on the album and crafts it into a defiantly giddy dance number, complete with tribal drumming in the verses and group choruses that sound massive. It's a mad stroke of brilliance to take Justin Vernon's solitary ode to alienation {{and use it as}} the centerpiece of a catchy, communal reverie. It's experimental, to be sure, but it's also the closest the album comes to pure pop indulgence." [...] The song peaked on the South Korea Gaon Chart at position 104.|$|E
500|$|Of the reviewers, Time rated it an A-minus and added, [...] "Burton and Depp infuse the {{brilliant}} cold steel of Stephen Sondheim's score with a burning passion. Helena Bonham Carter and a superb supporting cast bring focused fury to this musical nightmare. It's bloody great." [...] Times Richard Corliss named the film {{one of its}} top ten movies of 2007, placing it fifth. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it four stars out of four, lauding Burton's visual style. In his review in Variety, Todd McCarthy called it [...] "both sharp and fleet" [...] and [...] "a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheim's landmark 1979 theatrical musical ... things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by Tim Burton, expert screw-tightening by scenarist John Logan, and haunted and musically adept lead performances from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Assembled artistic combo assures the film will reap {{by far the biggest}} audience to see a pure Sondheim musical, although just how big depends on the upscale crowd’s tolerance for buckets of blood, {{and the degree to which}} the masses stay away due to the whiff of the highbrow." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-plus in its Movie Reviews section and stated, [...] "To stage a proper Sweeney Todd, necks must be slit, human flesh must be squished into pastries, and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death. Enter Tim Burton, who... has tenderly art-directed soup-thick, tomato-red, fake-gore blood with the <b>zest</b> <b>of</b> a Hollywood-funded Jackson Pollock." [...] She went on to refer to the piece as [...] "opulent, attentive... so finely minced a mixture of Sondheim's original melodrama and Burton's signature spicing that it's difficult to think of any other filmmaker so naturally suited for the job." ...|$|E

[...] Susan Stark of The Detroit News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Swift, sweet, irreverent, rangy and as spirited in the writing and voice work as it is splendid in design." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A fat green ogre with a grouchy disposition and worse manners, Shrek {{is the sort of}} unlikely hero that nobody could love -- except just about everyone who sees this hip and hilarious animated delight." [...] Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication." [...] Rene Rodriguez gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "a gleefully fractured fairy tale that never becomes cynical or crass". Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby <b>zest</b> <b>of</b> Shrek." [...] William Steig, the author of the original book, and his wife Jeanne Steig also enjoyed the film, stating [...] "We all went sort of expecting to hate it, thinking, 'What has Hollywood done to it?'

2500|$|During {{the first}} years of her son's reign, Maria often acted as the {{political}} adviser to the Tsar. Uncertain of his own ability and aware of her connections and knowledge, Tsar Nicholas II often told the ministers that he would ask her advice before making decisions, and the ministers sometimes suggested this themselves. It was reportedly on her advice that Nicholas initially kept his father's ministers. Maria herself estimated that her son was of a weak character and that it was better that he was influenced by her than someone worse. Her daughter Olga remarked upon her influence: “she had never before taken the least interest … now she felt it was her duty. Her personality was magnetic and her <b>zest</b> <b>of</b> activity was incredible. She had her finger on every educational pulse in the empire. She would work her secretaries to shreds, but she did not spare herself. Even when bored in committee she never looked bored. Her manner and, above all, her tact conquered everybody”. After the death of her spouse, Maria came to be convinced that Russia needed reforms to avoid a revolution. [...] According to courtier Paul Benckendorff [...] there was a scene when Maria asked her son not to appoint the conservative Wahl as minister for internal affairs: “during which one [...] almost threw herself at his [...] knees' begging him not to make this appointment and to choose someone who could make concessions. She said that if Nicholas did not agree, she would ‘leave for Denmark, and then without me here let the twist your head around’.” [...] p. 205 Nicholas did appoint her favored candidate, and she reportedly told her favoured candidate the liberal reformist Peter Sviatopolk-Mirsky [...] to accept by saying: “You must fulfil my son’s wish; If you do, I will give you a kiss” [...] p.205 After the birth of a son to the tsar the same year, however, Nicholas II replaced his mother as his political confidant and adviser with his wife, Empress Alexandra.|$|E

50|$|In {{yet another}} study that reaffirmed {{the idea that}} <b>zest</b> was one <b>of</b> the VIA {{character}} strengths that had a strong link to life satisfaction, another trend in zest was discovered. This study indicated slight gender differences in levels <b>of</b> <b>zest.</b> For women, life satisfaction was predicted by zest, gratitude, hope, appreciation of beauty and love, whereas men's life satisfaction was predicted by creativity, perspective, fairness and humor. These findings go along with gender stereotypes and suggest that life satisfaction comes when one lives according to the strengths especially valued in one's culture.|$|R
