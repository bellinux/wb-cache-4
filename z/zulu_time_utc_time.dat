5000|$|The Newfoundland Time Zone is a {{geographic}} region that keeps time by subtracting [...] hours from Coordinated Universal <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC)</b> during standard <b>time,</b> resulting in UTC−03:30; or subtracting [...] hours during daylight saving time.

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) Master Control Station (MCS) {{performs}} the Coordinated Universal <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC)</b> <b>time</b> transfer mission by uploading and broadcasting {{predictions of the}} GPS-UTC offset in subframe 4 of the GS navigation message. These predictions are based on only two successive daily data points obtained from the US Naval Observatory (USNO). USNO produces these daily smoothed data points by performing a least-squares fit on roughly 38 hours worth of data from roughly 160 successive 13 -minute tracks of GPS satellites. Though sufficient for helping to maintain a time transfer error specification of 28 ns (1 Sigma), the MCS's prediction algorithm {{does not make the}} best use of the available data from from USNO, and produces data that can degrade quickly over extended prediction spans. This paper investigates how, by applying Kalman filtering to the same available tracking data, the MCS could improve its estimate of GPS-UTC, and in particular, the GPS-UTC A(sub 1) term. By refining the A(sub 1) (frequency) estimate for GPS-UTC predictions, error in GPS time transfer could drop significantly. Additional, the risk of future spikes in GPS's time transfer error could similarly be minimized, by employing robust Kalman filtering for GPS-UTC predictions...|$|R
5000|$|Web servers {{presenting}} {{web pages}} primarily {{for an audience}} in a single time zone or a limited range of time zones typically show times as a local <b>time,</b> perhaps with <b>UTC</b> <b>time</b> in brackets. More internationally oriented websites may show <b>times</b> in <b>UTC</b> only or using an arbitrary time zone. For example, the international English-language version of CNN includes GMT and Hong Kong Time, whereas the US version shows Eastern Time. US Eastern Time and Pacific Time are also used fairly commonly on many US-based English-language websites with global readership. The format is typically based in the W3C Note [...] "datetime".|$|R

The kinematic orbit of GRACE-A was in the GPS time (GPST), while the time system of SLR data was the coordinated universal <b>time</b> (<b>UTC).</b> The <b>time</b> systems differ by an integer number of seconds.

It stores the measurement results in a format compatible with international standards, and sends data via the Internet to the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) {{for inclusion in the}} UTC computation. In addition to being inexpensive, the receiver was designed to be easy to use, allowing recently established timing laboratories to begin contributing to UTC with a minimal investment in training...|$|R
30|$|In this section, we will briefly {{summarize}} the container monitoring process as determined in the MoCo project. When a container is stored empty, its MoCo Device will daily report about its position and battery level {{according to a}} fixed Universal <b>Time</b> Coordinated (<b>UTC)</b> <b>time</b> (e.g. 12 : 00 <b>UTC</b> <b>time).</b> This way, neighbouring containers will all transmit {{around the same time}} and communication can be more easily optimized. This status is called REST mode. When the container is stuffed, its doors are closed and a MoCo Reader will send a trigger, putting the MoCo Device in Secured Transport Mode (STP mode). From now on, the MoCo Device will send 2 -hourly status updates and reports of optional sensors attached to the cargo, again according to <b>UTC</b> <b>time.</b> In addition, it will immediately report about any critical event that occurs. Finally, there is an optional mode called Secured Vessel Mode (SVE mode). By sending a trigger from a MoCo Router to a MoCo Device upon loading the container in the vessel, the MoCo Device can go to energy-saving mode, where the 802.15. 4 radio is disabled, an internal clock is scheduled and no status updates are sent until the device wakes up again.|$|R
