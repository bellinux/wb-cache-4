25|$|The Greenside {{fault is}} a normal fault with an average dip of 70° to the east. A fault plane is not a flat surface and the actual dip of the Greenside fault varies between 58° east and vertical; in one place it was 83° west. As the rock {{fractured}} and the two sides moved against each other, cavities were created, partly filled with broken rock (fault breccia and fault gouge). Hydrothermal circulation of sea water at temperatures of 110130°C, probably during the Carboniferous Period, led to mineralisation of the fault cavities. The metal content {{is believed to have}} been leached out of rocks of the Skiddaw Group, or the underlying granite batholith. The mineralisation of the fault shows some vertical zonation, with baryte (barium sulphate) in the upper part of the vein, and small amounts of both blende (sphalerite, <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphide)</b> and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) at deeper levels.|$|E
25|$|Also {{associated}} with the granite batholith {{was the creation of}} mineral veins in parts of the Lake District. The richest known lead vein of all was found crossing the south-east shoulder of Green Side. This, the Greenside Lead Vein runs in a north-south direction and dips steeply to the east at 70°. It was up to 59 feet (18m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (lead sulphide) is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (barium sulphate), although at the time this had no commercial value. Very small amounts of blende (<b>zinc</b> <b>sulphide)</b> and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) were found in the deeper levels, but never in recoverable quantities.|$|E

It was noticed that Fe(III) concentrations over 12 g/L did not affect zinc recoveries.

40|$|Abstract: Studies were {{conducted}} to investigate the possibilities to use combustion ashes, electric arc furnace (EAF) dust and lime sludge as neutralising agent with reference to a commercial grade slaked lime. To maintain optimum pH during biooxidation of pyrite the acid produced has to be neutralised. Batch bioleaching was performed on a pyrite concentrate in 1 -L reactors, using a mixed mesophilic culture at a temperature of 35 ºC. Neutralising agents were added regularly to ad-just pH to the desired level of 1. 5. The ashes used were Bioash, Waste ash and Coal & Tyres ash, representing ashes gen-erated from combustion of biomass, a mixture of wood chips and municipal waste, and a mixture of coal and tyres. The dust used was an EAF dust produced in a scrap-based steel plant, while the sludge used was Mesalime produced in a pa-per and pulp plant. The study aimed to investigate the possibility to replace the conventionally used lime or limestone with by-products, based on their neutralising capacity and to observe eventual toxic effects on the bacterial activity. The bioleaching effi-ciency was similar for all the neutralising agents used except Waste ash, when compared with slaked lime. The extent of pyrite oxidation was in the range 69 - 75 % for all neutralising agents, except Waste ash, which had a pyrite oxidation of 59 %. The Waste ash contained {{a large number of}} potentially toxic elements and the chloride concentration of 11 % proba-bly had a negative effect as observed on the lower redox potential and pyrite oxidation.
