30|$|Based on {{the sign}} and {{magnitude}} of the geoid height differences, {{it is possible to}} asses the simulated mass model. In order to do so in a numerically efficient way, we exploit the inverse property of Newton’s law of gravitation that a gravity signal diminishes with distance from the source masses. Therefore, as a first approximation, we assume that a particular geoid height difference is generated by insufficient mass modelling in its near vicinity. We therefore assume that the simulated mass model, the synthetic geoid heights and the EGM-induced geoid heights are all given on co-located <b>geographic</b> <b>grids</b> with the same resolution, thus there are as many mass elements (here prisms) as geoid heights.|$|R

40|$|Public health {{administrators are}} greatly {{concerned}} about over-weight or obesity 1 - 3 and various initiatives to reduce thishealth problem are being undertaken in Europe, 4, 5 the USA, 6 and Canada. 7 Although valuable, these initiatives show limited effects {{because they often}} neglect that “environmental factors play a role, and that environmental solutions {{will be required to}} address the epidemic. ” 8 In recent years, many studies reported relationships between con-textual measures and overweight or obesity, after controlling for individual characteristics. However, a review of these studies high-lights the fact that these were based, in large part, on weak research designs and theories. 8 Brug et al. 8 pointed out that only the most recent studies used multilevel analysis. In a review of 30 multilevel-based studies on overweight or obesity, 9 - 38 we further found that these may be improved in three ways, namely by: 1) using a longi-tudinal design, 2) including both diet and physical activity indica-tors in the modelling, and 3) providing a proper <b>geographic</b> <b>grid</b> to depict the area effect.

In this study, we assume an additional mass layer located at the mean depth of 220 km (the Lehmann discontinuity), which also corresponds to one of the mantle transition zones (Deuss and Woodhouse, 2004). Anomalous masses are added above or below the mean reference depth of 220 km corresponding to positive and negative mass anomalies, respectively. According to PREM (Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981), the constant mass-density contrast of Δϱ 220 = 180 kg/m 3 has been applied to all mass anomalies.

40|$|A four-step {{processing}} sequence is described to produce image mosaics {{from the various}} segments of a sidescanned acoustic imaging survey of a given seafloor area. Starting with data consisting for each ping of acoustic backscatter levels versus horizontal range across-track, median prefiltering is used first to reduce the influence of outliers on subsequent linear processes. Artifacts that are clearly unrelated to the backscattering properties of the seafloor are then isolated on a ping by ping basis through a spectral analysis that relies on a decomposition using Chebyshev polynomials to filter the low spatial frequency components of the image. Contrast enhancement is then achieved through an original implementation of the classical gray level histogram equalization technique by balancing local versus global histogram contributions. Pixels are mapped on a <b>geographic</b> <b>grid</b> taking due account of the geometry of the measurement and of the spacing between pings to minimize along-track smearing of features.

The stack of the moduli is a robust measure of energy radiated {{from a point}} source or point sources even when the velocity information is imprecise. Application to real data shows how double correlation focuses the source mapping compared to the common single correlation approach. Synthetic tests demonstrate the robustness of the method and its resolution limitations which are controlled by the station geometry, the finite frequency of the signal, {{the quality of the}} used velocity information and noise level. Both random noise and signal or noise correlated at time shifts that are inconsistent with the assumed velocity structure can be effectively suppressed. Assuming a surface-wave velocity, we can constrain the source location even if the surface-wave component does not dominate.

The explosive growth of geo-tagged photos enables many large-scale applications, such as location-based photo browsing, landmark recognition, etc. Meanwhile, {{as the number}} of geo-tagged photos continues to climb, new challenges are brought to various applications.

The numerical float tracks are binned using a clustering approach. The {{number of tracks}} in each bin is thus roughly the same leading to diffusivity estimates that converge better than those in bins defined by a regular <b>geographic</b> <b>grid.</b> Cross-stream diffusivities are elevated in the southern recirculation gyre region, near topographic obstacles and downstream in the KE jet, where the flow has weakened. Along-stream diffusivities, which are much larger than cross-stream diffusivities, correlate well with the magnitudes of eddy velocity. The KE jet suppresses cross-stream mixing only in some longitude ranges. This study estimates the critical layer depth both from linear local baroclinic instability analysis and from eddy phase speeds in the POP model using the Radon transform. The latter is a better predictor of large mixing length in the cross-stream direction.
