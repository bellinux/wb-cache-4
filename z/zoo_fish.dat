5000|$|The Vancouver Aquarium {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{facilities}} to incorporate professional naturalists into the galleries to interpret animal behaviours.Prior to this, at the London <b>Zoo</b> <b>Fish</b> House, naturalists James S. Bowerbank, Ray Lankester, David W. Mitchell and Philip H. Gosse (the creator of the word aquarium) had regularly held [...] "open house" [...] events, but the Vancouver Aquarium was the first to employ educational naturalists on a full-time basis. Aquarium research projects extend worldwide, and include marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation.|$|E
5000|$|Oregon Coast Community College {{offers a}} degree program in {{aquarium}} science, {{and is the}} only college in the United States to do so. There are two programs, one to obtain an associate's degree and the other a one-year certification for those with a bachelor's degree or higher in life sciences. Because of the limited number of places available (22 at present), applicants must apply early and are interviewed by several aquarists and biologists. Classes offered range from Biology of Captive Fish and Aquatic Animal Health Management to a scuba diving course. Those studying for either their associate degree or their one-year certification end with an internship at a public aquarium, <b>zoo,</b> <b>fish</b> hatchery, or marine laboratory.|$|E

Although Manchester was heavily bombed during the Blitz, the gardens sustained only minor damage. The Scenic Railway was hit by an incendiary bomb and the Reptile House was damaged by shell splinters from ack-ack guns, which also caused the death of a bull bison.|$|R
50|$|The Blackankle Bog Preserve {{is one of}} the few {{remaining}} Piedmont bogs. The bog is 284 acre total and is owned by The Nature Conservancy. The tract of land was purchased in 1991 from the Dassow Property Corporation. Over the next 20-25 years, the North Carolina Chapter will continue to restore the preserve to its historic condition by setting prescribed burns and replanting longleaf pine tree seedlings grown from local seed sources. The North Carolina <b>Zoo,</b> US <b>Fish</b> and Wildlife Service, and the NC Division of Forest Restoration are actively involved in supporting the Blackankle Bog Preserve and the Nature Conservancy in this restoration effort.|$|R
50|$|The Isle of Pingo Pongo is a 1938 Warner Bros. cartoon {{directed}} by Tex Avery. It {{is the first}} of Avery's spoofs of travelogues, followed on with similar cartoons such as Detouring America, A Day at the <b>Zoo,</b> Fresh <b>Fish,</b> Cross Country Detours, and Crazy Cruise. The cartoon, along with 10 other pre-1948 cartoons, was banned in 1968 and added to the Censored 11 category by United Artists, the owner of distribution rights of the short and UA believed that no amount of editing could make it allowed to be distributed on United States television. It is the only Egghead cartoon on the list.|$|R
50|$|On 14 January 2005, {{the city}} of Detroit {{announced}} that the aquarium would be closed to save $530,000 annually, with the staff being reassigned to the Detroit Zoo or the Belle Isle <b>Zoo,</b> and the <b>fish</b> transferred to other aquariums. It was originally scheduled to close on March 1. Although an extension was granted to the Friends of Belle Isle Aquarium {{to come up with}} a fund raising plan, the aquarium was closed on April 3, 2005.|$|R
50|$|While in Egypt, he {{organized}} the Zoological Museum {{in a building}} in Giza <b>Zoo,</b> started the <b>Fish</b> Garden with aquarium on Gezira Island, and was appointed Ranger of Central Africa. As well as establishing and enforcing game laws in Egypt and Sudan, he was active both in identification of unknown species and conservation of known species at risk.

30|$|Based on {{the results}} of <b>zoo</b> blot, <b>FISH,</b> and copy number analysis, we {{observed}} that the considerably differential amount of satellite VI element presents in the genomes of Indian muntjac, Formosan muntjac, Formosan Sambar, Formosan sika, and Asian red deer (all belong to Old World deer) while it is less abundant or even eliminated in roe deer, black tailed deer, caribou, and Chinese water deer (New World deer) (Pitra et al. [2004]; Hernandez Fernandez and Vrba [2005]). The characterization of copy number variants of satellite VI in the related deer species agrees with the satellite DNA library model as the consequence of concerted evolution (Fry and Salser [1977]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]). The variable FISH signals of satellite VI were observed between some homologous chromosomes in Formosan muntjac, Formosan Sambar deer, and Formosan sika deer. Such different FISH signal strengths/intensities of satellite VI between the homologous chromosomes were most likely due to unequal crossing-over events. It has been suggested that a short monomer size, such as the 11 -bp monomer size of satellite VI in this study, offers ample opportunities for unequal crossing-over during meiosis and results in copy number variation between homologous chromosomes (Smith [1976]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]).|$|R
40|$|The Goggausee, a small, shallow, {{meromictic}} lake(700 m long, 150 m wide, max. depth= 12 m, mean depth= 6 m), was {{the site}} of a week long study (19 - 26 May 1974) of the limnology department of the University of Vienna. The study comprised pollen analysis and palaeolimnological studies on the one hand, as well as a stock- taking of physiochemical factors, primary production, bacteria, zooplankton, <b>zoo</b> benthos and <b>fish</b> on the other. This paper studies the zooplankton of the lake. The Goggausee is a meromictic lake, with its anoxic deep water, that restricts the vertical distribution of most zooplankton. The aim {{of the study was to}} pursue the vertical distribution of the rotifers and Crustacea. Density of individuals, biomass, percentages of zooplankton together and crustaceans and rotifers as groups. Special consideration is given to the the Dipteran Chaoborus flavicans...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} report combines two journal {{articles on the}} relationships between seasons and chaos in ecosystems. They show that {{the strength of the}} seasons (i. e., the latitude) is a key factor for understanding the strange behavior of the ecosystem, and that chaos can be present in an assembly of different communities where the rhythm of the seasons suitably interferes with the endogenous rhythms of the biological processes. The first paper by Rinaldi et al. studies a general predator-prey model describing the behavior of two interacting populations in a periodic environment. Multiple attractors and catastrophic transitions are proved to exist and the two classical routes to chaos (torn destruction and cascade of period doublings) are numerically detected. The second paper by Doveri et al. presents a seasonally perturbed plankton-fish model composed by five compartments: nutrient, algae, <b>zoo</b> plankton, young <b>fish,</b> and adult fish. The bifurcation analysis of the model supports the conclusion that the dynamics of plankton communities can easily be chaotic provided that the strength of the season is sufficiently strong. In particular, the paper shows why large year-to-year differences in young fish survival need not always be attributable to external factors like interannual weather variability...|$|R
40|$|Debates {{in applied}} ethics {{about the proper}} {{treatment}} of animals (see ANIMAL RIGHTS; ANIMALS, MORAL STATUS OF) often refer to empirical data about animal cognition, emotion (see EMOTION), and behavior. In addition, there is increasing interest in {{the question of whether}} any nonhuman animal could be something like a moral agent (see MORAL AGENCY). These two questions are related but do not entirely overlap. If animals are moral agents we presumably need to grant them moral standing (see MORAL STATUS). If animals are not moral agents, there may be independent reasons for considering their interests. Empirical findings are relevant to both questions. This entry is designed to guide ethicists to the relevant data and claims of scientists and philosophers about capacities related to animal ethics. Moral standing In ethics, the usual question about animals has to do with whether nonhuman species are justified objects of sympathy and moral concern. In applied ethics, there are related questions about vegetarianism (see VEGETARIANISM AND VEGANISM), medical testing (see ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION), testing of consumer products, hunting (see HUNTING), catch-and-release <b>fishing,</b> <b>zoos,</b> husbandry, living conditions, ecotourism, entertainment, and so forth. Some of these arguments rest on claims about the worth of the species (see SPECIES, THE VALUE OF) or focus on the instrumental value (see INSTRUMENTAL VALUE) of treating animals well. Other arguments are based on the cognitive capacities of individual animals, such as the capacity of an animal to experience pain and suffering (see SENTIENCE, MORAL RELEVANCE OF), or to think about the future. Questions about the proper treatment of research and zoo animals might also be addressed by considering the quality of social relationships among such animals. Other cognitive capacities, such as rationality and personhood (see PERSONHOOD, CRITERIA OF), are also sometimes thought necessary for moral agency...|$|R
