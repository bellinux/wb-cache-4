40|$|THE VERBAL CONJUGATION SYSTEM OF THE ŠAUKĖNAI SUBDIALECT (SIMPLE FORMS) Summary The Šaukėnai subdialect {{belongs to}} the {{northern}} subdialects of the southern Žemaitian dialect and has retained their most characteristic features. However, due to considerable theoretical and practical obstacles, {{the description of the}} formation of the derived verbal forms in the Šaukėnai subdialect by applying the rules of the formation of derived verbal forms in Standard Lithuanian is impossible. The verb of the Šaukėnai subdialect possesses the morphological categories of person, number, tense, mood and voice. The inflected verbs (except the imperative mood) have three singular and three plural forms. The 3 rd person form is neutral with respect to the category of number, it denotes an action performed either by one or more than one agent. The marked member of the opposition singular / plural is the plural. The verb of the Šaukėnai subdialect possesses both simple and compound tenses. In the Šaukėnai subdialect, the paradigms of verbal forms indicate three types of modal oppositions: they distinguish four moods, i. e. indirect, direct, imperative and subjunctive. The direct and indirect moods possess the tense forms of present, past, past frequentative and future whereas the imperative and subjunctive moods do not possess the category of tense. In the Šaukėnai subdialect, there are two verbal conjugations which are distinguished according to the underlying form endings in the present tense of the indicative mood. The 1 st conjugation comprises verbs whose present tense underlying form ending is a <b>zero</b> <b>morph</b> (O) which is preceeded either by a consonant or – j, e. g. vèd, t í · l̑, šuokin í e, kaũlij, the 2 nd conjugation comprises verbs whose present tense underlying form ends in /-a/, e. g. mãt-a, b ì j-e, ž ì n-a, etc. The underlying simple past verbal forms of the 1 st (or (i̯) a- stem) conjugation end in /-a/ or /-i/, cf. rãd-a, l ì j-e and ãr-i. The a- stem verbs constitute a highly productive and stable class while in the subdialect there have remained only four i̯ a (former i) - stem verbs: t í · l̑ : ti·l í eti, gá l̑ : gal í eti, m í · l̑ : mi·l í eti  and gú l̑ : gul í eti. The verbs of the 2 nd conjugation (or a -stem) are also rather productive. The Šaukėnai subdialect has preserved some remnants of athematic conjugation. Some verbs are impersonal, e. g. pe r̃ št, the others possess all personal forms derived from underlying form stems, e. g. m ĩ · i̯ ktu, etc. The categories in the Šaukėnai subdialect indicate a variety of symbolization. The categories of person and number are usually represented by grammatical morphemes, or endings (i. e. the morphological markers of the categories) : /-u/, /-a·u/ symbolize the categories of person and number, i. e.   the 1 st person and the singular, /-i/, /-a· /, /-e· / [...] the 2 nd person and the singular /-am/, /-uom/, /-iem/, /-ma/ [...]   the 1 st person and the plural, /-at/, /-uot/, /-iet/, /-te/ [...] the 2 nd person and the plural. The ending forms of the 3 rd person represent the category of person, i. e. the 3 rd person only. The article rejects the opinion, which dominates in Lithuanian linguistic literature, as if the verbal form endings could also represent the category of tense. It is complete misunderstanding, cf. sak-á·u (present) and suk-á·u (past), mùš-ù (present) and mùš-ù (future), etc. As evidenced by the data from the Šaukėnai subdialect, the tense can be expressed by syntactic category markers, phonological means, cf. mat-á·u and ma č̑ -ǽ·u, various formants (infixes), such as –n-, -st-, -s-, cf. añk and ãka, k i̲m̃ b and k ì̲ ba, t i̲r̃ pst  and t i̲r̃ pa, d í̲́ rbu and d í̲́ rpsu, suffixes, cf. d í̲́ rb-a·u and d í̲́ rb-dav-a·u as well as vowel gradation, cf. ke r̃ t and k i̲r̃ ta, etc. However, only the simple form endings of the indicative and subjunctive moods can express the mood. The forms of the subjunctive mood, alongside their specific endings, possess a distinctive formant, -t- while the forms of the imperative mood differ from the forms of the other moods only in the underlying form which has a specific suffix, -k. The above suffix is the basis for the formation of plural forms whose endings do not express the category of mood.  The verbal forms in the Šaukėnai subdialect are derived from the underlying forms (see the list in the article) according to the additive rules by adding corresponding endings. The categoric asymmetry is realized additively. Therefore the coding of the derived forms is either maximally or minimally iconic. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{morpheme}} is generaliy {{understood as}} a unit which has form as well as content, i. e. a physical substance (phonological and phonetic) and a meaning or function within a grammatical system. With reference to examples from Northem Sotho and Zulu, this article demonstrates that <b>zero</b> <b>morphs</b> and empty morphs, as realizations of morphemes, fail to comply {{in one way or}} another with the above-mentioned characteristics posited for morphemes. <b>Zero</b> <b>morphs</b> lack a physical form, while empty morphs lack a meaning.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{implications for}} morpho-phonology {{of a model}} that minimizes {{the role of an}} innate linguistic endowment in grammar formation. ‘Bottom-up’ learning results in mental representations that form sets from perceived morphs but do not involve abstract ‘underlying’ representations. For production, syn- tactic/semantic features (S-features) identify morphs to be com- piled into words. When multiple morphs bear the same S-feature, the grammar must select among the possible contenders. Selection involves phonological regularities or sub-regularities and morpho- phonological as well as idiosyncratic choice; when all else fails the default morph is selected. The model unifies the formal character- ization of suppletion, sub-regularities, allophonic patterns, as well as unifying suppletion and <b>zero</b> <b>morphs.</b> Examples come from En- glish, Southern Min, Yoruba, and Kinande, and other languages...|$|R
40|$|Feminist {{linguistic}} reforms {{provide an}} example of planned social language change that seeks to ensure inclusivity and equality in the linguistic representation of women and men. Gender-neutralisation has been promoted as the preferred strategy for gender-inclusive representations in English. The strategy has included options such as lexical replacement, e. g., flight attendant instead of hostess; neologisms such as firefighter for fireman and morphological compounding with <b>zero</b> <b>morphs</b> chairØ for chairman and compounds with person. Interestingly, some person compounds have emerged into the gender-inclusive language landscape that were not promoted or supported as part of feminist language planning e. g., waitperson. Our discussion focuses on the gender-neutral morphological compounding evident {{in a number of}} occupational nouns. Drawing upon on-line survey data (www. teagirl. arts. uwa. edu. au) we trace the spread and diffusion of person compounds. Our findings reveal that degrees of social-gender loading and occupational prestige interact with positions about gender-inclusivity in confounding ways. Gender-neutralisation through the adoption of person compound...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, analysis and realization of a <b>zero</b> stiffness twist <b>morphing</b> wind turbine blade. The morphing blade {{is designed to}} actively twist {{as a means of}} alleviating the gust loads which reduce the fatigue life of wind turbine blades. The morphing structure exploits an elastic strain energy balance within the blade to enable large twisting deformations with modest actuation requirements. While twist is introduced using the warping of the blade skin, internal pre-stressed members ensure that a constant strain energy balance is achieved throughout the deformation, resulting in a zero torsional stiffness structure. The torsional stability of the morphing blade is characterized by analysing the elastic strain energy in the device. Analytical models of the skin, the pre-stressed components and the complete blade are compared to their respective finite element models as well as experimental results. The load alleviation potential of the adaptive structure is quantified using a two-dimensional steady flow aerodynamic model which is experimentally validated with wind tunnel measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{reflection}} on whether {{and on what}} grounds {{the absence of a}} sign turns out to be as just significant as the sign itself inevitably leads, in the linguistic field, to concentrating oneâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 s attention on the heterogeneous set of linguistic phenomena which modern linguistics generally refers to with the term "zero" 9 ̆ 9. Examples are easily found in many languages, such as in Engl. sheep (sing.) vs. sheep (pl.); cut (present) vs. cut (past) or, even more interesting, as it involves a transcategorisation, cheat (noun) vs. cheat (verb). In all these and many other examples the "absence of an otherwise necessary sign" to stay with Whitney's words may be recognised either through analogical reasoning (which allows one to postulate for example the necessity of an s to mark the morphological function of plural as in brook vs. brooks etc.) or through opposition which highlights the morphological role of some absences of sign. Similar phenomena have also been taken into account in the first Sanskrit grammar ever written, the Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini (4 th c. BC) in 239 rules involving the technical device of lopa lit. "suppression, erasing". 212 of these rules are operative ones, of which 95 can be considered as teaching the zero of sounds (either a single sound or sequences of sounds), 117 the <b>zero</b> of <b>morphs</b> (either inflectional or derivative affixes), rule the zero of an inflected word (pada), and 1 rule the zero of its, i. e. of the so-called markers used by Pāṇinii to connect some rules to some specific units...|$|R
