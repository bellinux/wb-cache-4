40|$|AbstractBackground: International {{guidelines}} {{recommend the}} use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, possibly {{in combination with other}} antihypertensive drugs, to treat hypertension with associated risk factors. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the antihypertensive effect of the combination of <b>zofenopril</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide versus <b>zofenopril</b> monotherapy in patients with essential hypertension, according to their cardiovascular risk level. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of a previously published efficacy and tolerability study. After a 4 -week placebo washout, patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95 - 115 mm Hg), aged 18 to 75 years, were randomized at a ratio of 2 : 1 : 1 to treatment with <b>zofenopril</b> 30 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12. 5 mg or monotherapy with <b>zofenopril</b> 30 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12. 5 mg for 12 weeks in an international, multicenter, double-blind study. This period was followed by 24 weeks of open-label treatment. Systolic BP [SBP] and DBP were measured by mercury sphygmomanometry, and changes associated with treatment were calculated. Patients' cardiovascular risk was computed using the Heart Score algorithm. Patients were classified in quartiles according to distribution of cardiovascular risk level, and comparisons were limited to the <b>zofenopril</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide and <b>zofenopril</b> monotherapy treatment groups. The primary end point was change in office DBP. Results: Two hundred forty-six patients (139 men, 107 women; mean [SD] age, 54 [11] years) were included in the analysis. Mean baseline cardiovascular risk was similar in the <b>zofenopril</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide group and the <b>zofenopril</b> monotherapy group (7 % vs 9 %). DBP and SBP reductions with treatment were significantly greater (both, P < 0. 01) with combination treatment than with monotherapy for each quartile of cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular risk reduction at the end of the 12 weeks of double-blind treatment was greater in the <b>zofenopril</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide group than in the <b>zofenopril</b> monotherapy group (1. 9 % vs 0. 2 %; P < 0. 01), particularly in the group of patients with the highest cardiovascular risk at baseline (5. 2 % vs 2. 0 %). At the end of the 24 -week open-label treatment period, the mean reduction in cardiovascular risk was also significantly greater in the combination treatment group than in the monotherapy group (1. 4 % vs 0. 5 %; P < 0. 01). Conclusions: In these hypertensive patients, combination treatment with <b>zofenopril</b> plus hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a significantly greater decrease in BP compared with <b>zofenopril</b> monotherapy, regardless of the patient's cardiovascular risk.

40|$|Two {{first-line}} antihypertensive therapies for initiating {{treatment in}} hypertension were compared, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) <b>zofenopril</b> and the beta-blocker atenolol. The study was multi-centre and double-blind, and included 304 middle-aged to elderly patients with {{mild to moderate}} hypertension who were randomized to receive either <b>zofenopril</b> 30 - 60 mg once daily (od) or atenolol 50 - 100 mg od for 4 weeks with the possibility to an up-titration in non-responding patients. The higher dose level was then administered until 12 weeks after randomization. Blood pressures (BPs) were substantially reduced by either treatment, but after 4 weeks, the systolic and diastolic BP reductions were significantly greater (p < 0. 05) with <b>zofenopril</b> (- 15. 6 /- 13. 5 mmHg) compared with atenolol (- 13. 1 /- 11. 8 mmHg).

Groups of 2 -month-old male mice received either placebo (N= 10), 0. 05 mg/kg/day of <b>zofenopril</b> (N= 10), 1 mg/kg/day of <b>zofenopril</b> (N= 10), 5 mg/kg/day of captopril (N= 10) or 0. 5 mg/kg/day of enalapril (N= 8). After 29 weeks of treatment, computer-assisted imaging analysis revealed that <b>zofenopril</b> reduced the aortic cumulative lesion area by 78 % at 0. 05 mg/kg/day and by 89 % at 1 mg/ml/day of <b>zofenopril</b> compared to that of the placebo (P< 0. 0001). Captopril reduced by 52 % aortic lesions compared to placebo (P< 0. 01 vs. placebo; P< 0. 05 vs. <b>zofenopril</b> at both doses). Enalapril did not reduce aortic lesions. Furthermore, 0. 05 mg/kg/day of <b>zofenopril</b> reduced susceptibility of plasma LDL to in vitro oxidation compared to captopril, enalapril or placebo, as shown by significant reduction of malondialdehyde content (P< 0. 001 vs. placebo or enalapril; P< 0. 05 vs. captopril), {{as well as by the}} prolongation of lag-time (P< 0. 01 vs. placebo or enalapril P< 0. 05 vs. captopril). More importantly, mice treated with 1 mg/ml/day of <b>zofenopril</b> had a significant decrease in the intimal immunohistochemical presence of oxidation-specific epitopes on oxLDL (NA 59 monoclonal antibody, P< 0. 01), macrophages derived foam cells (F 4 / 80 monoclonal antibody, P< 0. 05) and native LDL (NP monoclonal antibody, P< 0. 01) compared to placebo, captopril or enalapril. Thus, chronic treatment with the new sulfhydryl ACE-inhibitor <b>zofenopril</b> has antiatherosclerotic and antioxidant effects in the arterial wall of hypercholesterolemic apoE(-/-) mice.

40|$|Study {{objective}} - The aim was {{to compare}} the effects of two novel angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, spirapril and <b>zofenopril,</b> on cardiac remodelling in rats with congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction. Spirapril contains no sulphydryl group, whereas <b>zofenopril</b> is a sulphydryl containing ACE inhibitor. Design - Experimental myocardial infarction was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery. Sham operated animals served as controls. Treatment with spirapril (2 - 2. 5 mg. kg- 1. d- 1) or <b>zofenopril</b> (12 - 15 mg. kg- 1. d- 1) added to the drinking water was started immediately after myocardial infarction or sham operation and continued for six weeks. After the treatment period, all rats were killed. The heart was rapidly removed and perfused as described by Langendorff. Heart rate and left ventricular pressure were measured both at baseline and during stimulation with isoprenaline (6 nM). Heart and lung weights were determined. Subjects - Normotensive male Wistar rats (220 - 240 g) were used. Measurements and main results - Experimental myocardial infarction considerably increased left ventricular cavity volume. Chronic treatment with either spirapril or <b>zofenopril</b> significantly attenuated this increase in volume. In infarcted rats, the increase in total heart and lung weight was also significantly reduced by chronic treatment with spirapril and <b>zofenopril,</b> indicating that these compounds reduce cardiac mass and pulmonary congestion in congestive heart failure due to myocardial infarction. There {{were no significant differences}} between treatment with spirapril and <b>zofenopril.</b> In the isolated and perfused rat heart, myocardial infarction significantly decreased both heart rate and left ventricular pressure. Converting enzyme inhibition only affected heart rate. Heart rate was significantly higher in infarcted animals treated with spirapril and <b>zofenopril</b> than in untreated infarcted animals. Conclusions - Both spirapril and <b>zofenopril</b> attenuated ventricular enlargement and cardiac hypertrophy in rats with congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction when treatment was started in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. No additional role could be attributed to the sulphydryl moiety of <b>zofenopril.</b> It is also suggested that these two ACE inhibitors modify cardiac sympathetic activity in rats with congestive heart failure, but more studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|E

Immediately after a sham-operation or myocardial infarction in rats (sham: n = 8; MI: n = 17), treatment with <b>zofenopril,</b> a novel ACE-inhibitor, was started and continued during 42 days (long-term treatment).

The results from this study showed that long-term treatment with <b>zofenopril</b> caused a significant reduction of left ventricular cavity volume in rats with moderate-to-large infarctions, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in the ratio of total heart weight to body weight. However, short-term treatment with <b>zofenopril</b> did not significantly reduce ventricular volume or total heart weight. Finally, both long- and short-term treatment resulted in a small, but statistically significant, reduction of septal wall thickness in sham-operated and infarcted rats. We conclude that CEI therapy decreases ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy after myocardial infarction, only when treatment is continued during the chronic phase.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The SMILE studies {{proved the}} {{prognostic}} benefit of <b>zofenopril</b> vs. placebo or other ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) in post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In this retrospective pooled {{analysis of these}} studies we assessed whether the <b>zofenopril</b> effect is influenced by gender. METHODS: The four double-blind, randomized, parallel-group SMILE studies, compared the efficacy and safety of 6 - 48 week treatment with <b>zofenopril</b> 60 mg/day with that of placebo, lisinopril 10 mg/day or ramipril 10 mg/day in 3630 AMI patients. This pooled analysis compared treatment efficacy (1 -year combined occurrence of death or hospitalization for CV causes) in 2733 men and 897 women. RESULTS: Women were older than men, had a higher prevalence of diabetes and of other major CV risk factors. The risk of a major CV event was significantly larger for women (23 % vs. 17 % men, p< 0. 001). Between-gender risk difference was more marked for people living in Southern (+ 54 %) than in Northern Europe (+ 12 %). In both genders <b>zofenopril</b> similarly reduced the 1 -year risk of CV morbidity and mortality vs. placebo (- 39 % men, p =  0. 0001; - 40 % women, p =  0. 005). The risk reduction was more marked with <b>zofenopril</b> than with the other ACEIs, particularly in men (- 27 %, p =  0. 012; women: - 14 %, p =  0. 479). The drug safety profile was similar between genders in zofenopril-treated patients, while it was worse in women treated with other ACEIs. CONCLUSIONS: Post-AMI women are at higher risk of CV complications than men, particularly when living in Mediterranean countries.

40|$|The {{effects of}} angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibition with <b>zofenopril</b> on the {{development}} of atherosclerosis and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation were determined in Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. Rabbits received either placebo (n = 6) or 0. 5 mg/kg/day of <b>zofenopril</b> (n = 6). After 6 weeks of treatment, the computer-assisted analysis revealed that <b>zofenopril</b> reduced the aortic and common carotid corrected cumulative lesion area by 34 % and 39 %, respectively (p < 0. 05 vs placebo-treated group). The intimal/medial ratio of the largest fatty streaks was 0. 426 +/- 0. 158 in the zofenopril-treated group and 0. 875 +/- 0. 238 in the placebo-treated group (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, we found in the zofenopril-treated group smaller lesions with an intimal/medial ratio of <b>zofenopril</b> also reduced plasmatic LDL oxidation, as shown by significant reduction of malondialdehyde content (p < 0. 01) and relative agarose gel mobility (p < 0. 05), {{as well as by the}} prolongation of the lag-time (p < 0. 05). Compared to zofenopril-treated rabbits, arterial sections of the placebo-group had significant increase in the intimal presence of macrophages-derived foam cells (p < 0. 05), ox-LDL (p < 0. 01), and native LDL (p < 0. 01) detected by immunocytochemistry with RAM- 11, MDA 2 and NP 1533975 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. To investigate the amount of platelet accumulation in the atherosclerotic plaque we also measured platelet-associated radioactivity. Autologous platelets were labeled with 111 Indiumoxine and injected intravenously. After 2 hours, WHHL were sacrificed and arterial sections were counted for platelet-associated radioactivity. In the placebo-treated group, platelet radioactivity was 0. 52 +/- 0. 12 equivalent of radioactivity per mg of tissue in the common carotid and 0. 25 +/- 0. 18 in the abdominal aorta; in contrast, rabbits treated by <b>zofenopril</b> had 0. 20 +/- 0. 12 in the common carotid and 0. 06 +/- 0. 01 in the abdominal aorta. These data indicate that ACE-inhibition with <b>zofenopril</b> has antiatherosclerotic and antioxidant effects in WHHL-rabbits. Our results also shows that these effects could be linked to a reduced wall-associated platelet deposition at the site of atherosclerotic lesions...|$|E
40|$|Alterations in calcium (Ca) {{homeostasis}} play a {{major role}} in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia and of heart failure. Since the ACE-inhibitor <b>zofenopril</b> is known to be beneficial both in heart failure and in acute ischemia, we investigated whether it may modulate the expression of genes involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. We used an acute and a chronic model. In the acute model isolated rat hearts were perfused for 120 minutes in the presence or in the absence of 10 microM zofenoprilat, the active metabolite of <b>zofenopril.</b> At the end of perfusion, each heart was homogenized, RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of the following genes: sarcolemmal L-type Ca channel (CaV), sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchanger (NCE), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), SERCA modulator phospholamban (PLB). Gene expression was normalized on the basis of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase expression. In parallel experiments the heart was homogenized at the end of perfusion and oxalate-supported 45 Ca uptake, which provides a reliable estimate of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, was determined. In chronic experiments rats were treated with <b>zofenopril</b> (15 mg/kg die per os) for 14 days, while control hearts were treated with the same diet, except that <b>zofenopril</b> was omitted. At the end of this period, the heart was quickly excised and perfused with the working heart technique, then it was homogenized and oxalate-supported 45 Ca uptake was determined. Acute or chronic <b>zofenopril</b> administration did not produce any significant change in cardiac output, developed pressure, heart rate, or coronary flow. RT-PCR experiments showed that after 120 min of exposure to 10 microM zofenoprilat PLB gene expression was significantly decreased (0. 60 ± 0. 04 vs 0. 78 ± 0. 05 arbitrary units, P< 0. 05), while the expression of CaV, NCX, RyR and SERCA genes was not significantly modified. Functional experiments revealed that the rate of oxalate-supported 45 Ca uptake measured at 1 micromolar free calcium concentration was significantly increased both in the acute (11. 7 ± 0. 5 vs 14. 1 ± 0. 4 nmol/min per mg of protein, P< 0. 01) and in the chronic model (10. 4 ± 0. 8 vs 14. 5 ± 0. 7 nmol/min per mg of protein, P< 0. 01). We conclude that acute or chronic exposure to <b>zofenopril</b> increased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, possibly as a consequence of reduced PLB expression.

The aim {{of this study was to}} test the effects of <b>Zofenopril</b> on nerve regeneration and scarring in a rat model of peripheral nerve crush injury. Methods Twenty-one adult Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a surgical procedure involving right sciatic nerve crush injury. 15 mg/kg <b>Zofenopril</b> was administered orally to seven rats in group Z for seven days. Seven rats in group S received saline orally for seven days. Seven rats in the control group C received no drug after crush injury. Fourteenth and 42 nd days after injury, functional and electromyography assessments of nerves were performed. Functional recovery was analyzed using a walking track assessment, and quantified using the sciatic functional index (SFI). After these evaluations, all rats were sacrificed and microscopic evaluations were performed. Results The Sciatic functional Index (SFI) in group Z on 14 th day is different significantly from group S and group C (p = 0. 037). But on 42 nd day there was no difference between groups (p = 0. 278).

40|$|Sodium {{depletion}} with diuretics augments {{the efficacy}} of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor therapy for hypertension and renal dysfunction, and possibly for left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Underlying mechanisms may involve altered angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor pharmacokinetics. We hypothesized that the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide causes increased steady-state levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors lisinopril and <b>zofenopril</b> in rats with myocardial infarction. Rats were subjected to coronary ligation to induce myocardial infarction. After I week, rats were randomized to 50 mg/kg/day hydrochlorothiazide or control treatment for 3 weeks. The last week, rats received lisinopril or <b>zofenopril</b> in equipotentent dosages (3. 3 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively). Rats were sacrificed at T-max after the last dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, and tissues were collected for analysis of drug concentrations. Lisinopril concentrations in plasma were significantly increased by hydrochlorothiazide, at unchanged tissue concentrations. This increase could be fully explained by decreased renal function, as evidenced by increased plasma creatinine levels (lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide 82 +/- 5 mu M versus lisinopril 61 +/- 5 mu M, P < 0. 001). In contrast, zofenoprilat levels in kidney and non-infarcted left ventricle were markedly increased by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas plasma concentrations were unchanged. Although hydrochlorothiazide tended to increase plasma creatinine in zofenopril-treated rats as well, this increase was less pronounced (zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide 61 +/- 3 mu M versus <b>zofenopril</b> 54 +/- 2 mu M, P= 0. 15). Hydrochlorothiazide increases steady-state angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor drug levels, most likely by affecting their renal clearance. Notably, the lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor <b>zofenopril</b> accumulated in tissue, whereas the hydrophilic lisinopril increased in plasma. Whether combining different angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors with hydrochlorothiazide translates into distinct clinical profiles requires further study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
