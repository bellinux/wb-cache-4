50|$|Within {{gasoline}} and diesel, the government requires sulfur levels {{to be reduced}} from 300 - 500 ppm to 30 ppm and 15 ppm respectively. For fuel cell applications sulfur must be under 1 ppm to avoid poisoning the fuel cell. Cu(I) Y <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst</b> is typically used to reduce the sulfur in both situations. The hydrodesulfurization technique can remove thiols and sulfides, but cannot efficiently remove thiophenes, therefore the catalyst is used because it selectively adsorbs the sulfur compounds at ambient temperature and pressure. They selectively bind to the thiophenic compounds by pi complexation. The pi complexation involves the donation of electron charges from the thiophene pi-orbital to the vacant s orbital of the copper. At the same time, the d-orbitals of the metals donate electron charges to the anti-bonding pi-orbital. This donation to the s orbital of copper is important in adsorbing thiophene. The downfall of using the Cu(I) Y <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst</b> for desulfurization is that moisture exhibits strong inhibiting effects on the adsorption process because the water molecule is preferred over sulfur.|$|E

The current methods for the synthesis of nanocellulose involve harsh chemical treatments which are perpetually hazardous to human and environment. Catalytic synthesis of nanocellulose might be a green approach. Among the various types of catalyst, ionic liquids, which are composed of both cations and anions and have low or negligible vapor pressure, are particularly promising.

30|$|Direct {{synthesis}} of 2, 6 -DMN {{has been investigated}} by methylation and disproportionation of naphthalene sources over different kind of zeolite catalysts such as Pt-, Fe-, Ti-, Zr- and Co-modified ZSM- 5, ZSM- 12 and La, Cu-doped Y zeolite by (Jin et al. 2008). Pu and Inui (1996) studied the methylation of 2 -MN over zeolite catalysts including ZSM- 5, Fe-MFI, Zn-MFI and Pt/ZSM- 5 in a fixed-bed flow reactor. Fe- and Zn-modified MFI silicates showed higher 2, 6 -DMN/ 2, 7 -DMN ratios and higher β,β-DMN selectivity compared with ZSM- 5. On the other hand, the metal silicates demonstrated lower methylnaphthalene conversion and faster deactivation than ZSM- 5. However, Jin et al. (2008) investigated the methylation of 2 -MN over modified ZSM- 5 type <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst</b> in a fixed-bed micro-reactor at 400  °C with a reactant mixture of 2 -MN, methanol and mesitylene having a molar ratio of 1 : 5 : 3, respectively. Both catalytic activity and lifetime of ZSM- 5 <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst</b> were improved by NaOH treatment. Additionally, a higher 2, 6 -DMN/ 2, 7 -DMN ratio, higher selectivity and higher yield of 2, 6 -DMN were obtained over Zr-modified mesoporous ZSM- 5. The disproportionation of 2 -MN over Zr-modified ZSM- 5 <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst</b> in a fixed-bed reactor at 400 – 450  °C has been investigated for five different weight hourly space velocities by (Güleç et al. 2016). The results revealed that Zr-modified ZSM- 5 improved the catalytic activity of ZSM- 5 in the disproportionation reaction. Furthermore, Liang et al. (2010) mentioned that Pt-modified ZSM- 5 catalyst showed lower coke formation, higher conversion of 2 -MN, higher selectivity and higher yield of 2, 6 -DMN compare with HZSM- 5. In another study, Niftaliyeva and Karaduman (2015) investigated the methylation of 2 -MN over Cu- and La-impregnated Y <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst</b> using a feed mixture of 2 MN, methanol and 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene having a molar ratio of 1 : 5 : 5. The type Y <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst</b> resulted in a very high conversion of 2 -MN. Moreover, La impregnation enhanced the conversion activity of Y <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Although 2 -MN {{is one of the}} widely used raw material in the production of 2, 6 -DMN, whereas naphthalene is also another alternative starting material. Wu et al. (2010) established the effect of Al, Ga and Al/Ga impregnated ZSM- 12 on the methylation reaction of naphthalene. According to their results, the highest conversion of naphthalene was obtained over Al/Ga-modified ZSM- 12 and the highest 2, 6 -DMN percentage and highest 2, 6 -DMN/ 2, 7 /DMN ratio were also observed over Ga-modified ZSM- 12. Song et al. (2007) investigated shape selective methylation of naphthalene for the {{synthesis of}} 2, 6 -DMN with Ti-, Co- and Fe-modified ZSM- 5 <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The results illustrated that the highest conversion of naphthalene, the highest percentage of 2, 6 -DMN and highest 2, 6 -DMN/ 2, 7 /DMN ratio obtained over Fe-impregnated ZSM- 5 as compared with Ti- and Co-modified ZSM- 5. The synthesis of 2, 6 -DMN with isomerization reaction was studied by Motoyuki et al. (2000) and they investigated isomerization of DMN isomers to produce 2, 6 -DMN. According to their results, an effective synthesis process of 2, 6 -DMN is possible by utilizing a non-valuable feed stream that mainly includes naphthalene and DMN isomers. In addition, isomerization reaction of the mixture of DMN isomers occurred over MCM- 22 <b>zeolite</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The isomerization reaction also showed that 2, 6 -DMN can be enriched in the mixture effectively.|$|E
