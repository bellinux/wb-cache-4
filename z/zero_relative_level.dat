40|$|Variation {{and change}} in relativization {{strategies}} {{has been well documented}} (e. g. Ball 1996 : 46, Biber and Clark 2002, Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad and Finegan 1999, Johansson 2006, Lehmann 2002). Certain types of relative clause, namely that-relatives and <b>zero</b> <b>relatives,</b> were difficult to retrieve from plain-text corpora. Studies therefore either relied on manual extraction of data or a subset of possible relativization strategies. In some text types, however, the <b>zero</b> <b>relative</b> is an important member of the class of possible relativizers. Recent advances in syntactic annotation should have made that-relatives and <b>zero</b> <b>relatives</b> more accessible to automatic retrieval. In this article, we test precision and recall of searches on a modest-sized corpus, i. e. scientific texts from ARCHER (A Representative Corpus of Historical English Registers), as a preliminary to future work on the large corpora which are increasingly becoming available. The parser retrieved some false positives {{and at the same time}} missed some relevant data.

40|$|Impact {{sounds were}} {{synthesized}} according to standard textbook equations {{given for the}} motion of simply supported, metal plates. In a two-interval, forced-choice procedure, highly practiced listeners identified from these sounds a predefined class of target plates based on their particular material and geometric properties. The effects of two factors on identification were examined: the <b>relative</b> <b>level</b> of partials comprising the sounds and the relative amount of information (given as the difference in d′) each partial provided for identification. In different conditions one factor was fixed while the other either increased or decreased with frequency. The effect on listener identification in each case was determined from a logistic discriminant analysis of trial-by-trial responses, yielding a vector of listener decision weights on the frequency and decay of individual partials. The weights increased proportionally with <b>relative</b> <b>level,</b> but were largely uninfluenced by relative information content—a result exactly opposite to that expected from a maximum-likelihood observer. The dominant effect of <b>relative</b> <b>level</b> was replicated for other sound sources (clamped bars and stretched membranes) and was not diminished by randomizing the <b>relative</b> <b>level</b> of partials across trials.

Here, we perform numerical propagation of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and analytical calculations based on perturbation theory to show that the energy-resolved maximal absorption of photons from the attosecond pulse does not uniquely occur at a <b>zero</b> <b>relative</b> phase of the initial wave packet. Instead, maximal absorption occurs at different relative wave packet phases, distributed as a non-monotonous function with a smooth -π/ 2 shift across the central photon energy (given a Fourier-limited Gaussian pulse).

Our finding is surprising, because it implies that the energy-resolved photoelectrons are not mapped one-to-one with the energy-resolved absorbed photons of the attosecond pulse...|$|R
