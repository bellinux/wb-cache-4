40|$|This study {{examines}} {{some of the}} degradation phenomena exhibited by modern oil paintings and twentieth century oil paint formulations and possible correlations with the various organic additives typically introduced by manufacturers. The research takes into consideration historical and modern tube oil paints produced by different European manufacturers and selected twentieth century oil paintings which showed degradation problems such as efflorescence, softening, cracks and sensitivity towards water and polar solvents. The composition of oil paints and paintings samples was studied with XRF, SEM-EDX, ATR-FTIR and GCMS. The results showed that both artists’ oil paints and paintings samples contain a complex mixture of additives to the oil binders and pigments. The presence of aluminium and <b>zinc</b> <b>stearates,</b> added as dispersion agent gelling agents, was detected in most paint formulations of HKS, W&N, Talens and Maimeri (c. 1940 -present). Several paint films showed an unusually high content of fatty diacids, suggesting that, in drying, an oxidative reaction was favoured above polymerisation. This occurrence, together with the diversity of lipidic media, additives, pigments and driers present in the industrial formulations could {{play a crucial role}} in paint failure and instability, as showed by the analysed case studies. The obtained results may help understanding the behaviour of modern oil paints and painting surfaces and contribute to improved conservation methods...|$|R
40|$|Water {{represents}} {{without any}} doubt {{one of the}} most important degradation factors for a wide typology of materials like plasters, mortars, concretes, bricks and natural stones [1]. The degradation processes due to the water action towards architectural materials has been over time a problem with an increasing importance in the last years, as a consequence of the intensification of precipitations and world climate changes. The damages caused by water to buildings and architectures are often serious, with high costs for the reparation of materials and structures which are not well protected. Solutions able to prevent and limit this problem should be seen and studied as a sustainability tools for the protection of new and old buildings. This research deals with the study and development of in-mass-hydrophobized rendering mortars, which can be applied for the protection of building facades. Previous studies have focused on in mass water-repellent mortars, showing that hydrophobic compounds can be mixed to different binders and aggregates to obtain mortars whose water-repellent effectiveness depends most on the binder system chosen [2 - 5]. In this research lime cement mortars, which have not been deeply investigated yet, were taken in account. Integral water repellent lime cement mortars were prepared using different hydrophobic compounds. Calcium <b>stearates,</b> <b>zinc</b> <b>stearates,</b> powder silanes, liquid silanes were added to lime cement mortars. The influence of the additives on the setting and structure of mortars were investigated as well as the effectiveness of these agents in protecting the mortars against damages caused by the water action. Instrumental techniques such FT-IR and XRD were used in order to understand the chemical-physical interaction between agents and cement mortars. MIP analysis, ultrasonic measurements, water absorption tests and contact angle measurements were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of the water-repellent additives in hydrophobizing the final mortars. Workability variation of fresh mortars and a slight influence on the hydration times and products were observed. The water-repellent effectiveness changed with the additive chosen as well as the structure and the water vapor permeability...|$|R

40|$|From the 19 th Century, artists’ {{oil paints}} were {{increasingly}} produced on an industrial scale {{and include a}} number of additives, e. g. stabilisers, dispersion agents and driers [1]. These additives allowed for faster production, stability, prolonged shelf life and uniform handling properties of the paints in and from the tubes. In particular, aluminium and <b>zinc</b> <b>stearates</b> were introduced as wetting and dispersion agents for the pigments and as stabiliser for the paint. However, the incorporation of stearates into manufactured oil paints may cause water sensitivity during surface cleaning of unvarnished paintings [2, 3]. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate 20 th century manufactured oil paints by developing an analytical methodology for the detection of metal soaps and lipidic additives using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). A methodology for the detection of metal stearate and fatty acid additives was designed by analysis of selected oil paint films. In addition, commercial tube oil paints from Winsor&Newton, Old Holland, Talens, Gimborn, and Maimeri were tested. The developed analytical procedure was also used for the analysis of samples from 20 th century oil paintings by Lucio Fontana, Jasper Johns, Karel Appel, Willem de Kooning, and others. The results obtained pointed out the employ of different kinds of oil media (such as linseed oil, rapeseed oil, castor oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, etc) and the presence of additives (such as stearates, hydrogenated castor oil, waxes, etc). The identification of binding media and additives in paint samples is important for the knowledge about painting techniques and to understand degradation phenomena which occurr in modern and comtemporary works of art as well.

Additives serve a variety of purposes in polymer production from increasing stability during processing to improving the appearance of the final product. It is often necessary to include more than one additive to meet the processing and performance requirements of an application.

It has many applications e. g., in resins, paints, cosmetics, textile, lubricants and Langmuir-Blodgett films. Double decomposition (precipitation) and fusion processes are widely used techniques in ZnSt 2 production. The product purity {{has been a major}} concern in most of the ZnSt 2 applications such as PVC stabilization, coating of textile goods, additive in cosmetic products. In this study, the production of ZnSt 2 using precipitation, fusion and modified fusion processes was investigated based on product purity. Raw materials and ZnSt 2 were characterized by using various techniques. In the precipitation process, in order to maximize the solubility of sodium stearate and to minimize the water evaporation, the reaction was carried out at 70 °C. 2. 5 % (w) NaSt was used in the reaction at this temperature. The equivalent, excess Zn and deficient Zn cases were studied to determine the raw materials ratio on product purity. Equivalent raw materials produced highest product purity. From washing experiment, it was seen that Na 2 SO 4 adsorption did not take place on to wet ZnSt 2. The washing water to <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> ratio was found to be 40 dm 3 /kg for effective removal of by products and raw materials unreacted at room temperature. Any further increase in the amount of water did not bring any significant removal results. In the drying of wet ZnSt 2 at 100 °C, it was determined that it has 85 % (w) water. In IR spectra, characteristic ZnSt 2 peak was observed at 1540 cm- 1. ZnSt 2 obtained by this process did not contain any free Na+ and SO 4 - 2 ions as indicated by ICP, EDX and elemental analysis results. Only two of the characteristic peaks of ZnSt 2 at 2. values of 6. 40 and 19. 58 were obtained in XRD pattern of the dried product due to low crystallinity. From SEM micrographs, it was seen that <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> has lamellar structure and particle size changes between 2 - 4. m. Melting point of the <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> was found to be about 122 °C using optic microscopy with temperature controlled hot stage. In fusion process, reaction was carried out at 140 °C in equivalent amounts for different stirring rates 400, 600 and 750 rpm. The increase in mixing rate decreased the delay time occurring {{at the beginning of the}} reaction. The conversion was found to be 80 % using the developed method from IR spectra. In the comparison of the experimental conversion data with shrinking core model no relation was established. In IR spectra, two peaks observed at 1540 cm- 1 and 1700 cm- 1 which belong to ZnSt 2 COO- stretching and stearic acid C. O stretching vibrations, respectively. All of the characteristic 2. values of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> were observed for product, which means that the crystallinity of the product is high. From SEM micrographs, it was seen that <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> structure is in the form of layered lamella and particle size change between 4 - 6. m. The melting point of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> samples from fusion process was found to be slightly lower than 122 °C by optic microscopy with temperature-controlled hotstage. In the modified fusion process, reaction was carried out at 80 °C for 1 h. with equivalent amounts of stearic acid and zinc oxide in the presence of H 2 O. Sodium stearate 1. 5 % (w) was added into reaction mixture as a surfactant and its effect was examined. At the end of reaction it was seen from IR spectra that it does not significantly increase the reactants dispersion. The presence of unreacted raw materials was determined in IR spectras and XRD patterns. This result was confirmed by SEM micrographs too. In TGA analysis, thermal decomposition temperature of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> was found to be 250 °C. The use of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> in n-paraffin wax shifted the thermal decomposition temperature of wax 10 °C.

40|$|Effect of {{different}} precursors, and method of fabrication on {{the properties of}} zinc stearate/oxide hierarchical superhydrophobic surfaces Abstract: In recent years, surfaces with superhydrophobicity have attracted immense interest in fundamental research due to their wide range of practical applications. ZnO surfaces with different morphologies and superhydrophobic property have been reported. In the present work, superhydrophobic zinc stearate/oxide coatings were obtained by one pot method, using two different precursors and stearic acid. The method used is simple {{as well as economical}} and can be scaled up easily. It avoids the use of harmful fluoro chemicals and the superhydrophobic surfaces can be obtained within an hour. The hydrophobicity of the thin films can be tuned and controlled by changing the added amount of precursors, type of precursors and time of immersion. The FESEM images shows that the <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> flowers formed from different precursors are having different morphology. The superhydrophobic surface was achieved by the synergistic effect of surface roughness of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> and its own low surface energy. The coatings have been characterized by X-ray diffractometry and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy. The present work not only demonstrated a facile route for the preparation of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> hierarchical micro/ nanostructures, but also provides a very easy and effective method to fabricate superhydrophobic coatings in less tim...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Speed {{of sound}} have been {{measured}} {{as a function}} of composition for binary mixtures of stearates (<b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> and calcium stearate) and triethylene glycol were studied along with density and viscosity values, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular interactions in the binary mixture is thus only possible from the measurements of various physico – chemical properties and treating the excess functions derived there from [1]. Inspite of this interesting consideration, the concrete studies on the excess functions of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> – triethylene glycol and calcium stearate – triethylene glycol mixtures are studied. The results have been discussed in terms of molecular interactions. The aim of this work was also to find out if there are any structural peculiarities in solutions of stearate and glycol.

40|$|N-phenyl- 3 -acetyl pyrrolidine- 2, 4 -dione (F 6) and its {{derivatives}} (F 6 c and F 6 d) {{have been}} investigated as costabilisers for PVC at processing temperatures, along with the commercial costabilisers: dehydroacetic acid (DHA) and Rhodiostab- 83 (R 83). Spectroscopic (fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance) studies on PVC itself, and model compounds of PVC impurities (e. g. 4 -chloro- 2 -hexene) have shown two distinct modes of action: in which a metal complex between the costabiliser and a metal soap stabiliser (<b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> and calcium stearate is the active entity, one in which costabiliser action is facilitated by release of zinc chloride. F 6 was shown to substitute for allylic chloride by a C-alkylation reaction so inhibiting polyene formation and giving very good initial colour. It was demonstrated that F 6 formed a complex with the <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate</b> at room temperature to give a chelate in which the zinc ion is tetracoordinated. Because the costabiliser is able to co-ordinate readily to <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate,</b> this leads to good initial colour, but a more rapid evolution of HCl ('short-term' costabilisation). When the -C=O substituent in the 3 -position {{was replaced by a}} '-C=N-alkyl' (F 6 d), or a '-C=N-phenyl' (F 6 c) group, the behaviour was changed markedly. FTIR and HCl evolution showed that F 6 d was unstable at 180 deg. C and reacted with HCl evolved from the degraded PVC, decomposing into a basic gas and a structure similar to F 6. F 6 d being more basic formed a complex with the Lewis acid ZnCI_ 2 instead of <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate.</b> F 6 c did not interact with the ZnCl_ 2 or ZnSt_ 2, {{despite the fact that it}} has an extra nitrogen atom. The reason for this is that the #pi# orbital system of the N-substituted phenyl ring in the 3 -position in the pyrrolidine ring is conjugated with the C=N double bond. DHA also interacted with the <b>zinc</b> <b>stearate,</b> but this interaction was significant only at higher temperatures, i. e. after heating to processing temperatures. The synergistic action of R 83 was considered to arise from its ability to form a stable complex with the metal chloride, so protecting against the prodegradant action of the metal chloride (hence 'long-term' costabilisation).
