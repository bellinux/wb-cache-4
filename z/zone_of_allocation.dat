The major role of the Sub-mediterranean ammonites in the Volgian assemblages is described, providing additional detail to the existing scheme of Tithonian-Volgian correlations. The base of the Tithonian and {{the base of the}} Volgian are coincident, based on the association of Neochetoceras steraspis-Lingulaticeras solenoides. The Klimovi Zone corresponds to most <b>of</b> the Hybonotum <b>Zone.</b> However, the top <b>of</b> the Hybonotum <b>Zone,</b> based on the distribution of Paralingulaticeras, falls within the Sokolovi <b>Zone.</b> The <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> a Tenuicostata Subzone (with two horizons: neoburgense and puschi) in the Pseudoscythica Zone is proven. The neoburgense horizon may be correlated with the ciliata and penicillatum horizons of Neuburg and, probably, with the Semiforme <b>Zone.</b> The findings <b>of</b> Lingulaticeras blaschkei, Pseudolissoceras, and Sutneria in the Panderi <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Tithonian suggest that the base of the Middle Volgian may not be younger than the Middle Tithonian Fallauxi Zone. </p...|$|R
30|$|While {{all seems}} to agree that Mobile QoS is to reserve {{necessary}} bandwidth for next possible locations, opinions differ as to the different nature in network technology. Supporting of Mobile QoS in the IEEE 802.16 -MR network is worth a second thought. First of all, all RSs in the network share the same medium (channel), and the bandwidth requirement for a traffic flow depends on (more specifically, is proportional to) its path length (the number of RSs en route). Therefore, the bandwidth requirement of a mobile user at current RS is correlated with the bandwidth requirement at neighboring or nearby RSs. Secondly, the medium in the IEEE 802.16 -MR is managed by the BS in a centralized control manner, which provides the feasibility of more sophisticated bandwidth management in the network. The correlation of required bandwidth at nearby RSs leads {{to the idea of}} Zone-based bandwidth management proposed in this article. The <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> bandwidth <b>allocation</b> for a mobile user includes the user's current RS and the nearby RSs. The number of RSs in a zone is determined by the zone size, whose impact on different performance criteria has been investigated.

40|$|Fractional {{frequency}} reuse (FFR) {{has emerged as}} a viable solution to coordinate and mitigate cochannel interference (CCI) in orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA) -based wireless cellular networks. The incurred CCI in cellular networks with FFR is highly uncertain and varies as a function of various design parameters that include the user scheduling schemes, the transmit power distribution among multiple allocated subcarriers, the partitioning of the cellular region into cell-edge and cell-center <b>zones,</b> the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> spectrum within each zone, and the channel reuse factors. To this end, this paper derives a generic analytical model for uplink CCI in multicarrier OFDMA networks with FFR. The derived expressions capture several network design parameters and are applicable to any composite fading-channel models. The accuracy of the derivations is verified via Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, their usefulness is demonstrated by obtaining closed-form expressions for the Rayleigh fading-channel model and by evaluating important network performance metrics such as ergodic capacity. Numerical results provide useful system design guidelines and highlight the trade-offs associated with the deployment of FFR schemes in OFDMA-based networks. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

Like the {{solution}} theory in cooperative games of how the Harsanyi dividend of each coalition is distributed among a set of players, this new class <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> rules focuses {{on the distribution of}} the dividend of each network. The dividend of each network is allocated in proportion to some measure of each player's effort, which is called an effort function. With linearity <b>of</b> the <b>allocation</b> rules, an allocation rule is specified by the effort functions. These types <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> rules are called linear proportional effort allocation rules. Two famous allocation rules, the Myerson value and the position value, belong to this class <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> rules.

We investigate the temporal pattern <b>of</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> larval reserves to reproduction in a host-feeding parasitoid wasp.

However, despite the high frequency of host feeding and the high nutrient content of a haemolymph meal, which we predicted would lead to larval reserves being conserved in the event of host deprivation, larval reserves contribute to egg production throughout the lifetime of the female. We propose several mechanistic and adaptive explanations for our results, including the possible existence of a limiting or key nutrient for egg production of exclusively larval origin.
