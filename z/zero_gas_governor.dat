40|$|Air quality {{observations}} are performed globally {{to monitor the}} status of the atmosphere, its level of pollution and to assess mitigation strategies. Regulations of air quality monitoring programmes in various countries demand high precision measurements for harmful substances often at low trace concentrations. These requirements can only be achieved by using high quality calibration gases including high purity <b>zero</b> <b>gas.</b> For volatile organic compound (VOC) observations, <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> is defined being hydrocarbon free like purified air, nitrogen or helium and is essential for the characterisation of the measurement devices and procedures, for instrument operation as well as for calibrations. Two commercial and one self-built gas purifiers were tested for their removal efficiency of VOCs following a standardised procedure. The tested gas purifiers included one adsorption cartridge with an inorganic media and two types of metal catalysts. A large range of VOCs was investigated including the most abundant species typically measured at air monitoring stations. Both catalysts were able to remove a large range of VOCs whilst the tested adsorption cartridge was not suitable to remove light compounds up to C 4. Memory effects occurred for the adsorption cartridge when exposed to higher concentration. This study emphasises the importance to explicitly examine a gas purifier for its intended application before applying in the field...|$|R

40|$|Increasing use {{is being}} made of small digital {{controllers}} in Industry and Commerce. The failure of such controllers is important since it may cause either plant to become unsafe or the interruption of production. Fault tolerant techniques are discussed for improving the reliability of digital controllers with special reference {{to the development of}} a hybrid electromechanical <b>gas</b> <b>governor,</b> whose electronic controller is an example of a small digital controller. Three microprocessors are used in a two out of three majority voting configuration and the memory is Hamming code protected. Redundancy techniques are used to protect against faults in other parts of the controller and it will tolerate most classes of transient fault. When comparing designs or attempting to meet reliability criteria, it is necessary to predict the reliability of a system and its individual components. Several sources of failure rate prediction are compared and the wide variation in the failure rates of integrated circuits is highlighted. The comparison concludes by recommending which reliability data source is likely to be most accurate for each type of component. The <b>gas</b> <b>governor</b> is an example of a repairable system and analysis is developed for predicting the improvement in reliability for repairable redundant systems and for determining the optimum maintenance and repair times for equipment. The testing of redundant systems is difficult because of their complexity, and under certain circumstances the redundancy can mask design faults. Testing methods using complex test equipment are described, as well as the testing of the experimental controller. A review is included of other fault-tolerant systems. Although the work on large computers is not directly applicable to small controllers, many of the techniques can be used...|$|R

Considering, as an example, the reaction of μ-capture on proton, we demonstrate that measurements of the μ^- disappearance at different values of the hydrogen gas pressure in the target could be used to avoid a pressure-dependent correction and determine the "vacuum" μ p -> ν n reaction rate with accuracy better than 10 ^- 2 after extrapolation to <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> density.

It couples the level-set and volume-of-fluid techniques and retains their advantages while overcoming their weaknesses. It is stable and robust even for large density and viscosity ratios {{on the order}} of 1000 to 1. The numerical method is an extension of the second-order method presented by Sussman [M. Sussman, A second order coupled levelset and volume of fluid method for computing growth and collapse of vapor bubbles, Journal of Computational Physics 187 (2003) 110 – 136] in which the previous method treated the gas pressure as spatially constant and the present method treats the gas as a second incompressible fluid. The new method yields solutions in the <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> density limit which are comparable in accuracy to the method in which the gas pressure was treated as spatially constant. This improvement in accuracy allows one to compute accurate solutions on relatively coarse grids, thereby providing a speed-up over continuum or "ghost-fluid" methods...|$|R

40|$|The low {{frequency}} sensitivity of space-borne gravitational wave observatories will depend critically on the geodetic {{purity of the}} trajectories of orbiting test masses. Fluctuations in the temperature difference across the enclosure surrounding the free-falling test mass can produce noisy forces through several processes, including the radiometric effect, radiation pressure, and outgassing. We present here a detailed experimental investigation of thermal gradient-induced forces for the LISA gravitational wave mission and the LISA Pathfinder, employing high resolution torsion pendulum measurements of the torque on a LISA-like test mass suspended inside a prototype of the LISA gravitational reference sensor that will surround the test mass in orbit. The measurement campaign, accompanied by numerical simulations of the radiometric and radiation pressure effects, allows a more accurate and representative characterization of thermal-gradient forces in the specific geometry and environment relevant to LISA free-fall. The pressure dependence of the measured torques allows clear identification of the radiometric effect, in quantitative agreement with the model developed. In the limit of <b>zero</b> <b>gas</b> pressure, the measurements are most likely dominated by outgassing, but at a low level that does not threaten the LISA sensitivity goals.
