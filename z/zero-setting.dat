40|$|Rotor {{position}} detection is {{a prerequisite}} for achieving good control performance of PMSM. For a PMSM control system based on an optical encoder, it is a difficulty to detect rotor position and achieve R-Signal <b>zero-setting.</b> To solve the problem, a hybrid optical encoder is used in the paper by which a scheme for rotor position detection and R-Signal <b>zero-setting</b> is proposed. This encoder can do absolute and incremental rotor position detection simultaneously; here, the former is used for acquiring imprecise rotor position and the latter is for precise rotor position. Firstly, two detection methods of the encoder are analyzed, and a scheme for rotor position detection is proposed: absolute rotor position is used for motor starting before achieving R-Signal zero-setting; once achieving R-Signal <b>zero-setting,</b> incremental rotor position detection that has high precision is adopted. Then a novel scheme for R-Signal <b>zero-setting</b> is emphatically proposed. Finally, the simulation is conducted. Results show that rotor position detection and R-Signal <b>zero-setting</b> can be achieved by the proposed scheme...|$|E
40|$|The book is lucidly {{written in}} an {{accessible}} style which renders complex theoretical arguments comprehensible. It displays the {{intimate knowledge of}} the scholarly enthusiast and the clear-eyed scepticism of one who, like Cliff Hardy, has heard too much bullshit to take everything at surface value. Knight is however {{on the trail of}} a grand theory, offered with modest and provisional authority, about how crime fiction constructs and negotiates vitally important issues of Australian culture, providing 2 ̆ 7 a whole history of political domination [and] national and international responses made to it 2 ̆ 7. On the way he provides information about the publication, distribution and international situation of the Australian popular writer. For the benefit of literary historians he outlines distinctive and even unique Australian narrative preferences; criminal sagas, goldfields (petit bourgeois) mysteries, and stories with 2 ̆ 7 zero-detection 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 <b>zero-setting</b> 2 ̆ 7. Police procedurals (who trusts cops?) and amateur sleuths (too English) have a thin run of it here except, oddly, with women writers...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{distance}} relays have integrated numerous protection functions including power-swing blocking and out-of-step or pole-slip tripping functions. The {{main purpose}} of the power-swing blocking function is to differentiate faults from power swings and block distance or other relay elements from operating during stable or unstable power swings. Most power-swing blocking elements are based on traditional methods that monitor {{the rate of change}} of the positivesequence impedance. The required settings for the power-swing blocking elements could be difficult to calculate in many applications, particularly those where fast swings can be expected. For these cases, extensive stability studies are necessary to determine the fastest rate of possible power swings. This paper describes a <b>zero-setting</b> power-swing blocking protection method that is independent of network parameters and is based on monitoring the line swing-center voltage rate of change. The new method does not require any stability studies or user settings for the proper blocking of relay elements that are prone to operate during stable or unstable power swings. The method is applicable to long, heavily loaded transmission lines that pose great problems in the application of power-swing blocking elements based on traditional methods. This new method offers a great advantage in its ability to detect three-phase faults that may occur during power swings and allows the protective relays to issue a tripping command and isolate the faulted power system element. In this paper, we discuss other enhancements in the design of power-swing blocking and out-of-step tripping functions that improve the security and reliability of the power system. We also demonstrate the behavior and performance of the new power-swing blocking element through use of electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) and relay simulations...|$|E
