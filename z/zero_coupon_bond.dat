2500|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> have a {{duration}} {{equal to}} the bond's time to maturity, which makes them sensitive to any changes in the interest rates.

2500|$|Arbitrage {{arguments}} ("Rational pricing") apply {{when the}} deliverable asset exists in plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created.

Assuming interest rates are constant the forward price of the futures {{is equal to the}} forward price of the forward contract with the same strike and maturity. It is also the same if the underlying asset is uncorrelated with interest rates. Otherwise the difference between the forward price on the futures (futures price) and forward price on the asset, is proportional to the covariance between the underlying asset price and interest rates.

40|$|Debt financing, such as {{bonds and}} notes payable, {{comes with an}} {{interest}} cost that is incurred by the borrower and paid to the lender providing compensation {{for the use of}} funds. When <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> are issued, interest is included in the principal amount or face value of the <b>bonds.</b> Although <b>coupon</b> payments are not made during the life of the bonds, the company accrues interest expense on them, which is paid when the bonds are repurchased or redeemed at maturity. Hence, when a company repurchases or redeems <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> it should classify the cash outflow for the repayment of principal amount received from bondholders as a financing use of cash and the amount paid in excess of the principal as operating use of cash. This study examines the cash flow reporting practices of companies that repurchase or redeem <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> We also evaluate the impact these practices have on the reported cash flows from operating activities. Our results indicate that most companies classify the cash paid towards interest on <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> as a financing use of cash.

The model stresses the concepts of money duration and money convexity in interest-rate risk management. An application is addressed, by way of illustration, to generate hedging strategies with <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> when the term structure of the interest rate is driven by the Vasicek's (1977) model. ...|$|R

25|$|For a {{zero-coupon bond}} {{such as a}} US {{treasury}} bill, an annual effective discount rate may be specified instead of an effective interest rate, because <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> trade at a discount from their face value.|$|R
5000|$|One {{possible}} approach, and {{one that}} is gaining increasing attention, is the use of replicating portfolios or hedge portfolios. The theory is that we can choose a portfolio of assets (fixed interest <b>bonds,</b> <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> index-linked bonds, etc.) whose cashflows are identical to the magnitude and the timing of the cashflows to be valued.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{a regular}} bond + call {{strategy}} which only allocates the remaining dollar amount {{on top of}} the bond value (say the bond to pay 100 is worth 80, the remaining cash value is 20), the CPPI leverages the cash amount.

50|$|A Zero {{coupon swap}} (ZCS) is a {{derivative}} contract made between two parties with terms defining two 'legs' upon which each party either makes or receives payments. One leg {{is the traditional}} fixed leg, whose cashflows are determined at the outset, usually defined by an agreed fixed rate of interest. A second leg is the traditional floating leg, whose payments at the outset are forecast but subject to change and dependent upon future publication of the interest rate index upon which the leg is benchmarked. This is same description as with the more common interest rate swap (IRS). A ZCS differs from an IRS in one major respect; timings of scheduled payments. A ZCS {{takes its name from}} a <b>zero</b> <b>coupon</b> <b>bond</b> which has no interim coupon payments and only a single payment at maturity. A ZCS, unlike an IRS, also only has a single payment date on each leg at the maturity of the trade. The calculation methodology for determing payments is, as a result, slightly more complicated than for IRSs.|$|E
