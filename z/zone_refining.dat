25|$|Leaching {{powdered}} 96–97% pure silicon {{with water}} results in ~98.5% pure silicon, {{which is used}} in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of silicone production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated fractional distillation, followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure zinc metal as the reeducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by <b>zone</b> <b>refining.</b> Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane. Another process used is the reduction of sodium hexafluorosilicate, a common waste product of the phosphate fertiliser industry, by metallic sodium: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material: transistor production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 1010, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 1012 are needed and attained.|$|E

5000|$|Zone melting (or <b>zone</b> <b>refining</b> or {{floating}} zone {{process or}} travelling melting zone) {{is a group}} of similar methods of purifying crystals, in which a narrow region of a crystal is melted, and this molten zone is moved along the crystal. The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it as it moves through the ingot. The impurities concentrate in the melt, and are moved to one end of the ingot. <b>Zone</b> <b>refining</b> was invented by John Desmond Bernal and further developed by William Gardner Pfann in Bell Labs as a method to prepare high purity materials, mainly semiconductors, for manufacturing transistors. Its early use was on germanium for this purpose, but it can be extended to virtually any solute-solvent system having an appreciable concentration difference between solid and liquid phases at equilibrium.

40|$|In TMP-refining processes, the {{stabilization}} of the fiber pad inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> requires a new control approach. Specific energy control {{tends to be}} complex and most often affected {{by a number of}} disturbances not so well specified in traditional MPC-concepts. To describe the dynamics in such nonlinear processes is difficult, tedious and requires significant maintenance support. This paper focuses on two important issues related to modeling in mechanical pulping processes: measurements of internal states inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> and in particular natural decoupling to find a model suitable for future process optimization and improved control concepts of complete refiner lines. The idea is to show how this complex process, with serially linked refiners or <b>refining</b> <b>zones,</b> can be modeled and controlled using a simplified process description. In this series of papers, data from a commercial Twin-refiner and a CD-refiner are available as inputs. As an example of internal state measurements, <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature profiles and estimated distributed consistency in the <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> are used. We show that the characteristics of the temperature profile dynamics makes it possible to introduce a decoupling scheme where the anti-diagonal elements in the transfer function matrix describing the process can be eliminated naturally, independent of which refiner is to be controlled...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} used a system {{identification}} ARMAX modeling approach to analyze how the pulp properties can be predicted {{from the traditional}} input variables such as hydraulic pressures and dilution water feed rates at stable production. As a complement internal states from the <b>refining</b> <b>zones</b> are used as inputs in a commercial production line comprising two serially linked Twin refiners. It is shown that neither the hydraulic pressures and dilution water feed rates nor the motor loads from primary and secondary refiners are sufficient as inputs to the ARMAX model to describe the dynamics in the pulp properties. Instead, the temperature profile measurements from the <b>refining</b> <b>zones</b> outperform these traditional inputs and capture the major dynamics in the pulp property studied. It is also shown that the process should be controlled {{in a way that}} reduces as much variations inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zones</b> as possible. It is not only necessary to include the maximum temperatures in the <b>refining</b> <b>zones</b> as internal states when estimating pulp properties but also the periphery temperature since temperature profiles are affected differently depending on whether the changes are made in the hydraulic pressure, production or the dilution water feed rates. From a control perspective, <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> temperature control is preferable to any concepts based on specific energy for minimization of pulp quality variations...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been carried out with the goal of {{improving}} pulp quality control in TMP refining processes without a deeper understanding about the physical conditions inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> The <b>refiner</b> is thereby considered as a black box where the chips are defibrated to fibers. In this paper, a non-linear model for the estimation of thermodynamic and defibration/fibrillation work is presented.

This is a consequence of variations in the concentration of the fiber pad built up inside the <b>refining</b> <b>zone.</b> Moreover, it is shown that the commonly used control concept, where the traditional specific energy is used as a control variable should be reconsidered.

50|$|An {{important}} feature of the induction heating process is that the heat is generated inside the object itself, instead of by an external heat source via heat conduction.

Since most impurities tend to remain in the molten region rather than re-solidify, when the process is complete, most of the impurities in the rod will have been moved into the end that was the last to be melted.

40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that plate gaps are {{sometimes}} unequal in two-zoned low consistency refiners and that unequal gaps render unevenly refined pulp. It is also known that optimisation of plate gap in low consistency refining leads to improved energy efficiency. In this work, trials were made in mill scale in a modern TMP line equipped with a prototype 72 inch TwinFlo low consistency refiner in second stage. The study was designed to investigate the development of pulp properties from different rotor positions by means of altering the outlet flow rate ratio. The specific energy consumption was calculated for each <b>refining</b> <b>zone</b> and setting, based on flow rate and temperature increase.
