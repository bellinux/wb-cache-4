We report {{here for the}} first time an in vitro therapeutic effect of nanocomposites based on para-aminosalicylic acid with <b>zinc</b> layered <b>hydroxide</b> (PAS-ZLH) and zinc-aluminum layered double hydroxides (PAS-Zn/Al LDH), against mycobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria.

The intercalation of CA with a nanocarrier, <b>zinc</b> layered <b>hydroxide,</b> produces cinnamate-zinc layered hydroxide (ZCA), {{which has been}} previously characterized. Intercalation is expected to improve the solubility and cell specificity of CA. The nanocarrier will also protect CA from degradation and sustain its release. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of intercalation on the anti-inflammatory capacity of CA. Methods: In this study, the anti-inflammatory activity of ZCA was investigated and compared with that of nonintercalated CA. Evaluations were based on the capacity of ZCA and CA to modulate the release of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2, interleukin (IL) - 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL- 1 β, and IL- 10 in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264. 7 cells. Additionally, the expression of proinflammatory enzymes, ie, cyclooxygenase- 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), were examined. Results: Although both ZCA and CA downregulated nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL- 1 ß, and IL- 6, ZCA clearly displayed better activity. Similarly, expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were inhibited in samples treated with ZCA and CA. The two compounds effectively inactivated the transcription factor NF-κB, but the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10, was significantly upregulated by ZCA only. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that ZCA possesses better anti-inflammatory potential than CA, while <b>zinc</b> layered <b>hydroxide</b> had little or no effect, and these results were comparable with the positive control.

The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. [...] The compounds formed are, respectively, copper(II) carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them.
