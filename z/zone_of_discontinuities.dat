40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} metal joining process. The {{discontinuities}} and anomalies encountered {{in this type of}} welded joint differ from those of a conventional fusion weld. The discontinuities present in FSW are oriented in a different direction due to the unique formation process involved and are dispersed over the welded region widthwise as well as thicknesswise. The process of detection, evaluation, and characterization of these discontinuities is a challenging aspect, as no specific area is identified as a probable <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> In this study, typical discontinuities that are encountered during the FSW process were intentionally induced and then subjected to different types of nondestructive investigation. The methods and techniques adopted were liquid penetrant testing, radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, and eddy current testing. The interaction of these discontinuities and study of their response to different nondestructive testing (NDT) methods/techniques are presented in this paper. The eddy current technique appears to be most effective and simple NDT tool for identifying most of the discontinuities. However, a combination with other methods such as radiography is helpful in characterizing these discontinuities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} basis <b>of</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> in {{the living}} human eye lens has not been elucidated, {{and there is no}} conclusive explanation for what relevance they may have to the structure and function of the lens. Newly developed synchrotron radiation based X-ray Talbot interferometry has enabled the detection of subtle fluctuations in the human eye lens which, when used in mathematical modelling to simulate reflected and scattered light, can recreate the image of the lens seen {{in the living}} human eye. The results of this study show that the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> may be caused by subtle fluctuations in the refractive index gradient as well as from random scattering in the central regions. As the refractive index contours are created by cell layers with progressively varying protein concentrations, the zones are linked to growth and will contain information about ageing and development. The index gradient is important for image quality and fluctuations in this gradient may add to quality optimisation and serve as models for designs of new generation implant lenses...|$|R

40|$|The lens growth {{through life}} is the net result of surface {{accretion}} partially offset by central compaction. Compaction has previously been shown to affect the cortex. The present study examines compaction in the nucleus by measuring the change in dimensions of congenital lamellar cataract with time and by comparing the different dimensions of dominantly inherited lamellar cataract in individuals of different ages in the same family. It is now shown that compaction affects the nucleus at a decreasing rate with increasing age and {{that the rate of}} compaction of lamellar cataracts is faster the greater diameter of the affected lamella. It is concluded that compaction of lens fibres towards the centre of the lens affects all regions of the cortex and nucleus in youth and that the compaction becomes largely or completely confined to the cortex in middle age and beyond. The shape of the lamellar cataract changes from a lenticular shape in youth to a rounded shape with increasing age. This accounts {{for the development of the}} peripheral divergence <b>of</b> the <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> <b>of</b> the cortex, which allows the lens to remain emmetropic with increasing age in spite of changes in surface curvature...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{technique is}} presented {{for the analysis}} of nonsteady flowfields generated by accelerating flames in gaseous media. The problem is formulated in Eulerian coordinates and the solution is based on the extension of the floating shock-fitting technique to all the discontinuities and their interactions occurring in the flowfield. Besides shock waves, the discontinuities taken into account thus far consist of contact surfaces, deflagration, and detonation fronts. The governing partial differential equations are integrated by the use of an explicit second-order accurate, finite-difference scheme, while special algorithms are introduced for the treatment of segments of the flowfield where the influence <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuities</b> overlap. Actual interactions between them are treated by the polar intersection method. The technique is applied to the case of a steady flame experiencing an abrupt increase in burning speed, leading either to the establishment of a new steady flame flow system or to further acceleration culminated by the transition to detonation. A demarcation line between the two regimes of solutions, depending on the value of the initial burning speed and the magnitude of its abrupt increase, is established, and the physical validity of this criterion is corroborated by experimental evidence...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the scattering coefficient (as defined in the appendix) at a wavelength of 647 · 1 nm along the visual axis of human eye lenses was investigated using a specially designed set-up for spatially resolved measurements of {{the intensity of the}} scattered light. For the same lenses, the {{distribution of}} the protein content was measured using confocal Raman microspectroscopy. Data collected by both methods were processed in terms of a recently developed theory of short-range, liquid-like order of crystallin proteins that accounts for eye lens transparency. Seven fresh intact human lenses of varying age have been investigated. In addition, elastic and Raman scattering measurements have been performed on fixed lenses. The main results and conclusions are: (1) Fixation significantly affects the light scattering properties of the eye lens. The average level of scattering increases and a change in the distribution of scattered light intensity along the visual axis occurs. Protein content and average distribution were not altered by fixation. (2) There are significant differences between the {{distribution of the}} scattering coefficient for lenses of different ages. For young lenses (18 and 20 years) regions with a low protein content (anterior and posterior cortex) show a higher level of elastic light scattering, while for older lenses (42 - 78 years old) there is no obvious correlation between the scattering level and protein content. (3) Changes in the level of light scattering along the visual axis of the lens cannot be explained by protein concentration effects. Therefore, these changes must be caused by changes in the supramolecular organization of lens proteins in the fibre cytoplasm. (4) The observed changes in light scattering {{may be related to the}} <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> as observed in slitlamp and Scheimpflug photography of human lenses...|$|R

40|$|The {{available}} {{experimental data}} and steady-state calculations {{make it difficult}} to explain the M discontinuity beneath both oceans and continents {{on the basis of the}} same phase change. The oceanic M discontinuity may be a chemical discontinuity between basalt and peridotite, and a similar chemical discontinuity may thus be expected beneath the continents. Since available experimental data place the basalt-eclogite phase change at about the same depth as the continental M discontinuity, intersections may exist between a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> chemical <b>discontinuity</b> and a phase transition zone, the transition being either basalt-eclogite or feldspathic peridotite-garnet peridotite.

The M discontinuity could therefore represent the basalt-eclogite phase change in some localities (e. g. mountain belts) and the chemical discontinuity in others (e. g. oceans and continental shields). Variations in the depth to the chemical discontinuity and in the positions of geoisotherms produce great flexibility in orogenetic models.

Coarse-grained shoreface quartz arenite and lagoonal dolomicrite of the lowstand systems tracts display the following fea-tures characteristic of forced regression: (1) they contain coarse-grained proximal shoreline deposits that overlie an erosional surface (sequence-bounding unconformity) cut into fine-grained distal-marine carbonate facies; (2) they lie seaward <b>of</b> a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> sediment bypass, and are spatially detached and {{separated from the}} previous highstand shoreface; (3) they are confined geographically to a relatively narrow zone less than 30 km wide; (4) they are onlapped and overlain by transgressive systems tract deposits consisting of deep subtidal carbon-ates (West Range Limestone); and (5) landward of the lowstand shore-line pinch-out, the sequence-bounding unconformity beneath them merges with a transgressive surface of erosion above them.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{integrated}} stratigraphic, structural, geophysical, and geochemical study reveal the presence <b>of</b> a crustal <b>discontinuity</b> in western Sicily that, at present, runs roughly N-S along a band from San Vito Lo Capo to Sciacca. The boundary between the two <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> this <b>discontinuity</b> is nearly orthogonal to the main thrust propagation of the Sicilian thrust-and-fold belt. The different Permian to Tertiary sedimentary evolution recorded by the two zones appears related to this discontinuity, with thick carbonate platforms in the western sector facing deepwater successions in the eastern one. The presence of Upper Triassic reefs, huge megabreccia bodies, and widespread submarine volcanisms along the transition zone suggests {{the presence of a}} long-lasting weakness zone. This zone has been reactivated episodically as transpressional and/or transtensional faults in relation to the different geodynamic stress acting in central Mediterranean area in different epochs. We speculate that this transition zone has represented a segment of the passive margin of the Ionian Tethys. During the Maghrebian convergence a different style of deformation has affected the two sectors floored by different sedimentary multilayers. The orthogonal-to-oblique differential convergence between the two sectors has resulted in right-lateral transpressional motions, leading to oblique thrusting of deepwater-derived thrusts onto platform-derived thrusts associated with clockwise rotations. The oblique convergence is still ongoing as demonstrated by the seismicity of the area, by the geothermal field with high mantle-derived helium fluxes and by the GPS measurements collected by different authors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Eastern Mediterranean {{region is}} one of the {{interested}} regions from both tectonic and seismic point of views. It shows an active geologic structure attributed to the tectonic movement of the African and Eurasian plates from one side and the Arabian plate from other side. This tectonic setting is attributed with continuous seismological activity, which affects almost all the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean including Egypt. Crustal deformation as deduced from both European and Egyptian permanent GPS networks provides significant horizontal deformation velocities along this region. GPS crustal deformation parameters were able to reveal the complication of the deformation of the studied region. Spatial gravity map of the selected region indicates important mass discontinuities zones correlated well with the seismological and deformation activities. Temporal gravity variation as computed from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) of the considered region were able to determine important mass redistribution zones and shed more light on its geodynamics pattern. Results show important <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> mass <b>discontinuity</b> in this region correlated with the seismological activities and temporal gravity variations agree with the crustal deformation obtained from GPS observations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of lithological heterogeneities, structural discontinuities and discontinuity surface mineralisation upon groundwater migration within the Chalk and the Upper Greensand of southern England has been investigated. Lithological heterogeneities in the Chalk succession include marl seams, hardgrounds, tabular flints and nodular flints. Each of these heterogeneities {{has a lower}} intrinsic porosity and permeability than in the calcite rich chalk. The influence {{that each of these}} heterogeneities exerts upon groundwater flow is assessed in relation to the porosity and permeability of the Chalk. Clay minerals, iron oxide and dendrites of manganese hydroxide are forms <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> surface mineralisation. The paragenesis of these deposits is predominately from superficial deposits resting on the Chalk. The presence of mineralisation reduces the porosity and permeability <b>of</b> <b>discontinuity</b> surfaces. Mineralisation reduces the exchange between water in discontinuities with that in the matrix. In the matrix, parallel to the <b>discontinuity</b> surface, a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> enhanced porosity occurs, formed by the dissolution of the Chalk matrix. Parallel to this zone is a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> reduced porosity which has been formed by the precipitation of calcite as overgrowths upon the matrix. Mineralised discontinuity surfaces provide routes for rapid migration of groundwater in both the saturated and unsaturated zones. There is no discernible relationship between the physical properties <b>of</b> <b>discontinuities</b> (i. e. orientation, dip, dip direction) and the occurrence of mineralisation. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>discontinuities</b> within the Chalk is not uniform. Clusters <b>of</b> similarly orientated <b>discontinuities</b> occur separated by less disturbed material, which causes the Chalk act as an anisotropic aquifer. Solution formed cavities have been observed at the point <b>of</b> intersection between <b>discontinuities,</b> or at the intersection <b>of</b> <b>discontinuities</b> with lithological heterogeneities. The cavities extend laterally along the line of intersection. These cavities allow rapid migration of groundwater within the saturated zone. Inclined solution cavities are formed where the discontinuities have differing orientations or where the lithological heterogeneities are dipping. Such cavities provide preferential routes of groundwater recharge through the unsaturated zone. The Chalk is a less effective aquifer at depth due to the decreased occurrence <b>of</b> solution enhanced <b>discontinuities.</b> The Chalk and Upper Greensand aquifers are not in hydraulic continuity in locations where the basal unit of the Lower Chalk, the Glauconitic Marl is present...|$|R
40|$|Cohesive zone models (CZMs) {{are widely}} used for {{numerical}} simulation of the fracture process. Cohe-sive <b>zones</b> are surfaces <b>of</b> <b>discontinuities</b> where displacements jump.

The latter {{is in contrast to}} the traditional approach of fracture mechanics where stress analysis is separated from a description of the actual process of material failure. The common wisdom says that only cohesive strength—the maximum stress on the traction–separation curve—and the separation work—the area under the traction–separation curve—are important in setting a CZM while the shape of the traction–separation curve is subsidiary.
