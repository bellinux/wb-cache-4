25|$|Trains using CBTC locate {{themselves}} {{based on}} measuring their distance past fixed transponders installed between the rails. Trains equipped with CBTC have a transponder interrogator antenna beneath each carriage, which communicates with the fixed trackside transponders and report the trains' location to a wayside <b>Zone</b> <b>Controller</b> via radio. Then, the Controller issues Movement Authorities to the trains. This technology upgrade will allow trains {{to be operated}} at closer distances, slightly increasing capacity; will allow the MTA {{to keep track of}} trains in real time and provide more information to the public regarding train arrivals and delays; and will obviate the need for complex interlocking towers. The trains are also equipped with high-tech computers inside the cab so that the conductor could monitor the train's speed and relative location. The wayside controllers themselves are located in enclosed boxes that can withstand floods and natural disasters. The traditional block systems will remain on these lines despite the installation of CBTC.|$|E

5000|$|SmartZone {{systems are}} Motorola Type II {{systems that are}} {{networked}} together via microwave or land-line data circuits to provide multi-site wide-area communications. Many large public safety and state agencies use SmartZone systems for wide-area communications. Each individual trunked system is considered a site, or a sub-system of a Simulcast system, and {{is controlled by the}} <b>Zone</b> <b>Controller,</b> which is the master controller for all activity and is where all network links terminate. The primary types of sites are 6809 (named after the type of microprocessor used, and can be single or simulcast configurations), MTC 3600 (introduced {{to take the place of}} the 6809, and named for the speed of the control channel data stream in baud), and IntelliRepeaters (single-site only, a type of controllerless site). SmartZone allows efficient use of channels at each site by feature called [...] "Dynamic Site Assignment", or DSA. DSA's simple purpose is to determine whether a site actually needs to broadcast a call or not. In order to make this feature work subscriber radios are required to affiliate, or send in their radio identification and selected talkgroup information whenever they power-up, change channels, or change sites. A programmable [...] "timeout" [...] can be set to automatically query any given radio to determine its affiliation status on the network. These affiliations are compiled into a table which the <b>Zone</b> <b>Controller</b> maintains. When a call is requested at a site, the <b>Zone</b> <b>Controller</b> determines which site that talkgroup is registered at and routes that audio via a switch, referred to as the Ambassador Electronics Bank (AEB), to the appropriate channel at the site. SmartZone allows seamless roaming between sites that is transparent to the user. To the user, the system, when properly configured, appears as just one large system, when in fact the user is actually roaming between several different sites at different locations.|$|E

40|$|Complete mixing is hard {{to achieve}} in large bioreactors in {{wastewater}} treatment plants. This often leads to a non-uniform distribution of components such as dissolved oxygen and, hence, the process rates depend on them. Furthermore, when these components are used as input for a controller, {{the location of the}} sensor can potentially affect the control action. In this contribution, the effect of sensor location and the choice of setpoint on the controller performance were examined for a non-homogeneously mixed pilot bioreactor described by a compartmental model. The impacts on effluent quality and aeration cost were evaluated. It was shown that a dissolved oxygen controller with a fixed setpoint performs differently {{as a function of the}} location of the sensor. When placed in a poorly mixed location, the controller increases the aeration intensity to its maximum capacity leading to higher aeration costs. When placed just above the aerated <b>zone,</b> the <b>controller</b> decreases the aeration rate resulting in lower dissolved oxygen concentrations in the remainder of the system, compromising effluent quality.
