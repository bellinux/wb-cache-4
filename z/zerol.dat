Their teeth are curved, but not angled. <b>Zerol</b> bevel gears {{are designed with}} the intent of duplicating the characteristics of a straight bevel gear but they are produced using a spiral bevel cutting process.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zerol</b> {{bevel gears}} {{are very similar}} to a bevel gear only {{exception}} is the teeth are curved: the ends of each tooth are coplanar with the axis, but the middle of each tooth is swept circumferentially around the gear. <b>Zerol</b> bevel gears {{can be thought of as}} spiral bevel gears, which also have curved teeth, but with a spiral angle of zero, so the ends of the teeth align with the axis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the semilinear elliptic problem[formula]whereλis a nonnegative parameter andgis a positive, nondecreasing, convex nonlinearity. There exists a valueλ* of the parameter which is extremal {{in terms of}} existence of solution. We study the linearization of the semilinear problem at the extremal weak solution corresponding to the parameterλ=λ*. In some cases, this linearized problem has discrete and positiveH 10 -spectrum. However, we prove that there always exists a positive weak eigenfunction inL 1 (Ω) with eigenvalue zero for this linearized problem. The <b>zeroL</b> 1 -eigenvalue is coherent with the nonexistence of solutions of the semilinear problem forλ>λ*. Finally, we find all weak eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the linearization of the extremal problem whenΩis the unit ball andg(u) =euorg(u) =(1 +u) p...|$|E

40|$|Gears are an {{integral}} and necessary component in our day to day lives. They {{are present in the}} satellites we communicate with, automobiles and bicycles we travel with. Gears have been around for hundreds of years and their shapes, sizes, and uses are limitless. For the vast majority of our history gears have been understood only functionally. That is to say, the way they transmit power and the size they need to be to transmit that power have been well known for many years. It was not until recently that humans began to use mathematics and engineering to more accurately and safely design these gears. Bevel gears are widely used because of their suitability towards transferring power between nonparallel shafts at almost any angle or speed. The American Gear Manufacturing Association (AGMA) has developed standards for the design, analysis, and manufacture of bevel gears. The bending stress equation for bevel gear teeth is obtained from the Lewis bending stress equation for a beam and bending stress value derive for the spiral bevel gear, straight teeth bevel gear and <b>zerol</b> bevel gear. For above mentioned gear comparison between analytical value and value obtain by the ANSYS Workbench 14. 0...|$|E
40|$|An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{is often}} used in waste heat {{recovery}} applications. These are typically small-scale applications where cycle thermal efficiency is low, {{and the benefits of}} traditional cycle enhancements (such as reheat stages or feed-water heaters) do not typically outweigh the costs required to implement them. An ORC with flooded expansion and internal heat regeneration is an alternative enhancement that provides comparable benefits at reduced cost and complexity. The improvement in efficiency for the ORC with flooded expansion and internal regeneration is analyzed for several working fluids and for two flooding media: water and <b>Zerol</b> 60 compressor lubricant. It is shown that internal regeneration alone provides most of the efficiency enhancement for dry working fluids (R 600 a, n-Pentane, and R 245 fa). n-Pentane is shown to offer the most efficient cycle even without flooded expansion in most cases. A quantitative comparison is given between the proposed cycle and the reheat and feedwater heater cycles with internal regeneration. In applications where a hydrocarbon may not be appropriate as a working fluid, R 245 fa and R 717 show promise as alternatives. R 717, which shows the most benefit from flooded expansion and internal regeneration, requires this enhancement in order to be competitive with the dry working fluids...|$|E
