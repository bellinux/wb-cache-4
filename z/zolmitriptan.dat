50|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} {{has been}} reported when moclobemide has been taken {{in combination with other}} serotonin enhancing drugs; however, due to moclobemide's reversible MAO inhibition, serotonin syndrome is significantly less likely to occur with moclobemide than with older irreversible MAOIs. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported}} when trazodone was abruptly replaced with moclobemide. Taking at the same time or starting moclobemide too soon after discontinuing clomipramine, or other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as SSRIs may result {{in the development of a}} serotonin syndrome. SNRIs, such as venlafaxine in combination with moclobemide have also been associated with serotonin syndrome. Cimetidine, causes a doubling of the blood plasma levels of moclobemide. Blood plasma levels of trimipramine and maprotiline and possibly other tricyclic antidepressants increase when used in combination with moclobemide and may require dosage adjustments if the combination is used for treatment resistant depression. The elimination of <b>zolmitriptan</b> is reduced by moclobemide and if the combination is used, a dosage reduction of <b>zolmitriptan</b> is recommended. Moclobemide reduces the metabolism of dextromethorphan.|$|E
5000|$|Triptans are {{specific}} and selective agonists for the 5-HT1 receptors. Sumatriptan binds to 5-HT1D receptors, <b>zolmitriptan,</b> rizatriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D and eletriptan binds to 5-HT1B/1D/1F receptors. Triptans {{are believed to}} exert their effects through vasoconstriction, leading to reduced carotid arterial circulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, peripheral neuronal inhibition, or inhibition of transmission through second order neurons of the trigeminocervical complex.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zolmitriptan</b> is {{different}} from the other triptans because it is converted to an active N-desmethyl metabolite which has higher affinity for the 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors; both substances have a biological half-life of 2 to 3 hours. In studies, newer triptans are mostly compared to sumatriptan. They are better than sumatriptan for their longer half-life in plasma and higher oral bioavailability, but have a higher potential for central nervous side effects.|$|E

5000|$|All marketed triptans are {{available}} in oral form; some in form of sublingual tablets. Sumatriptan and <b>zolmitriptan</b> are also available as nasal sprays. For sumatriptan, {{a number of other}} application forms are marketed: suppositories, a subcutaneous injection, a iontophoretic transdermal patch, which uses low voltage controlled by a pre-programmed microchip to deliver a single dose of sumatriptan through the skin within 30 minutes; a drug-device combination containing sumatriptan powder that is [...] "breath powered" [...] allowing the user to blow sumatriptan powder in to their nostrils; as well as a needle-free injection system that works with air pressure.|$|E
50|$|All triptans have an indole {{structure}} {{identical to}} the neurotransmitter 5-HT. Classic triptan structure contain side chain on the indole ring, and a basic nitrogen in a similar distance from the indole structure. The main structural difference of the triptans is {{the position of the}} sulfonamide and the side chain attached to it (see figure 1 and table 1). Rizatriptan and <b>zolmitriptan</b> have instead of a sulfonamide a triazole and 2-oxazolidone respectively. Another exception to the classic structure is seen on eletriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain connected to the indole ring is replaced with a dimethyl-pyrrolidine, and in naratriptan where the nitrogen-alkyl chain is replaced with an 1-methyl-piperidine ring.|$|E
50|$|Sumatriptan was {{the pioneer}} drug in this class. The second generation's triptans such as <b>zolmitriptan,</b> naratriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, {{eletriptan}} and frovatriptan soon became available.Different triptans {{are available in}} different formulations and in different strengths (see table 2). They have been formulated as subcutaneous injections, oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal spray and as rectal suppositories. Delivery system of the triptans may {{play an important role}} in the onset of action. The selection of anti-migraine drug for patients depends on their symptoms. The first selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan, was first synthesized as a subcutaneous injection, then as an oral tablets and more recently as a nasal spray, it is also available in some countries as suppositories. The subcutaneous injection is the fastest way to stop a rapidly progressing migraine attacks. The sumatriptan nasal spray provides faster onset of action than the tablets but it produces a similar headache response at 2 hours. Some patients prefer the nasal spray as it works more rapidly than the tablets and does not have as many adverse effects as the subcutaneous injection. Nasal spray is although not suitable for all patients, because some patients experience bad taste and lack of consistency of response. <b>Zolmitriptan</b> was developed with the strategy to create a more lipophilic compound, with faster absorption and better ability to cross the blood brain barrier than sumatriptan. It is available as tablets, orally disintegrating tablets and as nasal spray in some countries. Rizatriptan is available as tablets and orally disintegrating tablets but naratriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan are only available in tablets, for now.|$|E
50|$|Triptan {{structures}} were designed from {{the structure of}} 5-HT to attain affinity to 5-HT receptors, hence the identical indole structure. The hydroxyl group (-OH) on the hexane of the indole core and the alkyl-amine side chain on position C3 on 5-HT have been replaced with other compounds, such as sulfonamides or azol-ring structured derivatives and different amine-alkyl side chains. An electro-negative group can form a hydrogen bond with Thr {{in the pocket of}} the receptor. Sulfonamide derivatives attached to the hexane ring of the indole structure have electro-negative properties, as well as the triazole and 2-oxazolidone on rizatriptan and <b>zolmitriptan</b> respectively. This can increase binding ability of the compound and the efficacy, especially with the 5-HT1D receptor.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Only {{a limited}} {{proportion}} of patients needing pharmacological control of portal hypertension are hemodynamic responders to propranolol. Here we analyzed {{the effects of}} <b>zolmitriptan</b> on portal pressure and its potential interaction with propranolol. Methods: <b>Zolmitriptan,</b> propranolol or both were tested in two rat models of portal hypertension: common bile duct ligation (CBDL) and CCl 4 -induced cirrhosis. In these animals we measured different hemodynamic parameters including portal venous pressure, arterial renal flow, portal blood flow and cardiac output. We also studied the changes in superior mesenteric artery perfusion pressure and in arterial wall cAMP levels induced by <b>zolmitriptan,</b> propranolol or both. Moreover, we determined the effect of splanchnic sympathectomy on the response of PVP to <b>zolmitriptan.</b> Results: In both models of portal hypertension <b>zolmitriptan</b> induced a dose-dependent transient descent of portal pressure accompanied by reduction of portal flow with only slight decrease in renal flow.

40|$|Migraine is {{a common}} and often {{disabling}} neurovascular disorder. Changes in the metabolism and the central processing of serotonin, as well as abnormalities in the modulation of the central and peripheral trigeminal nociceptive pathways, {{have been shown to}} play significant roles in migraine pathophysiology. Recent evidence suggests that a low serotonin state facilitates activation of the trigeminal nociceptive pathways. In addition, several pharmacological agents that modulate serotonin are used in the treatment of migraine. Specifically there are seven FDA approved, 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonists, used for the acute abortive therapy of migraine. <b>Zolmitriptan</b> is one such triptan. <b>Zolmitriptan</b> is available as a tablet, orally disintegrating tablet and as a nasal spray. It is rapidly absorbed and detectable within the plasma, within 2 to 5 minutes for the nasal spray and within 15 minutes for the tablet. <b>Zolmitriptan</b> reaches peak plasma levels in 2 â€“ 4 hours, with good levels maintained for up to 6 hours. Although the metabolism of <b>zolmitriptan</b> is predominantly hepatic, only 25 % of <b>zolmitriptan</b> is bound to plasma proteins. Thus it is unlikely for drug interactions involving the displacement of highly protein-bound drugs. <b>Zolmitriptan</b> is very well tolerated with less than half of participants in clinical trials reporting adverse events, most of which were mild and transient. Although rare, serious cardiovascular events have been reported with all triptans. However, when patients are appropriately selected, <b>zolmitriptan</b> is both, a safe and effective acute migraine abortive agent. In this article, we will first briefly review the biological role of serotonin and the literature linking serotonin to migraine pathophysiology. This will be followed by a comprehensive review of the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of <b>zolmitriptan.</b> Finally, the clinical application of the use of <b>zolmitriptan</b> in migraine therapy will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|RATIONALE: Effective neuroendocrine probes of 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 1 D {{receptor}} function {{may facilitate}} {{investigation of the}} role of these receptor subtypes in the pathophysiology of depression and the mode of action of antidepressant medication. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuroendocrine profile of the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonist, <b>zolmitriptan,</b> in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twelve subjects entered a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study of <b>zolmitriptan</b> (5 mg orally). Blood samples were taken at 15 -min intervals for assay of prolactin and growth hormone. A further six healthy men were recruited to an equivalent study to examine the effect of ketanserin (a 5 -HT receptor antagonist with some preference for 5 -HT 1 D over 5 -HT 1 B receptors) on the growth hormone response to <b>zolmitriptan.</b> RESULTS: <b>Zolmitriptan</b> significantly increased plasma growth hormone but had no effect on plasma prolactin or oral temperature. The increase in growth hormone produced by <b>zolmitriptan</b> was significantly attenuated by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the ability of triptans such as <b>zolmitriptan,</b> sumatriptan and rizatriptan to increase plasma growth hormone is mediated by their common agonist activity at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 D receptors...|$|E
40|$|This phase II study {{investigated}} the efficacy, tolerability and doseâ€“response relationship of oral <b>zolmitriptan</b> {{in the treatment of}} a single migraine attack in Japanese patients.

In this multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients received a single dose of placebo or <b>zolmitriptan</b> 1, 2. 5 or 5 mg. The primary endpoints were 2 -h headache response and the tolerability of <b>zolmitriptan.</b> A statistically significant doseâ€“response relationship was observed for the 2 -h headache response (P= 0. 003). The 2. 5 mg group had significantly greater 2 -h headache response than the placebo group (P= 0. 032). The adverse event profile was similar to that reported in western patients, and no adverse events unique to the Japanese population were observed.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>zolmitriptan</b> (Zomig, 311 C 90), a 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 HT) 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonist, in the acute oral treatment of migraine was evaluated in an extensive clinical trial program. Four randomized, placebo-controlled studies (total 2480 patients) were performed; data {{from two of}} these trials established that a 2. 5 mg dose was {{on the shoulder of}} the dose-response curve (2 -h headache response rate 64 %), showing similar efficacy to the 5 mg dose (67 %). In this program, the {{efficacy of}} <b>zolmitriptan</b> was not influenced by the pretreatment headache duration; the presence of aura preceding the headache, migraine associated with menses or migraine upon awakening; or by concomitant use of oral contraceptives or antidepressants. In addition, <b>zolmitriptan</b> 5 mg proved consistently effective in the treatment of multiple migraine attacks for up to 1 year. <b>Zolmitriptan</b> reduced the incidence of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia, reduced impairment of normal activity and demonstrated positive effects on patients' quality of life.
