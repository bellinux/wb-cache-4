5|$|Most 16O is {{synthesized}} {{at the end}} of the helium fusion {{process in}} massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process. 17O is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the CNO cycle, making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> stars. Most 18O is produced when 14N (made abundant from CNO burning) captures a 4He nucleus, making 18O common in the helium-rich <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> evolved, massive stars.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are classified}} mainly as baroclinic, because they form along <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> temperature and dewpoint gradient known as frontal zones.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a definition of}} racism inspired {{in the work of}} Frantz Fanon, Boaventura de Sousa Santos and contemporary Caribbean Fanonian Philosophers. It discusses racism in relation to <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being and <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being. Racism is discussed as a dehumanization related to the materiality of domination used by the world-system in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being (violence and dispossession) as opposed to the materiality of domination in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being (regulation and emancipation). The approach shows how intersectionality of oppressions work differently for oppressed people in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being as opposed to oppressed people in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being. While in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being oppressions are mitigated by racial privilege, in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being oppressions are aggravated by racial oppression...|$|R

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} revive the plan arose from talks between Kinkel and French foreign {{minister}} Hervé de Charette on 28 June. They proposed establishing <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> separation to enforce a ceasefire, monitoring the RSK's external borders, specific guarantees {{for the safety of}} Croatian Serbs and implementating confidence-building measures by economic cooperation between Croatia and the RSK. The initiative, however, did not gain ground when the RSK refused to negotiate.|$|E
40|$|Altogether sixty {{species of}} fusulinids are {{described}} from the Carboniferous Ichinotani Formation and the Permian Mizuyagadani Formation, Fukuji, Gifu Prefecture, Central Japan. Of them six species are new. They are Pseudostaffella minatoi, P. subrotunda, Fusulinella rhomboidalis, Triticites katoi, T. ichinotaniensis and T. elongatus. The following fusulind zones are established; <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Eostaffella, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pro-fusulinella, Lower <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Fusulinella-Fusulina, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Beedeina, Upper <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Fusulinella-Fusulina, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Triticites, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pseudoschwagerina, and <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pseudo-fusulina. As a whole fusulinids treated {{in this paper}} show similarity to those of China, Korea, and especially {{to those of the}} USSR. Lithologic sequence and fusulinid succession suggest that the fusulinid fauna in Fukuji ranges continuously from the Upper Viséan to the Sakmarian, although evidence for Namurian, Vereyan, and Upper Uralian is not at all clear...|$|R

5|$|Although extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are almost}} always classified as baroclinic since they form along <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> temperature and dewpoint gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters sufficient to warm its core, {{and as a result}} develops central convection. A particularly intense type of extratropical cyclone that strikes during winter is known colloquially as a nor'easter.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the tree}} line there are several <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> climax forest. Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of machair, a fertile dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age. Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{is heavily}} vegetated, and most islets possess three ringed <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> vegetation: an {{outermost}} herb mat, typically composed mainly of Heliotropium anomalum; an inward zone of shrub, primarily Heliotropium foertherianum; and a central forested region, typically dominated by groves of Pisonia grandis trees. Coconut palms {{have also been}} introduced and exist in substantial quantities on the larger islets. This pattern of vegetation is consistent across the larger islets, with smaller islets lacking the central forest and the smallest vegetated solely by low herbs. Other common plants include Suriana maritima and Morinda citrifolia.|$|E

5|$|Diamonds {{can also}} form under other {{naturally}} occurring high-pressure conditions. Very small diamonds of micrometer and nanometer sizes, known as microdiamonds or nanodiamonds respectively, {{have been found}} in meteorite impact craters. Such impact events create shock <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> high pressure and temperature suitable for diamond formation. Impact-type microdiamonds can be used as an indicator of ancient impact craters. Popigai crater in Russia may have the world's largest diamond deposit, estimated at trillions of carats, and formed by an asteroid impact.|$|E
