25|$|Metal fuels {{have the}} {{advantage}} of a much higher heat conductivity than oxide fuels but cannot survive equally high temperatures. Metal fuels {{have a long history of}} use, stretching from the Clementine reactor in 1946 to many test and research reactors. Metal fuels have the potential for the highest fissile atom density. Metal fuels are normally alloyed, but some metal fuels have been made with pure uranium metal. Uranium alloys that have been used include uranium aluminum, uranium zirconium, uranium silicon, uranium molybdenum, and uranium <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride.</b> Any of the aforementioned fuels can be made with plutonium and other actinides as part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Metal fuels have been used in water reactors and liquid metal fast breeder reactors, such as EBR-II.|$|E
500|$|Under his leadership, General Atomics {{developed}} TRIGA, a small reactor for {{universities and}} laboratories. TRIGA used uranium <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> (UZrH) fuel, {{which has a}} large, prompt negative fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity. As {{the temperature of the}} core increases, the reactivity rapidly decreases. It is thus highly unlikely, though not completely impossible, for a nuclear meltdown to occur. Due to its safety and reliability, which allows it to be installed in densely populated areas, and its ability to still generate high energy for brief periods, which is particularly useful for research, it became the world's most popular research reactor, and General Atomics sold 66 TRIGAs in 24 countries. The high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) was less successful, and only two HTGR power reactors were built, both in the United States. A 40 MW demonstration unit at the Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station [...] in Pennsylvania operated successfully, but a larger 300 MW unit at the Fort St. Vrain Generating Station in Colorado encountered technical problems. General Atomics also conducted research into thermonuclear energy, including means of magnetically confining plasma. Between 1962 and 1974 Creutz published six papers on the subject.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> are soluble in {{hydrofluoric}} acid or alcohol; they react violently with water, acids, oxidizers or halogenated compounds.|$|R
50|$|As a pure powder, <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> {{are used}} as {{hydrogenation}} catalysts, in powder metallurgy, and as getters in the vacuum tube industry. In vacuum system, <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> help establish a seal between a metal and ceramic. In this method, a hydride powder (particularly ZrH4) is mixed with the sealing metal; heating the mixture results in decomposition of the hydride. The evolving hydrogen cleans up the surrounding area, and the produced metal flows and forms a seal even at temperatures as low as 300 °C.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> {{describes}} an alloy made by combining zirconium and hydrogen. Hydrogen {{acts as a}} hardening agent, preventing dislocations in the zirconium atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of hydrogen and the form of its presence in the <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> (precipitated phase) controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride.</b> <b>Zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> with increased hydrogen content can be made harder and stronger than zirconium, but such <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> is also less ductile than zirconium.|$|E
5000|$|ZHPP (<b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> - {{potassium}} perchlorate) is {{a variant}} of ZPP that uses <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> instead of pure zirconium. It is significantly safer to handle than ZPP. http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6117254.html ...|$|E
50|$|Even in {{the narrow}} range of {{concentrations}} which make up <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride,</b> mixtures of hydrogen and zirconium can form {{a number of different}} structures, with very different properties. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride.</b> At room temperature, the most stable form of zirconium is the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure α-zirconium. It is a fairly soft metallic material that can dissolve only a small concentration of hydrogen, no more than 0.069 wt% at 550 °C. If <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> contains more than 0.069% hydrogen at <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride</b> making temperatures then it transforms into a body-centred cubic (BCC) structure called β-zirconium. It can dissolve considerably more hydrogen, more than 1.2% hydrogen above 900 °C.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> form upon {{interaction}} of the metal with hydrogen gas. Whereas this reaction occurs even at room temperature, homogeneous bulk hydrogenation is usually achieved by annealing at temperatures of 400-600 °C for a period between several hours and a few weeks. At room temperature, <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> quickly oxidize in air, and even in high vacuum. The formed nanometer-thin layer of oxide stops further oxygen diffusion into the material, and thus the change in composition due to oxidation can usually be neglected. However, the oxidation proceeds deeper into the bulk with increasing temperature.|$|R
50|$|Powdered <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> are {{flammable}} and can ignite and explode {{if exposed}} to heat, fire, or sparks. When heated above 300 °C, they decompose releasing hydrogen gas, {{which is also}} flammable.|$|R
50|$|Also, 5-20% of {{hydrogen}} diffuses into the zirconium alloy cladding forming <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides.</b> The hydrogen production process also mechanically weakens the rods cladding because the hydrides have lower ductility and density than zirconium or its alloys, and thus blisters and cracks form upon hydrogen accumulation. This process {{is also known}} as hydrogen embrittlement.|$|R

The computed spectroscopic IR and NMR signatures are fully consistent with experimental observations...|$|R
50|$|The {{water cooling}} of reactor {{zirconium}} alloys elevates requirement for their resistance to oxidation-related nodular corrosion. Furthermore, oxidative reaction of zirconium with water releases hydrogen gas, which partly diffuses into the alloy and forms <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides.</b> The hydrides are less dense and are weaker mechanically than the alloy; their formation results in blistering and cracking of the cladding - a {{phenomenon known as}} hydrogen embrittlement.|$|R
50|$|In regular operation, most {{hydrogen}} is safely neutralized in the reactor systems; however, {{a fraction of}} 5-20% diffuses into the Zircaloy rods forming <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides.</b> This process mechanically weakens the rods because the hydrides have lower hardness and ductility than metal. Only a few percent of hydrogen can dissolve in zirconium. Excess hydrogen forms voids that weaken Zircalloy. Among Zircaloys, Zircaloy-4 is the least susceptible to hydrogen blistering.|$|R

50|$|When {{zirconium}} hydrides {{with less}} than 0.7% hydrogen, known as hypoeutectoid <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydride,</b> are cooled from the β phase the mixture attempts to revert to the α phase, resulting in an excess of hydrogen.|$|E

The presence of <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> within the Zr-Nb alloys is shown to affect the AE behaviour.

50|$|The {{development}} of <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> obviously preceded that of hydrozirconation. The first such hydride, Cp2ZrH2, {{was developed in}} 1966 by M.G.H. Wallbridge in a reaction of (Cp)2Zr(BH4)2 with triethylamine in benzene as an uneventful insoluble solid. In 1970 H. Weigold and P.C. Wailes prepared the hydrochloride from the dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) and Lithium aluminium hydride (or the related LiAlH(t-BuO)3). They went on to investigate the reaction of these novel hydrides with carboxylic acids (for example to compounds like CpZr(OCOR)3) and in 1971 then arrived at their reactions with alkynes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> are odorless, {{dark gray}} to black {{metallic}} powders.They behave as usual metals {{in terms of}} electrical conductivity and magnetic properties (paramagnetic, unless contaminated with ferromagnetic impurities). Their structure and composition is stable at ambient conditions. Similar to other metal hydrides, different crystalline phases of <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> are conventionally labeled with Greek letters, and α is reserved for the metal. The known ZrHx phases are γ (x = 1), δ (x = 1.5-1.65) and ε (x = 1.75-2). Fractional x values often correspond to mixtures, so the compositions with x = 0.8-1.5 usually contain a mixture of α, γ and δ phases, and δ and ε phases coexist for x = 1.65-1.75. As a function of increasing x, the transition between δ-Zr and ε-Zr is observed as a gradual distortion of the face-centered cubic δ (fluorite-type) to face-centered tetragonal ε lattice. This distortion {{is accompanied by a}} rapid decrease in Vickers hardness, which is constant at 260 HV for x < 1.6, linearly decreases to 160 HV for 1.6 < x < 1.75 and stabilizes at about 160 HV for 1.75 < x < 2.0. This hardness decrease is accompanied by the decrease in magnetic susceptibility. The mass density behaves differently with the increasing hydrogen content: it decreases linearly from 6.52 to 5.66 g/cm3 for x = 0-1.6 and changes little for x = 1.6-2.0.|$|R

40|$|Zirconium alloys, {{widely used}} in the nuclear industry, Fig 1, have a strong {{affinity}} for hydrogen that leads to hydrogen pick up during a corrosion reaction when exposed to water. The hydrogen is readily in solution at higher temperature but precipitates as <b>Zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> at ambient temperatures. At least three phases are presumed to exist at ambient temperature depending on hydrogen concentration and quenching rate. However, some controversy exist regarding the exact nature, exact structure and stability of the γ-ZrH phase, which {{is closely related to}} the δ-ZrH phase through ordering of the hydrogen on tetrahedral sites on alternating 110 planes...|$|R
40|$|The misfit {{strains of}} both the isotopic forms of <b>{{zirconium}}</b> <b>hydrides,</b> viz., δ-ZrHx and δ-ZrDx, precipitated in zirconium were computed in the temperature range of 298 – 773 K and for 1. 5 ≤ x ≤ 1. 7, using the methodology proposed by Carpenter. Misfit strains along (0 0 0 1) plane and normal to it were observed to increase with increase in temperature for both the isotopic forms of hydrides. For a given isotopic atomic fraction, the misfit strains for deuteride were smaller than the corresponding values for hydride and with increase in atomic fraction of hydrogen isotopes, the misfit strains increased...|$|R
40|$|Zirconium alloys {{are very}} {{suitable}} as fuel claddings and structural components in nuclear reactors {{due to their}} low cross section for ab- sorption of thermal neutrons and high resistance to corrosion and irra- diation damage. Zirconium alloys are however susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Precipitation of <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> is attributed to the embrittlement effect in zirconium alloys. In this project ab-initio simulations of Zr and the three different <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> -ZrH, -ZrH 1 : 5 and -ZrH 2 are performed to calculate structural, elastic and thermal properties of these different compounds. The goal with the project was to calculate the equilibrium structures of the H-Zr system using ab-initio methods. The results from the calculations of thermal and mechanical properties {{were found to be}} in good agreement with previous results and experiments where these were available. Calcula- tions of the phonon band structure for the different hydrides show that the band structure of the hydrides has two characteristic bands, one corresponding to vibrations in the zirconium sublattice and one cor- responding to vibrations in the hydrogen sublattice. The calculated heat capacity of the different compounds was found to be described very well by the Einstein model for the heat capacity of a solid. By calculating the free energy of formation for the different compounds it was found that at high hydrogen concentrations -hydride is the equi- librium structure. At intermediate hydrogen levels the equilibrium structure can't be determined...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we report {{the results of}} an ab initio study of the transgranular {{fracture}} toughness and cleavage of brittle <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides.</b> We use the Griffith–Irwin relation to assess the fracture toughness using calculated surface energy and estimated isotropic Voigt–Reuss–Hill averages of the elastic constants. The calculated fracture toughness values are found to concur well with experimental data, which implies that fracture is dominated by cleavage failure. To investigate the cleavage energetics, we model the decohesion process. To describe the interplanar interaction we adopt Rose's universal binding energy relation, which is found to reproduce the behaviour accurately. The modelling shows that the work of fracture and ductility decreases with increasing hydrogen content...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{structure}} and properties of <b>zirconium</b> <b>hydrides</b> is important for understanding the embrittlement of zirconium alloys used as cladding in light water nuclear reactors.

We have generated six special quasirandom structure cells based on face centered cubic and face centered tetragonal unit cells to describe ZrH 2 -x (x = 0. 25 - 0. 5).
