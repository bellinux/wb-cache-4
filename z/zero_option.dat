500|$|On November 25, 1983, Soviet leader Yuri Andropov {{announced}} {{the resumption of}} nuclear missile deployment in the western U.S.S.R., {{a sign of the}} increased tension in the relationship. The thaw in relations can be taken to begin with Ronald Reagan's January 16, 1984 speech declaring that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had [...] "common interests and the foremost among them is to avoid war and reduce the level of arms" [...] in which he added that [...] "I support a <b>zero</b> <b>option</b> for all nuclear arms." [...] While the speech was commonly seen as propaganda, Lawrence S. Wittner, professor of History at the State University of New York - Albany says of it that [...] "a number of officials--including its writer, Jack Matlock Jr.--have contended that {{it was meant to be}} taken seriously by Soviet leaders."

5000|$|On 18 November 1981, {{shortly before}} the {{beginning}} of formal talks, Reagan made the <b>Zero</b> <b>Option</b> proposal (or the [...] "zero-zero" [...] proposal). The plan called for a hold on US deployment of GLCM and Pershing II systems, reciprocated by Soviet elimination of its SS-4, SS-5, and SS-20 missiles. There appeared to be little chance of the <b>Zero</b> <b>Option</b> being adopted, but the gesture was well received in the European public. In February 1982, US negotiators put forth a draft treaty containing the <b>Zero</b> <b>Option</b> and a global prohibition on intermediate- and short-range missiles, with compliance ensured via a stringent, though unspecific, verification program.|$|E

3000|$|... [...]. In this paper, we generalize these {{rectangular}} matrices {{to accommodate}} the important case where a given region has <b>zero</b> <b>options</b> - rather than one or more than one - for producing {{the product of a}} particular sector, that is, it is not equipped to produce that output at all. In this case, there is no information for creating a column for this sector, and we will see that a column is not needed. The region may, however, require the use of the output in question, which then it must import; if it does not use the product either, the demand quantified in the row of intermediate inputs is legitimately and unproblematically zero. That is, whether or not the product is used in the region, the row for this sector need not be suppressed. The rectangularity of the regional matrices {{comes from the fact that}} each one has exactly n rows but may have a smaller or larger number of columns. The number of columns is reduced by each sector that does not produce in that region and increased for each sector that has more than one technology option. Note that even if the rectangular matrix happens to be square (i.e., with the same number of rows and columns), this does not assure a one-to-one relationship between rows and columns as in the standard A matrix. It may mean, for example, that one sector is not present in this economy, but another sector has two technological options.|$|R
