The inorganic basecoats are made of <b>zinc</b> <b>flakes</b> and protect parts with very thin - usually between 8-12 µm. The less noble zinc scarifies itself, and this is called cathodic protection. Due to this phenomenon the more noble steel is protected from for many parts and components, specially designed for fasteners in the automotive-, wind-, electrical-, construction- and aviation industry.|$|R

The dielectric constant in the parallel direction was obviously higher than that of the perpendicular direction. And the anisotropic intensity of interfacial polarization is proposed to interpret the anisotropic dielectric constant. Also, an equivalent circuit model of two parallel RC circuits in series, based on the analysis of impedance data, is employed to further discuss the anisotropic dielectric behavior...|$|R

40|$|The {{conversion}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) into value-added chemicals and fuels, preferably using renewable energy and earth-abundant materials, is considered a key priority for future energy research. In this work, a bias-free reactor device for the solar-driven {{conversion of}} CO 2 to synthesis gas (syngas) has been developed. The integrated fluidic device consists of a cathode made of copper foam coated with low-cost nanosized <b>zinc</b> <b>flakes</b> as catalyst to perform the CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to syngas, an adapted silicon heterojunction solar cell structure as photoanode with nickel foam as catalyst to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and a bipolar membrane separating the respective catholyte and anolyte compartments. The membrane allows for {{the operation of the}} catholyte and anolyte at different pH values. Stable and tunable hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide (H 2 :CO) ratios between 5 and 0. 5 along with high CO Faradaic efficiencies of up to 85 % and CO current densities of 39. 4 mA cm- 2 have been demonstrated. Under photoelectrolysis conditions, the photovoltage of the photoanode was varied between 0. 6 V and 2. 4 V by connecting up to four heterojunction solar cells in series, and thus reducing the overall cell voltage solely by solar energy utilization. Bias-free operation of the integrated device has been achieved under ambient conditions with active areas for CO 2 RR and OER, respectively, of 10 cm 2. An operation current density of 5. 0 mA cm- 2 was measured under 100 mW cm- 2 illumination of the complete device, which corresponds to a solar-to-syngas conversion efficiency of 4. 3 %.

40|$|Comparative {{tests have}} been {{performed}} to evaluate the corrosion-prevention capabilities of an experimental paint of the type described in Water-Borne, Silicone-Based, Primerless Paints, NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 26, No. 11 (November 2002), page 30. To recapitulate: these paints contain relatively small amounts of volatile organic solvents and were developed as substitutes for traditional anticorrosion paints that contain large amounts of such solvents. An additional desirable feature of these paints {{is that they can}} be applied without need for prior application of primers to ensure adhesion. The test specimens included panels of cold-rolled steel, stainless steel 316, and aluminum 2024 -T 3. Some panels of each of these alloys were left bare and some were coated with the experimental water-borne, silicone-based, primerless paint. In addition, some panels of aluminum 2024 -T 3 and some panels of a fourth alloy (stainless steel 304) were coated with a commercial solvent-borne paint containing aluminum and <b>zinc</b> <b>flakes</b> in a nitrile rubber matrix. In the tests, the specimens were immersed in an aerated 3. 5 -weight-percent aqueous solution of NaCl for 168 hours. At intervals of 24 hours, the specimens were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and measurements of corrosion potentials. The specimens were also observed visually. As indicated by photographs of specimens taken after the 168 -hour immersion (see figure), the experimental primerless silicone paint was effective in preventing corrosion of stainless steel 316, but failed to protect aluminum 2024 -T 3 and cold-rolled steel. The degree of failure was greater {{in the case of the}} cold-rolled steel. On the basis of visual observations, EIS, and corrosion- potential measurements, it was concluded that the commercial aluminum and zinc-filled nitrile rubber coating affords superior corrosion protection to aluminum 2024 -T 3 and is somewhat less effective in protecting stainless steel 304...|$|R

50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> {{coatings}} are non-electrolytically applied coatings, {{which provide}} good protection against corrosion. These coatings {{consist of a}} mixture of zinc and aluminium flakes, which are bonded together by an inorganic matrix.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, a new {{coating system}} was {{developed}} in the United States: <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coating (patent number 1376067). By virtue of a thin coat thickness of typically 8-12 µm this system produced a high level of protection against corrosion and made it possible to avoid hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{material}} for the <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings gets supplied in liquid form {{and needs to be}} prepared to the desired conditions before application.

50|$|Cr(VI)-free {{coatings}} {{are more}} environmentally friendly than surfaces with a Cr(VI) content. No <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings {{used in the}} automotive industry nowadays contain this substance.Various manufactures, such as car companies and their suppliers, have produced their own specifications and supply rules in order to define the requirements for these coating systems.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, the use {{of these}} coating systems spread, e.g. within the {{automotive}} industry. This industry needs coating systems offering a high level of corrosion resistance. As <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings do not create any hydrogen in the process, they were used for critical applications as an alternative to electroplating.|$|E
50|$|The Dörken MKS-Systeme GmbH & Co. KG {{was founded}} in 1980 in Herdecke. The start was with the {{production}} and distribution of a micro-layer corrosion protection system for a high-performance but heavy metal-free surface protection, from the beginning without the carcinogenic Chromium VI. Originally, small parts were coated with <b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coating and organic topcoats.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to paints where {{the risk of}} sub-surface corrosion creep exists, this phenomenon is avoided through the sacrificial effect of the zinc. In salt spray test&shy;s <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings demonstrate better protection against corrosion than a typical galvanic zinc coating, which in the tests (generally run in accordance with ISO 9227) often achieve only 96 to 200 hours.|$|E
50|$|The coated parts have to {{be cured}} inside an oven at a {{controlled}} temperature for a set period. This temperature/time configuration {{is dependent on the}} coating material and the product manufacturer, as each manufacturer of <b>zinc</b> <b>flake</b> products has its patented formula. Typical curing temperatures are 200 °C, 240 °C and 320 °C. After the curing, a uniform, thin, firmly bonded and dry layer is produced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> {{coatings}} {{are used}} as cathodic protective layers against corrosion {{all over the world}} in the automotive and construction industries. Combined with cured, thin, organic or inorganic coatings, these can also provide colour (black, silver, green, blue, etc.), chemical resistance, low electrical conductivity (due to the influence of the organic layer) and assembly properties. If required, re-lubrication or a thread lock (patch) is also possible.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of wind {{turbines}} these coatings are frequently used for threaded fastening elements. Good systems are certified by, among others, the GL Group with the certificate “Germanischer Lloyd”. <b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> coatings are particularly well suited to high-strength bolts (strength category 10.9 and above), high-strength nuts (strength category 10 and above) and structural parts with tensile strength of > 1000 N/mm2 or > 320 HV because hydrogen embrittlement is avoided.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>flake</b> {{coatings}} containing Cr(VI) (hexavalent chromium): surfaces containing Cr(VI) provide greater anti-corrosion protection with a thinner coating, but Cr(VI) is carcinogenic and poses {{a potential}} {{risk to the}} environment. New European decrees prohibit the use of surfaces containing Cr(VI). These include the Vehicle End-of-Life Directive EC 2000/53 as of 1 July 2007 and directive EC 2002/95 on {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (the RoHS Directive). For applications outside of the automotive and electrical industries these coatings are still valid.|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS), d. c. conductivity {{measurements and}} the scanning vibrating electrode technique (SVET) {{are used to}} study through-film electronic percolation and sacrificial protection in zinc-rich organic coatings. Two types of zinc powder, exhibiting spherical and flake particle morphologies, are dispersed in an ethanolic solution of polyvinyl butyral. The resulting dispersions are cast onto glass to produce self-supporting zinc-rich organic films. The same dispersions are cast onto an iron substrate to form strongly adherent zinc-rich organic coatings. Through-film d. c. electrica conductance is found to increase sharply near the critical percolation volume fraction of zinc; that is the lowest zinc volume fraction at which long range electronic conduction becomes possible {{as a result of}} particle-particle contact. The critical percolation volume fraction is the same for both flake and powder particles. However, at any given zinc concentration near the critical percolation volume fraction, through-film conductivity is significantly higher {{in the case of the}} <b>zinc</b> <b>flake.</b> EIS is used to measure the through-film electrical impedance of self-supporting zinc-rich films. EIS data is not readily related to electronic charge percolation arising from zinc particle-particle contact but provides additional information on through-pore electrolytic conductivity and interfacial charge transfer-diffusion phenomena.
