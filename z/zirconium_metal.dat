5|$|Zirconium is a {{by-product}} of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne, the price for unwrought <b>zirconium</b> <b>metal</b> decreased from $39,900 to $22,700 per ton. <b>Zirconium</b> <b>metal</b> is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive.|$|E
5|$|The zirconium-containing mineral zircon {{and related}} {{minerals}} (jargoon, hyacinth, jacinth, ligure) were mentioned in biblical writings. The mineral {{was not known}} to contain a new element until 1789, when Klaproth analyzed a jargoon from the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He named the new element Zirkonerde (zirconia). Humphry Davy attempted to isolate this new element in 1808 through electrolysis, but failed. <b>Zirconium</b> <b>metal</b> was first obtained in an impure form in 1824 by Berzelius by heating a mixture of potassium and potassium zirconium fluoride in an iron tube.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{internal}} components and fuel assembly cladding are made from zircaloy because it is relatively transparent to neutrons. At normal operating temperatures of approximately , zircaloy is inert. However, above 1200 degrees Celsius, <b>zirconium</b> <b>metal</b> can react exothermically with water to form free hydrogen gas. The reaction between zirconium and the coolant produces more heat, accelerating the reaction. In addition, zircaloy can react with uranium dioxide to form zirconium dioxide and uranium metal. This exothermic reaction together with the reaction of boron carbide with stainless steel can release additional heat energy, thus contributing to the overheating of a reactor.|$|E
500|$|Commercial <b>zirconium</b> <b>metal</b> {{typically}} contains 1–3% of hafnium, {{which is}} usually not problematic because the chemical properties of hafnium and zirconium are very similar. [...] Their neutron-absorbing properties differ strongly, however, necessitating the separation of hafnium from zirconium for nuclear reactors. [...] Several separation schemes are in use. [...] The liquid-liquid extraction of the thiocyanate-oxide derivatives exploits {{the fact that the}} hafnium derivative is slightly more soluble in methyl isobutyl ketone than in water. [...] This method is used mainly in United States.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{transition}} <b>metals,</b> <b>zirconium</b> forms a {{wide range}} of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes.

2500|$|After enrichment, {{the uranium}} dioxide (...) powder is fired in a high-temperature, {{sintering}} furnace to create hard, ceramic pellets of enriched uranium dioxide. The cylindrical pellets are then {{clad in a}} corrosion-resistant <b>zirconium</b> <b>metal</b> alloy Zircaloy which are backfilled with helium to aid heat conduction and detect leakages. Zircaloy is chosen because of its mechanical properties and its low absorption cross section. The finished fuel rods are grouped in fuel assemblies, called fuel bundles, that are then used to build {{the core of the}} reactor. A typical PWR has fuel assemblies of 200 to 300 rods each, and a large reactor would have about 150–250 such assemblies with 80–100 tonnes of uranium in all. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. A PWR produces on the order of 900 to 1,600MWe. PWR fuel bundles are about 4meters in length.|$|E
2500|$|The RF {{induction}} coils {{function in}} a manner similar to the primary winding in a transformer. The zirconia acts as the [...] "secondary winding" [...] of a transformer which in effect is [...] "shorted" [...] out and thus gets hot. This heating method requires the introduction of small pieces of <b>zirconium</b> <b>metal.</b> The metal is placed near the outside of the charge and is melted by the RF coils and heats the surrounding zirconia powder from the outside inwards. The cooling water-filled pipes embracing the outer surface maintain a thin [...] "skin" [...] (1–2mm) of unmelted feed, creating a self-contained apparatus. After several hours the temperature is reduced in a controlled and gradual manner, resulting in the formation of flawless columnar crystals that are typically about 5cm long by 2.5cm wide, although they may be grown much larger. Prolonged annealing at 1400°C is then carried out to remove any strain. The annealed crystals are then cut into gemstones.|$|E

40|$|Initial {{results are}} {{reported}} for the anode behavior of spent metallic nuclear fuel in an electrorefining process. The anode behavior has been characterized {{in terms of the}} initial spent fuel composition and the final composition of the residual cladding hulls. A variety of results have been obtained depending on the experimental conditions. Some of the process variables considered are average and maximum cell voltage, average and maximum anode voltage, amount of electrical charge passed (coulombs or amp-hours) during the experiment, and cell resistance. The main goal of the experiments has been the nearly complete dissolution of uranium with the retention of <b>zirconium</b> and noble <b>metal</b> fission products in the cladding hulls. Analysis has shown that the most indicative parameters for determining an endpoint to the process, recognizing the stated goal, are the maximum anode voltage and the amount of electrical charge passed. For the initial experiments reported here, the best result obtained is greater than 98 % uranium dissolution with approximately 50 % <b>zirconium</b> retention.

40|$|Recently {{beside the}} "Polished Brass" type of finish using PVD {{technology}} the grey and black colour range has become commercially {{more and more}} popular. Surface oxidation of grey or black PVD-coating are immediately connected with colour change in the visible spectrum range.

Rolled tantalum (body-centered-cubic metal) plate and clock-rolled <b>zirconium</b> (hexagonal-close-packed <b>metal)</b> plate are both investigated. The results indicate that an assumption of topography invariance with respect to strain-rate is justifiable for tantalum. However, a strong sensitivity of topography with respect to strain-rate for zirconium was observed, implying that some accounting for a deformation mechanism rate-dependence associated with lower-symmetry materials {{should be included in}} the constitutive modeling.

The radii are very similar even though the number of electrons increases from 40 to 72 and the atomic mass increases from 91.22 to 178.49 g/mol. The increase in mass and the unchanged radii lead to a steep increase in density from 6.51 to 13.35 g/cm3.|$|R

40|$|Selective {{hydrogenation}} of furfural to {{furfuryl alcohol}} {{under mild conditions}} was evaluated over Ru nanoparticles supported {{on a series of}} <b>zirconium</b> based <b>metal</b> organic frameworks (UiO- 66, UiO- 67, Zr 6 -NDC, MIL- 140 A, MIL- 140 B, and MIL- 140 C). The particle size and oxidation state of Ru in the catalysts was characterized by TEM, H 2 -TPR, and XPS. The consecutive reduction by N 2 H 4 ·H 2 O and hydrogen flow led to Ru metal nanoparticles, unless the interaction of the Ru precursor with the organic linkers was strong as found for the carboxylic acid groups in MIL- 140 C. Although the Ru nanoparticle surface was oxidized when exposed to air, the surface RuOx could be reduced under reaction conditions for Ru/UiO- 66, consistent with its high catalytic activity. This catalyst exhibited 94. 9 % yield of furfuryl alcohol and could be reused in five consecutive reaction cycles without appreciable loss in performance...|$|R
30|$|Based on many {{benefits}} of using potentiometric sensors {{such as high}} sensitivity, low cost, simplicity in use and fast response time, ion-selective electrodes found many applications in electroanalytical chemistry including the detection of hazardous pollutants such as mercury even at trace levels (Agrahari et al. 2014). Valve metals such as Ta, Zr, Hf and Ti have high resistivity to corrosion when located in acidic or basic media due to the covering of their surfaces by a thin barrier oxide film. <b>Zirconium</b> was a <b>metal</b> of great applications in the nuclear and chemical fields (Ghoneim et al. 1996, 1998).|$|R
40|$|<b>Zirconium</b> based <b>metal</b> organic {{frameworks}} (Zr-MOFs) {{have become}} popular in engineering studies {{due to their}} high mechanical stability, thermostability and chemical stability. In our work, by using a theoretical kinetic adsorption isotherm, we can exert MOFs to an acid dye adsorption process, experimentally exploring the adsorption of MOFs, their external behavior and internal mechanism. The results indicate their spontaneous and endothermic nature, and the maximum adsorption capacity of this material for acid orange 7 (AO 7) could be up to 358 mg·g− 1 at 318 K, estimated by the Langmuir isotherm model. This is ascribed {{to the presence of}} an open active metal site that significantly intensified the adsorption, by majorly increasing the interaction strength with the adsorbates. Additionally, the enhanced π delocalization and suitable pore size of UiO- 66 gave rise to the highest host–guest interaction, which further improves both the adsorption capacity and separation selectivity at low concentrations. Furthermore, the stability of UiO- 66 was actually verified for the first time, through comparing the structure of the samples before and after adsorption mainly by Powder X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetric analysis...|$|R
