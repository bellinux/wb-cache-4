5|$|Fossas are {{occasionally}} held {{in captivity}} in zoos. They first bred in captivity in 1974 in the <b>zoo</b> of Montpellier, France. The next year, {{at a time}} when there were only eight fossas in the world's zoos, the Duisburg <b>Zoo</b> in Germany acquired one; this <b>zoo</b> later started a successful breeding program, and most <b>zoo</b> fossas now descend from the Duisburg population. Research on the Duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton <b>Zoo,</b> Auckland <b>Zoo</b> and Wellington <b>Zoo</b> also breed tuatara {{for release}} into the wild. At Auckland <b>Zoo</b> in the 1990s it was {{discovered}} that the temperature at which the eggs are incubated determines the sex of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Keeping blue-faced {{honeyeaters}} in an aviary in New South Wales {{requires a}} Class 2 Licence.

50|$|HSUS {{first took}} a policy {{position}} on <b>zoos</b> in 1975, {{its board of}} directors concluding that it would be neither for nor against <b>zoos,</b> but would work against roadside menageries and regular <b>zoos</b> that could not improve. In 1984, HSUS adopted a policy that animals should not be taken from the wild for public display in <b>zoos.</b>|$|R
5000|$|IDA {{believes}} that <b>zoos</b> {{lead to the}} premature deaths of elephants [...] and that [...] "urban <b>zoos</b> simply don’t have enough space for these magnificent, intelligent animals".

40|$|<b>Zoos</b> attract {{hundreds}} of millions of visitors every year worldwide. As such they are key institutions for publics to engage with live animals and environmental education, and to support conservation. But there is also a longstanding social representation of <b>zoos</b> as primarily serving a “spectacle” function—as the earliest <b>zoos</b> unashamedly did. Within the context of growing bioethical concern about holding animals in captivity, <b>zoos</b> have emphasized three main functions: education, research and conservation—although, in fact, a small percentage of zoos’ budgets are actually spent exclusively on these activities. Thus, <b>zoos</b> have come to legitimize themselves by emphasizing these other efforts. To examine the ways in which <b>zoos</b> communicate this self-legitimizing message and the way it is constructively understood by zoos’ most important audience –children-, we draw upon an evaluation study on the impact of the ZSL London <b>Zoo’s</b> educational programs. The study shows that children often employ their own strategies to reinterpret the <b>zoo’s</b> intended message, to constructively elaborate on the communication through their own background...|$|R
5|$|Like many <b>zoo</b> animals, hippos were {{traditionally}} {{displayed in}} concrete exhibits. In {{the case of}} hippos, they usually had {{a pool of water}} and patch of grass. In the 1980s, <b>zoo</b> exhibits increasingly reflected native habitats. The Toledo <b>Zoo</b> Hippoquarium, features a 360,000 gallon pool. In 1987, the Toledo <b>Zoo</b> saw the first underwater birth by a captive hippo. The exhibit was so popular, the hippos became the logo of the Toledo <b>Zoo.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Binky {{approached}} sexual maturity, <b>zoo</b> officials negotiated for {{the purchase}} of a female polar bear named Mimi from the Tulsa <b>Zoo</b> in Oklahoma. As the transfer was being finalized, however, Mimi died from a viral disease in Tulsa. In February 1979, young polar bear twins (Nuka, a female, and Siku, a male) joined Binky in his enclosure. Binky got along poorly with Siku, however, so Siku was given to a <b>zoo</b> in Morelia, Mexico in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh is {{the only}} <b>zoo</b> in the United Kingdom to be {{incorporated}} by Royal Charter, {{and was the first}} <b>zoo</b> in the world to house and breed penguins. The zoo's penguins have been famous throughout its history, and since the 1950s have performed a daily parade around the park.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 the <b>zoo</b> gained {{yet more}} {{military}} credentials when king penguin Nils Olav {{was adopted by}} the Norwegian King's Guard. Norway's connection with Edinburgh's penguins began with the Salvesen family's links to the <b>zoo,</b> and renewed interest was sparked when a lieutenant called Nils Egelien visited the <b>zoo</b> with the King's Guard in 1961. On his return in 1972 Egelien arranged for the unit to adopt one of the penguins. Nils Olav was named after Egelien and in honour of King Olav V of Norway, and given the rank of lance corporal. A statue of the penguin now stands outside the <b>zoo.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{economic}} and cultural aspects of <b>zoos.</b> The theoretical part describes {{the historical development of}} facilities engaged in animal husbandry. It also discusses the <b>zoos</b> of the Czech Republic and their specifics. It studies their current mission and approaches the service of <b>zoos</b> in terms of legislation. It compares their attractiveness to other tourist attractions. It analyses how the Czech <b>zoos</b> function among other international institutions and these institutions are also introduced in detail. It approximates the principles of the location selection for <b>zoos</b> and possible sources of their financing. The practical part of this thesis compares three important Czech <b>zoos</b> in detail. It analyses their functioning on the basis of selected sub-criteria...|$|R
5|$|In 1997, then-zoo {{director}} Jeff Williamson merged some {{departments of}} the <b>zoo</b> {{in a business}} move that was intended to provide a clearer direction for <b>zoo</b> operations. Many of the zoo's approximately 350 volunteers interpreted the merger as an elimination of volunteer training efforts. As a result, {{more than half of}} them left the <b>zoo</b> by 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Sarah Glass, {{curator of}} red pandas and special {{exhibits}} at the Knoxville <b>Zoo</b> in Knoxville, Tennessee, was appointed as {{coordinator for the}} North American Red Panda Species Survival Plan.

5|$|In May 2005, a {{veterinarian}} named Kris Nelson filed {{a series of}} complaints against the <b>zoo</b> regarding animal care and management. Her complaints were backed by two former <b>zoo</b> employees: a chief veterinarian and an animal nutritionist. The complaints stated that dozens of animals had been harmed or {{died as a result}} of poor management, feeding practices, and quarantine procedures. Another veterinarian, 15-year <b>zoo</b> employee Kathy Orr, discounted many of Nelson's claims as being either invalid, or having been corrected already.|$|E

25|$|Roadside <b>zoos</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} North America, particularly in remote locations. They are often small, for-profit <b>zoos,</b> often intended to attract visitors {{to some other}} facility, such as a gas station.

5|$|In September 2012, <b>zoo</b> {{customers}} were herded indoors when a Heck bull escaped from its enclosure. The 600kg animal with three feet long horns was loose for over 40 minutes, until <b>zoo</b> workers and vets managed to restrain him by using tranquilliser darts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the wild population at Chittenango Falls State Park, efforts to establish captive populations began in 1990. A captive Novisuccinea chittenangoensis colony was being maintained at the Rosamond Gifford <b>Zoo</b> in Syracuse, New York, however, the last remaining snails died in November 2002. Other unsuccessful breeding programs were tried in the 1990s: at ESF at Syracuse; at the Wildlife Conservation Park/Bronx Zoo; an early effort at the Rosamond Gifford <b>Zoo</b> (then called the Burnet Park Zoo); at the Seneca Park <b>Zoo</b> (Rochester, New York); and at the Buffalo <b>Zoo.</b> Further experiments are {{necessary in order to}} determine what the proper conditions are for maintaining a healthy captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
