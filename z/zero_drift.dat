The one-step transition vector has a symmetrical probability distribution with <b>zero</b> <b>drifts.</b> The state space of the random walk is the set of lattice points in the first quarter plane, the point at the coordinate axes are all absorbing states.

40|$|Abstract】Objective: To assess <b>zero</b> <b>drift</b> of intra-ventricular and {{subdural}} {{intracranial pressure}} (ICP) moni-toring systems. Methods: A prospective {{study was conducted}} in pa-tients who received Codman ICP monitoring in the neuro-surgical department from January 2010 to December 2011. According to the location of sensors, the patients were ca-tegorized into two groups: intraventricular group and sub-dural group. <b>Zero</b> <b>drift</b> between the two groups and its as-sociation with the duration of ICP monitor were analyzed. Results: Totally, 22 patients undergoing intraven-tricular ICP monitoring and 27 receiving subdural ICP moni-toring were enrolled. There {{was no significant difference in}} duration of ICP monitoring, <b>zero</b> <b>drift</b> value and its absolute value between intraventricular and subdural groups (5. 38 d± 2. 58 d vs 4. 58 d± 2. 24 d, 0. 77 mm Hg± 2. 18 mm Hg vs 1. 03 mm Hg± 2. 06 mm Hg, 1. 68 mm Hg± 1. 55 mm Hg vs 1. 70 mm Hg± 1. 53 mm Hg, respectively; all P> 0. 05). Absolute value of <b>zero</b> <b>drift</b> in both groups significantly rose with the increased duration of ICP monitoring (P< 0. 05) while <b>zero</b> <b>drift</b> value did not. Moreover, daily absolute value in the intraventricular group was sig-nificantly smaller than that in the subdural group (0. 27 mm Hg± 0. 32 mm Hg vs 0. 29 mm Hg± 0. 18 mm Hg, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that absolute value of <b>zero</b> <b>drift</b> significantly correlates with duration of both intraventricular and subdural ICP monitoring. Due to the smaller daily absolute value, ICP values recorded from intraventricular system may be more reliable than those from subdural system.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the asymptotic behavior of Markov chains on the set of positive integers for which, loosely speaking, large jumps are rare and occur at a rate that behaves like a negative power of the current state, and such that small positive and negative steps of the chain roughly compensate each other. If X_n is such a Markov chain started at n, we establish a limit theorem for 1 /nX_n appropriately scaled in time, where the scaling limit is given by a nonnegative self-similar Markov process. We also study the asymptotic behavior of the time needed by X_n to reach some fixed finite set. We identify three different regimes (roughly speaking the transient, the recurrent and the positive-recurrent regimes) in which X_n exhibits different behavior.
