50|$|The {{orange-breasted waxbill}} or <b>zebra</b> <b>waxbill</b> (Amandava subflava) {{is a small}} (approximately 9 cm long) sparrow-like bird with a reddish iris, orange breast, red bill and dark olive-green plumage. The male has a red rump, dark bars on the whitish flank and a scarlet eyebrow stripe. The female is duller and smaller than male; it also lacks the male's red eyebrow.|$|E
5000|$|Thick-billed weavers are polygynous, in that {{a single}} male {{attempts}} to attract and mate with several females. up to six, and three nest may ne active in any male's territory at once. Where they are found at low density there are many apparently monogamous pairs, although they normally nest in small colonies; more than 100 nests in one South African colony. After mating the female normally will lay a clutch of 3 whitish pink eggs, spotted with red, purple and brown. The incubation of the eggs is carried out solely by the female, lasting 14-16 days and the chicks are fed by regurgitation by the female until fledging, although occasionally the male also feeds the young. The chicks fledge after about 18-20 days in the nest. The nests are vulnerable to predation and recorded nest predators include the white-browed coucal Centropus superciliosus, house crow Corvus splendens and the Nile monitor [...] Varanus niloticus. After the nests {{have been used by}} the wevaers they may be commandeered by climbing mice, or used for breeding by the <b>zebra</b> <b>waxbill</b> Amandava subflava or brown firefinch Lagonosticta nitidula.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} ninety-eight wild birds, {{comprising}} eleven different species were captured alive from Zaria environs. These birds {{were used for}} the study, to determine the possible role they play as reservoirs of blood parasites. Thin blood smears (TBS) were prepared from the blood samples collected from these wild birds. The slides were stained and viewed under the microscope for the identification of blood parasites. Values of packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (Hb) and total protein (TP) were also determined from the blood samples. Sera from the birds {{were used for the}} determination of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres to Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Haemoparasites, such as Plasmodium circumflexum, P. relictum, P. nouxi, Haemoproteus nisi, H. columbae, and Aegyptienella pullorum were identified from the blood of some of the wild birds. The highest mean HI antibody titre to Newcastle disease virus(NDV) (log 2 9. 50 &# 177; 0. 1) and lowest mean HI antibody titre to NDV (log 2 2. 50 &# 177; 1. 7) were obtained from Senegal parrot (Poicephalus senegalus) and Northern red bishop (Euplectes franciscanus), respectively. The highest mean PCV and Hb values of 49. 00 &# 177; 0. 01 % and 16. 30 &# 177; 0. 1 g%, respectively were obtained from Senegal parrot (Poicephalus senegalus), while the lowest mean PCV and Hb values of 36. 50 &# 177; 8. 35 % and 12. 18 &# 177; 2. 77 g%, respectively were recorded from African marsked weaver (Ploceus velatus). The highest mean TP value (7. 00 &# 177; 0. 01 g/dl) and lowest mean TP value (1. 88 &# 177; 0. 54 g/dl) were obtained from Laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis) and <b>Zebra</b> <b>waxbill</b> (Sporaeginthus subflavus), respectively. It was concluded that wild birds could serve as reservoirs of haemoparasites and viral pathogens which could be potential dangers to domestic birds in Zaria, Nigeria. [Vet.

50|$|Typical of {{polygynous}} species, male red-collared widowbirds do {{not provide}} parental care. In fact, the only resources males provide are potential nest sites in their territories. They are different from other Euplectes species in that the males use only a simple nest ring in courtship and the females build and position the actual nests. The nests are usually oval in shape and the females line the nests with grass. Females continue {{to add to the}} nest during the incubation. Old nests are often occupied by <b>zebra</b> <b>waxbills.</b> There are usually between 2 and 4 eggs in a clutch, each egg being greyish or blue-green, with brown speckles. The incubation period, done only by the female, is between 12 and 15 days. Females also do all of the feeding, primarily via regurgitation, during the nestling period for the offspring, which is between 14 and 17 days. The nests are commonly parasitized by Diederik cuckoos.|$|R
