Results from a numerical ice sheet model, an atmospheric general circulation model and an ocean general circulation model are collated and used to provide iceberg production rate, wind field and surface current forcings to an iceberg trajectory model. The iceberg model then determines how icebergs issuing from the Eurasian Ice Sheet travel across the ocean and eventually melt. In addition the release of iceberg sediments is also predicted.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to a {{stability}} study of a walking gait for a biped. The walking gait is periodic and it is composed of a single-support phase, a passive impact, and a double-support phase.

We use the Poincaré map to study the stability of the walking gait of the biped.

40|$|Abstract: SE Asia {{comprises}} {{a collage}} of continental terranes derived directly or indirectly from the India–Australian margin of eastern Gondwana. The Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic evolution of the region involved the rifting and separation of three elongate continental slivers from eastern Gondwana and the successive opening and closure of three ocean basins, the Palaeo-Tethys, Meso-Tethys and Ceno-Tethys. The Sukhothai Island Arc System, including the Linchang, Sukhothai and Chanthaburi terranes, is identified between the Sibumasu and Indochina–East Malaya terranes in SE Asia and was formed by back-arc spreading in the Permian. The Jinghong, Nan–Uttaradit and Sra Kaeo sutures represent the closed back-arc basin. The Palaeo-Tethys is rep-resented to the west by the Changning–Menglian, Chiang Mai/Inthanon and Bentong–Raub suture zones. The West Sumatra and West Burma blocks rifted and separated from Gondwana, along with Indochina and East Malaya in the Devonian, and together with South China formed a composite terrane ‘Cathaysialand ’ in the Permian.

40|$|Fast-flowing ice streams carry {{ice from}} the {{interior}} of the Antarctic Ice Sheet towards the coast. Understanding how ice-stream tributaries operate and how networks of them evolve is essential for developing reliable models of the ice sheet's response to climate change. A particular challenge is to unravel the spatial complexity of flow within and across tributary networks. Here I define a measure <b>of</b> planimetric flow <b>convergence,</b> which can be calculated from satellite measurements of the ice sheet's surface velocity, to explore this complexity. The <b>convergence</b> map <b>of</b> Antarctica clarifies how tributaries draw ice from its interior. The map also reveals curvilinear <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> along lateral shear margins of streaming, and abundant ripples associated with nonlinear ice rheology and changes in bed topography and friction. Convergence on ice-stream tributaries and their feeding zones is uneven and interspersed with divergence. For individual drainage basins, as well as the ice sheet as a whole, fast flow cannot converge or diverge as much as slow flow. I therefore deduce that flow in the ice-stream networks is subject to mechanical regulation that limits flow-orthonormal strain rates. These findings provide targets for ice-sheet simulations and motivate more research into the origin and dynamics of tributarization...|$|R

Characteristic SAR image expressions are observed in relation to perturbation of the surface current-short wave interaction across the Norwegian Coastal Current front for winds less than 10 – 12 m s− 1. In situ measurements document the existence <b>of</b> alternating <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> and divergence coexisting with a strong near-surface current shear of nearly 4 f (where f is the Coriolis parameter) across a distance of a few kilometers.

Comparison of a near-coincident National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer image and an ERS 1 SAR image supports the interpretation that surface current fronts are imaged by SAR. In combination with a SAR image simulation model, the relative quantitative importance <b>of</b> shear, <b>convergence,</b> and divergence along the front is examined.

This model has two free material parameters, the power law exponent, n, of the vertically averaged rheology of the lithosphere and the Argand number, Ar, which expresses {{the relative importance of}} GPE and stresses required to deform the lithosphere. With boundary conditions described by three additional free parameters, the model fits the observed deformation, as measured by 367 GPS velocities, with a root-mean-square residual of < 2. 4 mm/yr. We find negligible improvement when variations in material properties are introduced that represent increases or decreases in the lithospheric strength of the Central Iranian and Turkish-Iranian Plateaux and the Zagros Mountains. Effective viscosity of the lithosphere ranges from 5 × 1022 Pa s at 10 nanostrain/yr to 1022 Pa s at 100 nanostrain/yr. As well as matching the decadal time scale strain rates determined from GPS, the computed distribution of strain rates is also consistent with the distribution and types of earthquake focal mechanism. Significant historical earthquake activity is seen in regions with strain rates lower than 20 nanostrain/yr, implying that it is prudent to base assessments of seismic hazard on regional strain rates...|$|E

40|$|An {{unstructured}} grid, phase-averaged wave model forced with winds from a {{high resolution}} atmospheric model is used to evaluate wind wave conditions in the Red Sea over an approximately 2 -year period. The Red Sea lies in a narrow rift valley, and the steep topography surrounding the basin steers the dominant wind patterns and consequently the wave climate. At large scales, the model {{results indicated that the}} primary seasonal variability in waves was due to the monsoonal wind reversal. During the winter, monsoon winds from the southeast generated waves with mean significant wave heights in excess of 2 m and mean periods of 8 s in the southern Red Sea, while {{in the northern part of}} the basin waves were smaller, shorter period, and from northwest. The <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> of winds and waves typically occurred around 19 - 20 ˚N, but the location varied between 15 to 21. 5 ˚N.

A 24 h period on 13 – 14 March 2002 framed by two RADARSAT images is analyzed. Data are included from autonomous ice buoys, a research vessel, Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and QuikSCAT satellite, and the operational European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model. During this 24 h period the cyclone moved northward along the western ice edge in the Fram Strait, crossed the northern ice edge, made a left-turn loop with 150 km diameter over the sea ice, {{and returned to the}} northern ice edge. The ECMWF analysis places the cyclone track 100 km too far west over the sea ice, a deviation which is too large for representative sea ice simulations. On {{the east side of the}} northward moving cyclone, the ice edge was pushed northward by 55 km because of strong winds. On the rear side, the ice edge advanced toward the open water but by a smaller distance because of weaker winds there.

In the Pliny and Strabo "trenches", the oblique relative plate motion is generally thought to be accommodated by a typical strain partitioning consisting of strike-slip and convergence components. Notwithstanding the occurrence of strike-slip motion parallel with the Pliny-Strabo "trenches", trench-normal thrusting is not observed so far. Therefore, we conducted a detailed analysis to investigate the deformation mechanisms of the {{eastern part of}} the Hellenic Trench system. Our analyses of offshore faulting and mechanisms of earthquakes in the overriding Aegean lithosphere show that the region of the Pliny and Strabo "trenches" obeys the mechanics of the sinistral shear zone model of Tchalenko (1970). We propose that the trench perpendicular convergence is taken up by the Rhodes fold and thrust belt, which has been postulated off the southeast coast of Rhodes. Several regional P-wave tomography results give indications of a slow seismic anomaly under this zone, which is interpreted as a tear between the Hellenic and Cyprus subduction zones. The primary reason for such tear and its propagation is the ongoing rollback of the subducted part of the African lithosphere, also referred to as "the Aegean slab". Our work elucidates the surface expression of this tearing process in the form of the development of a shear zone between the Aegean lithosphere in the NW and the African lithosphere in the SE, the Pliny-Strabo Shear Zone...|$|E
40|$|Recently, two new and {{independent}} methods for quantitative studies of SAR imaging of current features {{were presented in}} the July 2005 issue of Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans. They are the Doppler shift approach and the radar imaging modelling (RIM) approach. It is therefore timely to combine these two approaches for more comprehensive and quantitative studies of SAR imaging of current features. In this paper we present and examine the preliminary results obtained with this new “DopRim ” model, which also features an independent wind-wave SAR retrieval tool. Forward simulations of SAR images using this DopRim model have been conducted for two test areas around the French coast {{at the entrance to}} the English Channel. The 3 D current fields are taken from numerical ocean models, while the wind and dominant wave field are retrieved from the respective SAR images. These products serve as the input for the forward DopRim module. Extensive testing and validation of this method is currently ongoing. Preliminary results show that surface current velocities and estimation of current deformation such as <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> and current shear can be derived in consistence with the SAR backscatter anomalies, near surface wind and wave fields, and the measured Doppler shifts. The inverse module, when fully tested and validated, is expected to significantly advance the use of SAR imagery in quantitative studies of mesoscale features such as fronts, eddies and filaments. In the longer term, it may also open up for routine application of SAR image data in operational oceanography...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} a mixed variational formulation of 3 D contact problems with the simplest model involving friction. This formulation {{is based on a}} dualization of the set of admissible displacements and the regularization of the non-differentiable term. Displacements are approximated by piecewise linear elements while the respective dual variables by piecewise constant functions on a dual partition <b>of</b> the contact <b>zone.</b> The rate <b>of</b> <b>convergence</b> is established provided that the solution is smooth enough. The numerical realization of such problems will be discussed and results of a model example will be shown...|$|R
50|$|The {{magnitude}} 7.2 (Mw) Eastern Highlands earthquake occurred inland on 23 October 2011 at 13:41 local time, centered about 16 km north-northeast of Van, Turkey and at {{an estimated}} focal depth of 7.2 km. Its focal region and much of easternmost Turkey lie towards the southern boundary <b>of</b> the complex <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> continental collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate, beyond the eastern extent of the Armenian and Asia Minor fault <b>zones.</b> Part <b>of</b> the <b>convergence</b> between these two plates takes place along the Bitlis-Zagros fold and thrust belt. The earthquakes's focal mechanism indicates oblique thrust faulting, consistent with the expected tectonics {{in the region of}} the Bitlis-Zagros Fault Zone, where thrust mechanisms dominate.|$|R
