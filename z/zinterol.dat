40|$|The {{functional}} coupling of β 2 -adrenoceptors (β 2 -ARs) to murine L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa(L)) {{was investigated}} with two different approaches. The β 2 -AR signalling cascade was activated either with the β 2 -AR selective agonist <b>zinterol</b> (myocytes from wild-type mice), or by spontaneously active, unoccupied β 2 -ARs (myocytes from TG 4 mice with 435 fold overexpression of human β 2 -ARs). Ca 2 + and Ba 2 + currents {{were recorded in}} the whole-cell and cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp technique, respectively. <b>Zinterol</b> (10 [*]μM) significantly increased ICa(L) amplitude of wild-type myocytes by 19 ± 5 %, and this effect was markedly enhanced after inactivation of Gi-proteins with pertussis-toxin (PTX; 76 ± 13 % increase). However, the effect of <b>zinterol</b> was entirely mediated by the β 1 -AR subtype, since it was blocked by the β 1 -AR selective antagonist CGP 20712 A (300 [*]nM). The β 2 -AR selective antagonist ICI 118, 551 (50 [*]nM) {{did not affect the}} response of ICa(L) to <b>zinterol.</b> In myocytes with β 2 -AR overexpression ICa(L) was not stimulated by the activated signalling cascade.

The β 2 -AR inverse agonist ICI 118, 551 did not further decrease ICa(L). PTX-treatment increased current amplitude to values found in control myocytes. In conclusion, there is no evidence for β 2 -AR mediated increases of ICa(L) in wild-type mouse ventricular myocytes. Inactivation of Gi-proteins does not unmask β 2 -AR responses to <b>zinterol,</b> but augments β 1 -AR mediated increases of ICa(L).

40|$|Incubation {{of human}} {{mononuclear}} leukocytes (MLN) with isoproterenol rapidly desensitizes beta-adrenergic receptors, i. e. isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation decreases. This desensitization {{is accompanied by}} a redistribution of the receptor into a cellular environment to which hydrophilic compounds have limited access. We found that the total number of beta-receptors [defined as binding of [3 H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) inhibited by 1 microM propranolol] was unchanged in the desensitized MNL. In control MNL, virtually all DHA binding was inhibited by 1 microM CGP- 12177, suggesting that all of these receptors are on the cell surface, whereas in desensitized cells, only 33 +/- 2 % (mean +/- SEM) of the DHA binding was inhibited by CGP- 12177. We quantitated the sequestered receptors by subtracting the number of surface receptors from the total number of receptors. The sequestered receptors were homogeneous, with an affinity for DHA identical to that of surface receptors (Kd, 0. 66 +/- 0. 12 vs. 0. 62 +/- 0. 08 nM). The time courses of desensitization and sequestration were identical. The functional status of the sequestered receptors was assessed using the agonist <b>zinterol,</b> which (unlike catecholamines) is quite hydrophobic. <b>Zinterol</b> competed for DHA binding to both sequestered and surface receptors, whereas isoproterenol only competed for binding to the surface receptors. However, cAMP accumulation in desensitized MNL was reduced to the same extent regardless of whether isoproterenol or <b>zinterol</b> was used as the agonist. These results demonstrate that desensitization of intact cells to beta-agonists cannot be attributed to limited accessibility of the sequestered receptors to catecholamines, but, rather, that the sequestered receptors are not functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|Background-Catecholamines hasten cardiac {{relaxation}} through beta-adrenergic receptors, presumably by phosphorylation {{of several}} proteins, {{but it is}} unknown which receptor subtypes are involved in human ventricle. We assessed the role of beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenergic receptors in phosphorylating proteins implicated in ventricular relaxation. Methods and Results-Right ventricular trabeculae, obtained from freshly explanted hearts of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n= 5) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (n= 5), were paced at 60 bpm. After measurement of the contractile and relaxant effects of epinephrine (10 mu mol/L) or <b>zinterol</b> (10 mu mol/L), mediated through beta(2) -adrenergic receptors, and of norepinephrine (10 mu mol/L), mediated through beta(1) -adrenergic receptors, tissues were freeze clamped. We assessed phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin I, and C-protein, as well as specific phosphorylation of phospholamban at serine 16 and threonine 17, Data did not differ between the 2 disease groups and were therefore pooled. Epinephrine, <b>zinterol,</b> and norepinephrine increased contractile force to approximately the same extent, hastened the onset of relaxation by 15 +/- 3 %, 5 +/- 2 %, and 20 +/- 3 %, respectively, and reduced the time to half-relaxation by 26 +/- 3 %, 21 +/- 3 %, and 37 +/- 3 %. These effects of epinephrine, <b>zinterol,</b> and norepinephrine were associated with phosphorylation (pmol phosphate/mg protein) of phospholamban 14 +/- 3, 12 +/- 4, and 12 +/- 3, troponin I 40 +/- 7, 33 +/- 7, and 31 +/- 6; and C-protein 7. 2 +/- 1. 9, 9. 3 +/- 1. 4, and 7. 5 +/- 2. 0. Phosphorylation of phospholamban occurred at both Ser 16 and Thr 17 residues through both beta(1) - and beta(2) -adrenergic receptors.

40|$|In atrial myocytes, {{an initial}} {{exposure}} to isoproterenol (ISO) acts via cAMP to mediate a subsequent acetylcholine (ACh) -induced activation of ATP-sensitive K+ current (IK,ATP). In addition, β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation activates nitric oxide (NO) release. The present study determined whether the conditioning effect of β-AR stimulation acts via β 1 - and/or β 2 -ARs {{and whether it}} is mediated via NO signaling. 0. 1 μM ISO plus ICI 118, 551 (ISO-β 1 -AR stimulation) or ISO plus atenolol (ISO-β 2 -AR stimulation) both increased L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L) markedly, but only ISO-β 2 -AR stimulation mediated ACh-induced activation of IK,ATP. 1 μM <b>zinterol</b> (β 2 -AR agonist) also increased ICa,L and mediated ACh-activated IK,ATP. Inhibition of NO synthase (10 μM L-NIO), guanylate cyclase (10 μM ODQ), or cAMP-PKA (50 μM Rp-cAMPs) attenuated zinterol-induced stimulation of ICa,L and abolished ACh-activated IK,ATP. Spermine-NO (100 μM; an NO donor) mimicked β 2 -AR stimulation, and its effects were abolished by Rp-cAMPs. Intracellular dialysis of 20 μM protein kinase inhibitory peptide (PKI) abolished zinterol-induced stimulation of ICa,L. Measurements of intracellular NO ([NO]i) using the fluorescent indicator DAF- 2 showed that ISO-β 2 -AR stimulation or <b>zinterol</b> increased [NO]i. L-NIO (10 μM) blocked ISO- and zinterol-induced increases in [NO]i. ISO-β 1 -AR stimulation failed to increase [NO]i. Inhibition of Gi-protein by pertussis toxin significantly inhibited zinterol-mediated increases in [NO]i. Wortmannin (0. 2 μM) or LY 294002 (10 μM), inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3 ′-kinase (PI- 3 K), abolished the effects of <b>zinterol</b> to both mediate ACh-activated IK,ATP and stimulate [NO]i. We conclude that both β 1 - and β 2 -ARs stimulate cAMP. β 2 -ARs act via two signaling pathways to stimulate cAMP, {{one of which is}} mediated via Gi-protein and PI- 3 K coupled to NO-cGMP signaling. Only β 2 -ARs acting exclusively via NO signaling mediate ACh-induced activation of IK,ATP. NO signaling also contributes to β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L.

40|$|Perforated patch {{recordings}} {{were used}} to determine how plating atrial cells on laminin alters β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) regulation of L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L). Isoproterenol (isoprenaline; ISO; 0. 01 μM), a non-selective β-AR agonist, elicited a greater stimulation of ICa,L in cells plated on laminin (+ 79 ± 16 %; n = 17) than on glass (+ 33 ± 5 %; n = 23). Also, desensitization to ISO was greater in cells on laminin (− 16 ± 2 %) than on glass (− 3 ± 1 %). Atenolol (0. 1 μM), a selective β 1 -AR antagonist, inhibited the effects of ISO in cells on glass but not laminin. Conversely, 0. 1 μM ICI 118, 551, a selective β 2 -AR antagonist, inhibited the effects of ISO in cells on laminin but not glass. With β 2 -ARs blocked, ISO-induced stimulation of ICa,L was greater in cells on glass than laminin. <b>Zinterol</b> (0. 01 – 0. 1 μM), a selective β 2 -AR agonist, elicited a greater stimulation of ICa,L in cells on laminin than on glass. The effects of <b>zinterol</b> were blocked by ICI 118, 551. ISO-induced stimulation of ICa,L was greater in cells plated on an αβ 1 -integrin antibody than on glass. Also, addition of 20 μM cytochalasin D to cells on laminin prevented the enhanced effects of ISO typically elicited in cells on laminin alone. We conclude that laminin binding to αβ 1 -integrins, in conjunction with the actin cytoskeleton, reduces β 1 -AR and enhances β 2 -AR signalling which regulates ICa,L.

The high affinity component was shifted with low affinity by propranolol, (±) -cyanopindolol, tertatolol and alprenolol. CL 316243 (β 3 -AR agonist) relaxation was unaffected by CGP 20712 A or ICI 118551 but blocked by SR 58894 A (β 3 -AR antagonist; pA 2 = 7. 80). Enhanced relaxation after exposure to forskolin and pertussis toxin showed that β 3 -AR relaxation can be altered by manipulation of components of the adenylate cyclase signalling pathway. The β 1 -AR agonist RO 363 relaxed the ileum (pEC 50 = 6. 18) and was blocked by CGP 20712 A. Relaxation by the β 2 -AR agonist <b>zinterol</b> (pEC 50 = 5. 71) was blocked by SR 58894 A but not by ICI 118551. In rat ileum, β 1 -, β 2 - and β 3 -AR mRNA was detected.

The pharmacological analysis was supported by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction analysis of L 6 mRNA, which showed high levels of expression of β 2 -AR but not β 1 - or β 3 -AR in these cells. Forskolin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP produced negligible increases in GT while the phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, significantly decreased both insulin- and zinterol-stimulated GT, suggesting a possible interaction between the insulin and β 2 -AR pathways.

Studies were performed on acutely isolated atrial myocytes plated on uncoated coverslips (−LMN) or coverslips coated with LMN (+LMN). As {{previously reported}}, 0. 1 μm <b>zinterol</b> (zint-β 2 -AR) stimulation of ICa,L was larger in +LMN than −LMN myocytes. In +LMN myocytes, zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L was inhibited by inhibition of cPLA 2 by arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF 3; 10 μm), inhibition of Gi by pertussis toxin and chelation of intracellular Ca 2 + by 10 μm BAPTA-AM. In contrast to <b>zinterol,</b> stimulation of ICa,L by fenoterol (fen-β 2 -AR), a β 2 -AR agonist that acts exclusively via Gs signalling, was smaller in +LMN than −LMN myocytes. Arachidonic acid (AA; 5 μm) stimulated ICa,L to a similar extent in −LMN and +LMN myocytes. Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) by either 5 μm H− 89 or 1 μm KT 5720 in −LMN myocytes mimicked the effects of +LMN myocytes to enhance zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L, which was blocked by 10 μm AACOCF 3. In contrast, H− 89 inhibited fen-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L, which was unchanged by AACOCF 3. Inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 by 1 μm U 0126 inhibited zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L in +LMN myocytes and −LMN myocytes in which cAMP/PKA was inhibited by KT 5720. In −LMN myocytes, cytochalasin D prevented inhibition of cAMP/PKA from enhancing zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L.

40|$|The β 1 - and β 2 -adrenergic {{signaling}} systems play {{different roles}} in the functioning of cardiac cells. Experimental data shows that the activation of the β 1 -adrenergic signaling system produces significant inotropic, lusitropic, and chronotropic effects in the heart, while {{the effects of the}} β 2 -adrenergic signaling system is less apparent. In this dissertation, a comprehensive experimentally-based mathematical model of the combined β 1 - and β 2 -adrenergic signaling systems in mouse ventricular myocytes is developed to simulate the experimental findings and make testable predictions of the behavior of the cardiac cells under different physiological conditions. Simulations describe the dynamics of major signaling molecules in different subcellular compartments; kinetics and magnitudes of phosphorylation of ion channels, transporters, and Ca 2 + handling proteins; modifications of action potential shape and duration; and [Ca 2 +]i and [Na+]i dynamics upon stimulation of β 1 - and β 2 -adrenergic receptors (β 1 - and β 2 -ARs). The model reveals physiological conditions when β 2 -ARs do not produce significant physiological effects and when their effects can be measured experimentally. Simulations demonstrated that stimulation of β 2 -ARs with isoproterenol caused a marked increase in the magnitude of the L-type Ca 2 + current, [Ca 2 +]i transient, and phosphorylation of phospholamban only upon additional application of pertussis toxin (PTX) or inhibition of phosphodiesterases of type 3 and 4. The model also made testable predictions of the changes in magnitudes of [Ca 2 +]i and [Na+]i fluxes, the rate of decay of [Na+]i concentration upon both combined and separate stimulation of β 1 - and β 2 -ARs, and the contribution of phosphorylation of PKA targets to the changes in the action potential and [Ca 2 +]i transient. A comprehensive mathematical model of the mouse ventricular myocyte overexpressing β 2 -adrenergic receptors was also developed.

Although several of these models have altered betaAR subtypes, the specific functional sequelae of betaAR stimulation in murine heart, particularly those of beta 2 -adrenergic receptor (beta 2 AR) stimulation, have not been characterized. In the present study, we investigated effects of beta 2 AR stimulation on contraction, [Ca 2 +]i transient, and L-type Ca 2 + currents (ICa) in single ventricular myocytes isolated from transgenic mice overexpressing human beta 2 AR (TG 4 mice) and wild-type (WT) littermates. Baseline contractility of TG 4 heart cells was increased by 3 -fold relative to WT controls {{as a result of the}} presence of spontaneous beta 2 AR activation. In contrast, beta 2 AR stimulation by <b>zinterol</b> or isoproterenol plus a selective beta 1 -adrenergic receptor (beta 1 AR) antagonist CGP 20712 A failed to enhance the contractility in TG 4 myocytes, and more surprisingly, beta 2 AR stimulation was also ineffective in increasing contractility in WT myocytes. Pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment fully rescued the ICa, [Ca 2 +]i, and contractile responses to beta 2 AR agonists in both WT and TG 4 cells. The PTX-rescued murine cardiac beta 2 AR response is mediated by cAMP-dependent mechanisms, because it was totally blocked by the inhibitory cAMP analog Rp-cAMPS. These results suggest that PTX-sensitive G proteins are responsible for the unresponsiveness of mouse heart to agonist-induced beta 2 AR stimulation. This was further corroborated by an increased incorporation of the photoreactive GTP analog [gamma- 32 P]GTP azidoanilide into alpha subunits of Gi 2 and Gi 3 after beta 2 AR stimulation by <b>zinterol</b> or isoproterenol plus the beta 1 AR blocker CGP 20712 A. This effect to activate Gi proteins was abolished by a selective beta 2 AR blocker ICI 118, 551 or by PTX treatment. Thus, we conclude that (1) beta 2 ARs in murine cardiac myocytes couple to concurrent Gs and Gi signaling, resulting in null inotropic response, unless the Gi signaling is inhibited; (2) as a special case, the lack of cardiac contractile response to beta 2 AR agonists in TG 4 mice is not due to a saturation of cell contractility or of the cAMP signaling cascade but rather to an activation of beta 2 AR-coupled Gi proteins; and (3) spontaneous beta 2 AR activation may differ from agonist-stimulated beta 2 AR signaling...|$|E

Stimulation of PRL and GH release from these cultures was also induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin.

In view of our recent findings indicating that the amygdala is involved in mediating the effects of glucocorticoids on memory storage, the present study examined whether the glucocorticoid-induced effects on memory storage depend on β-adrenergic activation within the amygdala. Microinfusions (0. 5 μg in 0. 2 μl) of either propranolol (a nonspecific β-adrenergic antagonist), atenolol (a β 1 -adrenergic antagonist), or <b>zinterol</b> (a β 2 -adrenergic antagonist) administered bilaterally into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) of male Sprague–Dawley rats 10 min before training blocked the enhancing effect of posttraining systemic injections of dexamethasone (0. 3 mg/kg) on 48 -h memory for inhibitory avoidance training. Infusions of these β-adrenergic antagonists into the central nucleus of the amygdala did not block the dexamethasone-induced memory enhancement. Furthermore, atenolol (0. 5 μg) blocked the memory-enhancing effects of the specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR or type II) agonist RU 28362 infused concurrently into the BLA immediately posttraining.

40|$|Activation {{of either}} coexisting beta(1) - or beta(2) -adrenoceptors with {{noradrenaline}} or adrenaline, respectively, causes maximum increases of contractility of human atrial myocardium. Previous biochemical {{work with the}} beta(2) -selective agonist <b>zinterol</b> is consistent with activation of the cascade beta(2) -adrenoceptors -> Gs alpha-protein -> adenylyl cyclase -> cAMP -> protein kinase (PKA) -> phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin 1, and C-protein -> hastened relaxation of human atria from nonfailing hearts. However, in feline and rodent myocardium, catecholamines and <b>zinterol</b> usually do not hasten relaxation through activation of beta 2 -adrenoceptors, presumably because of coupling of the receptors to Gi protein. It is unknown whether the endogenously occurring beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonist adrenaline acts through the above cascade in human atrium and whether {{its mode of action}} could be changed in heart failure. We assessed the effects of (-) -adrenaline, mediated through beta(2) -adrenoceptors (in the presence of CGP 20712 A 300 nM to block beta(1) -adrenoceptors), on contractility and relaxation of right atrial trabecula obtained from nonfailing and failing human hearts. Cyclic AMP levels were measured as well as phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin 1, and protein C with Western blots and the back-phosphorylation procedure. For comparison, beta(1) -adrenoceptor-mediated effects of (-) -noradrenaline were investigated in the presence of ICI 118, 551 (50 nM to block beta(2) -adrenoceptors). The positive inotropic effects of both (-) -noradrenaline and (-) -adrenaline were accompanied by reductions in time to peak force and time to reach 50 % relaxation. (-) -Adrenaline caused similar positive inotropic and lusitropic effects in atrial trabeculae from failing hearts. However, the inotropic potency, but not the lusitropic potency, of (-) -noradrenaline was reduced fourfold in atrial trabeculae from heart failure patients. Both (-) -adrenaline and (-) -noradrenaline enhanced cyclic AMP levels and produced phosphorylation of phospholamban, troponin 1, and C-protein to a similar extent in atrial trabeculae from nonfailing hearts. The hastening of relaxation caused by (-) -adrenaline together with the PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation of the three proteins involved in relaxation, indicate coupling of beta(2) -adrenoceptors to Gs protein. The phosphorylation of phospholamban at serine 16 and threonine 17 evoked by (-) -adrenaline through beta(2) -adrenoceptors and by (-) -noradrenaline through beta(1) -adrenoceptors was not different in atria from nonfailing and failing hearts. Activation of beta(2) -adrenoceptors caused an increase in phosphorylase a activity in atrium from failing hearts further emphasizing the presence of the beta(2) -adrenoceptor-Gs alpha-protein pathway in human heart. The positive inotropic and lusitropic potencies of (-) -adrenaline were conserved. across Arg 16 Gly- and Gln 27 Glu-beta(2) -adrenoceptor polymorphisms in the right atrium from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, chronically treated with beta-selective blockers. The persistent relaxant and biochemical effects of (-) -adrenaline through beta(2) -adrenoceptors and of (-) -noradrenaline through beta(1) -adrenoceptors in heart failure are inconsistent with an important role of coupling of beta(2) -adrenoceptors with Gi alpha-protein in human atrial myocardium...|$|E

Relative to nonfailing PPH left ventricles, failing PPH right ventricles exhibited (a) markedly decreased beta 1 -adrenergic receptor density, (b) marked depletion of tissue norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y, (c) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation {{in response to the}} beta agonists isoproterenol and <b>zinterol,</b> and (d) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation in response to Gpp(NH) p and forskolin.

Additionally, relative to paired nonfailing PPH left ventricles and nonfailing right ventricles from organ donors, failing right ventricles from PPH subjects exhibited decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation by MnCl 2. These data indicate that: (a) Adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities present in the failing human heart are due to local mechanisms; systemic processes do not produce beta-adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities.

The percentage increase was similar in both young and old rats, either with <b>zinterol</b> (26. 9 +/- 3. 6 % and 24. 2 +/- 2. 8 %, respectively) or isoprenaline plus CGP 20712 A (30. 4 +/- 3. 7 % and 22. 4 +/- 4. 1 %, respectively). Isoprenaline alone (beta 1 AR and beta 2 AR stimulation) caused a much smaller increase in ICa,L in old rats (58. 4 +/- 12. 1 %) than in younger ones (95. 3 +/- 8. 1 %) (P = 0. 067). 3 The number of,BAR mg-' protein, measured with saturation binding assays of the non selective,betaAR antagonist [3 H]-CGP 12177 was 1989. 4 +/- 189. 5 for 3 - and of 1580. 7 +/- 161. 5 for 22 -month-old rats. Competition for [3 H]-CGP 12177 binding by CGP 20712 A gave biphasic curves which demonstrated two classes of binding sites. Densities (as percentages of total PAR density), and affinities for the two binding sites were: 80. 4 +/- 2. 2 % (Ki = 6. 6 +/- 1. 3 nM) betaAR and 19. 6 +/- 2. 2 % (Ki = 6. 9 +/- 2. 2 microM) beta 2 AR in young rats and 66. 1 +/- 1. 2 % (Ki= 8. 3 +/- 1. 1 nM) beta 1 AR and 33. 9 +/- 1. 2 % (Ki= 5. 2 +/- 0. 6 PM) P 2 AR in old rats. Thebeta 1 AR/beta 2 AR ratio was significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced in old rats with respect to the younger ones. 4 By combining electrophysiological and binding measurements, we calculated beta 1 AR and beta 2 ARdensities as number of receptors per microM 2 of cell surface. In old rats, beta 1 density was significantly decreased compared to young rats (8. 4 +/- 2. 0 vs 15. 4 +/- 3. 7 receptors microM- 2, P< 0. 05), while beta 2 AR density remained unchanged at both 3 and 22 months (3. 8 +/- 0. 7 and 4. 2 +/- 1. 1 receptors microM- 2, respectively). 5 Our results demonstrate that both beta 1 AR and beta 2 AR are functionally present in rat ventricular myocytes of young and old rats.

The present study investigated whether disruption of Cav- 3 binding to its endogenous binding partners influenced LTCC activity. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from male Wistar rats and LTCC current (ICa) recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Incubation of myocytes with a membrane-permeable peptide representing the scaffolding domain of Cav- 3 (C 3 SD) reduced basal ICa amplitude in intact, but not detubulated, myocytes, and attenuated the stimulatory effects of the β 2 -adrenergic agonist <b>zinterol</b> on ICa. The PKA inhibitor H- 89 also reduced basal ICa; however, the inhibitory effects of C 3 SD and H- 89 on basal ICa amplitude were not summative. Under control conditions, myocytes stained with antibody against phosphorylated LTCC (pLTCC) displayed a striated pattern, presumably reflecting localization at the t-tubules. Both C 3 SD and H- 89 reduced pLTCC staining at the z-lines but did not affect staining of total LTCC or Cav- 3. These data are consistent with the idea that the effects of C 3 SD and H- 89 share a common pathway, which involves PKA and is maximally inhibited by H- 89, and suggest that Cav- 3 plays an important role in mediating stimulation of ICa at the t-tubules via PKA-induced phosphorylation under basal conditions, and in response to β 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation...|$|E

The present study was aimed at investigating the role of P-adrenoceptor subtypes and catecholamine removal mechanisms in the adrenergic chronotropic response during the early post natal period. Right atria isolated from immature (0 - 21 day old) and adult (4 - 6 month old) rats were used for determination of the responsiveness to agonists and quaraitation of the transcripts of proteins involved in beta-adrenergic signaling. The main results were: (a) the maximum response (R-max) to norepinephrine increased with age, whereas sensitivity decreased; (b) age dependent differences in sensitivity to nor epinephrine were abolished by inhibition of the neuronal norepinephrine transporter; (c) R-max to isoproterenol was similar in immature and adult atria, and depressed only in the former by beta(2) -adrenoceptor blockade with ICI 118, 551; (d) neonatal atria showed greater beta(2) -adrenoceptor mRNA levels, and more prominent positive chronotropic response to the beta(2) - and beta(3) -adrenoceptor agonists <b>zinterol</b> and YM 178, respectively (nanomolar range); (e) in atria of immature rats, transcript levels of the extraneuronal monoamine transporter were lower, and its inhibition did not affect sensitivity to isoproterenol; and (f) reactivity to forskolin and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine was not affected by age. The increased beta(2) - and beta(3) -adrenoceptor participation in the adrenergic chronotropic response, in addition to weaker catecholamine removal, may compensate for the immature cardiac innervation and the apparently reduced efficiency of beta(1) -adrenoceptor signaling in the neonate, increasing the responsiveness to endogenous and exogenous beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonists.

Medullectomy (MED) of 24 -day-old female rats depressed both spontaneous diurnal changes in plasma epinephrine (EPI), and the EPI and norepinephrine (NE) response to decapita-tion, without affecting corticosterone (B) levels. Vaginal opening and first ovulation were delayed in MED rats. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were normal in MED rats, but those of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PrI) were depressed. MED reduced the ovarian weight response to pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and the ovarian steroidal response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in vitro, but it did not affect ovarian 1 -adrenergic receptors.

Peak Ba 2 + current (IBa) in freshly isolated rabbit portal vein smooth muscle cells was significantly increased by bath application of 0. 5 μm isoproterenol (isoprenaline; ISO) when measured using the whole-cell patch clamp method (53 ± 3 % increase, n = 15). Stimulation of IBa by ISO was partially reversed by a PKA inhibitor, KT 5720, or a PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, and completely blocked when cells were pretreated with both KT 5720 and calphostin C. Dialysis of cells with polyclonal antibody to Gαs significantly reduced but did not completely eliminate ISO-induced stimulation of IBa. The remaining stimulation was abolished by calphostin C. Dialysis of cells with a polyclonal antibody to Gβ also significantly reduced ISO-induced stimulation and the remaining stimulation was abolished by KT 5720.

The number of binding sites determined with 125 I-labeled CYP closely agreed with that determined with two other tritiated radioligands: [3 H]dihydroalprenolol and [3 H]CGP- 12, 177. Since 125 I-labeled CYP does not discriminate between beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenoceptors, the densities of the two receptor subtypes were determined from the competition curves of 125 I-labeled CYP by highly selective beta 1 -antagonists (bisoprolol, ICI- 89, 406, CGP- 20, 712 A, and LK- 204, 545). Moreover, in order to enable correlation with binding data, the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity and of lipolysis was tested with various beta-agonist and antagonist compounds. The results obtained on fat cell membranes from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue demonstrated the following. 1) 125 I-labeled CYP represents a valuable tool for the quantification and the delineation of beta-receptor subtypes. 2) The presence of sodium ions in binding buffers causes a modification of the affinity of beta-sites for some beta-antagonists. 3) The human fat cell beta adrenergic receptor population defined by nonselective radioligands is composed of two subtypes that can be interpreted in terms of classic beta 1 - and beta 2 -adrenergic receptor subtypes as assessed by competition studies with highly selective antagonists; beta 2 -sites are predominant (60 - 70 % of 125 I-labeled CYP sites) in the adipocytes of slightly overweight women. 4) Results {{support the idea that}} beta 1 - as well as beta 2 -adrenergic receptors are coupled with adenylate cyclase and involved in the induction of lipolysis. 5) The results focus on the interest in some beta 2 -agonist drugs (<b>zinterol,</b> clenbuterol) as partial inductors of lipolysis, with the lipolytic efficacies of these compounds being well correlated with their efficacies at 125 I-labeled CYP sites...|$|E

We therefore determined the effects of <b>zinterol</b> (0. 1 μM; zint-β 2 -AR) to stimulate ICa,L in atrial myocytes in the absence (+PKA) and presence (-PKA) of the PKA inhibitor (1 μM) KT 5720 and compared these results with atrial myocytes attached to laminin (+LMN). Inhibition of Raf- 1 (10 μM GW 5074), phospholipase C (PLC; 0. 5 μM edelfosine), PKC (4 μM chelerythrine) or IP 3 receptor (IP 3 R) signaling (2 μM 2 -APB) significantly inhibited zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L in-PKA but not +PKA myocytes. Western blots showed that zint-β 2 -AR stimulation increased ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation in-PKA compared to +PKA myocytes. Adenoviral (Adv) expression of dominant negative (dn) -PKCα, dn-Raf- 1 or an IP 3 affinity trap, each inhibited zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L in + LMN myocytes compared to control +LMN myocytes infected with Adv-βgal. In +LMN myocytes, zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L was enhanced by adenoviral overexpression of wild-type cPLA 2 and inhibited by double dn-cPLA 2 S 505 A/S 515 A mutant compared to control +LMN myocytes infected with Adv-βgal. In-PKA myocytes depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores by 5 μM thapsigargin failed to inhibit zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L via cPLA 2. However, disruption of caveolae formation by 10 mM methyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibited zint-β 2 -AR stimulation of ICa,L in-PKA myocytes significantly more than in +PKA myocytes. We conclude that inhibition of PKA removes inhibition of Raf- 1 and thereby allows β 2 -AR stimulation to act via PKCα/Raf- 1 /MEK/ERK 1 / 2 and IP 3 -mediated Ca 2 + signaling to stimulate cPLA 2 signaling within caveolae.

Haemoglobin (50 μm), a NO scavenger, also enhanced ACh-induced inhibition when ICa,l was stimulated by ZIN-β 2 -ARs, but not when stimulated by FEN-β 2 -ARs. ACh-induced inhibition of ICa,l stimulated by ZIN-β 2 -ARs was not affected by 10 μm 1 H-[1, 2, 4] oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a] quinoxaline- 1 -one (ODQ) a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, but was significantly enhanced by 500 μm reduced glutathione or 100 μm dithiothreitol, agents that act as sinks for S-nitrosylation. ACh-induced inhibition was smaller when ICa,l was stimulated by spermine/NO, a NO donor, than by milrinone, a phosphodiesterase type III inhibitor. ISO (ISO-β 1 /β 2 -AR stimulation) increased ICa,l and even though ISO releases NO, ACh prominently inhibited ICa,l. This inhibitory effect of ACh was enhanced by l-NIO. Stimulation of ZIN-β 2 -ARs increased intracellular NO, whereas ISO-β 1 -ARs or FEN-β 2 -ARs failed to increase intracellular NO. These results indicate that in atrial myocytes, NO released by selective β 2 -AR stimulation prevents ACh-induced inhibition of ICa,l stimulated by β 2 -ARs. NO acts via a cGMP-independent, S-nitrosylation mechanism. Although FEN acts via β 2 -ARs, it fails to stimulate Gi-/NO signalling and preferentially stimulates Gs-/adenylate cyclase signalling, similar to β 1 -ARs. These findings indicate that NO signalling modulates muscarinic receptor inhibition of atrial function stimulated by β 2 -ARs...|$|E
