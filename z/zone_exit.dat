40|$|Rip {{currents}} are {{the main}} cause of beach rescues and fatalities. Key drivers of rip current hazard are: (1) fast current speeds; and (2) the exit rate of floating material from inside to outside of the surf <b>zone.</b> <b>Exit</b> rates may vary temporally, such as due to Very Low Frequency (VLF) motions, which have a period on the order of 10 minutes. However, there is little field data to determine the driver(s) of exit rate. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine rip current circulation patterns, and specifically, determine their relationship to surf zone exits, on a high-energy dissipative beach. Three days of field measurements were undertaken at Ngarunui Beach, New Zealand. Three daily surf zone flow patterns were found: (1) alongshore; (2) surf zone eddy with high exit rate; and (3) surf zone eddy with no exits. There were strong infragravity peaks in energy within the surf zone, at 30 - 45 s, although none at VLF (~ 10 minute) frequencies. Further research is underway to determine what drove the high surf <b>zone</b> <b>exit</b> rate observed at Ngarunui Beach. 4 page(s...|$|E

One configuration of increasing {{interest is the}} staged, rich burn - quick mix - lean burn (RQL) combustor. This report summarizes an investigation conducted in a recently developed high pressure gas turbine combustor facility. The model RQL combustor was plenum fed and modular in design. The fuel {{used for this study}} is Jet-A which was injected from a simplex atomizer. Emission (CO 2, CO, O 2, UHC, NOx) measurements were obtained using a stationary exit plane water-cooled probe and a traversing water-cooled probe which sampled from the rich <b>zone</b> <b>exit</b> and the lean zone entrance. The RQL combustor was operated at inlet temperatures ranging from 367 to 700 K, pressures ranging from 200 to 1000 kPa, and combustor reference velocities ranging from 10 to 20 m/s. Variations were also made in the rich zone and lean zone equivalence ratios. Several significant trends were observed. NOx production increased with reaction temperature, lean zone equivalence ratio and residence time and decreased with increased rich zone equivalence ratio. NOx production in the model RQL combustor increased to the 0. 4 power with increased pressure. This correlation, compared to those obtained for non-staged combustors (0. 5 to 0. 7), suggests a reduced dependence on NOx on pressure for staged combustors. Emissions profiles suggest that rich zone mixing is not uniform and that the rich zone contributes on the order of 16 percent to the total NOx produced...|$|E
40|$|Background: Low {{back pain}} due to {{degenerative}} lumbar spine {{is one of}} the most common presenting complaints in out-patient and orthopaedic clinics. While most cases usually resolve in few weeks, 2 % of them develop radiculopathy and need further radiological investigations. Regardless of age and occupation of patients, back pain is a common cause of disability and gives a great personal and social impact to the individual and families, and economic burden to the society. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the gold standard imaging modality for investigation of degenerative disc disease for its superior soft tissue contrast, multiplanar imaging capability and non-ionizing property. Changes of degenerative intervertebral discs are well-demonstrated. Disc herniations, thickened ligamentum flavum and osteophytosis cause narrowing of neuroforamina, and further compromise the spinal cord and exiting nerve roots. Therefore, MRI is valuable to determine the degree of stenosis and level of compression, and hence, used as a guide to aid plan of surgical decompression. Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) {{is one of the}} surgical technique of nerve root decompression using posterior approach. In PLIF procedure, incision is made at midline at the back. This is followed by laminectomy to gain access to the intervertebral disc space. Discectomy is then performed and disc materials are replaced with disc spacer to restore disc height. It was postulated that PLIF procedure is able to restore foraminal height and therefore relieved nerve root compression without foraminotomy. Objectives: To study the improvement of exit foramina and lateral recess stenosis in patients with back pain who underwent Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF), using MRI as diagnostic tool, to correlate the MRI findings with clinical symptoms and to determine whether disc spacer height is a good predictor for improvement of lateral recess and exit foramina. Methodology: It is a cross-sectional, observational study of patients with back pain due to degenerative disc disease who underwent Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion (PLIF) in Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II from June 2007 till June 2010. Patients’ clinical symptoms were assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) pre- and postprocedure. MRI lumbosacral pre and post PLIF were analysed in axial and sagittal views. The depth of the lateral recess and exit foramina were measured at mid <b>zone,</b> <b>exit</b> zone and far lateral zone, and compared pre and post PLIF. The height of the disc spacer was measured at mid sagittal views. Mean difference of lateral recess and exit foramina size before and after procedure were analysed using paired t-test, and correlated with ODI score using Pearson’s correlation test. Correlation test was also used to determine whether disc spacer height is a good predictor for improvement of lateral recess and exit foramina size. Results: From 39 patients underwent PLIF in Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II, 25 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria with 43 lumbar segments available for analysis. Increment of lateral recess and exit foramina measurements post PLIF were observed at all levels which was statistically significant (p 0. 05). It was also noted that the height of the disc spacer was not a predictor for increment of exit foramen (p> 0. 05) Conclusion: Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion is proven to restore depth of lateral recess and exit foramen. Patients underwent PLIF had significant good surgical outcome. The difference of disc spacer height used in the procedure did not determine the increment of exit foramina. Therefore, current practice of using disc spacer height according to adjacent disc height is an acceptable method...|$|E

The results illustrated nerve-vessel conflicts (or cholesteatoma) to be located at the root <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> of the facial nerve in all cases. The root <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> is where the central glial axonal insulation of the nerve ends and the peripheral nerve axonal myelination begins.

The identities of moving objects are maintained when they are traveling from one cam-era to another. Appearance information and spatio-temporal information are explored and combined in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. In computing appearance probability, a two-layered histogram represen-tation is proposed to incorporate spatial information of objects. Diffusion distance is employed to histogram matching to compensate for illumina-tion changes and camera distortions. In deriving spatio-temporal prob-ability, transition time distribution between each pair of entry <b>zone</b> and <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Experimen-tal results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ...|$|R

The histological studies showed demyelination in the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal dorsal and ventral spinal roots {{and to a lesser}} extent in the spinal cord, including the dorsal root entry and ventral root <b>exit</b> <b>zones.</b> The electrophysiological studies demonstrated reduced conduction velocities between the lumbar ventral roots and sciatic nerve. Conduction block was demonstrated at the ventral root <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> of the lumbar spinal cord but was less severe than in rats with whole spinal cord-induced acute EAE. Recordings of the M wave and H reflex elicited in a hindfoot muscle by sciatic nerve stimulation showed a normal M wave, indicating normal peripheral nerve motor conduction, but a markedly reduced H reflex. The reduction in the H reflex is accounted for by demyelination-induced nerve conduction block in the dorsal and ventral spinal roots, intramedullary ventral roots and at the dorsal root entry and ventral root <b>exit</b> <b>zones</b> of the spinal cord. Demyelination and nerve conduction abnormalities were well established in the relevant lumbar segments on the day of onset of hindlimb weakness.

The highest community diversity, richness index, evenness index, and dominance index were light <b>zone</b> of <b>exit</b> (2. 7996), light zone of entrance (4. 5399), light zone of exit(0. 9196) and weak-light <b>zone</b> of <b>exit</b> (0. 1868), respectively. Index of similarity between light zone of entrance and light <b>zone</b> of <b>exit</b> (0. 6248) was highest.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the hemodynamic characteristics of lateral carotid artery aneurysms in a canine model {{and to determine}} their influence on coils and balloons. Materials and Methods: Forty aneurysms were created in fourteen dogs and their hemodynamic characteristics and influence on coils and balloons were evaluated with angiography and color Doppler pre- and postplacement. Twenty aneurysms were treated with coils, eight with balloons, and 12 aneurysms served as controls. Results: The aneurysms demonstrated three distinct zones of flow: 1) an inflow zone entering at the distal aspect of the aneurysm ostium, 2) an outflow <b>zone</b> <b>exiting</b> at the proximal ostium, and 3) a central slow flow vortex. The inflow zone is a determining factor in the placement and stability of coils and balloons placed within the aneurysm and in the thrombosis of an aneurysm.

40|$|AbstractWire drawing {{produced}} by extrusion process prevents tensile failures of wire, increases the production rate, reduces friction at die/billet interface, and enhances {{the surface finish}} and die life. The wire drawing of low strength ductile materials by direct extrusion process involves both {{the application of the}} extrusion pressure and the drawing force on the billet material. The lubricated zones (inlet zone, contact/work <b>zone,</b> and <b>exit</b> <b>zone)</b> formed at the interface of die and billet in the drawing process have significant influence {{on the quality of the}} finished product. An accurate analysis and determination of minimum film thickness in the inlet zone leads to the accurate modeling of the lubricating work zone. The grain refinement and strain hardening effects of material predominate in the work zone due to deformation of the billet. Thus, the accurate determination of friction stress in the work zone at die/billet interface in wire drawing process at various operating parameters is a vital issue. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to investigate friction stress at die/billet interface in the work zone in presence of three different lubricants (η 0 = 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3 Pa-s) considering lubricants’ starvation at different operating parameters using Lobatto quadrature technique in thermo-plasto-hydrodynamic analysis of interface.
