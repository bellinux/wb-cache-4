50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> {{smoke is}} grey-white and {{consists}} of tiny particles of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride.</b> The most common mixture for generating these is a <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> smoke mixture (HC), consisting of hexachloroethane, grained aluminium and zinc oxide. The smoke consists of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride,</b> <b>zinc</b> oxychlorides, and hydrochloric acid, which absorb the moisture in the air. The smoke also contains traces of organic chlorinated compounds, phosgene, carbon monoxide, and chlorine.|$|R
25|$|The use of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> as a flux, {{sometimes}} {{in a mixture}} with ammonium <b>chloride</b> (see also <b>Zinc</b> ammonium <b>chloride),</b> involves the production of HCl and its subsequent reaction with surface oxides. <b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> forms two salts with ammonium chloride: (NH4)ZnCl4 and (NH4)3ClZnCl4, which decompose on heating liberating HCl, just as <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> hydrate does. The action of <b>zinc</b> chloride/ammonium <b>chloride</b> fluxes, for example, in the hot-dip galvanizing process produces H2 gas and ammonia fumes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> {{hydroxide}} monohydrate is a zinc {{hydroxy compound}} with chemical formula Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O. It {{is often referred}} to as tetrabasic <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> (TBZC), basic <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride,</b> <b>zinc</b> hydroxychloride, or zinc oxychloride. It is a colorless crystalline solid insoluble in water. Simonkolleite has been shown to be a desirable nutritional supplement for animals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> {{is highly}} soluble in water. The {{solution}} used in saturating {{the paper was}} 70 Baume in density (1.93 specific gravity) and about 110°F. This is roughly a 70% percent <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> solution. <b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> is a mild lewis acid with a solution pH of about 4. <b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> can dissolve cellulose, starch, and silk. The <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> used in making vulcanized fibre swelled and gelatinized the cellulose. The fibre swelling explains why paper filters cannot be used to filter <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> solutions. It is also the reason why a number of paper plies were used to build up to the desired vulcanized fibre thickness, rather treating a single paperboard thickness. For instance, the practice was to use 8 paper plies of 4 mm thickness each, {{as opposed to a}} single paperboard ply of 32 mm.|$|R
25|$|Five {{hydrates}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> are known: ZnCl2(H2O)n with n = 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3 and 4. The tetrahydrate ZnCl2(H2O)4 crystallizes from aqueous solutions of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Concentrated aqueous {{solutions}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> (more than 64% weight/weight <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> in water) {{have the}} interesting property of dissolving starch, silk, and cellulose. Thus, such solutions cannot be filtered through standard filter papers. Relevant to its affinity for these materials, ZnCl2 {{is used as}} a fireproofing agent and in fabric [...] "refresheners" [...] such as Febreze.

30|$|Chitosan was {{provided}} by M/s. India Sea Foods, Cochin, Kerala, India. <b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> and sodium hydroxide were supplied by M/s. S. D. Fine Chem. Ltd. Mumbai, India. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized from chitosan, <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> and sodium hydroxide.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the paper}} plies were {{saturated}} with the gelatinizing <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride,</b> they were pressed together. The pressing allowed intimate contact of the cellulose fibres, thus promoting bonding between the cellulose chains. Once the bonding was established, {{the process of}} leaching out the <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> from the vulcanized fibre could begin. The leaching (removal by diffusion out) of the <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> was accomplished by subjecting the vulcanized fibre to successively less concentrated baths of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride.</b> The rate at which this could occur was constrained by osmotic forces. If {{the rate at which}} the vulcanized fibre was subjected to lower and lower concentrations of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> solution were too rapid, the osmotic forces could result in ply separations. The final leaching bath concentration was 0.05% zinc chloride.Thicknesses up to 0.093”, can be made on continuous lines that stretch up to 1,000 feet (305m) in length.|$|R
50|$|For {{thickness}} above 0.093” {{and up to}} 0.375”, {{a discrete}} laminated sheet (similar in size (l x w) to plywood) was produced by the cutdown process. The cutdown sheets were racked and moved from vat to vat by overhead tracked cranes. Each vat was successively less concentrated until the desired 0.05% was reached. The thicker the material, the longer it took to leach the <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> to 0.05%. For the thickest products, times of 18 months to 2 years were needed. The <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> used in these processes was {{for the most part}} not consumed in achieving the desired bonding. Indeed any dilution of the <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> resulting from the leaching was dealt with by using evaporators to bring the <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> solution back to the 70 Baume needed for using it again for saturating. In a sense, <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> {{can be thought of as}} a catalyst in the making of the vulcanized fibre.|$|R
25|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> is {{the name}} of {{chemical}} compounds with the formula ZnCl2 and its hydrates. <b>Zinc</b> <b>chlorides,</b> of which nine crystalline forms are known, are colorless or white, and are highly soluble in water. ZnCl2 itself is hygroscopic and even deliquescent. Samples should therefore be protected from sources of moisture, including the water vapor present in ambient air. <b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> finds wide application in textile processing, metallurgical fluxes, and chemical synthesis. No mineral with this chemical composition is known aside from the very rare mineral simonkolleite, Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O.|$|R
40|$|Zinc Hydrogen or oxide is soluble {{in an aqueous}} {{solution}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride,</b> and when a concentrated solution is diluted with water, a basic salt, an oxychloride of zinc is precipitated.

40|$|The alumina/silica with <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> aerogel {{alkylation}} catalyst {{was obtained}} using a one step sol-gel synthesis, and subsequent drying with supercritical carbon dioxide. The aerogel catalyst activity {{was found to}} be higher compared to the corresponding xerogel catalyst, {{as a result of the}} higher aerogel surface area, total pore volume and favourable pore size distribution. Mixed AlOSi bonds were present in both gel catalyst types. Activation by thermal treatment in air was needed prior to catalytic alkylation, due to the presence of residual organic groups on the aerogel surface. The optimal activation temperature {{was found to be}} in the range 185  225 °C, while higher temperatures resulted in the removal of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> from the surface of the aerogel catalyst with a consequential decrease in the catalytic activity. On varying the <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> content, the catalytic activity of the aerogel catalyst exhibited a maximum. High <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> contents decreased the catalytic activity of the aerogel catalyst as the result of the pores of the catalyst being plugged with this compound, and the separation of the alumina/silica support into Al-rich and Si-rich phases. The surface area, total pore volume, pore size distribution and <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> content had a similar influence on the activity of the aerogel catalyst as was the case of xerogel catalyst and supported <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> catalysts...|$|R

The present study was aimed to investigate separate and combined treatment effects of crocin and <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> on blood levels of zinc and metabolic and oxidative parameters in diabetic rats. Materials and Methods:Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of 50 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ) and was confirmed by blood glucose levels higher than 250 mg/dL. After confirmation of diabetes, injections (i. p.) of crocin and <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> were performed for six weeks.

40|$|Background: The {{control of}} parenchymal hemorrhage, {{especially}} in liver parenchyma, despite surgical science progresses, {{is still one}} of the challenges surgeons face saving the patientsâ�� lives; and there is a research challenge between the researchers in this field to introduce a more effective method. This study aimed to determine the hemostatic effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> on controlling the bleeding from liver parenchymal tissue. Methods: In this animal model study, 60 male Wistar rats were used. An incision with length of 2 and depth of 0. 5 cm was made on each mouseâ��s liver and the hemostasis time was measured using <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 25, and 50) and the control method (i. e. control of bleeding via suturing). Findings: In all the groups, complete hemostasis occurred; the hemostasis times of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration groups were significantly less than that of the control group (P < 0. 001). At concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> and suture group, pathological grade one was seen. In addition, in the 25 and 50 <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> groups, pathological grade two was the most common grade (70 and 80, respectively). Conclusion: <b>Zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> is an effective hemostatic agent in controlling liver parenchymal tissue hemorrhage in an animal model; it can control the liver bleeding, also at the lowest concentration (5).

40|$|ABSTRACT Zinc {{absorption}} {{as measured}} by body retention of [65 Zn]zinc chloride or a turkey test meal extrinsically labeled with 65 Zn was determined in human subjects by whole body counting after 7 days. Average 6 tZn absorption from <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> in persons with a high iron-absorbing capacity was similar to persons with a low capacity to absorb iron. Inorganic iron, 920 mol (51 mg), or HB iron, 480 imol (26 mg), inhibited 6 tZn absorption from 92 imol (6 mg) of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride.</b> When 610 imol of iron (34 mg) was added to a turkey test meal containing 61 mol of zinc (4 mg), 6 tZn absorption was not inhibited. Tin, 306 imol (36 mg), given with <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> or turkey test meals (61 mol, 4 mg, of Zn) significantly reduced 65 Zn absorption. Copper, 79 pmol (5 mg), had no {{significant effect on the}} 65 Zn absorption from 7. 9 gmol (0. 5 mg) of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride.</b> In summary, the capacity to absorb iron did not influence 65 Zn absorption, but both inorganic iron and heme-iron inhibited 65 Zn absorption from <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride.</b> Inorganic iron had no effect, however, on 6 tZn absorption from the turkey test meal.

40|$|Background & objectives: Zinc {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} trace elements is needed for proper functioning of the nervous system and homeostasis. Many studies show that stress causes memory impairment through various mechanisms, including oxidative stress induction and some mechanisms which are directly effecting brain function. So, in this work we assessed the effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> on passive avoidance memory and oxidative stress following acute stress in male rats. Methods: In this study, 50 male Wistar rats were used in five groups: control, sham, stress, <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> treatment and <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> treatment before stress induction. For stress induction, rats were restrained (not immobilized) for 6 h/day, 7 days in a Plexiglas restrainer, and treated rats received an oral dose of <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> 32 mg/kg/day by gavage for 6 days. At the end of the experiment, passive avoidance memory was avaluated by shuttle box and some oxidative damage markers were determined in all groups. Results: Results of this study showed that animals which were exposed to stress showed a significant decrease in passive avoidance memory compared to control group (p< 0. 01) and the oxidative stress parameters in this group showed significant changes compared to the control group (p< 0. 05). While passive avoidance memory and oxidative stress parameters in group treated with <b>zinc</b> <b>chloride</b> were nearly closed to control group.
