Its first Chairperson was Sarojini Poula Reddy, a Congress Party Member of the State Assembly. The first Vice Chairman and chief executive officer, was Vasant Bawa, of the Indian Administrative Services. The HUDA's first activities were in the Hyderabad metropolitan area. In early 1976 the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT) from Ahmedabad was engaged to prepared a <b>zonal</b> <b>plan,</b> and Christopher Charles Benninger was engaged to prepare a low income township at Yousufguda, which included more than 2000 [...] "growing houses" [...] on plots ranging from two hundred to one thousand square feet. The idea {{was to provide a}} hygienic wet core for each house, a plinth and to allow the participants to construct their won homes. Paved footpaths, street lighting, water supply and sewerage were provided. Participants were extended low interest loans through the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO), a central development finance agency. The Authority is currently {{in the process of being}} expanded to form the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority(HMDA).|$|E
40|$|Due to spatial {{separation}} between points of distribution and consumption, a vital feature of retailing is {{the provision of}} delivery services by customers, retailers, or transport intermediaries. Some store retailers, many Internet retailers, and most transport intermediaries use a "multizone pricing plan" or a "generalized N-zone menu plan". We extend spatial pricing theory to encompass multizone plans. We prove that the optimal number of zones varies {{with the level of}} demand "relative" to the spatial dispersion of customers, and with the cost of implementing a <b>zonal</b> <b>plan.</b> We show that a small number of zones capture almost all the profit attainable with a spatially discriminatory plan.

The habitats in this region are classified as proritary under the nature conservation point of view. During the LACOPE project (Large Scale Extensive Grazing Systems in Europe) it was developed a linear programming model that simulated several agrarian political cenarys and how these measures influenced the land uses, economic sustainability of the farms and the survival of the habitats. In this work we present the results of the modelling process and the several political measures, agricultural and others, that influenced and modelated the landscape since the XIX Century. The <b>Zonal</b> <b>Plan</b> of Castro Verde {{was one of the few}} measures that have succeed to maintain some economic sustainability and the nature conservation purposes. According with the modelization process and bibliography the grazing system is not sustainable but is essential for the maintenance of the steppic birds.

40|$|This paper {{approaches}} {{the importance and}} role of urban plans in spatial planning. Generally, these plans have {{the character of a}} specific regulation, establishing rules and outlining directives for the development of localities, determining the areas to be built and the areas with no constructions in a certain locality, assigning the functions in localities, thus influencing the development and organization of the territory. Any construction or any investment is {{made on the basis of}} such a plan (General Urban <b>Plan,</b> <b>Zonal</b> Urban <b>Plan,</b> and Detailed Urban Plan) following the legislation and the plans for that specific territory at that moment. The wider territorial plans (plans made for the national territory or at a county scale) and the present urban legislation regulate the manner of intervention on a territory through urban plans. However, the urban regulations apply differently according to the specificity of the rural area, taking into account the cultural influences, the traditions, customs, the relief forms, population, etc. (i. e. the General Urban Plan for Săvădisla – Hungarian influences in land planning, the General Urban Plan of Râşca, the General Urban Plan of Unguraş – planning influenced by the landscape). The <b>Zonal</b> Urban <b>Plan</b> and the Detailed Urban Plan are documents that have the role of modifying the regulations of the general urban plan, establishing new requirements for building regime and spatial arrangement (ex. <b>Zonal</b> Urban <b>Plan</b> of Călăţele holiday village - planning of a tourist area), taking into account the area’s specificity and the needs of the community, the territorial offer etc. The urban plans can contribute to the spatial development of a locality by setting the functions and facilities, yet they can also restrict and limit the way in which a rural locality develops...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} housing {{affordability}} in Nigerian urban centre s largely {{affected by the}} involvement of estate agent and building plan approval cost. It aims at examining {{the effects of these}} two factors on housing affordability in Nigerian urban centre with particular reference to Ibadan urban centre. The study utilised the qualitative approach through direct observation, photographs and personal interviews with the aid of unstructured questionnaire among 45 participants. Content analyses were used to evaluate the results of the method. The study revealed that, land value is likely to increase in the future as long as estate agents continue to play an intermediary role between the buyers and suppliers. This will consequently affect housing affordability. The involvement of estate agent and high cost of building plan approval at the <b>zonal</b> <b>planning</b> authority {{play a significant role in}} housing affordability for majority of households and in the expansion of unauthorised housing settlements...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{negative}} gradient between {{socio-economic status}} and prevalence of non-communicable disease in adulthood has prompted investigation of potential foundations based in childhood. The {{objective of the}} present study is to examine the influence of socio-geographical variations and socioeconomic status on health-related physical fitness in adolescents from a large population-based sample of Colombian ninth graders. Methods: During the 2014 – 2015 school years, we examined a cross-sectional component of the SER Study is a cross-sectional Body mass, height, muscular fitness (standing broad jump and handgrip tests) and cardiorespiratory fitness (20 m shuttle-run) were measured in n= 52, 204 14 – 16 -year-olds. Area-level socioeconomic status was categorized from 1 to 6. A model was built by means of a step-by-step process and gradient maps were created to show physical fitness in the quartiles and the trend of physical fitness across disaggregated in <b>Zonal</b> <b>Planning</b> Units (in Spanish UPZ) in Bogotá, for each of the five health-related physical fitness variables. Results: Socioeconomic status was used as the only group-level variable and this had a significant effect on the models for all health-related physical fitness parameters except for handgrip. Cardiorespiratory fitness, standing broad jump, and body mass index increased 6. 31, 2. 69, and 1. 45 times, respectively, on average with the maximum increase in socioeconomic status categories, when we compared two random individuals in each stratum. Conclusions: Our results suggest a significant association between health-related physical fitness variables and socio-geographical location in ninth grade adolescents from Bogotá, using a multilevel methodological approach. info:eu-repo/date/embargoEnd/ 2018 - 02 - 0...|$|R
50|$|In October 2004, a {{referendum}} {{was held in}} about 420 kebeles in 12 woredas across five zones of the Somali Region to settle the boundary between Oromia and the adjacent Somali Region. According to the official results of the referendum, about 80% of the disputed areas have fallen under Oromia administration, though there were numerous allegations of voting irregularities in many of them. The results led over the following weeks to minorities in these kebeles being pressured to leave. Doba authorities reported 12,000 refugees had fled to their woreda, requesting immediate relief support from NGOs. By late February, the <b>Zonal</b> authorities <b>planned</b> to aid 16,615 refugees in five kebeles, although the Federal Disaster Prevention and Preparation Committee provided assistance to only 5,000 people.|$|R
30|$|Because of {{high oil}} price and {{technology}} advancement in recent years, chemical EOR {{is becoming an}} important option for maintaining sustainable efficient development for mature reservoirs in the future. In this paper, an integrated numerical simulation approach is adopted for Palouge oilfield in South Sudan for chemical EOR feasibility evaluation. The chemical EOR methods are preliminarily screened for the main oil-bearing zones, and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} for chemical flooding are analyzed by comparing technical parameter limits with oilfield parameters. Specifically, the pilot oil zone and areal position selection was determined using a comprehensive method, which is based on <b>zonal</b> injection <b>plan</b> and application experiences. Chemical EOR simulation is performed for sensitivity analysis and different scenarios prediction. Three technical indicators are employed to evaluate the EOR efficiency. Some key physiochemical factors with uncertainty are also analyzed in detail, and this will provide unusual useful information for comprehensive feasibility evaluation. The proposed technical evaluation procedure provides a helpful guidance for chemical EOR feasibility assessment in other analogous reservoirs.|$|R
50|$|The club {{decided in}} 1932 to take Montevideo Wanderers' kit and colours (black and white) as homage to them being the last amateur {{champion}} of Uruguay in 1931. Later when entering a <b>zonal</b> league they <b>planned</b> {{to alter the}} kit design as Universal Ramírez used the same pattern. The current design {{was inspired by the}} red sash over the white kit worn by River Plate, but with the sash in black. This design remains today. The accompanying shorts are typically black (although some seasons they have been white), whilst the accompanying socks are white. In the 2005-06 season, the club wore an unusual green shirt with a white sash as their third kit to play against teams similar in colours (such as Miramar Misiones and Wanderers). In 2007, green was reintroduced in a match against Saprissa of Costa Rica. As of late 2007, it was decided to discontinue use of the green shirt, due to the repetitive defeats against Wanderers and Miramar leading to it being considered a cursed shirt. Red is now used for the third kit.|$|R
40|$|Rational land {{utilization}} {{is necessary}} for arresting the process of land degradation, rehabilitating degraded land, and increasing agricultural production. Assistance to land use planning was initially provided through the UNDP/FAO project ETH/ 78 / 003. The project inventoried and mapped Ethiopia's land and related resources, and identified and characterized economic and sociological factors influencing land use. Although the data assembled were suitable for the identification of areas requiring some form of government intervention, they were not adequate for detailed planning of land resources development projects. A second phase of assistance was provided through project ETH/ 82 / 010 to extend the studies {{to allow for the}} preparation of detailed land use plansProject ETH/ 82 / 010 prepared a Master Land Use Plan for Ethiopia giving an assessment of the ability of available land resources to provide a satisfactory subsistence level for farmers and the population as a whole at the 'awraja' or province level. The Plan highlights several trends that are undermining economic progress in Ethiopia. In particular, increasing population pressure on food and energy resources will result in demands that cannot be met by an expansion of cultivated land at present levels of productivity. Recommendations were therefore made for the immediate allocation of resources for achieving the objectives of increased agricultural and fuel output, improving the nutrition and general welfare of the people, and reducing the rate of population growth. These recommendations should be useful for defining policies at national level and for the regional allocation of resourcesLand use plans for three areas totalling some 900 000 ha were completed at a more detailed scale than had been possible under the Phase I project. These areas, in Borkena, Bichena and Hosaina, were chosen as being representative of specific agro- ecological conditions. The project made detailed, and sometimes area-specific, recommen- dations emanating from the three area studies to guide planning within individual 'weredas' or planning zonesThe programme of developing national capabilities in all aspects of land use planning, an important project objective, was continued through a combination of on-the-job training and formal short-term and long-term overseas training courses. Whilst a core of trained professional staff has been established, there was still a severe shortage of technical and clerical staff. Two <b>zonal</b> land use <b>planning</b> offices were set up in Jimma and Bahar Dar to service the needs of the southwestern and northwestern regions, and plans for a third zonal office were drawn up. These new demands on scarce manpower resources have aggravated the problem of a shortage of support staffLand use planning was a prerequisite for achieving the Government's objective of increased agricultural production on a sustainable basis, and the need for land use plans tailored for different purposes will increase in the future. It was essential that the Land Use Planning and Regulatory Department as the principal agency concerned with land use planning in Ethiopia be strengthened to meet this demand. It was recommended that the Department's role be expanded to coordinate and regulate land use planning activities in the country. The third phase of UNDP/FAO assistance, project ETH/ 87 / 006, would be a first step toward expanding the work undertaken by the Department. In addition to continuing to formulate land use plans, it was recommended that the new project develop an institutional framework so that land use plans could be put into effect; and also that a coherent land use policy be formulated for EthiopiaThere was still a shortage of qualified national personnel, and particular skills and experience were required to develop the institutional and administrative aspects of land use planning that had not yet been addressed. There was a pressing need for the training of Ethiopian personnel in land use planning at various levels, {{as well as in the}} related fields of soil survey, agronomy, ecology, climatology, socio-economics and land evaluation, all of which are essential for plan formulation. In addition to the training component built into the Phase III project, it was recommended that funds be sought from additional sources to support the training programme in land use planning and related disciplines at national, zonal and provincial level...|$|R
