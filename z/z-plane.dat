BABAR’s muon detection system consists of two parts: a hexagonal barrel region and two planar endcap regions each containing 18 layers of iron (∼ 3. 6 λ), with resistive plate chambers within the inter-iron gaps. These chambers have suffered deterioration in performance {{over the past few years}} and are being replaced by limited streamer tube chambers in the barrel. Each layer of the system consists of a set of up to 10 streamer tube modules oriented parallel to the beamline providing the azimuthal coordinate (Φ) and a single “Z-plane ” with strips oriented perpendicular the streamer tubes providing the coordinate (Z) along the beamline.

This study aims to explore the need to redefine the action-level in the head-and-neck imaging protocol in consideration of the intra-fraction movement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a local study of 18 patients treated using the same immobilisation system and setup protocol. Post-treatment orthogonal pair of kilovoltage X-ray images was acquired on {{the first three days}} of treatment. 106 sets of pre- and post-treatment kV X-ray images acquired over 53 fractions were analysed against the treatment planning DRR for calculation of intra-fraction movement. RESULTS: Individual mean intra-fraction movement in all directions ranged from - 1. 8 to 1. 1 mm. Population mean (median) intra-fraction movement in the x-, y-, and <b>z-planes</b> were - 0. 1 mm (0 mm), - 0. 3 mm (- 0. 3 mm) and - 0. 2 mm (- 0. 2 mm) respectively. Intra-fraction movement in all three dimensions, x-, y- and <b>z-planes</b> were considered statistically significant (p< 0. 05). 7 out of 53 fractions (13. 2 %) were highlighted as the combined magnitude of the intra-fraction motion with the uncorrected pre-treatment setup errors had exceeded the boundaries of given margins. CONCLUSIONS: 3 mm-AL was not adequate to account for intra-fraction movement when the CTV-PTV margin was ⩽ 3 mm and should be excluded from the routine imaging protocol and daily image-guided radiotherapy should be employed. Adjusting the action-level to 2 mm would allow a more confident approach in delivery of the prescribed dose in head-and-neck IMRT cases...|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Atlantis: The Lost Empire was notable for using more computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any other Disney {{traditionally}} animated feature. To increase productivity, the directors had the digital artists work with the traditional animators throughout the production. Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation: the Leviathan, the Ulysses submarine and sub-pods, the Heart of Atlantis, and the Stone Giants. During production, after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the Ulysses on paper, Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine, {{to be used as a}} reference for drawing the 3D Ulysses. The final film included 362 digital-effects shots, and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the 2D and 3D artwork. One scene that took advantage of this was the [...] "sub-drop" [...] scene, where the 3D Ulysses was dropped from its docking bay into the water. As the camera floated toward it, a 2D Milo was drawn to appear inside, tracking the camera. The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the 2D and 3D drawings when they were merged. The digital production also gave the directors a unique [...] "virtual camera" [...] for complicated shots within the film. With the ability to operate in the <b>z-plane,</b> this camera moved through a digital wire-frame set; the background and details were later hand-drawn over the wire frames. This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit.|$|E

The images are usually presented with reconstructed three-dimensional (3 D) imaging and its orthogonal (x-, y-and <b>z-planes)</b> images. Spatial relationship of the structures in these orthogonal views is important for diagnosis of diseases as well as planning for treatment. However, the non-standardized positioning of the object during the CBCT data acquisition often induces errors in measurement since orthogonal images cut at different planes might look similar. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposes an effective mapping from the Cartesian coordinates of a cube physically to its respective coordinates in 3 D imaging. Therefore, the object (real physical domain) and the imaging (computerized virtual domain) can be linked up and registered. In this way, the geometric coordination of the object/imaging can be defined and its orthogonal images would be fixed on defined planes.

40|$|Abstract Background Retinitis pigmentosa is {{characterized}} by the sequential loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. The preservation of cones would prevent blindness due to their essential role in human vision. Rod-derived Cone Viability Factor is a thioredoxin-like protein that is secreted by rods and is involved in cone survival. To validate the activity of Rod-derived Cone Viability Factors (RdCVFs) as therapeutic agents for treating retinitis Pigmentosa, we have developed e-conome, an automated cell counting platform for retinal flat mounts of rodent models of cone degeneration. This automated quantification method allows for faster data analysis thereby accelerating translational research. Methods An inverted fluorescent microscope, motorized and coupled to a CCD camera records images of cones labeled with fluorescent peanut agglutinin lectin on flat-mounted retinas. In an average of 300 fields per retina, nine <b>Z-planes</b> at magnification X 40 are acquired after two-stage autofocus individually for each field. The projection of the stack of 9 images is subject to a threshold, filtered to exclude aberrant images based on preset variables. The cones are identified by treating the resulting image using 13 variables empirically determined. The cone density is calculated over the 300 fields. Results The method was validated by comparison to the conventional stereological counting. The decrease in cone density in rd 1 mouse was found to be equivalent to the decrease determined by stereological counting. We also studied the spatiotemporal pattern of the degeneration of cones in the rd 1 mouse and show that while the reduction in cone density starts in {{the central part of the}} retina, cone degeneration progresses at the same speed over the whole retinal surface. We finally show that for mice with an inactivation of the Nucleoredoxin-like genes Nxnl 1 or Nxnl 2 encoding RdCVFs, the loss of cones is more pronounced in the ventral retina. Conclusion The automated platform ℮-conome used here for retinal disease is a tool that can broadly accelerate translational research for neurodegenerative diseases. </p...|$|R

40|$|In vertebrates, cadmium {{exposure}} {{is found to}} cause respiratory, neurological and kidney disorders. At the cellular level, cadmium can damage or modify proteins resulting {{in the production of}} toxic protein aggregates. The formation of protein aggregates can be inhibited by the accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), a class of molecular chaperones. Immunoglobulin binding protein (BiP) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -resident heat shock protein that binds to nascent proteins on entry into the ER and assists in their folding and assembly. Little information is available on the effect of cadmium on BiP accumulation or function in vertebrates. In this study, cadmium treatment of Xenopus laevis A 6 kidney epithelial cells induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in BiP accumulation that was the result of de novo transcription and translation. In cells recovering from cadmium exposure, elevated levels of BiP were still detectable after 48 and 72 h. The exposure of cells to a low concentration of cadmium at 30 °C greatly enhanced BiP accumulation compared to cadmium treatment at 22 °C. Glutathione levels may modulate the UPR since treatment of cells with the glutathione synthesis inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, enhanced cadmium-induced BiP accumulation. Finally, immunocytochemistry revealed that cadmium-induced BiP accumulation occurred primarily in a punctate pattern in the perinuclear region. In some cells treated with 200 μM cadmium or 30 μM MG 132, relatively large BiP antibody staining structures were observed that co-localized with a Proteostat dye that has been used to detect aggregated protein or aggresome-like structures. Analysis of individual <b>z-planes</b> revealed that BiP was detected {{in the center of the}} Proteostat-stained structures. These structures were also observed in cells treated with 100 μM cadmium chloride at 30 °C or 100 μM cadmium chloride after pretreatment with the glutathione inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine. This study has shown for the first time in amphibians that cadmium chloride induced an increase in BiP levels, which is likely to counteract the toxic accumulation of aggregated protein in the ER. The sequestration of protein aggregates by a molecular chaperone may be significant to the understanding of the pathology of certain diseases that result in intracellular inclusion bodies such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyloidosis...|$|R

Note that only some pdf viewers are able to display 3 d pdfs properly. 10 - 12) 3 d_obj_files_part 1. tar. gz, 3 d_obj_files_part 2. tar. gz, and 3 d_obj_files_part 3. tar. gz provide the 3 D mesh coordinates as obj files for each extracted object and a text file of all objects with failed 3 D extractions (15, 023 objects). This dataset accompanies the manuscript "Sixty-one thousand Recent planktonic foraminifera from the Atlantic Ocean" submitted to Scientific Data. The manuscript describes important details related to data collection and usage and should be consulted before using the data provided here. One key note about this dataset is repeated here as a precaution. We provide image classification for only 4 / 5 ths of the complete data set. A random subset (1 / 5 th of the classifications) are excluded as a test set, so that this image database can be used in machine learning...|$|R
