40|$|The {{absorption}} and metabolism of zinc in {{a commercial}} form for oral use (Rubozinc, 15 mg <b>zinc</b> as <b>gluconate)</b> were investigated in 10 subjects by a kinetic study of the serum zinc profile after administration of 45 mg zinc under three conditions: after an overnight fast, during a standardized breakfast, and 2 h after this meal. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by a method suitable to the characterization of rebound effects (recycling of the element in the gastrointestinal tract). In fasting state, the parameters were comparable to those previously collected in the same subjects with oral 45 mg zinc as sulfate, except with very significantly higher Cmax and area under curve (AUC), showing a better bioavailability for zinc in the commercial form. The light meal perturbed the absorption process {{as evidenced by the}} significant increases in the lag time (+ 180 %), the tmax (+ 57 %), and the lag times for the first two cycles during the meal. However, the parameters returned to normal values 2 h after the meal. The Cmax only moderately decreased during the meal (31 %) as did the AUC (- 28 %). An important delay in the absorption of zinc in the commercial form when taken during a meal was therefore demonstrated, but the effect on zinc bioavailability was only moderate.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the effect of folic acid with a combination of selenium and zinc on some biochemical markers of coronary heart diseases (CHD) and some selected hepatic antioxidant enzymes in male experimental animals. Animals and Methods: We assessed CHD risk by measuring the concentrations of homocysteine, lipids, glucose and insulin. Albino rats were classified into four groups each comprised 10 rats. Group I and group II (control groups); rats were orally received 1 ml saline/Kg body weight/day for six and eight weeks respectively. Group III and group IV; rats were orally received a nutritional doses of 100 μg folic acid + 100 μg of selenium + 20 mg of <b>zinc</b> (as <b>gluconate)</b> in 1 ml saline/Kg body weight/day for six and eight weeks respectively. Results: Results indicated that, the investigated nutritional doses were nonsignificantly decreased the level of cardiac troponin-T (cTn-T) and creatine kinase (CK) activity while the level of serum folate was significantly increased (P< 0. 05) as compared with corresponding control groups. At the same time plasma homocysteine decreased by 29. 6 % (P< 0. 01) and 35. 0 % (P< 0. 01) after six and eight weeks of treatment respectively compared to control groups. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and the antioxidant activity of plasma as assessed by ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) were significantly increased (P< 0. 05) while Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were nonsignificantly elevated after six and eight weeks of treatment with the investigated doses. Plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol were unaffected. Conclusion: According to the results presented in this work, it could be concluded that, nutritional doses of folic acid in combination with selenium and zinc at concentrations similar to that present in a healthy diet produced responses consistent with the reduction in CHD risk through the reduction in plasma homocysteine level in male experimental animals...|$|R
40|$|Wilson’s disease (WD) or hepato-lenticular {{degeneration}} {{is a rare}} autosomal-recessive disorder. A prevalence rate of 30 cases {{per million}} and a birth incidence rate of one per 30, 000 to 40, 000 are often quoted. In 40 to 50 % of individuals with WD, hepatic dysfunction is the initial clinical manifestation. With the exception of liver transplantation, treatment of WD is only palliative and intended to restore and maintain copper balance. It does not eliminate the underlying defect responsible for WD. Thus, a lifelong commitment to treatment is required. Limitation of dietary copper intake is generally ineffective, and pharmacological management is necessary. Administered either as acetate, sulfate, or <b>gluconate,</b> <b>zinc</b> reduces intestinal absorption of dietary copper via induction of metallothionein formation in intestinal enterocytes. Antioxidants, mainly vitamin E, may have a role as adjunctive treatment. Serum and hepatic vitamin E levels {{have been found to}} be low in WD. Symptomatic improvement when vitamin E was added to the treatment regimen has been occasionally reported but no rigorous studies have been conducted. No correlation of antioxidant deficiency with clinical symptoms was reported in one study. A vegetarian diet may be useful as adjunctive therapy; copper is less available. Adherence to a low copper diet is most important during the initial phase of treatment.   The recommendation is to avoid the foods highest in copper content:  organ meats, shellfish, chocolate, nuts, and mushrooms.   Once copper levels have stabilized at normal levels, these foods are allowed occasionally. Copper content of the drinking water you consume should also be tested.   If the water is over 0. 1 ppm (parts per million) (which is 0. 1 mg/L), consider an alternative water source or invest in a good filtering system that removes copper.     Keywords: Copper, Nutrition Support, Wilson’s Disease...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{increased}} popularity of herbomineral preparations in the healthcare sector, a new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated consisting of ashwagandha root extract and three minerals viz. <b>zinc</b> chloride, magnesium <b>gluconate,</b> and sodium selenate. The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the in vitro effect of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) on the test formulation using murine splenocyte cells. The herbomineral formulation was divided into two parts; one defined as the control, while the other part was treated with the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment performed from a remote distance by twenty renowned Biofield Energy Healers (The Trivedi Effect®) and defined as the Biofield Treated formulation. The splenocyte cells were exposed to test formulations at concentration from 0. 00001053 to 10. 53 µg/mL and were analyzed after 48 hours for cell viability using MTT assay. The expression of the cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL- 1 β, and MIP- 1 α) was determined using ELISA assay. The cell viability data showed that all the tested concentration ranges were found to be safe with percentage cell viability at more than 80 %. Further, TNF-α expression was significantly inhibited in the Biofield Treated test formulation group with respect to the vehicle control, while at 0. 001053 and 0. 1053 µg/mL, the expression was suppressed by 1. 70 % and 8. 16 %, respectively in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared to the untreated formulation. However, a significant immunosuppression was reported in IFN-γ expression at 0. 00001053, 0. 0001053, 0. 01053, 0. 1053, and 1. 053 µg/mL by 12. 63 %, 2. 31 %, 8. 31 %, 9. 15 %, and 7. 86 %, respectively in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared with the untreated test formulation. The MIP- 1 α expression was inhibited by 8. 31 %, 21. 53 %, and 8. 70 % at 0. 0001053, 0. 01053, and 0. 1053 µg/mL, respectively in the Biofield Treated formulation compared with the untreated test formulation. However, IL- 1 β expression was significantly suppressed by 19. 72 % at concentration 0. 00001053 µg/mL in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared with the untreated test formulation. Thus, the down-regulation of tested cytokines and chemokines in the Biofield Energy Healing test formulation might be applicable for controlling acute and chronic inflammation in many clinical diseases. Overall, the results demonstrated that The Trivedi Effect®- Biofield Energy Healing (TEBEH) has the capacity to potentiate the immunomodulatory activity of the test formulation, which can be useful against autoimmune disorders.

The test formulation was divided into two parts; one was represented as control, while the other part was treated with the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by renowned Biofield Energy Healers (The Trivedi Effect®) and defined as the Biofield Energy Treated formulation. The effect of the test formulation was monitored using humoral immune response, delayed type hypersensitivity, hematology, biochemistry, relative organ weight, and histopathology. The primary hemagglutination (HA) antibody titre level was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) increased by 185. 88 % in the Biofield Energy Treated group (G 3); while 41. 18 % increased in the untreated test formulation group (G 4) as compared to the disease control group (G 2). The secondary HA titre was significantly increased by 540 % (p≤ 0. 001) and 166. 7 % in the G 3 and G 4 groups, respectively as compared to the G 2 group. The secondary HA titre was also increased significantly (p≤ 0. 05) by 193 % in the Biofield Energy Treated group per se at day - 15 (G 6), as compared to the G 2 group. The paw volume data showed an alteration in the G 3 and G 6 groups as compared to the G 2 group. The platelet count was significantly increased by 11. 16 % and 8. 69 % in the G 3 and G 4 groups, respectively as compared to the G 2 group.

It is commonly found in feline diets as zinc ascorbate, <b>zinc</b> <b>gluconate,</b> zinc oxide, or as other types of zinc salts. A cat may absorb anywhere between ten and twenty-five percent of the dietary zinc they consume. Depending on other nutrient levels present, the absorption of zinc in the cat's body may be anywhere within this range. In particular, calcium and phytate are known to decrease zinc absorption. Alternatively, feeding zinc to cats in high concentrations can cause toxicity symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, {{and a lack of}} appetite.|$|E
