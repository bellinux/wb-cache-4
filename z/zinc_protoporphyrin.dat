5|$|One of {{the main}} causes for the {{pathology}} of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, or ALAD (see image of the enzyme structure), which {{is important in the}} biosynthesis of heme, the cofactor found in hemoglobin.

Compared to their referents, boys and girls from the two schools in the polluted area had significantly higher levels of lead in blood (PbB) but similar levels of cadmium (CdB) and <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrins</b> (ZPP). The functional integrity of the kidney was assessed by measuring the urinary excretion of beta 2 -microglobulin, Clara cell protein, retinol-binding protein (RBP), albumin and beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase. The most significant and consistent finding of the study was that children from the two schools in the polluted area showed a significant elevation of the urinary excretion of RBP that paralleled the level of lead in blood or in the dust collected on the school playgrounds. A similar pattern was observed for the prevalence of elevated values of urinary RBP which increased from 3. 9 % in the control area up to 17 % in the most polluted school. Urinary RBP was found to be associated with PbB (partial r 2 = 0. 046, P = 0. 005) in a stepwise regression analysis testing also the influence of age, sex, CdB, and ZPP.

Protoporphyrin and biliverdin were identified and fully characterized by HPLC/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) in all samples, but none contained <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin.</b> The zinc complex of biliverdin, claimed to be an additional pigment responsible for eggshell background colours, was labile to EDTA and acid pH and if occurring naturally could not be extracted intact by the published or the modified protocols. An explanation is advanced for the exceptional report that all porphyrins from uroporphyrin to protoporphyrin were found in eggshells of the fowl Gallus domesticus. A. Gorchein, C. K. Lim and P.

40|$|OBJECTIVE. - To {{evaluate}} in {{a prospective}} fashion {{the association between}} low-level lead exposure and blood pressure. DESIGN. - Prospective cohort study. SETTING. - General population. PARTICIPANTS. - A random population sample (N= 728; 49 % men; age range, 20 - 82 years) was studied in Belgium for 1985 through 1989 and reexamined for 1991 through 1995. MEAN OUTCOME MEASURES. - At baseline and follow-up, blood pressure was measured by conventional sphygmomanometry (15 total readings) and at follow-up also by 24 -hour ambulatory monitoring. Lead exposure was estimated from blood lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentrations. Multivariate analyses controlled for sex, age, body mass index, smoking and drinking habits, physical activity, exposure at work, social class, menopausal status, use of medications (antihypertensive medication, oral contraceptives, hormonal replacement therapy), hematocrit or hemoglobin, serum total calcium concentration, 24 -hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion, and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. RESULTS. - At baseline, mean (SD) systolic/diastolic conventional blood pressure was 130 (17) / 77 (9) mm Hg. The mean blood lead concentration was 0. 42 micromol/L (8. 7 microgram/dL), and the mean <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentration was 1. 0 microgram per gram of hemoglobin. Over the 5. 2 -year median follow-up, the mean blood lead concentration dropped by 32 % (0. 14 micromol/L [2. 9 microgram/dL]) (P<. 001). Small but significant (P<. 01) changes occurred in systolic (- 1. 5 mm Hg) and diastolic (+ 1. 7 mm Hg) conventional blood pressure and in <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentration (+ 0. 5 microgram per gram of hemoglobin). Over the follow-up period, no consistent associations emerged between the changes in conventional blood pressure and in blood lead or <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentrations. In addition, after adjustment for sex, age, and body mass index, blood lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentrations at baseline did not predict the development of hypertension in 47 patients (risk ratio for doubling of the initial lead concentration, 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 7 - 2. 0). In a time-integrated analysis in which each person was characterized by all available measurements, conventional blood pressure did not correlate with blood lead or <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentrations in a consistent manner. Similarly, the mean (SD) 24 -hour blood pressure at follow-up (119 [11]/ 71 [8] mm Hg; N= 684) did not show a consistent relationship with blood lead or <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> concentrations at baseline or at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS. - Lead exposure at the intensity studied (<l. 45 micromol/L [< 30 microgram/dL]) was not consistently associated with increased conventional or 24 -hour blood pressure {{in the general population}} or with increased risk of hypertension. These findings argue against the hypothesis that current lead exposure levels are associated with excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality caused by hypertension. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} of action of lead on cellular metabolism remain largely unknown, despite the known effects of lead on porphyrin and heme biosynthesis {{that have been}} studied for decades. In fact, lead-induced alter-ations in porphyrin metabolism have long formed the bases of tests for the laboratory diagnosis of chronic lead poison-ing. The two particular metabolic derangements that have become common clinical laboratory tests are increased urinary coproporphyrin excretion and accumulation of <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> in erythrocytes. The biochemistry underly-ing these lead-induced changes has attracted much interest but few clear conclusions. Coproporphyrin is a byproduct of nonenzymic oxidation of coproporphyrinogen, the porphyrinogen being the inter-mediate in heme biosynthesis. <b>Zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> accu...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. Nephropathy {{is known}} to occur in persons with heavy {{exposure}} to lead. Whether exposure to lead {{in the general population}} leads to impaired renal function is not known. METHODS. We studied renal function and indexes of lead exposure in a random population sample of 965 men and 1016 women (age range, 20 to 88 years). In all the subjects we measured creatinine clearance and blood concentrations of lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> (an indirect measure of blood lead level). RESULTS. The mean (+/- SD) creatinine clearance rate was 99 +/- 30 ml per minute in the men and 80 +/- 25 ml per minute in the women. In the men the geometric mean blood lead concentration was 114 micrograms per liter (0. 55 mumol per liter) (range, 23 to 725 micrograms per liter [0. 11 to 3. 5 mumol per liter]), and in the women 75 micrograms per liter (0. 36 mumol per liter) (range, 17 to 603 micrograms per liter [0. 08 to 2. 9 mumol per liter]); the <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> values in blood averaged 1. 0 and 1. 1 micrograms per gram of hemoglobin, respectively. The creatinine clearance rate was inversely correlated with blood lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> values in the men and the women both before and after adjustments for age, bodymass index, and diuretic treatment. A 10 -fold increase in blood lead concentration was associated with a reduction of 10 to 13 ml per minute in creatinine clearance. We also found a positive correlation between serum beta 2 -microglobulin (which is inversely related to the glomerular filtration rate) and blood lead in men, between serum beta 2 -microglobulin and <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> in both sexes, and between serum creatinine and <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> in men. CONCLUSIONS. Exposure to lead may impair renal function in the general population. The alternative hypothesis that renal impairment may lead to an increase in the blood lead concentration cannot be excluded, however. status: publishe...|$|E

Lead in blood ranged from 51 - 353 μg/ 1 and lead in hair from 0. 8 - 114 μg/g. It can be concluded that within the range of environmental exposure studied and for the age group concerned, measurement of lead in blood and of the <b>zinc</b> <b>protoporphyrin</b> in blood levels appear to be better biological parameters to assess both total enviromental exposure and health risk than measurement of lead in hair level alone...|$|E
