40|$|Purpose: A {{spectral}} element {{model is}} developed for accurate prediction {{of the dynamic}} characteristics of an axially-traveling strip subjected to a sudden thermal loading. Design/methodology/approach: The spectral element model is formulated from the frequency-dependent dynamic shape functions which satisfy the governing equations in the frequency-domain and its extremely high accuracy is evaluated by comparing with the conventional finite element model in which simple polynomials are used as the shape functions. Also some numerical studies are conducted to investigate the vibration characteristics of an example axially-traveling strip subjected to a sudden thermal loading on its upper surface. Findings: The present spectral element model is shown to provide very accurate dynamic characteristics by treating a whole uniform strip between two boundary supports as a single finite element, regardless of its length, {{when compared with the}} conventional finite element model. Practical implications: Numerical studies for the typical example problem show that the dynamic characteristics of an axially-traveling strip may depend on the traveling speed and the duration and frequency characteristics of the externally applied thermal loading. Originality/value: The spectral element model presented in this paper is the first one for the axially-traveling strips subjected to thermal loadings and is applicable to the engineering problems such as the galvanized steel strip passing through a hot <b>zinc</b> <b>tank,</b> for instance...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{spectral}} element model for accurate prediction {{of the dynamic}} characteristics of an axially moving thin uniform plate subjected to sudden thermal loadings on its surfaces. Design/methodology/approach: First, we have derived the governing equations of motion by using the Hamilton’s principle. Secondly, we have used the wave solutions, which satisfy the governing equations of motion in the frequency domain, as the frequency-dependent shape functions to formulate the spectral element matrix by using the variational approach. Thirdly, the extremely high accuracy of the spectral element model has been evaluated by comparing the dynamic responses obtained by the spectral element analysis with the results obtained by using the conventional finite element analysis. Findings: It has been numerically shown that the present spectral element model provides very accurate dynamic responses of an axially moving uniform plate by treating the whole plate as a single finite element, regardless of its length. Practical implications: Numerical investigations {{have shown that the}} thermally induced vibration characteristics of an axially moving plate depends on the duration and frequency characteristics of externally applied thermal loadings as well as its moving speed. Originality/value: The paper is the first to develop the spectral element model for the axially moving plates subjected to thermal loadings. The present spectral element model {{can be applied to the}} galvanized steel strip passing through a hot <b>zinc</b> <b>tank,</b> for instance...|$|E

Two men stand {{near one}} of 6 large {{rectangular}} tanks located inside a wooden building with a corrugated metal roof. A door is visible behind them at left. At right, behind them is a large vat labeled "poison". Some of the tanks are similarly labeled. A network of pipes interconnects the vat and tanks. Elevated wooden walkways run between the tanks...|$|R

Continuously-stirred <b>tank</b> reactors (CSTR) and plug flow reactors (PFR) in which first order chemical and electrochemical reactions take place are used in these models. The time dependent behaviours of the industrial plants are predicted. Tests with metallic tracers show {{the validity of the}} models.

40|$|The zinc {{present in}} the dead tank wash water of plating {{industry}} is of about 300 ppm approximately. The aim of the experiment was to reduce the zinc content in the effluent. Treatment by ion exchange produces reusable water. Generally dead tank wash water contains about 1 % of the plating bath concentration. If this water is sent as waste the zinc present will be left unused and it pollutes the environment, so the recovery of <b>zinc</b> from dead <b>tank</b> wash water is more important. For this process the synthetic ion exchange resin Amberlite (IR- 120) was used and the resin was regenerated using acid as regenerant. Mass transfer coefficient has been derived for adsorption and desorption, adsorption mass transfer coefficient has been calculated and breakthrough curve have been drawn for experimental values. The result shows that the zinc - recovery process is feasible and effective in ion exchange process...|$|R
40|$|The greater Wellington region, New Zealand, {{is highly}} {{vulnerable}} to large earthquakes {{because it is}} cut by active faults. Bulk water supply pipelines cross the Wellington Fault at several different locations, and there is considerable concern about severe disruption of the provision of reticulated water supplies to households and businesses {{in the aftermath of}} a large earthquake. A number of policy initiatives have been launched encouraging householders to install rainwater tanks to increase post-disaster resilience. However, little attention has been paid to potential health hazards associated with consumption of these supplies. To assess health hazards for householders in emergency situations, six 200 -litre emergency water tanks were installed at properties across the Wellington region, with five tanks being allowed to fill with roof-collected rainwater and one tank being filled with municipal tapwater as a control. Such tanks are predominantly set aside for water storage and, once filled, feature limited drawdown and recharge. Sampling from these tanks was carried out fortnightly for one year, and samples were analysed for E. coli, pH, conductivity, a range of major and trace elements, and organic compounds, enabling an assessment of the evolution of water chemistry in water storage tanks over time. Key findings were that the overall rate of E. coli detections in the rain-fed tanks was 17. 7 %, which is low in relation to other studies. We propose that low incidences of may be due to biocidal effects of high <b>zinc</b> concentrations in <b>tanks,</b> originating from unpainted galvanised steel roof cladding. Lead concentrations were high compared to other studies, with 69 % of rain-fed tank samples exceeding the World Health Organisation’s health-based guideline of 0. 01 mg/L. Further work is required to determine risks of short-term consumption of this water in emergency situations...|$|R
