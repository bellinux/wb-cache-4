The article focusses on finding ways to improve the transfer of EU information to people involved in the <b>zootechnical</b> field living in the rural areas of the Timis County. Studies made pointed out that the small farmers were not properly informed as far as accessing EU financial resources are concerned. The research was triggered by the low rate of absorption funds by the people involved in the <b>zootechnical</b> sector. The transfer of information is analysed in general, and in particular the transfer of information as far as the European Funds for agriculture is concerned. Particular emphasis is on put on presenting the elements of the communication process that have to be met in order to reach the intended communication objectives and find out those which influence the correct deciphering of the message. The analysis is made from the mass communication approach.

40|$|ABSTRACT A non-surgical {{sterilant}} (NSS) {{was used}} {{with the objective of}} assessing the <b>zootechnical</b> performance, carcass and meat quality, and hormone levels. 90 male piglets were selected with birthweights varying between 1. 5 kg to 2. 0 kg. The control group was constituted of 45 males castrated by the conventional surgical method, at the seventh day of age, and the treated group was constituted of 45 males castrated with NSS (active principle of zinc gluconate in the concentration of 26. 2 mg/mL associated to the dimethyl sulfoxide at 0. 5 %), with the application of the first dose on the seventh day of age and the second dose on the fourteenth day of age. The <b>zootechnical</b> assessments were carried out on the farm and consisted: weight gain in the periods per animal and feed conversion. The slaughter of the animals and the assessment of the carcass and meat quality and hormone levels were carried out in a slaughterhouse and the municipality of Campinas (SP).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate reference <b>zootechnical</b> and economic performance indexes, examine the influence of different technological levels on technical and economic results on dairy farms and identify the components that had higher representativeness on total and effective operational cost. Thirty-eight size, <b>zootechnical</b> and economic indicators of 61 milk production systems, grouped according to three technological levels, were analyzed. The data were collected during January 2002 to December 2011 period. It was adopted the structure of the operating cost and the total cost as methodology for calculating the costs. The results were compared by ANOVA test (normal distribution), complemented by LSD test, and Kruskal-Wallis test (non-normal distribution), also complemented by LSD test. The stratification of milk production systems according to technological level does not seem to be a good criterion to be used when it wants to make comparisons between different groups of producers, evidenced by the lack of statistical significance (P> 0. 05) in comparing of size and <b>zootechnical</b> indexes between low and medium technological level groups. Producers of high technological level made investments without proper analysis of return on investment and risk. The items of total and effective operational cost that had higher representativeness were, in descending order, feeding and labor. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to {{demonstrate}} the direct link between the microbial ecosystem of drinking water distribution systems and animal health in pig breeding.

In two representative monitored herds, it was observed that the drinking water distribution pipes, initially fouled by fungi, were replaced by a bacterial film while both veterinary costs and the total feed conversion ratio decreased.

Methods: Comparative analysis of published papers has been conducted from 1910 up to 2014. Results: The comparative analysis revealed the presence of oxytetracycline residues and other antibiotics in food intended for human and animal consumption, which resulted in multisystemic toxic effects.
