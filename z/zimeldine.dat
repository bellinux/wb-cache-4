50|$|Zimelidine (INN, BAN) (brand names <b>Zimeldine,</b> Normud, Zelmid) {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants to be marketed. It is a pyridylallylamine, and is structurally different from other antidepressants.|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{cases of}} the Guillain-Barré {{syndrome}} are reviewed, all occurring with a similar relationship to recent commencement of treatment with the antidepressive drug <b>zimeldine.</b> The risk of developing Guillain-Barré syndrome was increased about 25 -fold among patients receiving <b>zimeldine,</b> {{as compared with the}} natural incidence of the disorder. The cases described provide strong evidence that Guillain-Barré syndrome may occur as a specific, probably immunologically mediated, complication of drug therapy...|$|E
40|$|The {{ejaculatory}} {{response and}} the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) behavioural syndrome induced by 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeODMT) (3 mg kg- 1 i. p.) were studied following acute and repeated treatment of rats with the selective uptake inhibitors of 5 -HT, fluoxetine, <b>zimeldine,</b> alaproclate, and citalopram. The oral doses used {{were based on}} the respective ED 50 values for uptake inhibition. Acute doses of fluoxetine and <b>zimeldine</b> significantly reduced the ejaculatory response when given 48 h before 5 -MeODMT. This blockade was prevented by treatment of the rats with the postsynaptic 5 -HT receptor antagonist methergoline. An acute dose of fluoxetine given 7 and 14 days before 5 -MeODMT significantly enhanced the ejaculatory response. On day 24, the response returned to the control level. Repeated treatment every second day (5 times over 9 days and 10 times over 19 days) with fluoxetine caused a longer blockade of the ejaculatory response and the sensitization of the response came later than after an acute dose. Parallel with the ejaculatory response three other components of the 5 -HT behavioural syndrome also decreased significantly. Acute doses of alaproclate and citalopram significantly blocked the ejaculatory response at 1 h, but they failed to affect the response at any other time point after either acute or repeated treatment. Neither did these drugs attentuate the 5 -HT syndrome. It is concluded that acute and repeated treatment of rats with different selective 5 -HT uptake inhibitors does not produce a common alteration in 5 -HT 2 -receptor functions...|$|E
40|$|Drugs acting at 5 -HT receptors were {{evaluated}} on three animal models of anxiety. On the elevated X-maze test {{the majority of}} 5 -HT 1 agonists {{were found to be}} anxiogenic. However, ipsapirone was anxiolytic and buspirone and gepirone were inactive. The 5 -HT 2 agonist DOI and the 5 -HT 2 antagonist ritanserin were anxiolytic while ICI 169, 369, a 5 -HT 2 antagonist was inactive. All 5 -HT 3 antagonists tested were inactive in this test, while the indirect serotomimetics <b>zimeldine</b> and fenfluramine were anxiogenic. Neither beta-adrenoceptor agonists nor antagonists had reproducible effects on anxiety in this model. Combined beta- 1 /beta- 2 adrenoceptor antagonists reversed the anxiogenic effects of 8 -OH-DPAT while selective beta- 1 or beta- 2 antagonists did not. On the social interaction model the 5 -HT 1 agonists 8 -OH-DPAT, RU 24969 and 5 -MeODMT were anxiogenic and ipsapirone was anxiolytic. The 5 -HT 2 agonist DOI and the beta-adrenoceptor- and 5 -HT- antagonist pindolol were anxiolytic, while the 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 3 antagonists were inactive. In the marble burying test, the 5 -HT upake inhibitors <b>zimeldine,</b> fluvoxamine, indalpine and citalopram, the 5 -HT 1 B/ 5 -HT 1 C agonists mCPP and TFMPP and the 5 -HT 2 / 5 -HT 1 C agonist DOI reduced marble burying without affecting locomotor activity. 5 -HT 1 A agonists and the 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 3 antagonists were without effect. Lesions of the dorsal raphe nucleus reversed the anxiogenic effects of 8 -OH-DPAT in the X-maze model. The implication of these results for the understanding of the pharmacology of 5 -HT in anxiety is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Animal {{studies have}} shown that alcohol {{consumption}} is reduced when serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) levels are increased in the central nervous system. Similarly, studies of alcohol-dependent human subjects have shown that treatment with 5 -HT reuptake inhibitors (i e. <b>zimeldine,</b> citalopram, fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine) decreases the desire to drink alcohol and improves symptoms of alcohol-related anxiety and depression in patients who have undergone detoxification. However, not all {{studies have shown}} them to be an effective treatment to help maintain recovery in alcohol dependence. The exact mechanisms of action of the 5 -HT reuptake inhibitors are not yet fully understood and additional studies are needed. However, at this time, the 5 -HT reuptake inhibitors may be effective pharmacotherapies for alcohol-related depression...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{computerized}} video-image analysis system, spontaneous locomotor activity {{was measured in}} dominant and subordinate individuals of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and in individuals treated with inhibitors of serotonin (5 -HT) synthesis and reuptake. Arctic charr were put together in pairs. After 1 week, subordinate individuals {{were found to have}} elevated brain levels of 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a major 5 -HT metabolite, suggesting an increase in serotonergic activity. The subordinate individuals had significantly lower spontaneous locomotor activity than the dominant fish. Similarly, Arctic charr displayed a significantly reduced locomotor activity when their serotonergic activity was stimulated by the specific 5 -HT re-uptake inhibitor <b>zimeldine.</b> In contrast, fish treated with the 5 -HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine showed a significant increase in locomotor activity. Dominant, subordinate and pharmacologically treated fish all had very similar activity rhythms for the 18 h test period. Thus, neither the previous social experience nor the pharmacological treatment seemed to affect the diurnal activity rhythm per se. Taken together, these results suggest that the brain serotonergic system inhibits locomotor activity and support the possibility that 5 -HT is involved in the inhibition of locomotor activity displayed by subordinate fish...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{repeated}} administration of antidepressant drugs or electroconvulsive shock on the binding of [3 H]-spiperone to the 5 -hydroxytryptamine 2 (5 -HT 2) receptor in mouse frontal cortex and the 5 -HT-mediated head-twitch response have been examined. Repeated electroconvulsive shock increased both the head-twitch response {{and the number}} of 5 -HT 2 binding sites (Bmax). After 35 d but not 24 h or 14 d oral tranylcypromine (5. 6 mg kg- 1 per day) there was a marked decrease in both the behavioural response {{and the number of}} 5 -HT 2 receptors. Repeated oral doses of <b>zimeldine</b> (20 mg kg- 1 per day, 14 days) also decreased the head-twitch response and the number of 5 -HT 2 binding sites and these effects persisted after 48 h withdrawal. Oral mianserin (2. 1 mg kg- 1 per day, 14 days) decreased both the behaviour and the number of 5 -HT 2 binding sites, but this change was also seen after acute (1 day) administration. After 48 h withdrawal from chronic treatment the head-twitch response was still decreased but the Bmax had returned to control values. Desipramine given orally (27 mg kg- 1 per day, 14 days) decreased both the behaviour and number of 5 -HT 2 binding sites. After 48 h withdrawal, binding was still decreased but the head-twitch response was enhanced above control values. In contrast to repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS), all drugs decreased both 5 -HT 2 binding and the head-twitch response, while the mice were still on treatment.

40|$|The {{pharmacology}} of {{the acute}} hyperthermia that follows 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ‘ecstasy') administration to rats has been investigated. MDMA (12. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) produced acute hyperthermia (measured rectally). The tail skin temperature did not increase, suggesting that MDMA may impair heat dissipation. Pretreatment with the 5 -HT 1 / 2 antagonist methysergide (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), the 5 -HT 2 A antagonist MDL 100, 907 (0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or the 5 -HT 2 C antagonist SB 242084 (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) failed {{to alter the}} hyperthermia. The 5 -HT 2 antagonist ritanserin (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) was without effect, but MDL 11, 939 (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) blocked the hyperthermia, possibly because of activity at non-serotonergic receptors. The 5 -HT uptake inhibitor <b>zimeldine</b> (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) {{had no effect on}} MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) markedly attenuated the MDMA-induced increase in hippocampal extracellular 5 -HT, also without altering hyperthermia. The dopamine D 2 antagonist remoxipride (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) did not alter MDMA-induced hyperthermia, but the D 1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0. 3 [*]–[*] 2. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) dose-dependently antagonized it. The dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR 12909 (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) did not alter the hyperthermic response and microdialysis demonstrated that it did not inhibit MDMA-induced striatal dopamine release. These results demonstrate that in vivo MDMA-induced 5 -HT release is inhibited by 5 -HT uptake inhibitors, but MDMA-induced dopamine release may not be altered by a dopamine uptake inhibitor. It is suggested that MDMA-induced hyperthermia results not from MDMA-induced 5 -HT release, but rather from the increased release of dopamine that acts at D 1 receptors. This has implications for the clinical treatment of MDMA-induced hyperthermia...|$|E
