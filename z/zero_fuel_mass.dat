5000|$|Installation of vortex {{generators}} {{can usually}} {{bring about a}} slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative climb performance. The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements. [...] An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> weight or, if a maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> weight is already specified {{as one of the}} airplane's limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> weight. [...] For these reasons, vortex generator kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum <b>zero</b> <b>fuel</b> weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.|$|R

30|$|Pyrometers {{were removed}} from the plots {{immediately}} following burning. Thermocolor paint spots were examined in the lab, and scored as ‘melted’ if any portion of the spot was melted or heavily charred (Drewa et al. 2002; Iverson et al. 2004). Following fire extinction, all unburned fuel was collected from each 1 m 2 quadrat, dried in the lab for 72 hrs, and weighed. We replicated the experiment three times using fresh fuel and pyrometers each time. This allowed for calculations of variance under each combination of loading vs. moisture conditions. Maximum temperature at 5 and 30 cm, mean temperature at 5 and 30 cm, unburned <b>fuel</b> <b>mass,</b> burned <b>fuel</b> <b>mass,</b> and percent burned <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> were analyzed using factorial analysis of variance (Zar 1999) in NCSS (Hintze 2001).

40|$|Sulfur {{recovery}} unit (SRU) thermal reactors are negatively affected by high temperature operation. In this paper, {{the effect of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction on the combustion and fluid flow in a SRU thermal reactor is investigated numerically. Practical operating conditions for a petrochemical corporation in Taiwan are used as the design conditions for the discussion. The simulation results show that the present design condition is a fuel-rich (or air-lean) condition and gives acceptable sulfur recovery, hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) destruction, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions and thermal reactor temperature for an oxygen-normal operation. However, for an oxygen-rich operation, the local maximum temperature exceeds the suggested maximum service temperature, although the average temperature is acceptable. The high temperature region must be inspected very carefully during the annual maintenance period if there are oxygen-rich operations. If the <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction to the zone ahead of the choke ring (zone 1) is 0. 0625 or 0. 125, the average temperature in the zone behind the choke ring (zone 2) is higher than the zone 1 average temperature, which can damage the downstream heat exchanger tubes. If the zone 1 <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction is reduced to ensure a lower zone 1 temperature, the temperature in zone 2 and the heat exchanger section must be monitored closely and the zone 2 wall and heat exchanger tubes must be inspected very carefully during the annual maintenance period. To determine a suitable <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction for operation, a detailed numerical simulation should be performed first to find the stoichiometric <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction which produces the most complete combustion and the highest temperature. This stoichiometric <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction should be avoided because the high temperature could damage the zone 1 corner or the choke ring. A higher <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction (i. e., fuel-rich or air-lean condition) is more suitable because it can avoid deteriorations of both zone 1 and heat exchanger tubes. Although a lower <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction (i. e., fuel-lean or air-rich condition) can avoid deterioration of zone 1, the heat exchanger tubes may be damaged. This paper provides a guideline for adjusting the <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction to reduce the high temperature inside the thermal reactor and to ensure an acceptable sulfur recovery...|$|R

40|$|Upwardpropagation of a {{premixed}} flame in averticaltubefilled {{with a very}} leanmixture is simulated numerically using {{a single}} irreversible Arrhenius reaction model with infinitely high activation energy. In the absence of heat losses and preferential diffusion effects, a curved flame with stationary shape and velocity close to those of an open bubble ascending in the same tube is found for values of the <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> fraction above a certain minimum that increases with the radius of the tube, while the numerical computations cease to converge to a stationary solution below this minimum mass fraction. The vortical flow of the gas behind the flame and in its transport region is described for tubes of different radii.

40|$|One way of {{complying}} with future emission restrictions {{for diesel engines}} is to use pressure sensors for improved combustion control.

This min-imal energizing time varies over the injector’s lifetime and therefore requires a re-calibration. The necessary energizing time can be found by estimating the injected <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> at different rail-pressures during a calibration state op-erating under specific engine conditions.

40|$|Cyclic {{variability}} (CV) in lean HCCI combustion at {{the limits}} of operation is a known phenomenon, and this work aims at investigating the dominant effects for the cycle evolution at these conditions in a multi-cylinder engine. Experiments are performed in a four-cylinder engine at the operating limits at late phasing of lean HCCI operation with negative valve overlap (nvo). A combustion analysis method that estimates the unburned <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> on a per-cycle basis is applied on both main combustion and the nvo period revealing and quan-tifying the dominant effects for the cycle evolution at high CV. The interpretation of the results and comparisons with data from a single-cylinder engine indicate that, at high CV, the evolution of combustion phasing is dominated by low-order deterministic couplings similar to the single-cylinder behavior. Variations, such as air flow and wall temperature, between cylinders strongly influence the level of CV but {{the evolution of the}} combustion phasing is governed by the interactions between engine cycles of the individual cylinders.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{based on}} least squares technique {{was developed by}} NAL using available LCA flight data to improve the in-flight estimation of <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> in the internal tanks. In order to generate more accurate model coefficients, ADA has carried out fuel tank solid model simulation for all the internal tanks and generated truth tables relating probe measurements to the <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> in the tank at various aircraft attitudes using analytical software tool ANSA (Automatic Net generation Tool for Structural Analysis by β BETA CAE SYSTEM SA). This report presents details of a global nonlinear 3 rd order multivariate orthogonal polynomial model fit to the truth table data {{to arrive at a}} global model valid across a range of aircraft attitude for each of the probes in the F 1 A and wing tanks. The estimated model fit error was found to be less than  20 kg for all the probes. The estimated global model was used to predict the <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> from few flight data sets of PV 3. The predicted <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> was compared with fuel estimates from least square models and lookuptable estimates which is currently being used in LCA. While the trends appear similar, the global model predicts higher fuel content (50 to 100 kgs) as compared to the earlier estimates. This could be attributed to the fact that ANSA model generated <b>fuel</b> <b>mass</b> is higher than the mass that was used in generating the lookuptables which were based on fill and drain tests. This issue has to be resolved before the model can be used for getting accurate predictions.
