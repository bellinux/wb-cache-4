A major part of this unutilized nutrient is transported to the southern Arabian Sea, supporting biological production there.

A total of 154 species were identified during three surveys. The number of zooplankton species richness was strongly linked to salinity. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified three zooplankton groups during this study.

The difference among groups could be mainly ascribed {{to changes in the}} relative contributions of the dominant species. The fluctuations in the <b>zooplankton</b> abundance, <b>biomass</b> and community structure were determined by the interactive effects of freshwater inflow, tidal and coastal currents, chlorophyll a, salinity and temperature. Significant spatial variability in the distribution of zooplankton species, abundance and biomass can be ascribed to the virtual presence of a horizontal gradient in salinity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The Papagayo jet is an {{important}} meteorological phenomenon when considering ocean biodiversity in the eastern tropical Pacific. The jet {{plays a key role}} in lowering sea surface temperatures, through the influence on the Costa Rica Dome. The movement and growth of the dome is caused by the seasonal variability of the jet where the annual upwelling and mixing caused by the Papagayo jet during dome extension allows for the transport of nutrient-rich cold waters to the surface. If the jet was a permanent feature (and by extension, the dome was also permanent) there would be no seasonal transport of nutrients via cold water upwelling. Indirect evidence of this nutrient transport can be seen in satellite imagery showing increased chlorophyll production in the surface waters directly under the path of the jet.

Relationships between the zooplankton community and various environmental factors (salinity, temperature, sampling depth, bottom depth, sea-ice concentrations, algal biomass and bloom stage) were established using multivariate statistics. Our study demonstrated that variability in the physical environment around Svalbard had measurable effect on the pelagic ecosystem. Differences in bottom depth and temperature-salinity best explained more than 40 % of the horizontal variability in mesozooplankton biomass (DM/m** 2) after adjusting for seasonal variability.

40|$|Introduction: Lake {{productivity}} {{is determined by}} the amount of nutrients and light available. While phosphorus is the main limiting nutrient in freshwater systems light availability can be reduced by several factors, while the most important one in Scandinavian lakes is the amount of dissolved organic compounds (DOC). Primary productivity can affect <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomass</b> and diversity by bottom-up driven mechanisms while <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomass</b> and diversity can also be affected by fish via top-down control. The resource use efficiency of zooplankton gives an estimate about the realized amount of <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomass</b> per available nutrients (total phosphorus). Methods: To investigate the effect of light and primary productivity in lakes on zooplankton diversity, biomass and resource use efficiency we sampled 75 lakes in southern Norway and Sweden during summer 2011. Total nutrients (total phosphorus and nitrogen), particulate nutrients (particulate organic carbon and particulate organic phosphorus), dissolved nutrients (dissolved organic compounds) were measured and estimates of gross primary productivity were used to determine the productivity of the lakes. Zooplankton samples were taken to determine <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomass</b> (as dry weight) and zooplankton diversity (species richness). Additionally, existing data about fish diversity (species richness) were used. Results: <b>Zooplankton</b> <b>biomass</b> was positively affected by total phosphorus and negatively affected by total organic compounds (TOC). Additionally, a positive relationship between the estimated gross primary productivity (EPP) and <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomass</b> was observed. Zooplankton diversity increased with longitude but decreased with latitude while resource use efficiency (RUE) of zooplankton showed the opposite relation and decreased with longitude and increased with latitude. Resource use efficiency of zooplankton also decreased with increasing zooplankton and fish diversity. Discussion: While the amount of nutrients had a positive effect on <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomass,</b> increasing DOC concentrations reduced the amount of light and thus had a negative effect of zooplankton. There was no significant effect of zooplankton diversity or fish diversity on <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomass,</b> while they both gave a negative contribution to zooplankton resource use efficiency.

As a distinctive feature of the Bay, a plurimodal plankton bloom occurs generally between January and April, with very large interannual variability reaching one order of magnitude {{from one year to}} another. Later in the season, the plankton biomass remains very low from May to December. Contrarily to the 1979 - 1998 period where a continuous decrease of phyto- and <b>zooplankton</b> <b>biomasses</b> was observed, observations from the last decade (1999 - 2011) emphasize abrupt changes in plankton biomass and bloom duration from one year to another in response to succession of mild and rigorous winters. Studies conducted to understand mechanisms controlling plankton variability emphasize a close relationship between winter wind stress intensity, water temperature, nutrient inputs and phytoplankton biomass. Total phytoplankton biomass is maximum during years characterized by high winter wind stress and low winter water temperature. From a specific point of view, flagellates are always the dominant component of the winter - spring phytoplankton communities. However, diatoms tend to be more abundant during rigorous winter years.
