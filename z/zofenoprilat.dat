40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>Zofenoprilat,</b> an angiotensin-converting enzyme {{inhibitor}} carrying a thiol group, {{to intervene in}} protein S-thiolation processes was tested on bovine lens aldose reductase (ALR 2). <b>Zofenoprilat,</b> more susceptible to oxidation than glutathione (GSH), forms with this physiological thiol a rather stable mixed disulfide (ZSSG). ZSSG, whose generation through the transthiolation reaction between GSH and <b>Zofenoprilat</b> homodisulfide was shown to be enhanced by a micro-class glutathione S-transferase, {{appears to be a}} specific donor of the <b>Zofenoprilat</b> moiety in the S-thiolation processes. This is indicated by the apparent stability of ZSSG to reduction by GSH and by the specificity of the transfer of the group on ALR 2, used as a protein model. Indeed, the S-thiolation of ALR 2 by ZSSG occurred exclusively through the insertion of the <b>Zofenoprilat</b> moiety of ZSSG on the enzyme. The modified ALR 2 is shown to retain the same activity of the native enzyme, but displays a reduced sensitivity to inhibition.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} as atherosclerosis {{are associated}} to an inflammatory {{state of the}} vessel wall which is accompanied by endothelial dysfunction, and adherence and activation of circulating inflammatory cells. Hydrogen sulfide, a novel cardiovascular protective gaseous mediator, {{has been reported to}} exert anti-inflammatory activity. We have recently demonstrated that the SH containing ACE inhibitor <b>zofenoprilat,</b> the active metabolite of zofenopril, controls the angiogenic features of vascular endothelium through H 2 S enzymatic production by cystathionine gamma lyase (CSE). Based on H 2 S donor/generator property of <b>zofenoprilat,</b> the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether <b>zofenoprilat</b> exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vascular cells through its ability to increase H 2 S availability. Here we found that <b>zofenoprilat,</b> in a CSE/H 2 S-mediated manner, abolished all the inflammatory features induced by interlukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), especially the NF-κB/cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) /prostanoid biochemical pathway. The pre-incubation with zofenoprilat/CSE dependent H 2 S prevented IL- 1 β induced paracellular hyperpermeability through the control of expression and localization of cell-cell junctional markers ZO- 1 and VE-cadherin. Moreover, zofenoprilat/CSE dependent H 2 S reduced the expression of the endothelial markers CD 40 and CD 31, involved in the recruitment of circulating mononuclear cells and platelets. Interestingly, this anti-inflammatory activity was also confirmed in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts as <b>zofenoprilat</b> reduced, in both cell lines, proliferation, migration and COX- 2 expression induced by IL- 1 β, but independently from the SH moiety and H 2 S availability. These in vitro data document the anti-inflammatory activity of <b>zofenoprilat</b> on vascular cells, reinforcing the cardiovascular protective effect of this multitasking drug...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the vasodilating {{properties}} of captopril and <b>zofenoprilat,</b> two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors containing the sulfhydryl group, are investigated in the isolated rat heart. It is demonstrated that both compounds increase coronary flow in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mean pD 2 of <b>zofenoprilat</b> {{appears to be}} {{significantly higher than the}} mean pD 2 of captopril (4. 55 +/- 0. 06 and 3. 35 +/- 0. 02 respectively), indicating that <b>zofenoprilat</b> is about ten times more potent in increasing coronary flow than captopril. Possibly this difference in potency between captopril and <b>zofenoprilat</b> can be explained by their physiochemical properties. Since <b>zofenoprilat</b> is more lipophilic than captopril, its concentration in cardiac and vascular tissues at distribution equilibrium is thought to be higher than the tissue concentration of captopril, which may result in a more pronounced vasodilatory action. The precise mechanism of coronary vasodilation induced by ACE inhibitors containing the sulfhydryl group is not yet understood. Several factors have been proposed, such as stimulation of prostacyclin production. However, in this study, concomitant administration of 10 (- 6) mol/l acetylsalicyclic acid shows no antagonism, indicating that under normoxic conditions the vasodilatory effects of captopril and <b>zofenoprilat</b> are independent of the production of vasodilating prostaglandins. Therefore, other factors than stimulation of prostacyclin synthesis seem to be involved, such as prevention of bradykinin breakdown and/or potentiation of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Furthermore, despite a marked inhibition of prostacyclin production, 10 (- 6) mol/l acetylsalicyclic acid itself has no effect on coronary flow. These results suggest that prostacyclin does not {{play an important role in}} the regulation of coronary flow, at least in the normoxic isolated rat heart...|$|E
40|$|Pediatric {{and adult}} cancer patients, {{following}} {{the use of}} the antitumor drug Doxorubicin develop cardiotoxicity. Pharmacological protection of microvascular endothelium might produce a double benefit: (i) reduction of myocardial toxicity (the primary target of Doxorubicin action) and (ii) maintenance of the vascular functionality for the adequate delivery of chemotherapeutics to tumor cells. This study was aimed to evaluate the mechanisms responsible of the protective effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) <b>Zofenoprilat</b> against the toxic effects exerted by Doxorubicin on coronary microvascular endothelium. We found that exposure of endothelial cells to Doxorubicin (0. 1 - 1 μM range) impaired cell survival by promoting their apoptosis. ERK 1 / 2 related p 53 activation, but not reactive oxygen species, was responsible for Doxorubicin induced caspase- 3 cleavage. P 53 mediated-apoptosis and impairment of survival were reverted by treatment with <b>Zofenoprilat.</b> The previously described PI- 3 K/eNOS/endogenous fibroblast growth factor signaling was not involved in the protective effect, which, instead, could be ascribed to cystathionine gamma lyase dependent availability of H 2 S from <b>Zofenoprilat.</b> Furthermore, considering the tumor environment, the treatment of endothelial/tumor co-cultures with <b>Zofenoprilat</b> did not affect the antitumor efficacy of Doxorubicin. In conclusion the ACEI <b>Zofenoprilat</b> exerts a protective effect on Doxorubicin induced endothelial damage, without affecting its antitumor efficacy. Thus, sulfhydryl containing ACEI may be a useful therapy for Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity...|$|E

All the four tested ACE-I reduced endothelin- 1 secretion and increased nitric oxide metabolite production by HUVECs.

The effect of ACE-I on endothelin- 1 and nitric oxide metabolite production is mediated by the activation of bradykinin B 2 receptor being counteracted, at least in part, by a specific antagonist. <b>Zofenoprilat</b> and, to a lesser extent, captopril also reduced oxidative stress in HUVECs. In conclusion, among the four tested ACE-I, <b>zofenoprilat</b> was more effective in improving endothelin- 1 /nitric oxide balance in HUVECs likely because of its greater antioxidant properties...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol-induced endothelial changes might {{contribute}} {{to an increase in}} blood pressure in regular alcohol consumers. Some antihypertensive drugs affect oxidative stress and endothelial function and might counteract the effects of alcohol at the cellular level. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate in vitro the effects of three different types of anti hypertensive agents on alcohol-induced endothelial responses and oxidative stress. Cultured human endothelial cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (1, 10, 60 mu mol/L) of <b>zofenoprilat,</b> carvedilol, and lacidipine in the absence and in the presence of ethanol (140 mmol/L). Concentrations of endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in the culture media as markers of endothelial function, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular glutathione (GSHi) were measured as markers of oxidative stress. Exposure to alcohol increased the levels of ET, NO, and MDA, and decreased GSHi. Carvedilol and <b>zofenoprilat</b> were more effective than lacidipine in counteracting the effects of alcohol on ET production. Alcohol-induced NO production was enhanced by carvedilol, whereas <b>zofenoprilat</b> and lacidipine did not have a significant effect. The alcohol-induced increase in MDA concentrations was blunted by all three drugs, but only carvedilol restored a normal response. All three drugs increased GSHi levels, with the effect being greater for carvedilol and lacidipine than <b>zofenoprilat.</b> Carvedilol is more effective than <b>zofenoprilat</b> and lacidipine in counteracting alcohol-induced endothelial responses in vitro and in decreasing oxidative stress.

40|$|Angiotensin {{converting}} {{enzyme inhibitors}} (ACE-I) {{are known to}} affect the endothelial function decreasing {{the formation of the}} potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and increasing the bioavailability of the vasodilators bradykinin and nitric oxide. In order to test the potential differences among the class of ACE-I, we have evaluated their effects on endothelin- 1 and nitric oxide availability, and on reactive oxygen species generation in human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) obtained from umbilical cord veins. HUVECs were cultured in the presence of either sulfhydryl-containing ACE-I (<b>zofenoprilat</b> or captopril) or nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE-I (enalaprilat or lisinopril). After 24 hours, all ACE-I reduced endothelin- 1 secretion and increased nitric oxide production. However, <b>zofenoprilat</b> (− 42 % after 8 hours of incubation) was more effective (<. 05) than enalaprilat (− 25 %), lisinopril (− 21 %), and captopril (− 30 %) in reducing endothelin- 1 secretion. Similarly, <b>zofenoprilat</b> (+ 110 % after 8 hours of incubation) was more effective (<. 05) than enalaprilat (+ 64 %), lisinopril (+ 63 %), and captopril (+ 65 %) in increasing nitrite plus nitrate production. The effect of ACE-I on the nitric oxide availability and on endothelin- 1 secretion is mediated by the activation of bradykinin B 2 receptor being reverted, at least in part, by a specific antagonist. <b>Zofenoprilat</b> and, to a lesser extent, captopril also blunted tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and decreased TNF-stimulated glutathione consumption in endothelial cells. In conclusion, structural differences among the class of ACE-I play a role in their interaction with mediators that influence the homeostasis of the endothelium. The marked antioxidant effects exerted by <b>zofenoprilat</b> due to its sulphydryl group and lipophilia seem to be responsible for its greater endothelium protective activity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), an {{endogenous}} volatile mediator with pleiotropic functions, promotes vasorelaxation, exerts anti-inflammatory {{actions and}} regulates angiogenesis. Previously, the SH-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), zofenopril, {{was identified as}} being effective in preserving endothelial function and inducing angiogenesis among ACEIs. Based on the H 2 S donor property of its active metabolite <b>zofenoprilat,</b> {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate whether zofenoprilat-induced angiogenesis was due to increased H 2 S availability. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: HUVECs were used for in vitro studies of angiogenesis, whereas the Matrigel plug assay was used for in vivo assessments. KEY RESULTS: Zofenoprilat-treated HUVECs showed an increase in all functional features of the angiogenic process in vitro. As <b>zofenoprilat</b> induced the expression of CSE (cystathionine-γ-lyase) and the continuous production of H 2 S, CSE inhibition or silencing blocked the ability of <b>zofenoprilat</b> to induce angiogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. The molecular mechanisms underlying H 2 S/zofenoprilat-induced angiogenesis were dependent on Akt, eNOS and ERK 1 / 2 cascades. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, the molecular target that mediates part of the vascular functions of H 2 S, were shown to be involved in the upstream activation of Akt and ERK 1 / 2. Moreover, the up-regulation of fibroblast growth factor- 2 was dependent on CSE-derived H 2 S response to H 2 S and KATP activation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: <b>Zofenoprilat</b> induced a constant production of H 2 S that stimulated the angiogenic process through a KATP channel/Akt/eNOS/ERK 1 / 2 pathway. Thus, zofenopril can be considered as a pro-angiogenic drug acting through H 2 S release and production, useful in cardiovascular pathologies where vascular functions need to be re-established and functional angiogenesis induced...|$|E

40|$|The {{beneficial}} effect exerted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) on vascular endothelium has {{been attributed to}} restoration of endothelial cell survival properties and improvement of angiogenesis. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) - 2 is an angiogenic factor for the microvascular endothelium, which tonically promotes endothelial cell growth and survival through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. Here, we formulate the hypothesis that FGF- 2 might contribute to the prosurvival/proangiogenic effect of ACEI. We investigated <b>zofenoprilat</b> and, in selected experiments, lisinopril, as representatives of ACEI. These compounds induced formation of pseudocapillaries in vessel fragments isolated from porcine coronary and human umbilical arteries by increasing endothelial cell growth up to 5 -fold. Angiogenesis was abolished by inhibitors of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) pathway and by anti-FGF- 2 antibodies. Consistently, in cultured coronary endothelial cells (CVECs), ACEI up-regulated endothelial NOS (eNOS) and FGF- 2 and induced mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 activation. The overexpression of eNOS/FGF- 2 produced, at the functional level, enhanced cell proliferation and migration, the latter effect being dose-dependent and maximal at 0. 1 microM <b>zofenoprilat.</b> The importance of FGF- 2 for the acquisition of the angiogenic phenotype elicited by ACEI was clearly demonstrated by the impairment of endothelial functions following transfection of CVECs with small interference RNA for FGF- 2. Moreover, FGF- 2 silencing greatly affected the nuclear translocation of the FGF receptor (FGFR) - 1, highlighting the autocrine mode of action of FGF- 2. At the endothelial membrane level, <b>zofenoprilat</b> appeared to activate the bradykinin B 1 receptor, a known stimulant of FGF- 2 expression. In conclusion, we show that ACEI exert protective/proangiogenic effects in microvascular coronary endothelial cells by activating the endogenous FGF- 2 /FGFR- 1 system...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Data from {{prospective}} {{studies suggest}} {{a significant reduction}} in the risk of new diabetes from drug therapies containing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Since the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been found locally in several tissues and cells, including pancreatic islets, we hypothesized that the positive metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors may be due to a beneficial action of these compounds on insulin-secreting beta-cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolated human pancreatic islets were studied after 24 h of incubation with 22. 2 mmol/l glucose, with or without the presence in the incubation medium of 0. 5 - 6. 0 mmol/l <b>zofenoprilat</b> or enalaprilat, ACE inhibitor drugs which differ by the presence of a sulphydryl or a carboxyl group in their structural formula. Functional and molecular studies were then performed to assess insulin secretion, redox balance, mRNA and protein expression. RESULTS: Angiotensinogen, ACE and angiotensin type 1 receptor mRNA expression increased in islets cultured in high glucose; this was similarly prevented by the presence of either ACE inhibitor. As expected, preculture of human islets in high glucose determined a marked reduction in insulin secretion which was associated with enhanced oxidative stress, as shown by increased nitrotyrosine concentrations, and enhanced expression of protein kinase C beta and NADPH oxidase. The presence of either of the ACE inhibitors counteracted several of the deleterious effects of high glucose exposure, including reduction of insulin secretion and increased oxidative stress; <b>zofenoprilat</b> showed significantly more marked effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that: (a) RAS molecules are present in human islets and their expression is sensitive to glucose concentration, (b) ACE inhibitors, and in particular <b>zofenoprilat,</b> protect human islets from glucotoxicity and (c) the effects of ACE inhibition are associated with decreased oxidative stress. Together, these findings provide evidence that the possible beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors in human diabetes are due, at least in part, to a protective action on pancreatic beta-cells...|$|E

The expression of genes involved in the control of calcium homeostasis was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. In chronic experiments, SR (45) Ca uptake and gene expression were measured in hearts derived from rats treated with 15 mg*kg(- 1) *day(- 1) zofenopril for 15 days.

40|$|Alterations in calcium (Ca) {{homeostasis}} play a {{major role}} in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia and of heart failure. Since the ACE-inhibitor zofenopril is known to be beneficial both in heart failure and in acute ischemia, we investigated whether it may modulate the expression of genes involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis. We used an acute and a chronic model. In the acute model isolated rat hearts were perfused for 120 minutes in the presence or in the absence of 10 microM <b>zofenoprilat,</b> the active metabolite of zofenopril. At the end of perfusion, each heart was homogenized, RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of the following genes: sarcolemmal L-type Ca channel (CaV), sarcolemmal Na-Ca exchanger (NCE), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca channel/ryanodine receptor (RyR), sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA), SERCA modulator phospholamban (PLB). Gene expression was normalized on the basis of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase expression. In parallel experiments the heart was homogenized at the end of perfusion and oxalate-supported 45 Ca uptake, which provides a reliable estimate of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, was determined. In chronic experiments rats were treated with zofenopril (15 mg/kg die per os) for 14 days, while control hearts were treated with the same diet, except that zofenopril was omitted. At the end of this period, the heart was quickly excised and perfused with the working heart technique, then it was homogenized and oxalate-supported 45 Ca uptake was determined. Acute or chronic zofenopril administration did not produce any significant change in cardiac output, developed pressure, heart rate, or coronary flow. RT-PCR experiments showed that after 120 min of exposure to 10 microM <b>zofenoprilat</b> PLB gene expression was significantly decreased (0. 60 ± 0. 04 vs 0. 78 ± 0. 05 arbitrary units, P< 0. 05), while the expression of CaV, NCX, RyR and SERCA genes was not significantly modified. Functional experiments revealed that the rate of oxalate-supported 45 Ca uptake measured at 1 micromolar free calcium concentration was significantly increased both in the acute (11. 7 ± 0. 5 vs 14. 1 ± 0. 4 nmol/min per mg of protein, P< 0. 01) and in the chronic model (10. 4 ± 0. 8 vs 14. 5 ± 0. 7 nmol/min per mg of protein, P< 0. 01). We conclude that acute or chronic exposure to zofenopril increased sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, possibly as a consequence of reduced PLB expression.

40|$|The {{protective}} effect exerted by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in cardiovascular diseases caused by endothelial injury and aging has {{been attributed to}} the restoration of endothelial cell functions. Recently, we demonstrated a central role of the fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2) /FGF receptor- 1 system in mediating the acquisition of an angiogenic phenotype in coronary microvascular endothelium exposed to ACEI. Here, we report on the rescuing effect of ACEI on impaired endothelium and the intracellular signaling mechanisms that lead endothelial cells to enter apoptosis and to senesce. Conditions mimicking pathological cell damage (serum deprivation) lead to endothelial apoptosis as evidenced by increased caspase- 3 activity. ACEI enhanced cell survival through activation of prosurvival and antiaging signals involving Akt phosphorylation, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activation, FGF- 2 and telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) up-regulation, and delayed senescence. In microvascular endothelial cells exposed to ACEI, Akt/eNOS pathway-dependent FGF- 2 was necessary for gene transcription of TERT. These {{protective effect}}s were particularly evident for sulfhydryl-containing ACEI (<b>zofenoprilat),</b> which were reported to exhibit potent antioxidant effects. In conclusion, ACEI with antioxidant properties up-regulate eNOS, FGF- 2, and TERT mRNA, which favor endothelial cell survival and prolong their lifespan, thus restoring endothelial cell functions after vascular damage. These effects could explain the beneficial effects of these drugs in various cardiovascular diseases associated with endothelial injury and aging...|$|E

40|$|Sodium {{depletion}} with diuretics augments {{the efficacy}} of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor therapy for hypertension and renal dysfunction, and possibly for left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction. Underlying mechanisms may involve altered angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor pharmacokinetics. We hypothesized that the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide causes increased steady-state levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors lisinopril and zofenopril in rats with myocardial infarction. Rats were subjected to coronary ligation to induce myocardial infarction. After I week, rats were randomized to 50 mg/kg/day hydrochlorothiazide or control treatment for 3 weeks. The last week, rats received lisinopril or zofenopril in equipotentent dosages (3. 3 and 10 mg/kg/day, respectively). Rats were sacrificed at T-max after the last dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor, and tissues were collected for analysis of drug concentrations. Lisinopril concentrations in plasma were significantly increased by hydrochlorothiazide, at unchanged tissue concentrations. This increase could be fully explained by decreased renal function, as evidenced by increased plasma creatinine levels (lisinopril + hydrochlorothiazide 82 +/- 5 mu M versus lisinopril 61 +/- 5 mu M, P < 0. 001). In contrast, <b>zofenoprilat</b> levels in kidney and non-infarcted left ventricle were markedly increased by hydrochlorothiazide, whereas plasma concentrations were unchanged. Although hydrochlorothiazide tended to increase plasma creatinine in zofenopril-treated rats as well, this increase was less pronounced (zofenopril+hydrochlorothiazide 61 +/- 3 mu M versus zofenopril 54 +/- 2 mu M, P= 0. 15). Hydrochlorothiazide increases steady-state angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor drug levels, most likely by affecting their renal clearance. Notably, the lipophilic angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor zofenopril accumulated in tissue, whereas the hydrophilic lisinopril increased in plasma. Whether combining different angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors with hydrochlorothiazide translates into distinct clinical profiles requires further study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

In contrast, {{the effect of}} concomitant administration of enalaprilat only slightly increased the effect of bradykinin on coronary flow. In nitrate-tolerant hearts of rats pretreated with isosorbide dinitrate (15 mg daily), the increase in coronary flow by nitroglycerin and bradykinin was significantly less when compared to control hearts. The effect of captopril was not affected by pretreatment. The involvement of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) in the effect of captopril was apparent from experiments with L-arginine, the precursor of EDRF, and L-NMMA, the "false" precursor of EDRF. L-Arginine increased the effect of captopril, whereas L-NMMA showed a competitive antagonism for the effect of captopril on coronary flow in the isolated rat heart. Clinically, the effect of captopril was studied in 10 patients with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris that had been treated for 3 weeks with slow-release isosorbide dinitrate (20 mg four times daily). At day 7, a baseline exercise test was obtained. Subsequently, patients with chest pain and at least 1 -mm ST-segment depression on the ECG during exercise were included. They received on day 14 and 21 either captopril (25 mg) or placebo 1 h before exercise testing in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design.

H 2 S-induced vasodilation is hypothesized to occur through ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP); however, we recently demonstrated that it also increases cGMP levels in tissues. Herein, we studied the involvement of cGMP-dependent protein kinase-I in H 2 S-induced vasorelaxation. The effect of H 2 S on vessel tone was studied in phenylephrine-contracted aortic rings with or without endothelium. cGMP levels were determined in cultured cells or isolated vessel by enzyme immunoassay. Pretreatment of aortic rings with sildenafil attenuated NaHS-induced relaxation, confirming previous findings that H 2 S is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In addition, vascular tissue levels of cGMP in cystathionine gamma lyase knockouts were lower than those in wild-type control mice. Treatment of aortic rings with NaHS, a fast releasing H 2 S donor, enhanced phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is activated after exposure to H 2 S. Incubation of aortic rings with a PKG-I inhibitor (DT- 2) attenuated NaHS-stimulated relaxation. Interestingly, vasodilatory responses to a slowly releasing H 2 S donor (GYY 4137) were unaffected by DT- 2, suggesting that this donor dilates mouse aorta through PKG-independent pathways. Dilatory responses to NaHS and L-cysteine (a substrate for H 2 S production) were reduced in vessels of PKG-I knockout mice (PKG-I 2 / 2). Moreover, glibenclamide inhibited NaHS-induced vasorelaxation in vessels from wild-type animals, but not PKG-I 2 / 2, suggesting that there is a cross-talk between KATP and PKG. Our results confirm the role of cGMP in the vascular responses to NaHS and demonstrate that genetic deletion of PKG-I attenuates NaHS and L-cysteine-stimulated vasodilation. ACE inhibitors are widely used in controlling blood pressure in hypertensive patients and they represent first line treatment in different cardiovascular diseases, since they also show additional beneficial effects unrelated to ACE inhibition. In particular, therapeutic use of sulfhydrylated inhibitor S-zofenopril has raised different hypotheses regarding the role played by its thiol group in the beneficial clinical effects it exerts over other ACEi. Here, we investigated whether H 2 S pathway contributes to the beneficial vascular effect described. SHR and WKY rats were treated with either zofenopril or enalapril in vivo. Aorta and carotid were harvested and vascular reactivity in vitro to Ach and L-cysteine assessed. CBS, CSE expression as well as H 2 S levels were evaluated in both vascular tissues. The vascular response to Ach in both carotid artery and aorta was impaired in SHR (~ 30 %, P< 0. 001). Zofenopril, but not enalapril, treatment rescued the vascular response to Ach, while the vasodilatory response to L-cysteine was enhanced. CSE protein expression in vessels, and tissue and plasma H 2 S levels were restored to WKY levels in SHR rats receiving zofenopril. In contrast, CBS expression was unchanged. <b>Zofenoprilat,</b> the active metabolite of zofenopril, released in vitro detectable amount of H 2 S as well as it relaxed vessels in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner (P< 0. 001). Adminstration in vivo of the R-zofenoprilat diasteroisomer that does not inhibit ACE, did not modify blood pressure, but still displayed a beneficial vascular profile. Our findings establish that S-zofenopril modulates vascular function by rescuing the H 2 S pathway in a model of spontaneous hypertension, suggesting a unique mechanism unrelated to ACE inhibition and based on H 2 S release, which maybe explain the beneficial effects of sulfhydrylated ACE inhibitors reported in literature. The reticulon (Rtn) family of proteins are localized primarily to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of most cells. The Rtn- 4 family, (aka Nogo) consists of 3 splice variants of a common gene called Rtn- 4 A, Rtn- 4 B, and Rtn- 4 C. Recently, we identified the Rtn- 4 B (Nogo-B) protein in endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall, and showed that Nogo-B is a regulator of cell migration in vitro and vascular remodeling and angiogenesis in vivo. However, it is still unknown the biological function of Nogo-B in the peripheral system. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of Nogo-B in the vasculature by using Nogo-A/B-/- mice. We found that Nogo-A/B-/- mice were markedly hypotensive compared to WT mice and moreover, mesenteric resistance vessels undergo vascular remodeling as both the media wall thickness and wall thickness:radius ratio were significantly reduced in Nogo-A/B-/- mice. Finally, by using pressure myograph system we found that both cholinergic and adrenergic response were not affected in Nogo-A/B-/- mice, conversely, the myogenic tone was markedly impaired in those mice. In conclusion, the present study reports a previously unidentified role of Nogo-B plays in the regulation of blood pressure in physiological conditions. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism defining the physiological and biological function of Nogo-B...|$|E
