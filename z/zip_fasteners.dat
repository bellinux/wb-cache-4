50|$|A {{variety of}} {{fasteners}} {{are seen in}} fashion boots. Laces are commonly used in ankle boots, but are too time-consuming for longer styles. <b>Zip</b> <b>fasteners</b> are widely employed in all styles of boot - they may run {{the entire length of}} the shaft, or just the ankle and lower calf - these partial-length zips make it easier to insert the foot into the toe of the boot by relaxing the fit around the ankle. Pull-on boots have no fasteners and tend to have a looser fit than zip or lace-up boots; they sometimes have a loop of leather at the top of the shaft, called a boot-strap, to assist with pulling the boot on. Finally, button-fastened boots were common at the beginning of the last century but are rarely seen today. If present, buttons are usually employed as design accents on boots; other decorative features include straps, buckles, studs, and decorative stitching.|$|E

5000|$|Fingleton {{emphasizes}} {{the degree to}} which Japan and other advanced manufacturing nations such as Germany have established global monopolies - in his terms [...] "chokepoints" [...] - in supplying little-noticed but vital materials, components, and production machinery without which less advanced manufacturing nations such as China could not manufacture consumer goods. Writing in the New Republic in 2011, he commented: [...] "As world manufacturing has become more technologically advanced, {{it is more likely that}} a single supplier, or even a single factory, can be critical to a whole industry. And we know that, in this vein, Japanese corporations enjoy monopolies or oligopolies in a host of crucial niches in supplying advanced materials, components and production machinery for industries like electronics, cars, and aerospace. In two books in the 1990s, I made a sustained effort to track Japan's more important manufacturing ‘chokepoints,’ as they are known to customers. I succeeded in identifying close to 100. Some are well known, such as the YKK Company's global lock on <b>zip</b> <b>fasteners</b> and Shimano's dominance in bicycle gears. Many have hitherto gone largely unnoticed, but are actually much more important to the smooth functioning of the world economy. A good example is semiconductor-grade silicon—a highly purified not-an-atom-out-of-place material that only a couple of companies worldwide can make. The leading suppliers, Shin-Etsu and Sumco, are both Japanese and, as far as I can tell, there are no significant suppliers left in either Europe or America." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Longitudinal {{components}} of the Zagros mountain chain change in character and width across N-S trending zones of strike-slip transfer faults lying between 51 ~ and 54 ~ E. To the north-west, a fold-thrust belt with consistent SW vergence has a width of c. 220 km {{in front of an}} imbri-cate belt c. 160 km wide. To the southeast, an imbricate zone c. 80 km wide is fronted by a gently tapering festoon of upright periclines that is c. 350 km wide and punctured by over a hundred emergent salt diapirs. Pre-Zagros stages of the transfer zones in the Zagros are preserved on the Arabian platform and the two most obvious bound what we call the incipient Qatar syntaxis. This is at an early stage of one of the many syntaxes that compartmentalize th Alpine-Himalayan mountain chain.

50|$|A zipper, zip, fly, or <b>zip</b> <b>fastener,</b> {{formerly}} known as a clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of fabric or other flexible material, like on a garment or a bag. It is used in clothing (e.g., jackets and jeans), luggage and other bags, sporting goods, camping gear (e.g. tents and sleeping bags), and other items. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American inventor from Chicago who invented and constructed a workable zipper. The method, still in use today, is based on interlocking teeth. Initially, {{it was called the}} “hookless fastener” and was later redesigned to become more reliable.|$|R

50|$|The 1st Pattern smock {{design was}} {{replaced}} in 1944 {{by a second}} pattern which had buttoning tabs at the cuffs and brass snap fasteners to stow the tail flap {{on the back of}} the jacket when not needed. Other detail differences included reduced length and tube shaped rather than tapered sleeves. In order to make it more wind-proof, the tops of woollen socks were often sewn to the cuffs. The half-length <b>zip</b> <b>fastener</b> on this smock was made of brass. The colours of the 2nd pattern also differed from those of the earlier smocks, the base colour varying from a light to a medium olive combination, with overlying brushstrokes of reddish brown and dark olive green. These colours were thought better suited to the North Western European theatre.|$|R

Despite initial problems, in the years following the war, Hans managed to expand the <b>zip</b> <b>fastener</b> business with the newly developed plastic zip, ”Prymalon”, as an addition to the traditional products. In 1960, after prolonged negotiations, he was successful in buying back all Austrian properties and rights, which was of essential importance, particularly regarding the ”Prym” brand name. His marriage to Russian-born Olga Gütschow (1884-1975) in 1903 produced six sons, four of whom worked in the company. From 1928-72, Hans-August (1904-82) was head of ”William Prym of America, Inc.”, while Axel (1907-89) and Dieter (born 1917) held leading positions in the Stolberg head office which was expanding towards the Far East and Central America.

50|$|After the {{war there}} was a backsliding in fashion to 1913. Skirts were longer and the hobble skirt was en vogue again; but also tight tube-like dresses were worn in these days. This led to a {{reduction}} {{of the mass of}} underclothing and put more emphasis on the body itself.From 1920-1930, the focus in fashion was on youth. This was an effect of the war since the death of many young men resulted in a glorification of the male youth. It became typical for girls to flatten their breasts and to hide their waist since this was the ideal of a girl in this time. The beginning recovery of economy might be the factor that brought a change in fashion again in 1925. Women's clothes, especially evening wear, were cut in a more feminine line but important to mention the ideal of the youthfulness was still alive. The first skirts with a flare and flounces were introduced. As the skirts had been very short up to that point, from 1928 on they became longer.Also important to mention is the emergence of the <b>zip</b> <b>fastener.</b> First used in the U.S. Navy, it was found in 1925 in Britain, too.|$|R

5000|$|The smock {{was made}} from loose-fitting, yellowish-sand coloured, heavyweight twill material, {{allegedly}} hand-painted with broad, mop like brushes using non-colourfast dyes in broad pea green and dark brown stripes, or [...] "brush-strokes". With use the base colour faded to a sandy buff, and the overlaid shades gained a blended appearance. The colours of the 1st pattern smock were thought to best suit the wearer to the North African and Italian theatres. It had a half length <b>zip</b> <b>fastener</b> made of steel, knitted woollen cuffs, four external pockets that secured with brass snaps (two on the chest and two below the waist), two internal pockets on the chest, and epaulettes that secured with plastic battle dress buttons. The inside of the collar was lined with soft khaki flannel (or in senior officer's smocks, Angora wool). A “beaver tail” fastened beneath the crotch from the {{back to the front}} of the smock - which kept it from riding up during a parachute descent. When not used, the tail would hang down behind the wearer's knees, hence the nickname [...] "men with tails", given by the Arabs in North Africa in 1942. The smock was styled as a very loose garment, since it would be worn over Battle Dress, but it could be adjusted to some extent with tightening tabs on both sides of the lower part of the smock.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} kinds of knowledge. I may know that Paris is the capital of France, or know how to bake a cake, or know where my keys are, or know who was the {{inventor}} of the <b>zip</b> <b>fastener,</b> and so on. To keep matters simple, we will focus on a particular kind of knowledge which is of central importance, what is known as propositional knowledge. Propositional knowledge, as the name suggests, is knowledge of a proposition. A proposition is, roughly, what is expressed by a sentence which says that something is the casee. g., that Paris is the capital of France, or that the earth is flat. In focussing on propositional knowledge, then, we are focussing on knowledge that such-and-such is the case, rather than, say, on knowing how to do such-and-such, or knowing where such-and-such is, and so on. Everyone agrees that knowledge entails true belief, in the sense that if one knows a proposition, p, then one believes p and p is true. (Of course, one might think that one knew a certain proposition {{which turned out to be}} false, but in such a case one would thereby discover that one did not really know it after all). Everyone also agrees that there is a lot more to knowledge than merely true belief. It is easy to formulate cases of true belief that are not also cases of knowledge.
