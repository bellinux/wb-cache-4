5000|$|Chemical Control - Chemical {{control is}} highly {{recommended}} because downy mildew is an aggressive and destructive disease and satisfactory control {{without the use}} of fungicides is unlikely. Both protectant and systemic products should be applied. Fungicides are most effective when applied prior to infection and reapplied at 5- to 7-day intervals. The following products have proven to be the most effective fungicides in cucumber downy mildew control in North Carolina trials conducted annually from 2004 to 2008: Presidio (fluopicolide, Valent), Ranman (cyazofamid, FMC), Previcur Flex (propamocarb, Bayer), Curzate (cymoxanil, DuPont), Tanos (famoxadone and cymoxanil, DuPont),and Gavel (<b>zoxamide</b> and mancozeb, Dow AgroSciences). These products should be applied in a program to prevent pathogen resistance, that is, rotated with fungicides of a different mode of action. Protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb should be used as mixing partners.|$|E

The current study investigated the activity of <b>zoxamide</b> against Phytophthora sojae and a baseline sensitivity was established with a mean EC 50 of 0. 048 μg/ml. Three stable resistant mutants with a high resistance level were obtained by selection on <b>zoxamide</b> amended media. Although the development of resistance occurred at a low frequency, there were no apparent fitness penalty in the acquired mutants in terms of growth rate, sporulation, germination and pathogenicity. Based on the biological profiles and mutagenesis rate, the resistance risk of P. sojae to <b>zoxamide</b> can be estimated as low to medium. Further investigation revealed all the zoxamide-resistant mutants had a point mutation of C 239 S in their β-tubulin. <b>Zoxamide</b> also exhibited high activity against most species from the genus Pythium in which only Py. aphanidermatum was found resistant to <b>zoxamide</b> and harboring the natural point mutation S 239 in the beta-tubulin. Back-transformation in P. sojae with the mutated allele (S 239) confirmed the C 239 S mutation induced resistance to <b>zoxamide,</b> and the resistance level {{was positively related to}} the expression level of the mutated gene.

40|$|This study {{characterized}} isolates of P. capsici {{that had}} developed a novel mechanism of resistance to <b>zoxamide,</b> which altered the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) but not the EC 50. Molecular analysis revealed that the b-tubulin gene of the resistant isolates contained no mutations and was expressed {{at the same level}} as in zoxamide-sensitive isolates. This suggested that P. capsici {{had developed a}} novel non-target-site-based resistance to <b>zoxamide.</b> Analysis of the segregation ratio of zoxamide-resistance in the sexual progeny of the sensitive isolates PCAS 1 and PCAS 2 indicated that the resistance to <b>zoxamide</b> was controlled by one or more recessive nuclear genes. Furthermore, the segregation of resistance in the F 1, F 2, and BC 1 progeny was in accordance with the theoretical ratios of the x 2 test (P. 0. 05), which suggested that the resistance to <b>zoxamide</b> was controlled by two recessive genes, and that resistance to <b>zoxamide</b> occurred when at least one pair of these alleles was homozygous. This implies that the risk of zoxamide-resistance in P. capsici is low to moderate. Nevertheless this potential for resistance should be monitored closely, especially if two compatible mating types co-exist in the same field...|$|E
40|$|In {{tropical}} regions, protozoan parasites {{can cause}} severe diseases with malaria, leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease {{standing in the}} forefront. Many of the drugs currently being used to treat these diseases have been developed more than 50 years ago and can cause severe adverse effects. Above all, resistance to existing drugs is widespread {{and has become a}} serious problem threatening the success of control measures. In order to identify new antiprotozoal agents, more than 600 commercial agrochemicals have been tested on the pathogens causing the above mentioned diseases. For all of the pathogens, compounds were identified with similar or even higher activities than the currently used drugs in applied in vitro assays. Furthermore, in vivo activity was observed for the fungicide/oomyceticide azoxystrobin, and the insecticide hydramethylnon in the Plasmodium berghei mouse model, and for the oomyceticide <b>zoxamide</b> in the Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900 mouse model, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew on lettuce {{is caused}} by the fungus Golovinomyces cichoracearum (Erysiphe cichoracearum). This disease is favored by {{moderate}} to warm temperatures and dry weather conditions. Several potential new fungicides were evaluated for control of powdery mildew on lettuce in 2003. Powdery mildew appeared in our plots by Jan 9 and reached high levels by plant maturity on Feb 19. Compared to non-treated plants, all treatments significantly reduced the final severity of powdery mildew on lettuce statistically. However, {{only a limited number of}} compounds, such as Rally, Microthiol Disperss, Quinoxyfen, Flint, <b>Zoxamide,</b> Maneb, Pristine and Cabrio, provided the degree of disease control that would be of value to growers. The trial was intended to be a downy and powdery mildew trial; therefore, some of the treatments within this study were specifically included for downy mildew. No downy mildew developed; however, the downy mildew test products did offer some protection against powdery mildew...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this work {{was to assess the}} {{influence}} of mancozeb, <b>zoxamide</b> and copper oxychloride fungicide treatments on Mn, Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb concentrations in Sicilian red wines, grapes, marcs and grape stalks; the experimentation was carried out over two crop years, 2003 and 2004. Trace metals analysis was performed by derivative stripping chronopotentiometry which allowed to detect concentrations lower than 1 ngg- 1. The obtained data gave evidence that the levels of Mn and Zn in wines from plots treated with zoxamide-mancozeb were about 3 -fold higher than those observed in the control. Wines treated with Cu oxychloride presented a significant increase of Cu (II) concentrations with respect to the control; in particular samples from 2004 showed a Cu amount increased by 50 %. Furthermore, as shown in a previous paper, the studied fungicides treatments lead to a moderate increase in Pb (II) and Cd (II) levels in treated samples with respect to the control. Wines from 2004 presented higher Cu and Pb amounts than wines from 2003; the concentration of all the other metals is similar. The statistical elaboration of the obtained data by LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and Kruskal-Wallis test has confirmed that both zoxamide-mancozeb treatments and copper oxychloride treatments exerted a significant influence on Mn (II), Zn (II) Cu (II), Pb (II) and Cd (II) concentrations in wines, grapes, marcs and grape stalks samples from both the studied vintages...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Methyl {{benzimidazole}} carbamate (MBC) fungicides {{are used}} to control the oilseed rape pathogen Pyrenopeziza brassicae. Resistance to MBCs {{has been reported in}} P. brassicae, but the molecular mechanism(s) associated with reductions in sensitivity have not been verified in this species. Elucidation of the genetic changes responsible for resistance, hypothesised to be target-site mutations in β-tubulin, will enable resistance diagnostics and thereby inform resistance management strategies. RESULTS P. brassicae isolates were classified as sensitive, moderately resistant or resistant to MBCs. Crossing P. brassicae isolates of different MBC sensitivities indicated that resistance was conferred by a single gene. The MBC-target encoding gene β-tubulin was cloned and sequenced. Reduced MBC sensitivity of field isolates correlated with β-tubulin amino acid substitutions L 240 F and E 198 A. The highest level of MBC resistance was measured for isolates carrying E 198 A. Negative cross-resistance between MBCs and the fungicides diethofencarb and <b>zoxamide</b> was only measured in E 198 A isolates. PCR-RFLP was used to screen isolates for the presence of L 240 F and E 198 A. The substitutions E 198 G and F 200 Y were also detected in DNA samples from P. brassicae populations after cloning and sequencing of PCR products. The frequencies of L 240 F and E 198 A in different P. brassicae populations were quantified by pyrosequencing. There were no differences in the frequencies of these alleles between P. brassicae populations sampled from different locations or after fungicide treatment regimes. CONCLUSIONS The molecular mechanisms affecting sensitivity to MBCs in P. brassicae have been identified. Pyrosequencing assays are a powerful tool for quantifying fungicide-resistant alleles in pathogen populations...|$|E
