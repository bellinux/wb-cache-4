25|$|The three extant {{families}} of cycads all {{belong to the}} order Cycadales, and are Cycadaceae, Stangeriaceae, and <b>Zamiaceae.</b> These cycads have changed little since the Jurassic, compared to some major evolutionary changes in other plant divisions. Five additional families belonging to the Medullosales became extinct {{by the end of}} the Paleozoic Era.|$|E
25|$|The family Stangeriaceae (named for Dr. William Stanger, 18111854), {{consisting}} {{of only three}} extant species, {{is thought to be}} of Gondwanan origin, as fossils have been found in Lower Cretaceous deposits in Argentina, dating to 70135mya. The family <b>Zamiaceae</b> is more diverse, with a fossil record extending from the middle Triassic to the Eocene (54200mya) in North and South America, Europe, Australia, and Antarctica, implying the family was present before the break-up of Pangea. The family Cycadaceae is thought to be an early offshoot from other cycads, with fossils from Eocene deposits (3854mya) in Japan, China, and North America, indicating this family originated in Laurasia. Cycas is the only genus in the family and contains 99species, the most of any cycad genus. Molecular data have recently shown Cycas species in Australasia and the east coast of Africa are recent arrivals, suggesting adaptive radiation may have occurred. The current distribution of cycads may be due to radiations from a few ancestral types sequestered on Laurasia and Gondwana, or could be explained by genetic drift following the separation of already evolved genera. Both explanations account for the strict endemism across present continental lines.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the area}} {{containing}} Cycadetum {{there are certain}} species of cicadi that have a notable history. Of these we have Cycas revoluta, donated by Queen Maria Carolina in 1793, [...] was the first such specimen to find a permanent home in Europe. In the following stage of the gardens' development <b>Zamiaceae</b> Ceratozamia mexicana and Dioon edule, were both introduced from Mexico, as was Cycas circinalis, an elegant species from the Indian sub-continent. [...] In 1997 the collection was further improved by the acquisition {{of a variety of}} worthy specimens, including Dioon spinulosum, [...] Encephalartos altensteinii, Encephalartos longifolius, Encephalartos villosus, Macrozamia moorei and Zamia furfuracea.|$|E
