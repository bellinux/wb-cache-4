25|$|Contrary to {{mainland}} practices, corn was not {{ground into}} flour and baked into bread, but was cooked and eaten off the cob. Corn bread becomes moldy faster than cassava {{bread in the}} high humidity of the Caribbean. Corn was also used to make an alcoholic beverage known as chicha. The Taíno grew squash, beans, peppers, peanuts, and pineapples. Tobacco, calabashes (West Indian pumpkins) and cotton were grown around the houses. Other fruits and vegetables, such as palm nuts, guavas, and <b>Zamia</b> roots, were collected from the wild.|$|E
25|$|Generally, Noongar made {{a living}} by hunting and {{trapping}} a variety of game, including kangaroos, possums and wallabies; for {{people close to the}} coastal zone or riverine systems, spear-fishing or culling fish in traps was customary. An extensive range of edible wild plants were also available, including yams and wattle seeds. Nuts of the <b>zamia</b> palm, eaten during the Djeran season (April–May) required extensive treatment to remove its toxicity, and for women may have had a contraceptive effect. The forebears of the Noongar, as early as 10,000 BP, utilised quartz, replacing chert flint for spear and knife edges, when the chert deposit was submerged by sea level rise during the Flandrian transgression.|$|E
25|$|The Tequesta {{gathered}} many plant foods, including {{saw palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) berries, cocoplums (Chrysobalanus icaco), sea grapes (Coccoloba uvifera), prickly pear (nopal) fruits (Opuntia spp.), gopher apples (Licania micbauxii), pigeon plums (Cocoloba diversifolia), palm nuts, false mastic seeds, cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and hog plum (Ximenia americana). The roots of certain plants, such as Smilax spp. and coontie (<b>Zamia</b> integrifolia), were edible when ground into flour, processed to remove toxins (in {{the case of}} coontie), and made into a type of unleavened bread. (Archaeologists have commented, however, {{on the lack of}} evidence for coontie use in excavated sites.) Briton Hammond, the sole survivor of an English sloop that was attacked by Tequestas after grounding off Key Biscayne in 1748, reported that the Tequestas fed him boil'd corn.|$|E

25|$|Species {{diversity}} of the extant cycads peaks at 17˚ 15"N and 28˚ 12"S, with a minor peak at the equator. There is therefore not a latitudinal diversity gradient towards the equator but towards the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. However, the peak near the northern tropic {{is largely due to}} Cycas in Asia and <b>Zamia</b> in the New World, whereas the peak near the southern tropic is due to Cycas again, and also to the diverse genus Encephalartos in southern and central Africa, and Macrozamia in Australia. Thus, the distribution pattern of cycad species with latitude appears to be an artifact of the geographical isolation of the remaining cycad genera and their species, and perhaps because they are partly xerophytic rather than simply tropical.|$|E
2500|$|Djeran: March to April, was [...] "first rains-first dew", {{with the}} weather was {{becoming}} cooler with winds from the south west. Fishing continued (often caught in fish traps) and <b>zamia</b> palm (Noongar = djiriji, Macrozamia ridlei) cycad nuts (Noongar = buyu), (nardoo, Marsilia quadrifolia) bulbs and other seeds were collected for food.

2500|$|Some {{authors have}} argued that the Calusa {{cultivated}} maize and <b>Zamia</b> integrifolia (coontie) for food. [...] But, Widmer argues that the evidence for maize cultivation by the Calusa depends on the proposition that the Narváez and de Soto expeditions landed in Charlotte Harbor rather than Tampa Bay, which is now generally discounted. [...] No <b>Zamia</b> pollen has been found at any site associated with the Calusas, nor does <b>Zamia</b> grow in the wetlands that made up most of the Calusa environment. Marquardt notes that the Calusa turned down the offer of agricultural tools from the Spanish, saying that they had no need for them. The Calusa gathered a variety of wild berries, fruits, nuts, roots and other plant parts. Widmer cites George Murdock's estimate that only some 20 percent of the Calusa diet consisted of wild plants that they gathered. However, no evidence of plant food was found at the Wightman site. There is evidence that as early as 2000 years ago, the Calusa cultivated papaya (Catrica papaya), a gourd of the species Cucurbita pepo, and the bottle gourd, the last two of which were used for net floats and dippers.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the typical}} Landmark Mills mall {{is synonymous with}} outlet shopping, Pittsburgh Mills is the only center to offer an entire lineup of full-price {{retailers}} that otherwise {{could be found in}} a traditional enclosed mall. The reason for this goes back to 1981, when developer <b>Zamias</b> Services, Inc. of Johnstown, planned to develop a regional mall on the Frazer Township site. Legal setbacks and financial difficulties had postponed the project for many years, until the Mills Corporation announced in 1986 that they would partner in conjunction with <b>Zamias</b> to build a retail and entertainment complex on the site.|$|R

60|$|The coal crops {{out at the}} surface; but {{the shafts}} worked are sunk through thick beds of alluvium. The age of these coal-fields is quite unknown, and I regret {{to say that my}} {{examination}} of their fossil plants throws no material light on the subject. Upwards of thirty species of fossil plants have been procured from them, and of these the majority are referred by Dr. McLelland* [Reports of the Geological Survey of India. Calcutta, 1850.] to the inferior oolite epoch of England, from the prevalence of species of <b>Zamia,</b> Glossopteris, and Taeniopteris. Some of these genera, together with Vertebraria (a very remarkable Indian fossil), are also recognised in the coal-fields of Sind and of Australia. I cannot, however, think that botanical evidence of such a nature is sufficient to warrant a satisfactory reference of these Indian coal-fields to the same epoch as those of England or of Australia; in the first place the outlines of the fronds of ferns and their nervation are frail characters if employed alone for the determination of existing genera, and much more so of fossil fragments: in the second place recent ferns are so widely distributed, that an inspection of the majority affords little clue to the region or locality they come from: and in the third place, considering the wide difference in latitude and longitude of Yorkshire, India, and Australia, the natural conclusion is that they could not have supported a similar vegetation at the same epoch. In fact, finding similar fossil plants at places widely different in latitude, and hence in climate, is, in the present state of our knowledge, rather an argument against than for their having existed cotemporaneously. The Cycadeae, especially, whose fossil remains afford so much ground for geological speculations, are far from yielding such precise data as is supposed. Species of the order are found in Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and India, some inhabiting the hottest and dampest, and others the driest climates {{on the surface of the}} globe; and it appears to me rash to argue much from the presence of the order in the coal of Yorkshire and India, when we reflect that the geologist of some future epoch may find as good reasons for referring the present Cape, Australian, or Mexican Flora to the same period as that of the Lias and Oolites, when the Cycadeae now living in the former countries shall be fossilised.|$|E

50|$|The {{first major}} anchor change for Port Plaza {{came in the}} summer of 1992 when H.C. Prange was {{acquired}} by Younkers and subsequently renamed. In 1997, Whitehall Funds purchased Port Plaza and 9 other malls from Metropolitan Life, and named Johnstown, Pennsylvania-based <b>Zamias</b> Services Inc. to manage Port Plaza (<b>Zamias</b> would be removed as manager in February 2001). By this time, however, the mall {{was in the midst of}} a decline as shoppers lost favor with the mall and its downtown location and preferred stores and malls in outlying locations such as Bay Park Square in suburban Ashwaubenon. The mall would lose one of its three anchors in 2000 when Boston Store was merged with the same company that owned Younkers.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, {{the roof}} {{at the former}} J. C. Penney {{location}} collapsed. This prompted the then-new owners of the plaza, <b>Zamias</b> Services, Inc., to demolish the former J. C.

Since then, there have been talks of moving the remaining tenants into the two smaller portions of the plaza so that the two larger portions—the two that were on each side of J. C. Penney (including the former Hills/Ames store) can be considered for redevelopment. <b>Zamias</b> later admitted that if Northern Lights wasn't included in a package deal with other properties such as Pittsburgh Mills and instead was standalone, it wouldn't have acquired the property.|$|R
