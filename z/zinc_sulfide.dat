5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. <b>Zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E

5|$|Zinc powder is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide,</b> together with large amounts of hot gas, heat, and light.|$|E
5|$|The {{element is}} {{normally}} found {{in association with}} other base metals such as copper and lead in ores. Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere.

5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> ores and is produced as a byproduct of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E

50|$|The Broken Hill {{ore deposit}} is hosted within the Proterozoic gneisses of the Broken Hill Block, {{adjacent}} to the Curnamona Craton in South Australia. The terrane in which Broken Hill is hosted has undergone a series of several metamorphic deformations at amphibolite facies. This {{has resulted in the}} squeezing of the lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfides</b> into the current basic boomerang shape, and resulted in the separation of the ore body into zinc-rich and lead-rich lodes and domains.|$|R
5|$|Zinc is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It {{is the first}} element in group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).|$|E
5|$|Group 12 metals are chalcophiles, {{meaning the}} {{elements}} have low affinities for oxides and prefer {{to bond with}} sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals. Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide,</b> is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia. Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.|$|E
5|$|Although group 12 {{lies in the}} d-block of {{the modern}} 18-column {{periodic}} table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.|$|E
50|$|Wurtzite is a <b>zinc</b> iron <b>sulfide</b> mineral ((Zn,Fe)S) a less {{frequently}} encountered mineral form of sphalerite. The iron content is variable {{up to eight}} percent. It is trimorphous with matraite and sphalerite.|$|R
50|$|The {{tests were}} {{designed}} to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents. Stations on the ground tracked the fluorescent <b>zinc</b> cadmium <b>sulfide</b> particles. During the first test and subsequently, much of the material dispersed ended up being carried by winds into Canada. However, {{as was the case}} in the first test, particles were detected up to 1,200 miles away from their drop point. A typical flight line covering 400 miles would release 5,000 pounds of <b>zinc</b> cadmium <b>sulfide</b> and in fiscal year 1958 around 100 hours were spent in flight for LAC. That flight time included four runs of various lengths, one of which was 1,400 miles.|$|R

25|$|Cathodoluminescence, the {{emission}} of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons {{return to their}} ground state, is analogous to UV-induced fluorescence, and some materials such as <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena. Over the last decades, cathodoluminescence was most commonly experienced as the light emission from the inner surface of the cathode ray tube in television sets and computer CRT monitors. In the SEM, CL detectors either collect all light emitted by the specimen or can analyse the wavelengths emitted by the specimen and display an emission spectrum or {{an image of the}} distribution of cathodoluminescence emitted by the specimen in real color.|$|E

5000|$|Sulfides {{are some}} of the most {{unstable}} minerals in humid, oxidizing environments; many cadmium, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, nickel and <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfides</b> are easily leached to deep in the profile.

They are leached from the upper horizons and reprecipitate with secondary iron-manganese oxides in the mid- to lower saprolite.|$|R
25|$|Clocks, watches, and {{instruments}} {{dating from the}} first half of the 20th century, often in military applications, may have been painted with radioactive luminous paint. They are usually no longer luminous; however, this is not due to radioactive decay of the radium (which has a half-life of 1600 years) but to the fluorescence of the <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> fluorescent medium being worn out by the radiation from the radium. The appearance of an often thick layer of green or yellowish brown paint in devices from this period suggests a radioactive hazard. The radiation dose from an intact device is relatively low and usually not an acute risk; but the paint is dangerous if released and inhaled or ingested.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in solid solution, energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (<b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide),</b> fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E

40|$|A general {{review on}} {{preparation}} {{and methods of}} characterization of monolayers was given in Chapter 1. Different projects were undertaken in the research of this dissertation. Neutron and X-ray reflection studies of fullerene C[subscript] 60 and its derivative monolayers were performed in Chapter 1. Neutron and X-ray reflection measurements and surface pressure isotherms of spread films of C[subscript] 60 -dodecylamine adduct C[subscript] 60 -(NH[subscript] 2 (CH[subscript] 2) [subscript] 11 CH[subscript] 3][subscript]x and C[subscript] 60 -propylamine adduct C[subscript] 60 -(NH[subscript] 2 C[subscript] 3 H[subscript] 7][subscript]x indicate that these C[subscript] 60 derivatives may form monomolecular layers on water surface. By contrast, neutron reflection and surface pressure vs. area data of spread films of pure C[subscript] 60 on aqueous surfaces indicated the formation of inhomogeneous multilayer films with a thickness and a surface roughness exceeding the molecular size. These underivatized fullerenes thus did not form monomolecular films;In Chapter 2, nanoscale size particles were synthesized inside the channel protein MIP- 26 using monolayer technique. Cadmium and <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfides</b> were formed within the cavity of a channel protein by a simple process in which a close-packed monolayer of the channel protein was formed on a neutral subphase, transported to a cadmium-chloride-containing subphase, transferred to a quartz slide by Langmuir-Blodgett transfer and exposed to hydrogen sulfide.
