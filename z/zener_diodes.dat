25|$|At speed a dynamo can {{overpower}} the lamp, {{causing it}} to fail. Historically this was a nuisance, but modern lamps and dynamos often incorporate <b>Zener</b> <b>diodes</b> to prevent overvoltage, and dynamos can be designed to saturate beyond a certain voltage to protect the lamp.|$|E
25|$|These {{can be made}} {{to conduct}} in reverse bias (backward), and are {{correctly}} termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called Zener breakdown, occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode {{to be used as a}} precision voltage reference. The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking <b>Zener</b> <b>diodes</b> have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage <b>Zener</b> <b>diodes</b> are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or Transorb, a registered trademark).|$|E
25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} <b>Zener</b> <b>diodes</b> (and are often mistakenly called <b>Zener</b> <b>diodes),</b> but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E

Measuring elements of static relays have been successfully and economically built up from diodes, <b>zener</b> <b>diodes,</b> avalanche diodes, unijunction transistors, p-n-p and n-p-n bipolar transistors, field effect transistors or their combinations. Static relays offer the advantage of higher sensitivity than purely electromechanical relays, because power to operate output contacts is derived from a separate supply, not from the signal circuits. Static relays eliminated or reduced contact bounce, and could provide fast operation, long life and low maintenance.|$|E

50|$|A {{conventional}} solid-state diode allows significant current {{if it is}} reverse-biased {{above its}} reverse breakdown voltage. When the reverse bias breakdown voltage is exceeded, a conventional diode is subject to high current due to avalanche breakdown. Unless this current is limited by circuitry, the diode may be permanently damaged due to overheating. A <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> exhibits almost the same properties, except the device is specially designed so as to have a reduced breakdown voltage, the so-called Zener voltage. By contrast with the conventional device, a reverse-biased <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> exhibits a controlled breakdown and allows the current to keep the voltage across the <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> close to the Zener breakdown voltage. For example, a <b>diode</b> with a <b>Zener</b> breakdown voltage of 3.2 V exhibits a voltage drop of very nearly 3.2 V across {{a wide range of}} reverse currents. The <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> is therefore ideal for applications such as the generation of a reference voltage (e.g. for an amplifier stage), or as a voltage stabilizer for low-current applications.|$|R
