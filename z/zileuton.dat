25|$|The {{apparent}} volume of distribution of <b>zileuton</b> is approximately 1.2 L/kg. <b>Zileuton</b> is 93% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin, with minor binding to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.|$|E
25|$|Research on mice {{suggests}} that <b>Zileuton</b> used {{alone or in}} combination with imatinib may inhibit chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} formula of <b>zileuton</b> is C11H12N2O2S with a molecular weight of 236.29. The formulation from the manufacturer is a racemic mixture of R(+) and S(-) enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|Related {{compounds}} include montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate). These two compounds are leukotriene receptor antagonists which {{block the}} action of specific leukotrienes, while <b>zileuton</b> inhibits leukotriene formation.|$|E
25|$|Although the 600mg {{immediate}} release tablet (Zyflo) {{and extended}} release formulation of <b>zileuton</b> {{are still available}} (Zyflo CR), the 300mg immediate release tablet was withdrawn from the U.S. market on February 12, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Elimination of <b>zileuton</b> is {{primarily}} through metabolites {{in the urine}} (~95%) with the feces accounting for the next largest amount (~2%). The drug is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, 2C9, and 3A4.|$|E
25|$|Following oral {{administration}} <b>zileuton</b> is rapidly absorbed {{with a mean}} time to peak blood serum concentration of 1.7 hours and an average half-life elimination of 2.5 hours. Blood plasma concentrations are proportional to dose, whereas the absolute bioavailability is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|Human {{experience}} of acute overdose with <b>zileuton</b> is limited. [...] A patient {{in a clinical}} study took between 6.6 and 9.0grams of <b>zileuton</b> immediate-release tablets in a single dose. [...] Vomiting was inducted and the patient recovered without sequelae. [...] <b>Zileuton</b> is not removed by dialysis.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zileuton</b> is {{indicated}} for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in {{adults and children}} 12 {{years of age and}} older. [...] <b>Zileuton</b> is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks. Therapy with <b>zileuton</b> can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zileuton</b> is {{an active}} oral {{inhibitor}} of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which forms leukotrienes, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid from arachidonic acid. [...] The chemical name of <b>zileuton</b> is (±)-1-(1-Benzothien-2-ylethyl)-l-hydroxyurea.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zileuton</b> is a weak {{inhibitor}} of CYP1A2 {{and thus}} has three clinically important drug interactions, which include increasing theophylline, and propranolol levels. [...] It {{has been shown}} to lower theophylline clearance significantly, doubling the AUC and prolonging half-life by nearly 25%. Because of theophylline's relation to caffeine (both being a methylxanthine, and theophylline being a metabolite of caffeine), caffeine's metabolism and clearance may also be reduced, but there are no drug interaction studies between <b>zileuton</b> and caffeine. The R-isomer of warfarin metabolism and clearance is mainly affected by <b>zileuton,</b> while the S-isomer is not (because of metabolism via different enzymes). This can lead to an increase in prothrombin time.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zileuton</b> (trade name ZYFLO) is an orally active {{inhibitor}} of 5-lipoxygenase, {{and thus}} inhibits leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) formation, {{used for the}} maintenance treatment of asthma. [...] <b>Zileuton</b> was introduced in 1996 by Abbott Laboratories and is now marketed in two formulations by Cornerstone Therapeutics Inc. under the brand names ZYFLO and ZYFLO CR. [...] The original immediate-release formulation, ZYFLO, is taken four times per day. The extended-release formulation, ZYFLO CR, is taken twice daily.|$|E
2500|$|The {{avoidance}} of alcohol is recommended due to increase risk of CNS depression {{as well as}} an increase risk in liver toxicity. [...] In addition, the herbal supplement St. John's wort may decrease the serum levels of <b>zileuton.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zileuton</b> {{is a minor}} {{substrate}} of CYP1A2, 2C8/9, 3A4, and a weak inhibitor of CYP 1A2. The drug {{has been}} shown to increase the serum concentration or effects of theophylline, propranolol, and warfarin, although significant increase in prothrombin time is not obvious. [...] It is advised that the doses of each medication be monitored and/or reduced accordingly.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most serious}} {{side effect of}} ZYFLO and ZYFLO CR is a {{potential}} elevation of liver enzymes (in 2% of patients). [...] Therefore, <b>zileuton</b> is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or persistent hepatic function enzymes elevations greater {{than three times the}} upper limit of normal. [...] Hepatic function should be assessed prior to initiating ZYFLO CR, monthly for the first 3 months, every 2–3 months {{for the remainder of the}} first year, and periodically thereafter.|$|E
