25|$|Galactic Civilizations II {{is powered}} by a custom 3D game engine, {{although}} most user interface elements are displayed in 2D. Planets and ships are restricted to a single plane in space, but the user may pan and zoom as they wish, even to view the details of individual ships. Players may <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> view the galactic map on a wide scale, at which point the ships, planets and anomalies are replaced by icons. It is possible to play the game in this mode.|$|E
25|$|TVS's {{identity}} {{featured a}} six coloured symbol that formed up {{in three stages}} from the outside in before zooming out and sitting alongside the TVS lettering, accompanied by a shortened version of the station theme New Forest Rondo. There were different variations for weekday and weekend, which only differed in the <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the lettering. The ident was shot initially on film of a mechanical model, but was later shot using video effects and from 1985, a computer generated version of the ident was used. Accompanying this ident was a clock on a black background with the six TVS colours either side, and an ident sequence following the theme 'For the best view of the South' which was used prior to the news.|$|E
500|$|Cartman and Mysterion both {{refer to}} {{themselves}} as [...] "the symbol this town needs", a line from The Dark Knight, and Cartman encourages Butters to film a video threatening {{to blow up a}} hospital, the same as the Joker from a scene in that film. The opening shot of [...] "The Coon" [...] is also inspired by a sequence from Watchmen: both feature a close-up of a city sidewalk and <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> someone looking down from the top of a tall skyscraper. A poster of the Coon shown at Cartman's Coonicon 2009 is inspired by the front cover of The Dark Knight Returns, the Batman graphic novel by Frank Miller. Other common comic book film traits parodied in [...] "The Coon" [...] include costumes that do little to actually conceal secret identities, trophies adorning superhero secret lairs, and sudden disappearing exits and entrances.|$|E

50|$|As the Cylon and Galactica fleets {{prepare for}} battle, the camera <b>zooms</b> <b>out</b> (<b>to</b> show the entire galaxy), and zooms {{back into a}} nearby section of the galaxy to show a single planet: Earth.|$|R
5000|$|For years most {{television}} audiences saw {{a slightly}} altered opening credit {{than what is}} shown on the DVD releases. Instead of the opening animated [...] "Bye Bye Birdie" [...] title it opened with a solid white title card that <b>zoomed</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> fill the screen with the Columbia logo backing.|$|R
500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} to feature battling wizards, {{who would have}} had creatures (originally named Titans) to raise, and be powered by belief. A key idea was the ability to turn living beings into Titans. Healey's early visualisation featured the Horned Reaper from Dungeon Keeper representing Titans. The team wanted the player {{to see the world}} from the same perspective as possessing a creature in Dungeon Keeper (it was originally intended for the player {{to be able to take}} control of creatures in the first-person). Molyneux wanted [...] "limitless flexibility" [...] and the ability to <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> see the world from the sky. It was decided to make the player a god when it was realised that humans could not wield the powers that were being implemented. The spells that were to be cast became miracles, and the wizards' supporters became worshippers. The mechanic of turning living beings into Titans was dropped because of problems with balance, with certain Titans having advantages over others. After the name Titans was dropped, others were considered, including Sards, Demes, Ikons, Psiphs, and Amalians. None had unanimous support, so they ended up being called 'creatures'. Elements of the Wizard theme, such as Temples resembling a wizard's tower, remain in the final game. Temples were originally named Citadels and some sported a medieval, fairy-tale look.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{was among}} the first {{directors}} to use video assist during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of 2001, he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. On some films, such as Barry Lyndon, he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses [...] "dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers". For Barry Lyndon he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using [...] "pure candlelight", and in doing so Kubrick [...] "made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting... You almost posed like for portraits." [...] LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's [...] "magic lens" [...] and that he became a [...] "legend" [...] among cameramen around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{well-known}} HBO program opener, [...] "Neon Lights", began movies airing {{outside of}} primetime from November 1, 1986, to September 30, 1997. The sequence, set to a synth and electric guitar theme, {{begins with a}} purple HBO logo on a film strip with blue, green and pink light rays shooting through it as the strip rotates out of view; the lights shoot through several glowing CG slots until {{a flash of light}} hits a field of spheres in varying colors, which <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> form a light purple HBO logo overlaid by a cursive magenta [...] "Movie" [...] script against a black background with rows of light purple spheres. From 1997 to 1999, HBO used several feature presentation bumpers designed by Pittard Sullivan featuring the network logo in different situations (such as a fish in water, a celebrity in a limousine, a large HBO logo chasing a man and a neon HBO logo on the rooftop of a building); these sequences were also used by the network as IDs from 1997 to 2002, and in upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers until 2000.|$|E
50|$|Howard's {{mother is}} at the wedding, albeit off-screen, along with Bernadette's father. While there is some tension between Leonard and Penny after his mistaken proposal, the five ministers each say some words before the couple {{exchange}} their vows. The camera <b>zooms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> show the satellite's view of the rooftop, and continues <b>to</b> <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> until a picture of Earth is visible. The episode ends back in the present, when the Soyuz capsule takes off.|$|R
50|$|Cesira is outraged and upset, {{slapping}} and spanking Rosetta for her behavior, but Rosetta remains unresponsive, emotionally distant. When, however, Cesira informs Rosetta of Michele's death, Rosetta {{begins to}} cry like the little girl she had been prior to the rape. With her mother comforting the child, De Sica <b>zooms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> end the film.|$|R
5000|$|This setting then {{shatters}} in {{the middle}} of the second verse to feature clips of the two performers, as well as backup dancers, performing in front of flashing neon lights. As the song ends, the camera <b>zooms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> show that the lights form the promotional [...] "Press Play" [...] symbol associated with the album.|$|R

Halfway through the video, Jamelia is having {{what seems to}} be a tea party on a grass and one scene shows her in a thin walkway with white walls.|$|R
50|$|Then {{he flies}} back home, {{coming out of}} the flashback. After putting a turkey in the oven, taking a bath, and giving his pets {{presents}}, he critiques presents received from his relatives. Father Christmas climbs into bed, wishing everyone a merry Christmas. Then the camera <b>zooms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the immediate area, where church bells can be heard ringing out on Christmas morning.|$|R
50|$|After {{the opening}} {{establishing}} shot, the film cuts to {{a close-up of}} Edvard Munch's The Scream. The camera <b>zooms</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> show {{that this is a}} framed copy hung in Morlar's apartment. In the ensuing opening scene, after Morlar is murdered, the camera pans over the wall of his apartment and comes to rest on a copy of Caravaggio's Medusa, which underlies the opening credits.|$|R
