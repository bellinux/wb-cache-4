40|$|Interfacial {{reaction}} between {{refractory materials}} such as zirconia, magnesia and doloma brick, and the metallurgical slags of the CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-CaF 2 system with varying CaF 2 content were investigated at high temperatures using various methodologies with static and dynamic modes. To figure out the corrosion mechanism due to interfacial reaction with the slag, the slag characteristics were examined in terms of flow temperature and viscosity and the corroded interface of zirconia, magnesia and doloma refractories were analyzed by SEM-EDS and EPMA. With an addition of CaF 2, three different layers were formed at the interface between slag and <b>zirconia</b> <b>refractory.</b> Furthermore, the corrosion of <b>zirconia</b> <b>refractory</b> {{was found to be}} accelerated with an increase of CaF 2 which facilitated the dissolution of intermediate compounds. The penetration of slag through the grain boundaries of MgO refractory is enhanced by increasing the content of CaF 2 due to an increase in the fluidity of slag in the dynamic mode. On the other hand, in the static condition, a dense Ca 2 SiO 4 layer is formed at the hot face of magnesia-doloma refractory due to a reaction between silica in slag and lime in doloma, resulting in the protection of direct corrosion of refractory brick. However, the thickness of C 2 S layer decreases with increasing content of CaF 2 due to an increase in fluidity of slag. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An {{in-depth}} {{study has been}} carried out to investigate refractory degradation during continuous steel casting processes. Slag/refractory interactions have been investigated through a study of the wetting behaviour and gas generation phenomena at the slag/refractory interface at 1550 oC using sessile drop experiments. The influence of carbon content and slag composition was investigated. Two different steel casting slags (slag 1 : MnO 50 %, SiO 2 25 %, Al 2 O 3 25 %; and slag 2 : MnO 40 %, SiO 2 60 %) have been studied along with yttria stabilized <b>zirconia</b> <b>refractory</b> substrates respectively containing 10 %, 15 % and 20 % carbon. The gas generation has been measured using the Infrared gas analyser, and its influence has also been investigated by taking optical images at varying times. The total amount of gases emitted has shown the dependence on the compositions of refractory substrates and the existence of casting slags. Under the investigation of zirconia-carbon refractory, a new phenomenon that the gas generated can push the liquid slags away and minimise the contact of slags and refractory substrates has been proven...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNew {{compositions}} of {{refractory materials}} {{with a very}} high content of zirconia are being developed for the processing of special glasses. The use of these refractories requires good control of the manufacturing process to avoid critical flaws due to severe thermo-mechanical stresses. These materials exhibit a microstructure containing monoclinic zirconia dendrites embedded into a glassy phase. The {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize the coupling between the microstructural texture and the cooling process of high <b>zirconia</b> <b>refractories.</b> The cooling stage creates an important thermal gradient between the core and the skin of the block. During this cooling process, zirconia crystallizes under the cubic (C) phase and then two phase transitions occur (cubic to tetragonal (T) and tetragonal to monoclinic (M)), which can influence the macroscopic mechanical properties. Neutron diffraction experiments have been performed, on samples from solidified blocks to evaluate the relationship between the thermal gradient of cooling and the crystallographic texture. It was shown that the stress field created during the cooling process manages the preferential orientation of zirconia crystals...|$|R

50|$|On 13 January 2010 {{some of the}} {{aluminosilicate}} {{refractory ceramic}} fibres and <b>zirconia</b> aluminosilicate <b>refractory</b> ceramic fibres {{have been included in}} the candidate list of Substances of Very High Concern. In response to concerns raised with the definition and the dossier two additional dossiers were posted on the ECHA website for consultation and resulted in two additional entries on the candidate list. This actual (having four entries for one substance/group of substances) situation is contrary to the REACH procedure intended. Aside from this situation, concerns raised during the two consultation periods remain valid.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{concerns}} high <b>zirconia</b> fused-cast <b>refractories</b> used in {{the glass}} industry. In situ temperature measurements have been performed in the casting structure during an actual casting of a tile. A two-dimensional mesh of the casting structure has been developed so as to perform numerical simulations. From temperature recordings, an interfacial heat transfer coefficient between the tile and the graphite mould has been determined, by an inverse method, by fitting the calculated temperatures with those measured. A similar procedure allowed the thermal conductivity and the heat capacity of the surrounding insulating medium to be determined. Then, the numerical model allowed {{the evolution of the}} temperature field, within the tile, to be determined. The influences of different parameters (mould thickness and thermal properties of the annealing medium) have been numerically tested, by comparison with the cooling-down kinetics of the tile...|$|R

40|$|After subchronic {{exposure}} of rats to different fibre types [calcium magnesium silicate fibre, calcium magnesium <b>zirconia</b> silicate fibre, <b>refractory</b> ceramic fibre (RCF), non-fibrous material of that RCF and long amosite] lung fibre burden accumulation was proportional to biopersistence. The lung burden of non-fibrous particulate was so pronounced (> 2 µl/lung) that macrophage clearance collapsed and considerable inflammation occured. The {{effects of the}} three vitreous fibres also correlated with effects on clearance. A fibre (RCF) with the same composition as the particles accumulated to a similar mass/volume level but had less effect. Amosite fibres accumulated {{more than the other}} test materials investigated, mostly in the interstitial tissue, but produced only a small effect on clearance of labelled particles, however, amosite had the highest effect on cell proliferation. The toxicity results of this study are presented in an accompanying paper...|$|R
