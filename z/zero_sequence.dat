2500|$|An example {{illustrating}} the infinite-dimensional case is {{afforded by the}} map f: R∞ → R∞, [...] with b1 = 0 and b'n + 1 = an for n > 0. Its image consists of all sequences with first element 0, and thus its cokernel consists of the classes of sequences with identical first element. Thus, whereas its kernel has dimension 0 (it maps only the <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> to the <b>zero</b> <b>sequence),</b> its co-kernel has dimension 1. Since the domain and the target space are the same, the rank and the dimension of the kernel add up to the same sum as the rank and the dimension of the co-kernel ( [...] ), but in the infinite-dimensional case it cannot be inferred that the kernel and the co-kernel of an endomorphism have the same dimension (0 ≠ 1). The reverse situation obtains for the map h: R∞ → R∞, [...] with cn = a'n + 1. Its image is the entire target space, and hence its co-kernel has dimension 0, but since it maps all sequences in which only the first element is non-zero to the <b>zero</b> <b>sequence,</b> its kernel has dimension 1.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> {{represents}} the {{component of the}} unbalanced phasors that is equal in magnitude and phase. Because they are in phase, <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> currents flowing through an n-phase network will sum to n times {{the magnitude of the}} individual <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> currents components. Under normal operating conditions this sum is small enough to be negligible. However, during large <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> events such as lightning strikes, this nonzero sum of currents can lead to a larger current flowing through the neutral conductor than the individual phase conductors. Because neutral conductors are typically not larger than individual phase conductors, a large <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> component can lead to the overheating of neutral conductors and to fires. One way to prevent large <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> currents is to use a delta connection which appears as an open circuit to <b>zero</b> <b>sequence</b> currents.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fresh new combinatorial {{approach to the}} study of minimal <b>zero</b> <b>sequences</b> of a finite abelian group.

We continue by giving a closed form solution for the number of atoms in an infinite family of groups. Then, by introducing the concept of the dimension class of an atom in the block monoid of a group, we are able to give a partial description of another infinite family of groups. Finally, we conclude by making a strong connection between the study of minimal <b>zero</b> <b>sequences</b> and the polynomials of a group which are in-variant under a certain class of cyclic variable substitutions. ...|$|R
