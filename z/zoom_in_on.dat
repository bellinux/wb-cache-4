5|$|In {{the second}} setting, the player guides Harry Mason in an over-the-shoulder view as he {{searches}} for his missing daughter Cheryl in the snowy town of Silent Hill. Harry {{is equipped with}} a smartphone and flashlight: he can use the phone to check his location on a Global Positioning System map, take photographs, and make telephone calls. Moving to certain spots with high interference, represented by a lot of radio noise, or by taking pictures of spots where shadowy figures can be seen, unlock various text and voicemail messages that expand the story and occasionally provide clues. To view the details of various documents, the player can <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> objects. The game also alters details of gameplay based on what the player views. Throughout his journey, Harry encounters puzzles such as mechanisms, which reward either a key required to progress or a bonus memento. In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for puzzle solving and to control the flashlight and cell phone.|$|E
5|$|Scene7's {{clients include}} the {{companies}} Sears, Lands' End, Harrods, Macy's, Office Depot, Levi Strauss & Co., La-Z-Boy, and QVC. In 2001, Scene7 agreed to develop home design and landscaping software for Individual Software for $50million. High-end casual clothing retailer Anthropologie has used Scene7's services {{to create and}} deploy online catalogs for its e-commerce website since November 9, 2004. The retailer implemented Scene7's Dynamic Imaging service to let customers <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> products, similar to how merchandise is inspected in retail stores. The Harrods department store {{signed an agreement with}} Scene7 on June 24, 2005 to use Scene7's imaging and catalog system on the store's website. This required Harrods to convert all its printed material to a digital format for Internet use.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Knowles walking down an alley, {{accompanied}} by several men in suits, {{an homage to}} Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs. As the main section of the song begins, cameras <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Knowles as she dances in {{a black and white}} latex leotard while holding sunglasses with hand signals on them. When the first verse begins, Knowles seductively dances for two men who have cameras as heads. Another scene shows her teasing men with futuristic toy guns while wearing a skin-colored latex top. During Gaga's verse, she and Knowles appear wearing white leotards; they both sing to the camera while shooting more toy guns in open fire. Knowles next brandishes a bow and fires arrows at a cameraman who's strapped to a rotating dart board. She and Gaga, now in front of a white backdrop, perform a synchronized dance together, with Gaga wearing a pair of yellow Louboutins heels. Knowles then appears dressed as an homage to Bettie Page, while handling several different firearms. Throughout the video, the two singers fire their guns and arrows at men. The video ends with Knowles shooting a gun while perched upon a stationary motorcycle and surrounded by images {{from the start of the}} video.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} {{series of the}} show, the opening {{sequence}} consisted of a police car, a Rover SD1, racing down a street with its siren wailing and its blue flashing light on. The car would screech to a stop, and the camera would <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the blue light. Various clips were then shown from the series {{of the characters in}} action, often chasing suspects.

500|$|The {{game was}} criticized {{for the lack of}} {{downloadable}} content beyond the existing Death Magnetic album, and its price was also called into question, costing the same as World Tour but with fewer songs. The career mode's [...] "cartoon storyline" [...] describing the player's Metallica's-wannabe band was seen as being out of place in the game and was considered as the game's [...] "biggest weakness". Chris Roper of IGN noted that the PlayStation 2 version of the game suffers from several graphical problems, including poor video compression, the inability to read or <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> handwritten tour and lyric sheets, and some stuttering on the display on the note highway, and considers it the weakest release across all the game's platforms. Roper also cites video compression and problems with viewing the extras in the Wii version.|$|E
500|$|There are a {{total of}} nine levels in Obi-Wan's Adventures that can be played with {{different}} difficult-settings. Obi-Wan is attacked by the Trade Federation's droids, bounty hunters, and other evil critters during his travels, and the player is able to control his lightsaber and blaster to defeat them. Both close- and long-range combat {{are available in the}} battles with the Federation's forces. The player can also take advantage of Obi-Wan's connection to the Force as a weapon. In order to do this, the player hits the [...] "A" [...] key to <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the target and then hits [...] "A" [...] again to blow the enemy away. The power of the Force is limited and eventually runs out. To power up, the player accumulates Force pellets that can be obtained on the different levels. The Force is not only used as weapon, but also to get through the levels by moving objects that are in the way.|$|E
500|$|The {{team made}} use of Havok's Behavior toolset for {{character}} animation, which allows for a greater fluidity between the character's movements of walking, running and sprinting, and also increases {{the efficiency of the}} third-person camera option, which had been criticized in Oblivion. The toolset allows interactions between the player and NPCs to take place in real-time; in Oblivion, when the player went to interact with an NPC, time would freeze and the camera would <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the NPC's face. In Skyrim, NPCs can move around and make body gestures while conversing with the player. Children are present in the game, and their presence is handled similarly to Fallout 3 in that they cannot be harmed by the player in any way, since depictions of violence involving children in video games is considered controversial. Skyrim makes use of the Radiant AI artificial intelligence system that was created for Oblivion, and it has been updated to allow NPCs to [...] "do what they want under extra parameters". The updated system allows for greater interaction between NPCs and their environments; NPCs can perform tasks such as farming, milling, and mining in the game world, and will react to each other.|$|E

In May, 2012, she performed [...] "Flaws and All" [...] {{as a part}} of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote, [...] "She has a fast-reacting face, and opens her eyes wide to look astonished, touched, or grateful.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of [...] "The Tale of Sir Robin", there is a slow camera <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> rocky scenery (that in the voice over is {{described}} as [...] "the dark forest of Ewing"). This is actually a still photograph of the Gorge at Mount Buffalo National Park in Victoria, Australia.

This was a low-cost method of achieving a convincing location effect.|$|E
2500|$|The opening title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by Elastic. The company previously created the title sequence for True Detective, which had stood out to the creators in terms of [...] "imagination and delivering on what the show was about". DeKnight explained that multiple companies had made pitches to the creative team involving [...] "variations of the same idea, where you <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> an eye and you see a sonar map of the city." [...] However, one of Elastic's pitches had [...] "fluid-like blood dripping over everything ... as if paint were covering something invisible and revealing it", which both DeKnight and Loeb wanted to use immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{previous}} album, short animated [...] "idents" [...] have been released for fictional band members Murdoc, 2D, Russel, and the Noodle cyborg. The first depicts Murdoc fleeing from an unknown, rifle-wielding assailant (featuring a clip of [...] "Three Hearts, Seven Seas, Twelve Moons" [...] in the background), and the second depicts 2D's abduction and transportation to Plastic Beach by a masked figure, who according to the Boogeyman (with a snippet of the instrumental version of [...] "Rhinestone Eyes"). The track can be found as a bonus track along with [...] "Pirate's Progress" [...] on the iTunes Deluxe edition. Russel's ident has him stomping off of {{the edge of a}} pier and diving into the ocean, presumably headed to Plastic Beach for reasons unknown. The fourth features a <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Cyborg Noodle with its face plate open. A fifth ident was also released, showing a luxury cruise sail being bombarded by torpedoes coming from planes flying above it. A crew member rushes over to cabin 13 to warn a passenger, who is revealed to be Noodle (wearing the oni mask), that the cruise is under attack by pirates and he was told to escort her to the lifeboats. Noodle then grabs her briefcase and opens it, revealing a gun, and passes the crew member while heading out, presumably to face the pirates. Noodle's ident acts as a trailer to the [...] "On Melancholy Hill" [...] music video, which was released on 15 June.|$|E
