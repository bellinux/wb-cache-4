25|$|Users {{can view}} {{statistics}} for rainfall, streamflow, water depth, and flooding every 3 hours, at each 12 kilometer gridpoint {{on a global}} map. Forecasts for these parameters are 5 days into the future. Users can <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see inundation maps (areas estimated to be covered with water) in 1 kilometer resolution.|$|E
25|$|Central to the Ensembl {{concept is}} the ability to {{automatically}} generate graphical views of the alignment of genes and other genomic data against a reference genome. These are shown as data tracks, and individual tracks can be turned on and off, allowing the user to customise the display to suit their research interests. The interface also enables the user to <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> a region or move along the genome in either direction.|$|E
25|$|After {{thoroughly}} {{cleaning the}} diamond, the diamond {{is picked up}} using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond {{for the first time}} through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set down and picked up with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the tweezer, so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.|$|E

50|$|G'MIC is {{primarily}} a script language callable from a shell. For example, to display an image:gmic image.jpgThis command displays the image contained in the file image.jpg and allows <b>zooming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> examine values.|$|R
50|$|Planet Earth Live - An ident used to {{introduce}} and promote Planet Earth Live. Similar to Frozen Planet, {{the earth is}} seen, before the camera <b>zooms</b> <b>in,</b> <b>to</b> reveal a desert with birds and elephants.|$|R
50|$|The film {{ends with}} a shot of Betinha's face with a serious expression. The camera <b>zooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the {{reflection}} <b>in</b> her eye which shows Coffin Joe who is laughing amid the sounds of tortured screams.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Chamaerops humilis var. argentea, south {{slopes of}} the High Atlas, Morocco. <b>Zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see the spines on the petioles.|$|E

5000|$|On <b>zooming</b> <b>in,</b> {{lines and}} curves need not get wider proportionally. Often the width is either not {{increased}} {{or less than}} proportional. On the other hand, irregular curves represented by simple geometric shapes may be made proportionally wider when <b>zooming</b> <b>in,</b> <b>to</b> keep them looking smooth and not like these geometric shapes.|$|R
5000|$|... (December 27, 1979 - March 26, 1981) The {{original}} {{opening of}} Knots Landing designed by Wayne Fitzgerald features a rotating aerial {{shot of a}} California beach which dissolves to a rotating aerial shot of roads and houses, gradually <b>zooming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> a freeze-frame of the Seaview Circle cul-de-sac. The camera then <b>zooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> {{the top of each}} house in turn, showing a brief shot of the residents of each home. Photo credits for each of the main actors then appear superimposed over the shape of the cul-de-sac. In the pilot, however, it had the photo credits of the main actors shown superimposed over the house each of their characters live in.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: For moving images, {{the action}} of <b>zooming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> fill the frame with the subject {{requires}} the simultaneous tilting up of the camera, shown by the red lines, to maintain the correct amount of headroom. Conversely, zooming out requires tilting down.|$|R

5000|$|There is no {{ability to}} <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> (or enlarge) a VI which {{will be hard to}} see on a large, {{high-resolution}} monitor, although this feature is under development [...]|$|E
5000|$|Another {{feature of}} the show was [...] "looking through the polka-dot-door." [...] This {{feature of the}} show, usually on [...] "Finding-Out Day," [...] was unique in that the camera would <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> a special dot on the door, which would open up to reveal a short {{educational}} film.|$|E
50|$|The short {{begins by}} showing {{a map of}} Music Land, before <b>zooming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> show the treble clef-shaped Land of Symphony. The Land of Symphony is a {{classical}} music-themed kingdom, where the princess (an anthropomorphized violin) grows bored with the slow ballroom dancing and sneaks out.|$|R
50|$|The series also {{introduced}} graphical scaling into the fighting game genre: as the characters move towards each other, the camera <b>zooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> maximize {{the level of}} detail. Character sprites in Art of Fighting change as the fight progresses to become more bruised and cut as damage is taken.|$|R
50|$|StretchText {{is similar}} to outlining, however instead of {{drilling}} down lists to greater detail, the current node is replaced with a newer node. This ‘stretching’ {{to increase the amount}} of writing, or contracting to decrease it gives the feature its name. This is analogous <b>to</b> <b>zooming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> get more detail.|$|R
5000|$|A {{group of}} ants is seen {{coming and going}} at an anthill. The camera and mike <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> allow the viewer {{to see and hear}} as a mother summons her son: [...] "Hen-REEEE!" [...] "Coming, Mother!" [...] (referring to the catchphrase from the radio show, [...] "The Aldrich Family").|$|E

50|$|The Prime Radiant {{projects}} the equations onto walls in some unexplained manner, {{but it does}} not cast shadows, thus allowing workers easy interaction. Control operates through the power of the mind, allowing the user to <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> details of the equations, and to change them. One can make annotations, but by convention all amendments remain anonymous.|$|E

50|$|The Open Tree of Life is {{an on-line}} phylogenetic {{tree of life}} - a {{collaborative}} effort, funded by the NSF AVAToL #1208809. The first draft, including 2.3 million species, was released in September 2015. The Interactive graph allows the user to <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> taxonomic classifications, phylogenetic trees, and information about a node. Clicking on a species will return its source and reference taxonomy.|$|E
50|$|The {{aspect of}} state {{hierarchy}} emphasized most often is abstraction—an old and powerful technique {{for coping with}} complexity. Instead of addressing all aspects of a complex system at the same time, it is often possible to ignore (abstract away) {{some parts of the}} system. Hierarchical states are an ideal mechanism for hiding internal details because the designer can easily zoom out or <b>zoom</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> hide or show nested states.|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{brings a}} little of the Applied Legal Storytelling movement to the conference. It starts with the larger topic of coherence and plausibility in legal storytelling, then quickly <b>zooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> explore mimesis and character in legal storytelling, looking at how these elements contribute to the persuasiveness of legal narratives (and how they might differ from the storytelling found in narrative fiction) ...|$|R

The spherical objects are glass beads with a diameter of 10 μm, similar <b>in</b> diameter <b>to</b> a red blood cell.|$|R
