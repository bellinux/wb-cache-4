50|$|Seven {{species of}} duiker antelopes {{are found in}} Sapo National Park, {{including}} the vulnerable Jentink's duiker (Cephalophus jentinki) and <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus zebra). bay duikers (Cephalophus dorsalis) and Maxwell's duikers (Cephalophus maxwellii) are reported to be locally abundant.|$|E
5000|$|Wildlife in {{the park}} {{includes}} large antelope such as [...] eland, red hartebeest, bontebok, kudu, gemsbok, steenbok, mountain <b>zebra,</b> <b>duiker</b> and ostriches in the Postberg section. Other smaller animals include the bat-eared fox, caracal, and Cape gray mongoose.|$|E
5000|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. However, {{the status of}} two species, the <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> and the Aders' duiker, remained dubious. In 2012, Anne R. Johnston (of the University of Orleans) and colleagues constructed a cladogram of the subfamily Cephalophinae (duiker) based on mitochondrial analysis. They showed that within the [...] "giant duiker" [...] group, the bay duiker formed a clade with Jentink's duiker, and the <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> is sister to this clade. Similarly, Abbott's duiker and yellow-backed duiker form a clade sister to Sylvicapra. The bay duiker and Jentink's duiker probably evolved during the Pleistocene, less than 2.5 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zebra</b> <b>duikers</b> live in lowland primary rainforests, {{particularly}} by clearings and along forest margins. They are most {{commonly found in}} forested areas of the midwestern parts of Africa. They can less commonly be found in hill and low-mountain forests.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zebra</b> <b>duikers</b> have {{displayed}} diurnal activity when {{living in}} captive situations, but mostly nocturnal in the wild.They are solitary animals that form pair bonds for breeding purposes. Both {{the male and}} female participate in the defense of young and home range. Adaptations include stripes and thickened nasal/frontal bones. The stripes may reduce injury to the more vulnerable abdominal area. The stripes may also {{make it more difficult for}} some predators to identify by breaking up the outline of their forms. The nasal bones allow for protection against blunt force during altercations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zebra</b> <b>duikers</b> have gold or red-brown coats with 12-16 {{distinctive}} zebra-like stripes, dark {{markings on}} their upper legs, and russet faces. Newborns appear darker {{because they are}} born with their stripes closer together. An adult can grow to 90 cm in length, 45 cm in height, and 20 kg in weight. Their horns are short and round with sharp pointed tips. They are about 4.5 - 5.0 cm long in males, and half that in females. Female body size is larger than males, possibly due to long gestation periods.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> is Cephalophus zebra. The bay duiker is classified under the genus Cephalophus and the family Bovidae. It was first described by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1838 in Annals of Natural History. No subspecies are identified. The generic name probably comes from {{the combination of the}} New Latin word cephal, meaning head, and the Greek word lophos, meaning crest. The specific name zebra pertains to the striking resemblance this duiker bears to the zebra due to the presence of dorsal stripes. The word [...] "duiker" [...] comes from the Afrikaans word duik, or Dutch duiker - both mean [...] "diver". The <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> is locally known as the marking deer in Liberia.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus zebra) {{is a small}} {{antelope}} found {{primarily in}} Liberia, {{as well as the}} Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and occasionally Guinea. They are sometimes referred to as the banded duiker or striped-back duiker. It is believed {{to be one of the}} earliest duiker species to have evolved.|$|E
50|$|They are {{considered}} Vulnerable by the IUCN due to deforestation, loss of habitat, and overhunting within its range. Zebra duikers are common prey to Leopards, African Gold Cats, African Rock Pythons, and the Crowned Eagle. The <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> {{has been described}} as the species least capable of adapting of all West African Duiker species and most likely to become extinct. The wild population is estimated at 28,000 individuals. This estimation is believed to be high and continues to decline. Having once been more widespread, it is now more common in protected areas, in particular the Gola National Park in Sierra Leone, Sapo National Park in Liberia, and Taï National Park in Ivory Coast. In a study conducted to identify areas of greatest conservation need, one <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> was identified in an unprotected area of the Ziama Classified Forest of Guinea. This area is under consideration for classification as a national park and currently serves as a home to many species categorized as rare and threatened.|$|E

50|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. Abbott's duiker (C. spadix), the bay duiker (C. dorsalis), Jentink's duiker (C. jentinki) and the yellow-backed duiker (C. silvicultor) {{were classified as}} the giant duikers. The east African red duikers include the black-fronted duiker (C. nigrifrons), Harvey's duiker (C. harveyi), red-flanked duiker (C. rufilatus), red forest duiker (C. natalensis), Ruwenzori duiker and white-bellied duiker (C. leucogaster). The third group, the west African red duikers, comprises the black duiker (C. niger), Ogilby's duiker, Peters's duiker (C. callipygus) and Weyns's duiker (C. weynsi). However, the status of two species, Aders' duiker and <b>Zebra</b> <b>duiker,</b> remained dubious.|$|E
50|$|Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve {{lies within}} Guinean Forests of West Africa Biodiversity Hotspot. It {{harbours}} an especially rich flora and fauna, {{and it is}} the home of more than 2000 vascular plant species, 317 vertebrate species, 107 of which are mammals, and to more than 2,500 invertebrate species. The reserve is a subject of biological surveys, because there are still large numbers of unknown species. Notably endemic vertebrates are Nimba viviparous toad (Nimbaphrynoides occidentalis), Lamotte's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros lamottei), and Nimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei). Other rare and endangered animals are West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis), pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis), <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus zebra), and western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) that uses stones as tools.|$|E

40|$|Savannahs make {{up about}} 20 % of the world’s land surface, whereas African savannahs {{constitute}} 50 % of the land area and {{have been used as}} parks to conserve nature and for outdoor recreation. However, conserving biodiversity in these ecosystems has been challenging due to increasing pressures, potential loss of habitat and species or lack of up-to-date data in some of the protected areas. In this thesis, I investigated the state of biodiversity in Akagera National Park (ANP), Rwanda, and factors affecting its distribution. The work of this thesis is {{based on the results of}} large-scale, replicated point counts and presence-absence surveys conducted between August 2009 and August 2011 in the savannah habitats of the park. ANP plays an important role in conserving about 525 bird species known from the park and > 50 species of large mammals. Systematic plots of equally-spaced 1 -km 2 (n = 266) were used for both bird and large mammal censuses. The Chao 2 estimator and the Simpson index were used to estimate and compare bird species richness and diversity, respectively, between inside and outside the park. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to investigate relationships between bird diversity and habitat structure, whereas Distance sampling methods were used for estimating both population sizes and densities of large mammals. Despite recent important changes in habitats and fauna of the ANP, the results of this thesis show that the park has maintained an important diversity of birds. The 301 bird species recorded during my study represents 43 % of Rwanda’s checklist of birds (i. e. 697 species), underlining that ANP still contributes to the conservation of birds (Paper I). The results highlight that ANP still maintained special and important ornithological features, including the presence of endemic species of the Lake Victoria region, globally threatened species, those that have not previously been recorded in Akagera and a large number of Palearctic and Afrotropical migrants (Paper I). The abundance of bird species was found to be linked to human influence (Paper II). In fact, this thesis found large human effects on both the grassland habitat (e. g. reduction of grass biomass and the presence of tall grass by 57 % and 76 %, respectively) and bird species richness which significantly varied between inside and outside the park due to different land use practices between the two types of habitat. However, human activities did not affect species diversity. This thesis further revealed significant relationships between habitat structure and bird species richness that varied between inside and outside the park (Paper III). However, habitat structure did not correlate with species diversity. Paper III also demonstrated that single savannah species use habitats differently due to individual niche characteristics and niche interactions with other species. Estimates of the total population and density of large mammals varied for each species and the most abundant large herbivores were impalas, buffaloes, topis, baboons and zebras (Paper IV). High population sizes and densities of Ankolé found both inside and outside the park might have an impact on wildlife. Similarly, large population sizes of large mammals that are still outside the park pose a conservation challenge. Compared to previous surveys of the park (e. g. 1990, 1997 / 1998, 2002 & 2010), the findings of this thesis demonstrate that most large wild herbivores declined between 1990 and 2011 except <b>zebras,</b> warthogs and <b>duikers</b> that rather increased. Habitat structure was also found to affect the distribution and abundance of large mammals. Finally, I hope that my results provide new inputs for further strengthening of efforts to conserve the park’s biodiversity and might be useful for further assessment of the relationships between species diversity/richness and community stability as well as ecosystem function...|$|R
5000|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers.

50|$|On {{the first}} expedition, Büttikofer was {{accompanied}} by a Dutchman, Mr. Carolus Franciscus Sala of Leiden, who had previously served in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and had also collected zoological specimens in present-day Angola. Venturing into areas in the lands of the Gola people along the Saint Paul River that had never before been visited by Europeans, Büttikofer and Sala were highly successful in their collecting activities. Among their finds was the first ever complete specimen of the <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus zebra). Suffering from a range of adversities, rapacious local chieftains, malaria and other tropical medical afflictions, Büttikofer and Sala next set up a collecting station at Robertsport. Here, Sala’s condition worsened, and he died on 10 June 1881 and was buried in a mission cemetery. Büttikofer continued collecting, now in the company of the Liberian hunter Jackson Demery, and also visited the various coastal trading factories in eastern Liberia, until severe ill health forced him to return to Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Antelope have a {{wide variety}} of coverings, though most have a dense coat of short fur. In most species, the coat (pelage) is some {{variation}} of a brown colour (or several shades of brown), often with white or pale underbodies. Exceptions include the zebra-marked <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker,</b> the grey, black, and white Jentink's duiker, and the black lechwe. Most of the [...] "spiral-horned" [...] antelopes have pale, vertical stripes on their backs. Many desert and semidesert species are particularly pale, some almost silvery or whitish (e.g. Arabian oryx); the beisa and southern oryxes have gray and black pelages with vivid black-and-white faces. Common features of various gazelles are white rumps, which flash a warning to others when they run from danger, and dark stripes midbody (the latter feature is also shared by the springbok and beira). The springbok also has a pouch of white, brushlike hairs running along its back, which opens up when the animal senses danger, causing the dorsal hairs to stand on end.|$|E
50|$|Also found are two bats, Buettikofer's epauletted {{fruit bat}} (Epomops buettikoferi) and Aellen's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros marisae), Pel's flying {{squirrel}} (Anomalurus peli), giant pangolin (Manis gigantea), tree pangolin (Manis tricuspis) and long-tailed pangolin (Manis tetradactyla), Liberian mongoose (Liberiictus kuhni), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), leopard (Panthera pardus), African forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), which in 2001 numbered only about 100 {{individuals in the}} south of the park compared to some 1,800 in 1979, red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni ivoriensis), dwarf or pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) numbered at around 500 in 1996 {{is one of the few}} viable populations remaining, water chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus) and an exceptional variety of forest duikers including Jentink's duiker (Cephalophus jentinki), banded or <b>zebra</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus zebra), Maxwell's duiker (Cephalophus maxwelii), Ogilby's duiker (Cephalophus ogilbyi), black duiker (Cephalophus niger), bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus sylvicultor) and the royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus). Forest rodents include the rusty-bellied brush-furred rat (Lophuromys sikapusi), the Edward's swamp rat (Malacomys edwardsi) and the woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus). Also recorded in the park is Stochomys defua, which is characteristic of secondary forest.|$|E
