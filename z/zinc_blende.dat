5|$|Alpha {{silicon carbide}} (α-SiC) {{is the most}} {{commonly}} encountered polymorph; it is formed at temperatures greater than 1700°C and has a hexagonal crystal structure (similar to Wurtzite). The beta modification (β-SiC), with a <b>zinc</b> <b>blende</b> crystal structure (similar to diamond), is formed at temperatures below 1700°C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.|$|E

Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E
5|$|Zinc is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It {{is the first}} element in group 12 of the periodic table. In some respects zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (<b>zinc</b> <b>blende),</b> a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).|$|E

40|$|We have {{extended}} the effective-bond-orbital model (EBOM) method [Y. C. Chang, Phys. Rev. B 37, 8215 (1988) ] {{to include the}} effects of the bulk inversion asymmetry (BIA) present in <b>zinc</b> <b>blendes.</b> This is accomplished without adding to the number of basis states or extending the range of interaction. We have also investigated a variant form of the EBOM proposed in the original formulation that offers improved zone-center behavior, but may also generate spurious solutions in heterostructure calculations due to poor description of bulk zone-boundary band structure. We offer suggestions for avoiding this problem so that this variant form of EBOM may be used safely. In general, we find that the addition of BIA effects in EBOM results in improved descriptions of zone-center band structure, but also in a loss of accuracy far from the Brillouin-zone center. We illustrate the use of the BIA extension with band-structure calculations for bulk GaSb. We show that the spin splitting predicted by the extended EBOM method for an AlSb/GaSb superlattice is in good agreement with k·p calculations that include BIA effects...|$|R
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} structure {{has a point}} group 6mm (Hermann-Mauguin notation) or C6v (Schoenflies notation), and the space group is P63mc or C6v4. The lattice constants are a = 3.25 Å and c = 5.2 Å; their ratio c/a ~ 1.60 {{is close to the}} ideal value for hexagonal cell c/a = 1.633. As in most group II-VI materials, the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic (Zn2+–O2−) with the corresponding radii of 0.074nm for Zn2+ and 0.140nm for O2−. This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than <b>zinc</b> <b>blende</b> structure, as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO. Because of the polar Zn-O bonds, zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged. To maintain electrical neutrality, those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials, but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat, stable and exhibit no reconstruction. This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained. However, studies using wurtzoid structures explained the origin of surface flatness and the absence of reconstruction at ZnO wurtzite surfaces in addition to the origin of charges on ZnO planes.|$|E
25|$|Indium is {{the fourth}} element of the boron group but was {{discovered}} before the third, gallium, and after the fifth, thallium. In 1863 Ferdinand Reich and his assistant, Hieronymous Theodor Richter, were looking {{in a sample of}} the mineral <b>zinc</b> <b>blende,</b> also known as sphalerite (ZnS), for the spectroscopic lines of the newly discovered element thallium. Reich heated the ore in a coil of platinum metal and observed the lines that appeared in a spectroscope. Instead of the green thallium lines that he expected, he saw a new line of deep indigo-blue. Concluding that it must come from a new element, they named it after the characteristic indigo color it had produced.|$|E
25|$|Gallium {{minerals}} {{were not}} known before August 1875, when the element itself was discovered. It {{was one of}} the elements that the inventor of the periodic table, Dmitri Mendeleev, had predicted to exist six years earlier. While examining the spectroscopic lines in <b>zinc</b> <b>blende</b> the French chemist Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran found indications of a new element in the ore. In just three months he was able to produce a sample, which he purified by dissolving it in a potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution and sending an electric current through it. The next month he presented his findings to the French Academy of Sciences, naming the new element after the Greek name for Gaul, modern France.|$|E

The role of inclusions of own Ag-minerals was inflated by geologist, but a prevailing amount of silver is isomorphous in galena and argentotetrahedrite. Almost no possibility to concentrating discrete silver minerals was proved technologically. In galena, an interesting content of Se and Te was registered.

Changes in the wire morphology, i. e. a decrease in length {{and an increase in}} diameter have been observed with rising doping level. Crystal structure analysis based on transmission electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction reveals an enhancement of the <b>zinc</b> blende/(wurtzite+zinc <b>blende)</b> segment ratio if Te is provided during the growth process. Furthermore, electrical two-point measurements show that increased Te-doping causes a gain in conductivity. Two comparable growth series, differing only in As-partial pressure by about 1 × 10 ^- 5 while keeping all other parameters constant, were analyzed for different Te-doping levels. Their comparison suggests that the crystal structure is stronger affected and the conductivity gain is more distinct for wires grown at a comparably higher As-partial pressure...|$|R
50|$|The use of Sidot's <b>blende</b> (<b>zinc</b> sulfide) {{instead of}} barium {{platinocyanide}} as a luminescence material {{to make the}} radioactive rays visible was a commonly accepted improvement. He did several self-experiments with radioactive substances {{and was able to}} affirm the damaging effects of radioactive radiation on skin. Because of prolonged contact with radioactive material, fingers of his right hand had to be amputated and he suffered from lung cancer. He died of lung cancer in 1927.

25|$|In the 1890s, Captain Borlase's {{efforts to}} save labour costs {{involved}} {{improvements to the}} mill, making it a continuous process. Ore from the mine was separated into three size fractions before crushing the larger ones. The crushed ore was passed through cylindrical trommels so that fractions of different sizes could be sent to separate jigs. Vibrating tables replaced some of the round buddles to treat fine material, and an {{effort was made to}} recover some of the <b>zinc</b> <b>blende</b> in the ore, but this seems not to have been successful. Water provided the motive power in the mill. Smelting and refining remained labour-intensive and costly. In 1903 {{the decision was made to}} stop separating the silver and to sell argentiferous lead to a smelting company. This created an overall saving of 14shillings per ton of lead sold, roughly £750 per year. With labour shortages during World WarI and reduced ore production, it was decided to cease smelting altogether in 1917 and sell the lead concentrates.|$|E
500|$|In stark {{contrast}} to this, all four silver(I) halides are known. The fluoride, chloride, and bromide have the sodium chloride structure, but the iodide has three known stable forms at different temperatures; that at room temperature is the cubic <b>zinc</b> <b>blende</b> structure. They can all be obtained by the direct reaction of their respective elements. As the halogen group is descended, the silver halide gains more and more covalent character, solubility decreases, and the color changes from the white chloride to the yellow iodide as the energy required for ligand-metal charge transfer (X−Ag+ → XAg) decreases. The fluoride is anomalous, as the fluoride ion is so small {{that it has a}} considerable solvation energy and hence is highly water-soluble and forms di- and tetrahydrates. The other three silver halides are highly insoluble in aqueous solutions and are very commonly used in gravimetric analytical methods. All four are photosensitive (though the monofluoride is so only to ultraviolet light), especially the bromide and iodide which photodecompose to silver metal, and thus were used in traditional photography.

25|$|Also {{associated}} with the granite batholith {{was the creation of}} mineral veins in parts of the Lake District. The richest known lead vein of all was found crossing the south-east shoulder of Green Side. This, the Greenside Lead Vein runs in a north-south direction and dips steeply to the east at 70°. It was up to 59 feet (18m) wide in the highest workings of the Greenside Mine, but averaged about 8 feet (2.5m) wide in deeper workings. The vein contained galena in a mixture of quartz and smashed rock. Galena (lead sulphide) is an ore of lead. The ore from Greenside also yielded 10oz of silver per ton of lead. Higher levels of the vein also contained quantities of baryte (barium sulphate), although at the time this had no commercial value. Very small amounts of <b>blende</b> (<b>zinc</b> sulphide) and chalcopyrite (copper-iron sulphide) were found in the deeper levels, but never in recoverable quantities.|$|R

2500|$|Another fragile {{candidate}} mineral is sphalerite (<b>zinc</b> <b>blende).</b> Gem-quality {{material is}} usually a strong yellow to honey brown, orange, red, or green; its very high RI (2.37) and dispersion (0.156) make for an extremely lustrous and fiery gem, {{and it is also}} isotropic.

Two calcium-rich members of the garnet group fare much better: these are grossularite (usually brownish orange, rarely colorless, yellow, green, or pink) and andradite. The latter is the rarest and most costly of the garnets, with three of its varieties—topazolite (yellow), melanite (black), and demantoid (green)—sometimes seen in jewelry. Demantoid (literally [...] "diamond-like") especially has been prized as a gemstone since its discovery in the Ural Mountains in 1868; it is a noted feature of antique Russian and Art Nouveau jewelry. Titanite or sphene is also seen in antique jewelry; it is typically some shade of chartreuse and has a luster, RI (1.885–2.050), and dispersion (0.051) high enough to be mistaken for diamond, yet it is anisotropic (a high birefringence of 0.105–0.135) and soft (hardness 5.5).|$|E
