25|$|Because zero {{is neither}} {{positive}} nor negative, the term nonnegative is sometimes {{used to refer}} to a number that is either positive or zero, while nonpositive is {{used to refer to}} a number that is either negative or <b>zero.</b> <b>Zero</b> is a neutral number.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicability}} of the Franck–Condon principle in both absorption and fluorescence, along with Kasha's rule leads to an approximate mirror symmetry shown in Figure 2. The vibrational structure of molecules in a cold, sparse gas is most clearly visible due {{to the absence of}} inhomogeneous broadening of the individual transitions. Vibronic transitions are drawn in Figure 2 as narrow, equally spaced Lorentzian lineshapes. Equal spacing between vibrational levels is only the case for the parabolic potential of simple harmonic oscillators, in more realistic potentials, such as those shown in Figure 1, energy spacing decreases with increasing vibrational energy. Electronic transitions to and from the lowest vibrational states are often referred to as 0–0 (<b>zero</b> <b>zero)</b> transitions and have the same energy in both absorption and fluorescence.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "11001001" [...] is {{a binary}} number, a {{contraction}} {{of the names}} of the Bynars (One One, <b>Zero</b> <b>Zero,</b> One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called [...] "10101001". It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to [...] "The Big Goodbye", with the Bynars' modifications causing the problems with the holodeck seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems re-occurring. The Bynars themselves were played by young women. Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too problematic because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming to get it to fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars' necks. Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus {{on the side of the}} headpiece through a battery pack attached to the waistband of their costumes. To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars' conversations between themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Sequences {{with the}} letters CU, FD and OO, were {{originally}} not used, the first two because they coincided with a slang words (CU - [...] "arse", FD - Portuguese abbreviation for [...] "fuck") and the last to avoid confusion with 00 (<b>zero,</b> <b>zero).</b> However, The CU sequence was used in 1982 on Lisbon registered vehicles and OO in 1966, 1967, 1978, 1979 and 1982 on Oporto registered vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|When spoken, binary numerals {{are usually}} read digit-by-digit, {{in order to}} {{distinguish}} them from decimal numerals. For example, the binary numeral 100 is pronounced one <b>zero</b> <b>zero,</b> rather than one hundred, to make its binary nature explicit, and for purposes of correctness. Since the binary numeral 100 represents the value four, it would be confusing {{to refer to the}} numeral as one hundred (a word that represents a completely different value, or amount). Alternatively, the binary numeral 100 can be read out as [...] "four" [...] (the correct value), but this does not make its binary nature explicit.|$|E

According to The Canberra Times it was [...] "a surrealistic video musical for symphony orchestra, rock group, synthesiser and voice", when shown in April on ABC-TV. For the Australian stage version of Alan Bleasdale's musical play, Are You Lonesome Tonight?, Goh provided guitar in August 1986 at Her Majesty's Theatre. In May 1987 Goh was a guitarist for a rock group, The Inevitables, with Armando Hurley on lead vocals; David Jones on drums; and Sam McNally on keyboards.|$|E
