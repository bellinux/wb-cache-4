40|$|Launched in Summer 2012, the European Central Bank (ECB) 's Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program {{indirectly}} recapitalized European banks {{through its}} {{positive impact on}} periphery sovereign bonds. However, the stability reestablished in the banking sector did not fully translate into economic growth. We document zombie lending by banks that remained undercapitalized even post-OMT. In turn, firms receiving loans used these funds not to undertake real economic activity such as employment and investment but to build up cash reserves. Creditworthy firms in industries with a high <b>zombie</b> <b>firm</b> prevalence suffered significantly from this credit misallocation, which further slowed down the economic recovery...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{existence}} of extreme types of <b>zombie</b> <b>firm,</b> i. e. companies with negative equity that continue to do business despite having lost their entire equity. We explain how these firms are measured and how the riskier ones are defined with different determinants. Using a Spanish sample from 2010 to 2014 an index called the EZIndex is developed that includes four dimensions of the extreme zombie problem: extension, contagion, recovery signs and immediacy. The paper contributes to zombie theory {{on the one hand}} by developing a method for ranking zombie firms based on risks and changes over time, {{and on the other hand}} by using a log-linear model to detect the riskiest corporate profiles out of all these risky firms. It demonstrates significant implications that need to be considered by the competent authorities not only in terms of their impact as a whole but also in regard to the particular profile of extreme zombie firms: they are less regulated, large and located in regions with large business fabrics...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} search for the causes of {{sluggish}} productivity in Japan during the 1990 s, in this paper we analyze factors causing increases in productivity, creating microdata at both the establishment and company levels covering almost all industries in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. With regard to the manufacturing sector we find a strong possibility that the reason for the slowdown in productivity growth in the 1990 s was not a rapid decline in the metabolic function of industries as the <b>zombie</b> <b>firm</b> hypothesis maintains (the metabolic function in the manufacturing sector had been consistently low since the 1980 s), but rather because 1) factors such as a decline in learning effects {{as a result of a}} decrease in the opening of new establishments and the growing impact of "shadow-of-death" effects brought about by establishments nearing their closure dates led to declines in internal effects (productivity improvement of individual establishments), and 2) the shift of production bases to other parts of Asia, mainly in the electrical equipment industry, brought about the closure of establishments in which productivity was high. With regard to the non-manufacturing sector, although we were only able to conduct analysis covering the short period since 1997 we found that productivity dynamics differ greatly between industries. For most non-manufacturing industries the metabolic function has been stagnant, as demonstrated by the hugely negative redistribution effects. In the construction and transportation industries in particular there were remarkable declines in employment at highly productive large companies, and owing to their large scale this contributed to the decline in productivity growth in the non-manufacturing sector as a whole. The metabolic function was also sluggish in the electricity, gas, water, and broadcasting industries. On the other hand, in the telecommunications, retail, and wholesale industries, not only do we identify substantial positive internal effects but also major positive redistribution effects, for example many companies with low productivity in the retail and wholesale industries scaling down employment, and many highly productive companies in the telecommunications industry increasing employment. ...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese economy {{experienced}} prolonged recessions {{during the}} 1990 s. Previous {{studies suggest that}} evergreen lending to troubled firms known as "zombie firms" distorted market discipline in terms of stabilizing the Japanese economy and caused significant delays in the economy's recovery. However, the eventual bankruptcy of zombies was rare. In fact, {{a majority of the}} "zombie" firms substantially recovered {{during the first half of}} the 2000 s. The purpose of this paper is to investigate why <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> recovered in Japan. We first extend the method of Caballero, Hoshi, and Kashyap (2008) and identify zombies from among the listed firms. Subsequently, we investigate the nature of corporate restructuring that was effective in reviving <b>zombie</b> <b>firms.</b> Our multinomial logistic regressions suggest that reducing the employee strength of <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> and selling its fixed assets were beneficial in facilitating their recovery. However, corporate restructuring without accounting transparency or by discouraging incentives for managers was ineffective. In addition, corporate restructuring lacked effectiveness in the absence of favorable macroeconomic environment as well as substantial external financial support. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} main bank model where the main bank decides {{whether or not}} to raise {{additional}} funds from the capital market to continue to invest in a borrowing firm when nonmain banks withdraw funds. We show that the threat of withdrawal of nonmain banks is more likely to force the main bank to perform efficiently in handling troubled loans, thereby preventing problems with <b>zombie</b> <b>firms,</b> if the potential cash flow (liquidation value) of the firm decreases (increases) relative to the amount funded by nonmain banks. The theoretical results provide both efficiency evaluations for the renewal of the main bank relation in Japan {{after the end of the}} 1990 s and empirical implications for the renewed main bank system.

Based on granular bank-firm data pertaining to {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SME) from five stressed and two non-stressed euro area economies, we show that 'zombie' firms generally continued to lever up during the 2010 - 2014 period. Whereas relationships with stressed banks reduce SME leverage on average, we also show that <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> that are tied to weak banks in euro area periphery countries increase their indebtedness even further. Sustainable economic recovery therefore requires both: deleveraging of banks and firms...|$|R
5000|$|Around {{the time}} that these papers were published, Japan {{deregulated}} its financial system and that changed the way the keiretsu operated. Hoshi and Kashyap went on to continue studying {{the evolution of the}} Japanese financial system {{in the wake of the}} deregulation. They wroteon the history of the Japanese financial system—one of the first papers on the Japanese banking crisis, and winner of the 45th Nikkei Prize for Excellent Books in Economic Science. Later, with Ricardo Caballero, they popularized the idea that the ongoing financial problems were creating [...] "zombie firms.". [...] Their notion of a <b>zombie</b> is a <b>firm</b> that was insolvent or virtually so, but was protected from bankruptcy because their banks were hesitant to foreclose upon them for fear of having to recognize the losses. These weak banks would engage in sham loan restructurings to present the appearance that the firms were viable, hoping that the firms might eventually recover. Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap find that the presence of the <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> contributed to the slow growth in Japan after its acute financial crisis in 1997.|$|R
40|$|The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program, {{launched}} in summer 2012, indirectly recapitalized periphery country banks through its {{positive impact on}} the value of sovereign bonds. However, the regained stability of the European banking sector has not fully transferred into economic growth. We show that zombie lending behavior of banks that still remained undercapitalized after the OMT announcement is an important reason for this development. As a result, there was no positive impact on real economic activity like employment or investment. Instead, firms mainly used the newly acquired funds to build up cash reserves. Finally, we document that creditworthy firms in industries with a high prevalence of <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> suffered significantly from the credit misallocation, which slowed down the economic recovery...|$|R

40|$|During the {{financial}} crisis that started in 2007, the U. S. government has {{used a variety of}} tools to try to rehabilitate the U. S. banking industry. Many of those strategies were also used in Japan to combat its banking problems in the 1990 s. There are also a surprising number of other similarities between the current U. S. crisis and the recent Japanese crisis. The Japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks until the economy finally started to recover in 2003. From these unsuccessful attempts, we derive eight lessons. In light of these eight lessons, we assess the policies the U. S. has pursued. The U. S. has ignored three of the lessons and {{it is too early to}} evaluate the U. S. policies with respect to four of the others. So far, the U.

40|$|Defence date: 19 June 2017 Examining Board: Prof. David K. Levine, EUI, (Supervisor); Prof. Ramon Marimon, EUI; Prof. Hugo Hopenhayn, UCLA; Prof. Facundo Piguillem, Einaudi Institute for Economics and FinanceThis thesis {{deals with}} the {{economics}} of crises, within the macro-finance literature. The first chapter, coauthored with Rasmus Pank, deals with how crises emerge. Particularly, {{we are interested in}} how confidence affects the outcomes in an experimental asset market where the fundamental value is known by all the participants. We elicit expectations in a way that allows us to measure confidence. We ask participants to forecast the one-period-ahead price as a discrete probability mass distribution and find that confidence not only affects the price-formation in markets, but also is important in explaining the dynamics of the bubble. Moreover, as traders' confidence grows, they become increasingly more optimistic, thus increasing the likelihood of price bubbles. The remaining chapters deal with policy responses to crises. The second chapter, Banks vs Zombies, studies how <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> arise in equilibrium and the scope for policy. <b>Zombie</b> <b>firms</b> are otherwise insolvent borrowers who are kept afloat by new credit from banks to cover their losses. The practice, known as evergreening or zombie lending, has occurred in times of financial distress even when debt restructuring is allowed. I study the incentives to restructure debt in a borrower-lender game and provide conditions under which it is optimal to engage in evergreening even when socially inefficient. In normal times, the borrower can access a competitive credit market and pay the opportunity cost of capital. When a shock renders the creditor insolvent, debt needs to be restructured. The firm is locked in a lending relationship and the incumbent bank has monopoly power. Normally, a lender would liquidate the firm. However, the lender is also financially distressed, the incentives to restructure change radically. To keep the firm afloat and prevent its own bankruptcy, the bank covers the firms losses. It does not, however, fund investment, as the distressed borrower may not use the funds efficiently. Evergreening can happen for profitable investments and renegotiation does not solve the problem. I discuss policy alternatives and show that debt haircuts and bank capitalizations must be used simultaneously; and that monetary policy can behave differently in the presence of <b>zombie</b> <b>firms.</b> Finally, I provide evidence supporting the model using a novel panel data set of matched firms and banks for the case of Spain. The final chapter, Optimal Haircuts, analyzes the desirability of intervention in a simple model of heterogeneous firms and households. Households finance firm's working capital, and the credit constrained firms are heterogeneous in their productivity and hence debt levels. After an unexpected aggregate shock, less productive firms go bankrupt. This directly decreases the wage income of the households, and indirectly decreases their income from the defaulted loans to firms. The main result of the paper is that there is an optimal haircut for deposits such that both firms and families are better off. Moreover, there is a tension between maximizing welfare and maximizing output. This provides a rationale for the Cypriot, Hungarian and Argentinean experience. The model is adapted to an open economy and used to analyze a devaluation shock, which provides policy for countries attempting to escape a monetary union or a currency peg.

40|$|While {{it is well}} {{established}} that bank lending to severely impaired (<b>zombie)</b> Japanese <b>firms</b> during the 1990 s was detrimental to the Japanese economy, bank lending to troubled, but economically viable, firms may have had beneficial effects. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the consequences of increased bank lending to distressed Japanese firms in order to determine the extent to which those increased loans contributed to the recovery of distressed firms, rather than being used to insulate the firms from market forces in order to avoid the painful, but needed, restructuring. That is, is increased lending to a distressed firm associated with an improvement in the subsequent performance of the firm? Certainly, bank lending to some severely distressed (<b>zombie)</b> <b>firms</b> did allow those firms to survive for an extended period of time, even though they were not economically viable firms. While such lending has been shown to have contributed to the recent prolonged stagnation of the Japanese economy (for example, Caballero et al. 2006), bank lending to distressed firms has the potential to help as well as hinder firm recovery. Presumably, an important factor in the ability of firms to survive and return to health will be their ability and willingness to restructure their operations. Insofar as increased bank credit provides a necessary cushion to distressed firms that allows them the opportunity to overcome temporary liquidity problems and/or restructure their operations, one might expect firms receiving increased bank loans to be more likely to undertake the required restructuring necessary to improve their operations and return them to financial health, or at least to prevent an illiquidity problem from becoming a solvency problem. However, while increased bank credit may enhance the ability of the firm to undertake restructuring, this increased funding also may ease the immediate pressure on management to take actions to ensure the firm’s longer-term survival, lessening the incentive (and thus the willingness) of the firm t...|$|R
40|$|According to Krugman, {{the central}} {{cause of the}} profession’s failure to {{forecast}} the current Great Crisis is the abandoning of Keynesian theory to explain crises and depressions, and the prevailing of monetarism and neoclassical vision that whatever happens in a market economy must be right. According to Neoclassicals, instead, economic models do not just fail to predict the timing of financial crises, they say that we cannot. This common sense {{is the heart of}} rational expectations models. So the correct conclusion should be that our inability to predict the crisis confirms Neoclassical theories. Keynesians suggest that deficit spending is the right policy to put the economic system in a full employment equilibrium path, while Neoclassicals think that fiscal stimulus is only a bad way to transfer money from taxpayers to inefficient bureaucrats, policymakers, and <b>zombie</b> <b>firms.</b> Anyway, Keynesians and Neoclassicals share the opinion that we need a more tightening regulation of financial markets. Commercial banks, who are allowed to manage systemic contracts like bank deposits, and for that reason they have access to the lender of last resort, should be kept strictly separated from investment banks, hedge funds and other financial speculative institutions, none of which should be considered too big to fail. This is the most important convergence between the two schools of thought...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} interaction of firm level heterogeneity and selection. This selection can encompass either the survival of firms in the market, or their participation in international trade. In the first part I concentrate {{on the question of}} how large the aggregate productivity losses from the misallocation of resources across firms are. If firm exit is endogenous, micro-frictions can induce extensive margin misallocation: inefficient firms continue to survive (<b>Zombies)</b> and efficient <b>firms</b> are forced to exit (Shadows). I develop and estimate a fully specified model with plant-level micro-data to quantify extensive margin misallocation. This method allows me to identify <b>Zombie</b> <b>firms,</b> estimate the efficiency distribution of Shadow firms and calculate aggregate Total Factor Productivity (TFP) gains when Zombies are replaced by Shadows. Estimates for Indonesia show that extensive margin misallocation can increase aggregate TFP losses from micro-distortions by over 40 %. Compared to existing estimates aggregate TFP losses from micro-distortions are 50 - 100 % higher. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation I trace out the implications of a simplified version of the framework I developed in the first part to questions of international trade. The cross-country comparisions in measured micro-distortions suggest that differences in firm heterogeneity could be potentially important to explain aggregate TFP and therefore also trade patterns. I consequently develop a tractable multi-country general equilibrium model of such differences in firm level heterogeneity across countries. I show how the model naturally links measured trade frictions to national firm-efficiency distributions and endogenously generates asymmetries in trade flows in the absence of asymmetric trade frictions. The model is able to generate key stylized facts, specifically the absence of a strong negative relationsship of firm-size dispersions and internal trade shares as predicted by the standard heterogeneous firm trade model with identical efficiency dispersions across countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the consequences of increased bank lending to distressed Japanese firms in order to determine the extent to which increased loans were associated with the improved performance of distressed firms. In particular, a key focus of the study is the extent to which such a relationship in the 1980 s persisted into the 1990 s after the bursting of the stock market and real estate bubbles when both firms and banks came under increasing stress. The evidence in this study suggests that increases in main bank loans are, in fact, associated with improved firm performance subsequent to entering distress during the 1980 s. However, not only did that pattern disappear during the post-bubble period, but increased main bank loans were associated with a deterioration in operating income during the late 1990 s and early 2000 s. This is consistent with main banks evergreening loans to <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> rather than focusing their lending on supporting distressed, but viable, borrowers. The change in bank behavior was likely related to the perverse incentives banks faced as their own health deteriorated sharply. In contrast, no similar change in behavior is observed for secondary lenders to distressed firms, in part because of the weaker relationships and responsibilities of secondary banks compared with main banks. * I thank participants at the New York and San Francisco ESRI conferences for their insightful comments on earlier versions of this study, and Sunayan Acharya for valuable research assistance...|$|R
40|$|The European Central Bank {{adopted a}} policy of {{quantitative}} easing early in 2015, long after the US and UK, and after implementing a succession of measures to increase liquidity in the Euro zone financial markets, none of which proved sufficient eventually. The paper draws out lessons for the Euro zone from US and UK experience. Numerous event studies have been undertaken to uncover the effects of QE on yields on and prices of financial assets. Estimated effects on long-term government bond yields are then converted into {{the size of the}} cut in the policy rate that would normally have been needed to produce them. From these implicit cuts in policy rates, estimates of the effect on GDP and inflation are generated. Euro zone QE appears to have had a much smaller effect on bond yields for the core members states than did QE in the US or UK. Therefore its effects on output and inflation are likely to be proportionately smaller. Its effects on long-term government bond yields in periphery members are greater. QE is compressing interest differential among Euro zone member states. The dangers of QE to which various commentators draw attention, that it creates a danger of inflation in the future, that it creates asset price bubbles, that it allows <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> and banks to survive, slowing down the process of adjustment, seem remote. Meanwhile it makes a useful contribution to cutting the costs of debt service and allowing member states more fiscal room for maneouvre...|$|R
40|$|According {{to growth}} {{accounting}} analysis {{based on the}} JIP Database 2008, the growth of Japan's total factor productivity (TFP) has accelerated {{in the first decade}} of this century, centered on nonmanufacturing industry, and TFP in manufacturing industry has also recovered since 2001. In addition, the growth in TFP in nonmanufacturing industry has occurred amid a decline in labor, capital services, and intermediate inputs. In this paper we use micro data in the Basic Survey of Japanese Business Structure and Activities from 1994 to 2005 to find out what kind of mechanism has given rise to this acceleration of Japan's TFP growth, and what kinds of firms have succeeded in enhancing their productivity. We first analyze the productivity dynamics after decomposing the rate of TFP growth into internal, redistribution, and entry-exit effects, finding that in both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industry the acceleration of TFP growth in the 21 st century is an internal effect (acceleration of TFP growth within firms). A modest improvement in the metabolic function is observed, but the exit effect has been negative in many industries during the 2000 s. Next, we use data confined to only continuing firms to analyze why the internal effect has been rising, finding that much of the acceleration of TFP growth in the Japanese economy has been achieved by corporate restructuring. In other words, despite falls in labor, capital service, and intermediate inputs, production volume has been maintained or has declined only slightly. We find also that this restructuring is being conducted primarily by firms facing global competitive pressure, such as exporters, multinational firms, and firms oriented towards R&D. In the case of the upper 25 % of firms in each industry with high debt-equity ratios, we find that initial TFP levels are markedly low relative to those of other firms, but are raised by substantially reducing inputs of all factors of production, even when economic conditions are healthy. Also, it is possible that the approach to resolving the problem of <b>zombie</b> <b>firms</b> in Japan lies not in exiting but in restructuring. ...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{identify}} some specific concrete steps Japan {{can take to}} jump start growth. Our recommendations are organized around three broad themes: regulatory reform, opening up the Japanese economy, and improving macroeconomic policies. Section 2 identifies four types of regulatory relief that would improve growth in Japan. One set of changes show how {{to reduce the cost}} of conducting business in Japan. Each of these is achievable and together they would modestly improve business conditions and the efficiency of doing business in Japan. We also explain how to stop the protection of <b>zombie</b> <b>firms,</b> and identify several other government regulations that also discourage productivity growth, especially in the non-manufacturing parts of the economy. An approach that Koizumi government tried for deregulation was the creation of structural reform special zones. As our earlier report found, these special zones had mixed results, so we also explain the conditions that a special zone should satisfy to be growth enhancing. Section 3 examines the gains that can be achieved by opening up the Japanese economy. One avenue for doing this is via the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Japan has finally decided to join the negotiation. We explain why participating in this deal is desirable. A perpetual road block to trade negotiations in Japan has been the pressure from agricultural interests to protect that sector from competition. Productivity gains in the Japanese agricultural sector have been dismal and we also discuss policies that could help improve that situation. A third path to openness is through increased immigration. We sketch immigration reforms that would be growth enhancing. Section 4 explores the growth impediments resulting from poor macroeconomic policies. The threat of a debt crisis that could cripple Japanese growth is real. We explain why a credible plan for fiscal consolidation is necessary and propose some principles that should be part of such a plan. Monetary policy has also been bad since the Bank of Japan’s legal independence. We identify the type of monetary policy framework that is necessary to end more than a decade long deflationary period.

40|$|It is said among historians, {{that there}} are two {{remarkable}} innovations in modern finance: deposit banking in southern Europe and negotiable bills in northern Europe, especially Antwerp. Although negotiable bills are as important as deposit banking (because they became a foundation of modern commercial banking and stock markets), they are not often studied. Part I of the thesis studies indirect loan contracts which do not rely on either bank-specific technologies or legal protection. It focuses on the concept of negotiability and explains its characteristics, including the substitutability of deposit banking and negotiable bills. Negotiable bills, or resaleable bills, can be interpreted as an indirect loan contract. The buyer of the bill, i. e. the initial lender, can re-sell the bill to a third party to satisfy his liquidity needs. So the initial issuer of the bill borrows from a third party, through the initial lender (acting as an intermediary). Previous studies have focused on direct loan contracts: between banks and borrowers, depositors and banks, or suppliers and buyers. There are few papers studying the incentive problems faced by all three players. To fill this gap, in Chapter Two, we study indirect loan contracts that a lender and a borrower can make only through an intermediary agent, where the borrower and the lender cannot observe any transaction between the other two. Under this severe information asymmetry, the existence of loan contracts as a sequential equilibrium is proved, although they are less efficient compared with direct loan contracts. In Chapter Three, we consider role of collateral in improving efficiency. Chapter Four concludes, summarising the characteristics of these contracts: only less risky borrowers can issue negotiable bills and riskier borrowers need to seek a direct relationship with lenders (or, they are rationed). In the 1990 s, the Japanese economy experienced a prolonged recession, the so-called ’lost decade’. It is discussed that a cause of the problem was the ”zombie lending” problem: chronic loss-making <b>firms</b> (<b>zombies)</b> still obtained finance from their banks. Part II of the thesis aims to address the following issues with a microeconomic model. Firstly, why did banks not liquidate bankrupt borrowers? Secondly, how did it affect macroeconomic productivity? And thirdly, how did it affect the procyclicality of land prices as in Kiyotaki and Moore(1997) ’s credit cycle? A bank, in this model, has an incentive not to liquidate insolvent borrowers: the liquidation of collateral asset (land) will invite the collapse of land market and the bank has to bear a large loss. The loss may make the bank under-capitalised and force it to close its business. The bank, to avoid the forced closure, does not liquidate insolvent borrowers. This ”zombie borrowers” occupy their land unused, and the bank can squeeze land supply to push up land price: the bank’s own capital is then kept higher than it should be. In the final chapter, based on this model, optimal post-crisis policies are discussed by comparing two options; public capital injection and toxic asset purchasing scheme.
