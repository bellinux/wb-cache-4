40|$|Abstract The Honey Lake {{fault is}} a major strike-slip fault in northeastern California that {{accommodates}} northwest-directed right-lateral shear in the northern Walker Lane. We reexamine the fault’s paleoseismic history and slip rate by evaluating a natural stream bank exposure of the fault and offset terrace riser. Structural and stratigraphic relations within the modern stream cut, radiocarbon ages, and a detailed topographic survey of the offset terrace riser are used to estimate a Holocene fault slip rate of 1 : 7 – 0 : 6 mm=yr or more. We also interpret the occurrence of at least four surface-rupturing earthquakes during the last 7025 calendar years before present (B. P.). Three of the surface-rupturing earthquakes occurred prior to 4670 calendar years B. P. and have interevent times that range between 730 and 990 yr.

The timing of seed dispersal and river flow interact to determine the annual composition of species cohorts (Dixon 2003).

The maximum diversity appeared at the intermediately flooded zone, while the least diversity was found at the lower riverbank.

40|$|The {{main concern}} with welding {{processes}} {{has in the}} past, generally, concentrated on productivity and quality. However, the occupational health of the welder {{has become a major}} focal area in the last decade, and the working environment of the welder is becoming a more important area of investigation. One particular area of interest is the amount of fume present in the operator’s breathing zone. With the potentially hazardous material present in the breathing environment of the welder, an effective method of controlling this airborne contaminant must be adopted to limit exposure levels to within occupational health and safety limits and to ensure the well being of the worker. This investigation examines the distribution of fume and breathing zone concentration within a controlled space using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. The controlled working environment provided the basis for quantifying breathing <b>zone</b> <b>exposure</b> concentrations, and the ability to predict operator exposure. The initial evaluation focused on determining the breathing zone concentration and the welding fume plume dispersal within a confined enclosure. Within a sealed environment GMA welding was performed for approximate 100 % duty cycle with two types (copper and non-copper coated) of ER- 70 S filler wire. The breathing zone and background enclosure concentrations were measured. The purpose of this initial investigation was to evaluate the breathing zone concentration within a confined environment, and to determine a fundamental concentration for direct evaluation of control procedures. The inclusion of the non-copper (low-fuming) coated electrode was to validate the measurements obtained during the study. The low-fuming electrode provided the expected reduction in exposure concentrations in comparison with the copper coated wire, however the concentrations measured over a 15 minute welding cycle were substantial higher than Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) exposure limits. To aid the evaluation of fume control effectiveness, various ventilation strategies were incorporated into the controlled environment. Utilising various modes of general and local extraction enabled an evaluation of the measured breathing zone concentration to be compared with the non-ventilated situation, as well as indicating their relationship with the occupational exposure limits for welding fume. This enabled the breathing <b>zone</b> <b>exposure</b> concentration to be effectively reduced to meet the OHS exposure limits. Although all techniques significantly reduced the exposure concentration, in direct comparison with the confined ‘fundamental’ concentrations, only an appropriately installed local extraction technique provided the required reduction. As well as the breathing zone evaluation, a model to predict the initial dispersion of GMAW fume was developed, aiding in better determining welding fume plume flow behaviour characteristics. This analysis, in addition with classical plume theories, enabled a model of the fume plume characteristics to be developed...|$|E

30|$|The {{fracture}} orientations {{derived from}} the outcrops in this study show a degree of similarity; for instance, a common NE–SW set exists, and {{in three of the}} four outcrops a second NW–SE group occurs (Fig.  6). However, other studies carried out in this region (e.g. Dezayes et al. 2015; Meier et al. 2015; Peters 2007) show that a wider range of fracture patterns have been observed in this area. In addition, we found that in the Cleebourg outcrop with fault <b>zone</b> <b>exposure,</b> individual layers host different fracture systems (Figure  7). Both observations suggest that the permeability-controlling fracture patterns are difficult to predict in the study area. This assumption is further supported by the two fracture patterns that were identified in the well, based on FMI data (Fig.  13; Reinecker et al. 2015). None of these fracture patterns coincides with those observed at the surface. At a depth of about 3275  m, i.e. the depth at which total mud loss occurred, and where the API values are increased (Fig.  10 a), a fault is expected based on the seismics (Lotz 2014). We propose that it is likely that this fracture system belongs to the damage zone of the fault, rather than reflecting the regional trend.|$|E
40|$|A {{computerized}} {{model was}} developed to describe the redistribution of wind eroding soil-contaminant mixtures. Potentially mobile particulate contaminants can, in the first approximation, be assumed to be indistinquishable from the wind eroding soil {{in which they are}} distributed. A grid network characterizes important soil and surface conditions, and mass conserving control volumes are constructed on each cell. Material is transported through the vertical and top surfaces of a control volume by a modified Bagnold-Chepil horizontal flux formulation and modified Gillette vertical flux formulation, respectively. The vertical emissions, considered as puffs from area sources, create at regular time intervals a contaminant cloud which is proportional to the suspendable ground concentration. These puffs diffuse downwind under time- dependent wind velocity and atmospheric stability conditions, maintaining during the time interval a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution of concentration with cloud volume. Material from each puff is deposited in downward cells, leading to the possibility of many different flights from these new sources. The usefulness of this predictive tool is demonstrated by calculations involving mixtures of particulate $sup 238 $PuO$sub 2 $ in highly erodible soils under dust storm conditions. Time-dependent surface concentration and breathing <b>zone</b> <b>exposure</b> isopleths, evolving from a small contaminated area, show the potential hazard from wind eroding toxic materials.

40|$|The minimal {{inhibitory}} concentrations (MICs) of rifampin for 12 {{strains of}} Staphylo-coccus aureus ranged from 0. 005 ~g/ml to 0. 02 ug/ml, and the minimal antibiotic con-centrations (Le., those that inhibited growth by 900 / 0 {{in comparison with}} control values) ranged from one-fifth to one-half the MICs. Rifampin alone produced a l-log (90 %) decrease in the staphylococcal population after incubation for 6. 5 hr, and the inhibitory effect after removal of the antibiotic lasted for 5 hr. Regardless of whether rifampin was used simultaneously with, before, or after exposure to oxacillin, the latter drug par-tially or totally prevented the overgrowth of rifampin-resistant staphylococci. The use of this combination in therapy is therefore justified. Staphylococci exposed to rifampin at concentrations equal to three or 20 times the MIC developed a cell wall that was four times thicker than normal and had a peripheral undulated dense layer.

The Zone System assigns numbers from 0 through 10to different brightness values, with 0 representing black, 5 middle gray, and 10 pure white; these values are known as zones. To make zones easily distinguishable from other quantities, Adams and Archer used Roman rather than Arabic numerals.

For our work, we used controlled, short light path, laboratory, turbidostat-operated PBRs equipped with a LED light source for square-wave L/D cycles with frequencies from 1 to 100 ¿Hz. Biomass density was adjusted that the PFD leaving the PBR was equal to the compensation point of photosynthesis.
