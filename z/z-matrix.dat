It provides a description of each atom in a molecule in terms of its atomic number, bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle, the so-called internal coordinates, although it is not always the case that a <b>Z-matrix</b> will give information regarding bonding since the matrix itself is based on a series of vectors describing atomic orientations in space. However, it is convenient to write a <b>Z-matrix</b> in terms of bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals since this will preserve the actual bonding characteristics. The name arises because the <b>Z-matrix</b> assigns the second atom along the Z axis from the first atom, which is at the origin.|$|E

Here we discuss each single class of <b>Z-matrices</b> and inverse <b>Z-matrices</b> as well as considering the whole classes of <b>Z-matrices</b> and inverse <b>Z-matrices.</b> We establish some common properties of the classes, such as eigenvalue bounds and determinant inequalities, and we give a new characterization of some classes of <b>Z-matrices</b> and inverse <b>Z-matrices.</b> Moreover, we prove that other classes besides those of M-matrices, N 0 -matrices, and F 0 -matrices consist of matrices whose determinants have the same sign. Some of the results generalize known results for M-matrices, N 0 -matrices, and F 0 -matrices and for inverse M-matrices, inverse N 0 -matrices, and inverse F 0 -matrices. However, we also show that some properties of the specific classes mentioned above do not hold for all classes of <b>Z-matrices</b> and inverse <b>Z-matrices...</b>|$|R

40|$|A matrix A all {{of whose}} (positive) powers are <b>Z-matrices</b> is called here a ZM-matrix. A matrix {{is called a}} ZMA-matrix if all powers of A are {{irreducible}} <b>Z-matrices.</b> We prove that the spectrum of a ZMA-matrix is real and only the eigenvalue minimal in absolute value may be negative. By means of an operation called inflation which generalizes the Kronecker product of two matrices, we determine the class of ZMA-matrices of order n {{in terms of the}} classes of ZMA-matrices of smaller orders. We use this result to show that a Z M A-matrix is positively diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix. Similar results hold for M M A-matrices which are defined in analogy with ZMA-matrices in terms of M-matrices, and for ZMO-matrices which are defined to be ZM-matrices such that all odd powers are irreducible and all even powers reducible. We also prove that a matrix is a ZMA-, ZMO- or M M A-matrix under apparently weaker conditions. If A is a real matrix such that all sufficiently large powers of A are <b>Z-matrices,</b> then A is a Z M A-matrix if A 2 is irreducible, A is a ZMO-matrix if A is irreducible and A 2 is reducible...|$|R

50|$|They {{are used}} for {{creating}} input geometries for molecular systems in many molecular modelling and computational chemistry programs. A skillful choice of internal coordinates can make the interpretation of results straightforward. Also, since Z-matrices can contain molecular connectivity information (but do not always contain this information), quantum chemical calculations such as geometry optimization may be performed faster, because an educated guess is available for an initial Hessian matrix, and more natural internal coordinates are used rather than Cartesian coordinates.The <b>Z-matrix</b> representation is often preferred, because this allows symmetry to be enforced upon the molecule (or parts thereof) by setting certain angles as constant. The <b>Z-matrix</b> simply is a representation for placing atomic positions in a relative way with the obvious convenience that the vectors it uses easily correspond to bonds. A conceptual pitfall is to assume all bonds appear as {{a line in the}} <b>Z-matrix</b> which is not true. For example: in ringed molecules like benzene, a <b>z-matrix</b> will not include all six bonds in the ring, because all of the atoms are uniquely positioned after just 5 bonds making the 6th redundant.|$|E
