40|$|Knot {{disease of}} Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis subsp. halepensis) {{occurs in the}} western range of the host in the Mediterranean region. The disease, {{originally}} named Aleppo pine tuberculosis (from tubercle, i. e. knot) by Petri in 1924, causes a hyperplastic growth on the twigs and small branches, with knots that initially are small, green and lignified, and expand to 5 – 6 cm diameter at maturity. These knots {{have been associated with}} various bacterial species. In this study, only one bacterium was isolated from Aleppo pine knots, and this bacterium was constantly associated with the pine weevil Pissodes castaneus. The hyperplastic growth started either in the cortex or in the xylem, while the knot was formed in the cortical parenchyma. Bacteria were grouped in <b>zoogloeae</b> in the intercellular spaces or inside lysigenous cavities. Bacterial microcolonies have also been observed in the parenchyma cells. Inoculation of two of the bacterial strains on healthy Aleppo pine twigs did not induce knot formation. Knots did however form when adults of P. castaneus were externally contaminated with the bacteria and were then allowed to feed on pine saplings. These latter knots contained the same bacterial isolate as that which had been used to contaminate the weevils. All the isolates examined were tentatively assigned to the genus Erwinia. As this bacterium seems to be the causal agent of Aleppo pine knot disease, its complete identification and characterisation is needed...|$|R

50|$|Most enzyme of the thiolase super {{family are}} dimers. However, {{monomers}} {{have not been}} observed. Tetrameters are observed only in the thiolase subfamily and, in these cases, the dimers have dimerized to become tetramers. The crystal structure of the tetrameric biosynthetic thiolase from <b>Zoogloea</b> ramigera has been determined at 2.0 Å resolution. The structure contains a striking and novel ‘cage-like’ tetramerization motif, which allows for some hinge motion of the two tight dimers with respect to each other. The enzyme tetramer is acetylated at Cys89 and has a CoA molecule bound in each of itsactive-site pockets.|$|E
50|$|The family {{contains}} mainly aerobic or denitrifying rod-shaped bacteria, which exhibit very versatile metabolic capabilities. Most species live in aquatic {{habitats and}} prefer oligotrophic conditions. Many, for example species of <b>Zoogloea</b> and Azoarcus, occur in waste water and {{play an important}} role in biological remediation in waste water treatment. The name-giving genus Rhodocyclus is rather atypical for the group, being the only phototroph among them. Rhodocyclus sp. are performing anoxygenic photosynthesis under anoxic conditions in a similar way as other bacterial genera among the alpha-Proteobacteria. The species Rhodocyclus purpureus also deviates from the other known members of the family (including other Rhodocyclus species) in its ring-shaped cell form, which brings the two cell poles close to each other and has inspired the genus name.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of fingered branch-bearing <b>Zoogloea</b> {{has been noted}} {{on a number of}} occasions in the Baroda Sewage Disposal Works. Samples of raw sewage, the effluent from the continuous flow settling basin, the raw sludge, the floating scum in the settling basin, the final secondary digested sludge, and the supernatant liquid from the secondary digester were kept without any disturbance in 1 -liter Pyrex glass beakers, which were loosely covered with petri dishes. Scum was formed on the surface within 48 hr in all the samples, and fingered <b>Zoogloea</b> colonies resembling the pure culture of <b>Zoogloea</b> ramigera reported by Crabtree et al.

40|$|Two {{bacterial}} isolates, Pseudomonas sp. SL 10 and <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. SL 20, {{attach to}} heterocysts of Anabaena spp. {{with a high}} degree of selectivity, and this attachment can be expressed quantitatively in terms of adsorption isotherms. Adhesion of Pseudomonas sp. SL 10 was restricted to a monolayer and exhibited a type I (Langmuir) isotherm, whereas adhesion of <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. SL 20 involved multilayer attachment and exhibited a type II isotherm. The degree of adhesion by the bacteria to heterocysts of different Anabaena species may reflect the distribution and abundance of binding sites on the surface of different heterocysts.

30|$|The taxonomic {{composition}} of the remaining strains was remarkably different in the FSC isolates and APD isolates. One striking difference was that strains belonging to Betaproteobacteria were only isolated in the FSC isolation method. This is probably because Betaproteobacteria bacteria were outcompeted by faster-growing microorganisms on DNB-NS agar plates in APD isolation. In contrast, FSC isolation provides a habitat {{where there is no}} competition for the bacterial growth substrate ([Ishii et al. 2010 b]), so a number of Betaproteobacteria denitrifiers (27 strains) were isolated by the FSC isolation method in this study. Strains belonging to <b>Zoogloea</b> in Betaproteobacteria were most frequently isolated (14 strains), suggesting that <b>Zoogloea</b> is another abundant denitrifying bacteria in the Niigata paddy soil. In our soil RNA-based culture-independent study, Betaproteobacteria including <b>Zoogloea</b> was found to be active in the denitrification-inductive microcosm of the Niigata paddy soil ([Yoshida et al. 2010]). The FSC isolation method seems good to isolate this type of active, but relatively slow-growing denitrifying bacteria in soil.|$|E
40|$|Aerobic {{granular}} sludge {{is based}} on self-granulated flocs forming mobile biofilms with a gel-like consistence. Bacterial and structural dynamics from flocs to granules were followed in anaerobic-aerobic sequencing batch reactors fed with synthetic wastewater, namely a bubble column (BC-SBR) operated under wash-out conditions for fast granulation, and two stirred-tank enrichments of Accumulibacter (PAO-SBR) and Competibacter (GAO-SBR) operated at steady-state. In the BC-SBR, granules formed within two weeks by swelling of <b>Zoogloea</b> colonies around flocs, developing subsequently smooth zoogloeal biofilms. However, <b>Zoogloea</b> predominance (37 - 79 %) led to deteriorated nutrient removal during {{the first months of}} reactor operation. Upon maturation, improved nitrification (80 - 100 %), nitrogen removal (43 - 83 %), and high but unstable dephosphatation (75 - 100 %) were obtained. Proliferation of dense clusters of nitrifiers, Accumulibacter, and Competibacter from granule cores outwards resulted in heterogeneous bioaggregates, inside which only low abundance <b>Zoogloea</b> (< 5 %) were detected in biofilm interstices. The presence of different extracellular glycoconjugates detected by fluorescence lectin-binding analysis showed the complex nature of the intracellular matrix of these granules. In the PAO-SBR, granulation occurred within two months with abundant and active Accumulibacter populations (56 &# 177; 10 %) that were selected under full anaerobic uptake of volatile fatty acids and that aggregated as dense clusters within heterogeneous granules. Flocs self-granulated in the GAO-SBR after 480 days during a period of over-aeration caused by biofilm growth on the oxygen sensor. Granules were dominated by heterogeneous clusters of Competibacter (37 &# 177; 11 %). <b>Zoogloea</b> were never abundant in biomass of both PAO- and GAO-SBRs. This study showed that <b>Zoogloea,</b> Accumulibacter, and Competibacter affiliates can form granules, and that the granulation mechanisms rely on the dominant population involved...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{temperature}} and cycle length on microbial competition between polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) -producing populations enriched in feast-famine sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) was investigated at temperatures of 20 [*]°C and 30 [*]°C, {{and in a}} cycle length range of 1 - 18 [*]h. In this study, the microbial community structure of the PHB-producing enrichments {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on temperature, but not on cycle length. <b>Zoogloea</b> and Plasticicumulans acidivorans dominated the SBRs operated at 20 [*]°C and 30 [*]°C, respectively. Both enrichments accumulated PHB more than 75 % of cell dry weight. Short-term temperature change experiments revealed that P. acidivorans was more temperature sensitive as compared with <b>Zoogloea.</b> This is particularly true for the PHB degradation, resulting in incomplete PHB degradation in P. acidivorans at 20 [*]°C. Incomplete PHB degradation limited biomass growth and allowed <b>Zoogloea</b> to outcompete P. acidivorans. The PHB content {{at the end of the}} feast phase correlated well with the cycle length at a constant solid retention time (SRT). These results suggest that to establish enrichment with the capacity to store a high fraction of PHB, the number of cycles per SRT should be minimized independent of the temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} fate of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in soils is motivated by their wide distribution, high persistence, and potentially deleterious effect on human health. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons constitute {{the largest group of}} environmental contaminants released in the environment. Therefore, the potential biodegradation of these compounds is of vital importance. A biocarrier suitable for the colonization by micro-organisms for the purpose of purifying soil contaminated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was developed. The optimized composition of the biocarrier was polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 10 %, sodium alginate (SA) 0. 5 %, and powdered activated carbon (PAC) 5 %. There was no observable cytotoxicity of biocarriers on immobilized cells and a viable cell population of 1. 86 × 10 10 g – 1 was maintained for immobilized bacterium. Biocarriers made from chemical methods had a higher biodegradation but lower mechanical strengths. Immobilized bacterium <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. had an ideal capability of biodegradation for phenanthrene and pyrene over a relative wide concentration range. The study results showed that the biodegradation of phenanthrene and pyrene reached 87. 0 and 75. 4 %, respectively, by using the optimal immobilized method of <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. cultivated in a sterilized soil. Immobilized <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. was found to be effective for biodegrading the soil contaminated with phenanthrene and pyrene. Even in "natural" (unsterilized) soil, the biodegradation of phenanthrene and pyrene using immobilized <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. reached 85. 0 and 67. 1 %, respectively, after 168 h of cultivation, more than twice that achieved if the cells were not immobilized on the biocarrier. Therefore, the immobilization technology enhanced the competitive ability of introduced micro-organisms and represents an effective method for the biotreatment of soil contaminated with phenanthrene and pyrene. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Over 300 {{bacterial}} strains {{were isolated}} from seven samples of activated sludge by plating on sewage agar. Gram-negative bacteria {{of the genera}} <b>Zoogloea</b> and Comamonas predominated.

40|$|The use {{of mixed}} {{microbial}} cultures {{for the production}} of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) is emerging as a viable technology. In this study, 16 S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing was used to analyse fluctuations in populations over a 63 -day period within a PHA-storing mixed microbial community enriched on fermented whey permeate. This community was dominated by the genera Flavisolibacter and <b>Zoogloea</b> as well as an unidentified organism belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. The population was observed to cycle through an increase in <b>Zoogloea</b> followed by a return to a community composition similar to the initial one (highly enriched in Flavisolibacter). It was found that the PHA accumulation capacity of the community was robust to population flux during enrichment and even PHA accumulation, with final polymer composition dependent on the overall proportion of acetic to propionic acids in the feed. This community adaptation suggests that mixed culture PHA production is a robust process...|$|E
40|$|On-site aerobic {{sequencing}} {{batch reactor}} (SBR) treatment plants are implemented in many Australian wineries {{to treat the}} large volumes of associated wastewater they generate. Yet very {{little is known about}} their microbiology. This paper represents the first attempt to analyze the communities of three such systems sampled during both vintage and nonvintage operational periods using molecular methods. Alphaproteobacterial tetrad forming organisms (TFO) related to members of the genus Defluviicoccus and Amaricoccus dominated all three systems in both operational periods. Candidatus ‘Alysiosphaera europaea’ and <b>Zoogloea</b> were codominant in two communities. Production of high levels of exocellular capsular material by <b>Zoogloea</b> and Amaricoccus is thought to explain the poor settleability of solids in one of these plants. The dominance of these organisms is thought to result from the high COD to N/P ratios that characterize winery wastes, and it is suggested that manipulating this ratio with nutrient dosing may help control the problems they cause...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most widespread pollutants leading to eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems, especially in drinking water reservoirs. In this study, an oligotrophic aerobic denitrifier was isolated from drinking water reservoir sediment. Nitrogen removal performance was explored. The strain was identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis as <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. N 299. This species exhibits a periplasmic nitrate reductase gene (napA). Its specific growth rate was 0. 22 h− 1. Obvious denitrification and perfect nitrogen removal performances occurred when cultured in nitrate and nitrite mediums, at rates of 75. 53 % ± 1. 69 % and 58. 65 % ± 0. 61 %, respectively. The ammonia removal rate reached 44. 12 % ± 1. 61 % in ammonia medium. <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. N 299 was inoculated into sterilized and unsterilized reservoir source waters with a dissolved oxygen level of 5 – 9 mg/L, pH 8 – 9, and C/N 1. 14 : 1. The total nitrogen removal rate reached 46. 41 % ± 3. 17 % (sterilized) and 44. 88 % ± 4. 31 % (unsterilized). The cell optical density suggested the strain could survive in oligotrophic drinking water reservoir water conditions and perform nitrogen removal. Sodium acetate was the most favorable carbon source for nitrogen removal by strain N 299 (p 0. 05). Furthermore, strain N 299 could efficiently remove nitrate at neutral and slightly alkaline and low temperature conditions. These results, therefore, demonstrate that <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. N 299 has high removal characteristics, and can be used as a nitrogen removal microbial inoculum with simultaneous aerobic nitrification and denitrification in a micro-polluted reservoir water ecosystem...|$|E

30|$|EPS {{producing}} taxa (e.g. Meganema, Thauera, and <b>Zoogloea)</b> {{were observed}} in high abundance in every reactor, {{which suggests that the}} predominant aggregation mechanism was microcolony outgrowth (Weissbrodt et al. 2013). These genera are usually present in conventional activated sludge ecosystems, but in lower abundances (in the seed sludge the cumulative relative read abundance of EPS producers was only 13 %). Many of the EPS producing genera typical for sewage treatment plants are mixotrophic bacteria capable of denitrification and/or PHA production (Etchebehere et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2014; McIlroy et al. 2015; Inoue et al. 2016; McIlroy et al. 2016). EPS was earlier reported {{to play an important role}} in the formation and (mechanical) stability of granular sludge (Weber et al. 2007; Lemaire et al. 2008; Tan et al. 2014), while denitrification was reported to accelerate granule formation (Wan and Sperandio 2009; Suja et al. 2015). The EPS producing functional group was dominated by different genera in the three reactors (Thauera in R 1, Meganema in R 2 and <b>Zoogloea</b> in R 3) due to the different organic loading rates applied.|$|E
30|$|During {{steady-state}} operation (weeks 7 – 12), {{most of the}} biomass is granulated {{and dense}} enough to be retained in the reactor. Nonetheless, certain genera had a retention ratio significantly lower than one (Fig.  3), i.e. they were more abundant in the effluent than in the granules. A {{possible explanation is that}} these genera were situated {{on the surface of the}} granule, and were therefore exposed to granule erosion, as suggested by Winkler et al. (2012). They found that bacterial groups situated on the surface (e.g. ammonium oxidizing bacteria) were more prone to be washed out than bacterial groups situated in the core of the granules. We found that two abundant groups of bacteria, Meganema sp. and <b>Zoogloea</b> sp., which had a low retention ratio in all three reactors during steady-state operation (Fig.  3), were situated mostly in the outer layer of the granules, where the biomass was loosely packed (Fig.  4) and therefore more likely to be washed out due to granule erosion. Meganema sp. is usually found in aerobic environments, therefore it is not expected to grow in the inner parts of the granules (Kragelund et al. 2005). <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. has been reported to produce EPS containing high amounts of water and to grow as slimy colonies, thus the high abundance of these bacteria in the outer layer might explain the lower density of this part of the granule (Thomsen et al. 2007; Nielsen et al. 2010). Moreover, the typical morphological characteristics of these genera (filamentous growth for Meganema sp. (Kragelund et al. 2005), and finger-like structures in case of <b>Zoogloea</b> sp. (Rosselló-Mora et al. 1995) make them even more likely to detach when exposed to high shear force. Another possible explanation for the high abundance in the effluent is that these bacteria grew not only attached to the granule, but also in the bulk liquid as free floating cells. Both Meganema and <b>Zoogloea</b> have high substrate uptake rate and growth rate (Roinestad and Yall 1970; Kragelund et al. 2005), therefore they may also grow in suspended phase even in SBRs operated at 2  min settling time and 9.3  h HRT. It has also been shown that suspended biomass can be retained under wash-out conditions if attached to the rough surfaces of broken granules (Verawaty et al. 2012) or sheltered in indentations on the granule surface (Gonzalez-Gil and Holliger 2014).|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the biodegradation performance and characteristics of Sudan I and Acid Orange 7 (AO 7) to improve the biological dye removal efficiency in wastewater and optimize the treatment process. The dyes with different water-solubility and similar molecular structure were biologically treated under aerobic condition in parallel continuous-flow mixed stirred reactors. The biophase analysis using microscopic examination suggested that the removal process of the two azo dyes is different. Removal of Sudan I was through biosorption, since it easily assembled and adsorbed {{on the surface of}} <b>zoogloea</b> due to its insolubility, while AO 7 was biodegraded incompletely and bioconverted, the AO 7 molecule was decomposed to benzene series and inorganic ions, since it could reach the interior area of <b>zoogloea</b> due to the low oxidation-reduction potential conditions and corresponding anaerobic microorganisms. The transformation of NH 3 -N, SO 42 − together with the presence of tryptophan-like components confirm that AO 7 can be decomposed to non-toxic products in an aerobic bioreactor.
