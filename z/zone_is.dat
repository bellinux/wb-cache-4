5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of the dive time spent in four depth zones: descent, bottom, multilevel, and decompression. The descent zone was defined as the part of the dive between the surface and first reaching 85% of the maximum depth. The bottom <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> the part of the dive deeper than 85% of maximum depth. The multilevel <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum depth, and the decompression <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was defined as having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel was defined as having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E

5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone. A subduction <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} of denuded zones following low stress creep in particle-containing crystalline materials {{is both a}} microstructural prediction and observation often cited as irrefutable evidence for the Nabarro-Herring (N-H) mechanism of diffusional creep. The denuded <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> predicted to be at grain boundaries that are orthogonal to {{the direction of the}} applied stress. Furthermore, their dimensions should account for the accumulated plastic flow. In the present article, the evidence for such denuded <b>zones</b> <b>is</b> critically examined. These <b>zones</b> have <b>been</b> observed during creep of magnesium, aluminum, and nickel-base alloys. The investigation casts serious doubts on the apparently compelling evidence for the link between denuded zones and diffusional creep. Specifically, denuded <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> clearly observed under conditions that are explicitly not diffusional creep. Additionally, the denuded <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> often found in directions that are not orthogonal to the applied stress. Other mechanisms that can account for the observations of denuded <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> discussed. It is proposed that grain boundary sliding accommodated by slip is the rate-controlling process in the stress range where denuded <b>zones</b> have <b>been</b> observed. It is likely that the denuded <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> created by dissolution of precipitates at grain boundaries that are simultaneously sliding and migrating during creep. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the oceanic {{lithosphere}} near fracture zones {{have resulted in the}} proposal that the 'magma budget', defined as the amount of magma delivered to magma chambers or conduits beneath a spreading center for a given amount of spreading, decreases as fracture <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> approached. Geochemical variations in basaltic glasses collected near fracture <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> consistent with a decrease in partial melting as fracture <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> approached, but they could also be produced by variations in open-system magmatic processes with no change in the extent of partial melting. Although a decrease in the magma budget as fracture <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> approached is consistent with these data, so are alternative models that incorporate a constant magma budget...|$|R
