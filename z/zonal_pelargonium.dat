5000|$|In 1850 Lemoine {{established}} himself as a florist and gardener at Nancy, France, and by 1852 the Revue Horticole mentioned Lemoine's double flowered Portulaca. In 1854 Lemoine produced the first double Potentilla (Gloire de Nancy), and the first Streptocarpus hybrids. It was about the same period that Lemoine turned his hand to fuchsias and introduced many varieties, including the double flowered hybrid Solferino. By 1862 he had introduced a white Spiraea callosa, in 1866 his Hydrangea paniculata grandiflora and the first genuine double-flowered <b>zonal</b> <b>Pelargonium</b> geraniums (Gloire de Nancy), and in 1868 the first of his hybrid weigelas.|$|E

40|$|Host {{selection}} by adult {{greenhouse whitefly}} Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) was assessed on two pelargonium plant cultivars, Pelargonium x domesticum (regal) and P. x hortorum (zonal) using Petri dish bioassay chambers in choice and no-choice tests. Plant characteristics which could influence the oviposition preference of the whitely i. e., type and density of trichomes on the abaxial leaf surface was determined. A strong host preference was observed for the regal {{compared to the}} <b>zonal</b> <b>pelargonium</b> by the adult whiteflies. In no-choice tests, adults laid a significantly higher number of eggs on regal than on zonal leaves both at 24 and 48 hours post-exposure, respectively. After exposure to the adult whitefly, the number of 42 eggs in choice tests were similar between cultivars at 24 hours, but were higher for regal at 48 and 72 hours. The total number of trichomes (sng: straight non-glandular + sg: straight glandular) per 0. 50 cm 2 44 was significantly less on regal (Mean ± SE sng + sg; 43. 1 ± 1. 5) than on zonal leaves (60. 5 ± 1. 2); however, the sng trichomes were significantly higher on the zonal (49. 4 ± 0. 96) than the regal leaves (28. 6 ± 1. 00). Also, the number of sg trichomes was slightly higher for the regal cultivar leaves compared to the zonal, being 14. 4 ± 1. 2 and 11. 2 ± 0. 5, respectively. Results suggest that the trichome density, type {{and the ability to}} express glandular exudates can affect adult whitefly Pelargonium cultivar preference and {{plays an important role in}} their host plant selection for oviposition. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{usability}} of composts made of sewage sludge and either straw or leaves used as substrates for growing zonal pelargoniums. The study plants ‘Hot Pink’ cv. of Survivor group and ‘Fire’ cv. of Graffiti group were grown in 5 different substrates. The control substrate was high peat (100 %) deacidified with chalk and dolomite up to pH 5. 8 – 6. 0 and supplemented with 2. 5 g·dm - 3 of Azofoska multicomponent fertilizer. The other four substrates contained two types of composts: SSRS – sewage sludge, straw (1 : 1, v/v) and SSL – sewage sludge, leaves (1 : 1, v/v), mixed with high peat at two different proportions, 1 : 3 (v/v) and 1 : 7 (v/v). Chemical composition of the substrates was investigated and they were supplemented with nitrogen and potassium as recommended for pelargoniums. Plant morphological parameters were evaluated during flowering. They included plant height and diameter, number of shoots and leaves, leaf assimilation area and leaf weight. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content was also estimated. Inflorescence related parameters included inflorescence diameter and inflorescence stem length, number of flowers per inflorescence and flower diameter. All inflorescences formed over 10 weeks of flowering were counted. Plant ornamental value was assessed using a five-score bonitation scale. The investigated composts were found to be useful components of the substrates for <b>zonal</b> <b>pelargonium</b> production. Irrespective of the compost share, the tested substrates significantly affected most of the evaluated morphological traits. The substrate containing the compost made of sewage sludge and straw (SSRS) and peat (1 : 3, v/v) was found the most beneficial for pelargonium foliage, i. e. the number of leaves, their fresh weight and assimilation area. Leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content in the pelargoniums grown in the substrates containing either dose of SSRS compost did not differ from the control plants. Substrate type did not affect bonitation score of ‘Survivor Hot Pink’ cultivar. The bonitation score of ‘Graffiti Fire’ cultivar was the highest for plants growing in the substrates with either SSRS or SSL compost plus peat in 1 : 3 ratio (v/v) ...|$|E

50|$|Quisqualic acid is an agonist of the AMPA, kainate, {{and group}} I metabotropic {{glutamate}} receptors. It {{is one of}} the most potent AMPA receptor agonists known. It causes excitotoxicity and is used in neuroscience to selectively destroy neurons in the brain or spinal cord. Quisqualic acid occurs naturally in the seeds of Quisqualis species.Research conducted by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, has demonstrated quisqualic acid is also present within the flower petals of <b>zonal</b> geranium (<b>Pelargonium</b> x hortorum) and is responsible for causing rigid paralysis of the Japanese beetle. Quisqualic acid is thought to mimic L-glutamic acid, which is a neurotransmitter in the insect neuromuscular junction and mammalian central nervous system.|$|R

High-resolution–MS and NMR (1 H, 13 C, COSY, heteronuclear sequential quantum correlation, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation) analysis identified the paralytic compound as quisqualic acid (C 5 H 7 N 3 O 5), a known but rare agonist of excitatory amino acid receptors. Optical rotation measurements and chiral HPLC analysis determined an l-configuration. Geranium-derived and synthetic l-quisqualic acid demonstrated the same positive paralytic dose–response.

For both crops, {{at the end of}} the cultural cycle the highest ECs in the upper and lower layers were recorded in plants fertilized with the full strength solution, whereas the effect of irrigation system was less pronounced where the highest ECs was recorded in subirrigation but only in the upper layer. The highest ECs recorded with subirrigation under full strength nutrient solution on geranium had a negative effect on plant growth parameters (shoot dry weight, root-toshoot ratio, final leaf area, and growth index) and on number of flowers, while no significant effects were observed for petunia, indicating that this bedding plant can be considered more tolerant to salinity. No significant differences among treatments were recorded for the petunia WUEGI, whereas for geranium the lowest value of WUEGI was observed in the subirrigation treatment using half strength nutrient solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{sustainable}} floriculture and the continuous and increasing demand for environmentally-friendly products have produced, in recent years, several studies {{that tried to}} answer these requests. Simultaneously {{there is a need}} to meet the companies requirements for cost reduction and more attractive products. Nowadays, studies with an holistic approach to the problem, for example the evaluation of product’s life cycle, are not very common. A complete study requires, in fact, a huge amount of data acquired throughout the investigation of a statistically significant sample of companies. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was first used to determine the environmental impact of industrial products. In the last decades its applications in the agricultural sector have increased, though studies on floriculture productions are still rare. In this study we perfored the first Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of three species, poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd.), <b>zonal</b> geranium (<b>Pelargonium</b> ×hortorum) and cyclamen (Cyclamen persicum Mill.) and two type of containers, a traditional polypropylene pot and a compostable rice hulls pot. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data were sourced from interviews and published literature. The results showed that both type of pots are major contributor to the environmental impact of the assessed systems. Global Warming Potential (GWP) of plastic pot is mainly affected by the material used for its production, while rice hulls (RH) pot is only affected by transport process from the production site. The use of compostable RH pot could potentially be more sustainable, but to date its contribution is only slightly lower than the plastic one. Further assessments including end-of-life information, in particular for plastic materials, may lead to a better evaluation of the possible alternatives...|$|R
