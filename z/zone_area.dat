5|$|The {{war started}} officially on 3 December 1971, when Pakistani {{aircraft}} bombed Indian Air Force {{bases in the}} western part of the country. The Army Headquarters, under the leadership Manekshaw, formulated a strategy as follows: the II Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Tapishwar Narain Raina (later General, and COAS), was to enter from the west; the IV Corps, commanded Lieutenant General Sagat Singh, was to enter from the west; the XXXIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Mohan L. Thapan was enter to from the west; additionally the 101 Communication <b>Zone</b> <b>Area,</b> commanded by Major General Gurbax Singh, was to provide support from the northeast. This strategy was to be executed by the Eastern Command, under Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Manekshaw instructed Lieutenant General J. F. R. Jacob, chief of staff Eastern Command, to inform the Indian prime minister that orders were being issued for the movement of troops from Eastern Command. The following day, the navy and the air force also initiated full-scale operations on both eastern and western fronts.|$|E

A Cabinet Minister (Fraser Colman) was randomly selected to accompany this official New Zealand Government protest fleet. This voyage included a number of local kiwi peace organisations who had organised an international flotilla of protest yachts that accompanied the frigates into the Mururoa zone. Many of the early NZ peace activists and organisations were enthusiastic young hippies and students, many of whom were involved with the counter-culture and the original opposition to the Vietnam War movements.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the measurement repeatability of peripapillary atrophy (PPA) parameters obtained by optic disc ster-eophotography (ODP) {{and evaluate the}} usefulness of PPA parameters to differentiate open-angle glaucoma (OAG) from nor-mal eyes in patients with PPA. Methods: Sixty-five eyes of 65 patients with PPA were examined. Disc area, cup area, rim area, vertical cup to disc (CD) ratio, CD area ratio, PPA <b>area,</b> <b>zone</b> beta (β) <b>area</b> and <b>zone</b> alpha (α) <b>area</b> were obtained by ODP using intrinsic algorithms. The area under the receivers operating characteristic (AUROC) curves {{was used to compare}} the PPA parameters with that of the disc parameters to differentiate OAG from normal eyes. Two examiners analyzed PPA parameters to confirm reproducibility and repeatability of ODP. Results: Vertical CD ratio (VCD), <b>area</b> CD ratio, <b>zone</b> β <b>area,</b> <b>zone</b> β <b>area</b> per PPA <b>area,</b> <b>zone</b> β <b>area</b> per disc area and axial length were significantly larger in OAG patients (p 0. 997). Conclusions: The PPA measurement obtained by ODP has good reproducibility and consistency and can be a useful tool in monitoring PPA changes in glaucoma patients...|$|R
2500|$|As a {{follow-up}} to earlier legislation, in 1985 the eligibility of projects in the restricted area for 421-a tax benefits was restricted to projects that either received financial help from any level of government or had 20% of their housing units be certified by the HPD to be affordable.
