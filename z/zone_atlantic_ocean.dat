50|$|This {{season was}} below average in activity. In the eastern north Pacific, eleven {{tropical}} cyclones formed. Of these, four became hurricanes, {{one of which}} were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The remainder were tropical storms. In addition, one Atlantic hurricane, Hurricane Cesar, crossed into this <b>zone</b> from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and was renamed Douglas. None of the systems in the eastern north Pacific crossed 140°W and entered the central Pacific. The last time that happened was in the 1979 season.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{composition}} of two deep-sea viral communities obtained from the Romanche Fracture <b>Zone</b> in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> (collected at 5200 m depth) and the southwest Mediterranean Sea (from 2400 m depth) using a pyro-sequencing approach. The results are based on 18. 7 % and 6. 9 % of the sequences obtained from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and the Mediterranean Sea, respectively, with hits to genomes in the non-redundant viral RefSeq database. The identifiable richness and relative abundance in both viromes were dominated by archaeal and bacterial viruses accounting for 92. 3 % of the relative abundance in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and for 83. 6 % in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite characteristic differences in hydrographic features between the sampling sites in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and the Mediterranean Sea, 440 virus genomes were found in both viromes. An additional 431 virus genomes were identified in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> and 75 virus genomes were only found in the Mediterranean Sea.

50|$|The {{little tunny}} {{is found in}} the neritic waters of the {{temperate}} and tropical <b>zones</b> in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>ocean.</b> It can also be found in the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. In the eastern Atlantic, the little tunny has been found from Skagerrak to South Africa. Although found it this broad range of latitudes, it is rare north of the Iberian Peninsula or farther south than Brazil. On the Atlantic coast of the United States, they can be caught as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and as far south as the tip of Florida, as well as throughout the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} colonies are deserted from July to March {{when the}} birds {{migrate to the}} south Atlantic, wintering mainly off Brazil and Argentina with smaller numbers off southwest South Africa.The journey south can be over 10000 km, so a 50-year-old bird has probably covered over a million km (600,000 mi) on migration alone. The migration {{also appears to be}} quite complex, containing many stopovers and foraging <b>zones</b> throughout the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Ornithologist Chris Mead estimated that a bird ringed in 1957 when aged about five years and still breeding on Bardsey Island off Wales in April 2002 had flown over 8 million km (5 million mi) in total during its 50-year life.|$|R
30|$|The {{choice of}} Asilah is also {{justified}} by its geological context and {{proximity to the}} Nubia–Eurasia plate boundary (NEPB). In fact, several possible tsunami sources are identified along the Gulf of Cadiz (Johnston 1996; N. Zitellini et al. 1999; M.-A. Gutscher et al. 2002; L. Matias et al. 2005; M. -A. Gutscher et al. 2006; M. -A. Gutscher et al. 2006).

40|$|We {{present a}} {{multiple}} linear regression model developed for describing global river export of dissolved SiO 2 (DSi) to coastal zones. The model, with river basin spatial scale and an annual temporal scale, is based on four variables with a significant influence on DSi yields (soil bulk density, precipitation, slope, and area with volcanic lithology) for the predam situation. Cross validation showed that the model is robust {{with respect to the}} selected model variables and coefficients. The calculated global river export of DSi is 380 Tg a(- 1) (340 - 427 Tg a(- 1)). Most of the DSi is exported by global rivers to the coastal <b>zone</b> of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean</b> (41 %), Pacific Ocean (36 %), and Indian Ocean (14 %). South America and Asia are the largest contributors (25 % and 23 %, respectively). DSi retention in reservoirs in global river basins may amount to 18 - 19 %...|$|R
40|$|International audienceComplexity and {{predictability}} {{of daily}} precipitation in a tropical semi-arid region (Ceará State, Brazil) is assessed by applying entropy concepts. Precipitation regimes {{in that region}} depend on several dynamical forcings, the most important being the displacement and activity of the Inter-tropical Convergence <b>Zone</b> in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Ocean.</b> Topography is another important factor that influences the spatial distribution of rainfall in the region. A hierarchical approach based on sequences of events of different lengths is used to estimate complexity of daily precipitation records. It is shown that precipitation in Ceará exhibit more random than periodic sequences, which indicates a large degree of complexity. Nevertheless, there is indication of potentially inherent rules in the precipitation time-series that could ultimately improve prediction on time-scales between 9 ? 11 days. It is suggested that synoptic-scale disturbances (1 ? 8 days) represent important sources of rules in the precipitation regimes in this region...|$|R
