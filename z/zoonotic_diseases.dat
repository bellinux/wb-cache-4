25|$|Bar-Yosef and Cohen {{suggest that}} the success of hominins within Eurasia once out of Africa is in part due to the absence of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> outside their {{original}} habitat. <b>Zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> are those that are transmitted from animals to humans. While a disease specific to hominins must keep its human host alive long enough to transmit itself, <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases</b> will not necessarily do so as they can complete their life cycle without humans. Still, these infections are well accustomed to human presence, having evolved alongside them. The higher an African ape's population density, the better a disease fares. 55% of chimps at the Gombe reserve die of disease, most of them zoonotic. The majority of these diseases are still restricted to hot and damp African environments. Once hominins had moved out into drier and colder habitats of higher latitudes, one major limiting factor in population growth was out of the equation.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to genetic}} similarity, {{non-human}} primates {{are often the}} focus of <b>zoonotic</b> infectious <b>disease</b> research. The objective of <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> research can vary depending upon whether the study is focusing on human health or the health of wild non-human primate populations. Research with non-human primates {{is often associated with}} their use in medical laboratories for the benefit of human health. However, other studies focus on both the health of wild non-human primate populations and human interactions. This study reviews <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> research published in both primatology journals and broader scientific journals. Reviewing journals from different academic backgrounds can show trends on where research is being done and where research is heading with <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> and primates. To find common trends in zoonotic research, each article was categorized based off of the research 2 ̆ 7 s primary objective in question. Furthermore, this study looks at how <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> impacts primate conservation and whether or not current research is looking into this. As anthropogenic habitat destruction increases, humans and non-human primates interact more, which leads to an increase in <b>disease</b> transmission. <b>Zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> negatively impacts both human and non-human primate populations. Many non-human primate populations are endangered and disease transmission further affects conservation efforts...|$|R

25|$|Many modern diseases, even {{epidemic}} diseases, {{started out}} as <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> It is hard to establish with certainty which diseases jumped from other animals to humans, but there is increasing evidence from DNA and RNA sequencing, that measles, smallpox, influenza, HIV, and diphtheria came to humans this way. Various forms of the common cold and tuberculosis also are adaptations of strains originating in other species.|$|E
25|$|A {{side effect}} of {{domestication}} has been <b>zoonotic</b> <b>diseases.</b> For example, cattle have given humanity various viral poxes, measles, and tuberculosis; pigs and ducks have given influenza; and horses have given the rhinoviruses. Many parasites have their origins in domestic animals. The advent of domestication resulted in denser human populations which provided ripe conditions for pathogens to reproduce, mutate, spread, and eventually find a new host in humans.|$|E

Regulatory differences across states as well as compartmentalization of information within agencies may impede disease detection. However, the impact may not always be negative: bureaucracies can also be adaptive; federalism allows states important opportunities for innovation.
