50|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>stroke</b> {{has been}} {{described}} in slightly different terms by various authors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zero</b> <b>stroke</b> or cipher stroke was {{an alleged}} mental disorder, {{reportedly}} diagnosed by physicians in Germany during the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic (1921-24). The disorder was primarily {{characterized by the}} desire of patients to write endless rows of zeros, which are {{also referred to as}} ciphers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>zero</b> <b>stroke</b> {{disorder}} {{was supposedly}} {{caused by the}} dizzying speed of hyperinflation and the calculations required to conduct commerce under its effect. It {{has been said that}} during the worst period of hyperinflation that in the time it took to drink a cup of coffee, the price for the cup could double. The fast pace of hyperinflation caused people to quickly buy goods when they received their wages. Workers would demand to be paid {{at the beginning of the}} day for their work and after they were paid, they would be given half an hour to run off to buy goods before their earnings became worthless. The requirements to calculate and recalculate commercial transactions in the billions and trillions made it practically impossible to do business in paper Marks.|$|E
5000|$|In an Esophageal Doppler Monitor (EDM) or Oesophageal Doppler Monitor (ODM), {{during the}} time the aortic valve is open (ejection time or flow time), the average aortic blood {{velocity}} is calculated. The product of average velocity and ejection time gives the stroke distance (how far the blood travels in each heart cycle). Flow time (FT) is the time difference between the sudden increase in velocity (T0) and the return to near <b>zero</b> velocity (T1). <b>Stroke</b> distance (SD) can calculated from the plug flow like velocity (v(t)): ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To determine, {{using an}} animal model of blood loss, (1) if stroke distance, derived non-invasively {{from the time}} {{integral}} of the maximum velocity of red cells in the aorta, changed {{to a greater extent}} than heart rate and mean arterial pressure (MAP), which are recognised to be unreliable indicators of blood loss; (2) if changes in stroke distance reflected changes in stroke volume derived from thermodilution cardiac output measurements. METHODS: Eight anaesthetised swine had baseline measurements of heart rate, MAP, stroke volume, and stroke distance and were then exsanguinated at a rate of 1 ml/kg/min. Percentage changes from baseline of heart rate, MAP, stroke volume, and stroke distance were compared after 10, 20, and 30 ml/kg blood loss. The animal's blood was then reinfused at the rate of 2 ml/kg/min for 15 min, followed by normal saline 1 ml/kg/min. Percentage changes from baseline measurement of stroke volume and stroke distance over the whole experiment were evaluated by regression analysis. RESULTS: Heart rate, MAP, and stroke distance changed + 7. 9 %, - 22. 5 %, and - 18. 1 % respectively (from baseline values) after 10 ml/kg blood loss; + 23. 2 %, - 44. 0 %, and - 47. 4 % after 20 ml/kg blood loss; and + 55. 7 %, - 62. 0 %, and - 69. 8 % after 30 ml/kg blood loss. Regression analysis of percentage changes in stroke volume and stroke distance from their baseline values at experimental time <b>zero</b> is <b>stroke</b> volume = 1. 014 x stroke distance - 2. 156, r = 0. 92, n = 54, P < 0. 0001. CONCLUSIONS: (1) At maximal blood loss, stroke distance changes {{to a greater extent than}} heart rate and MAP. (2) Changes in stroke distance reflected changes in stroke volume but with less variability at lower values. Stroke distance may be a more useful measure of blood loss than heart rate and MAP...|$|R
40|$|For many years, it {{has been}} known that myosin binds to actin tightly, but {{it had not been}} {{possible}} to devise a muscle fiber experiment to determine whether this binding energy is directly coupled to the working stroke of the actomyosin crossbridge cycle. Addressing the question at the single-molecule level with optical tweezers allows the problem to be resolved. We have compared the working stroke on the binding of four myosin complexes (myosin, myosin-ADP, myosin-pyrophosphate, and myosin-adenyl- 5 ′yl imidodiphosphate) with that observed while hydrolyzing ATP. None of the four was observed to give a working stroke significantly different from <b>zero.</b> A working <b>stroke</b> (5. 4 nm) was observed only with ATP, which indicates that the other states bind to actin in a rigor-like conformation and that myosin products (M. ADP. Pi), the state that binds to actin during ATPase activity, binds in a different, prestroke conformation. We conclude that myosin, while dissociated from actin, must be able to take up at least two mechanical conformations and show that our results are consistent with these conformations corresponding to the two states characterized at high resolution, which are commonly referred to in terms of having open and closed nucleotide binding pockets...|$|R
40|$|Background—: To perform {{decision}} {{analyses that}} include stroke {{as one of}} the possible health states, the utilities of stroke states must be determined. We reviewed the literature to obtain estimates of the utility of stroke and explored the impact of the study population and the elicitation method. Summary of Review—: We searched various databases for articles reporting empirical assessment of utilities. Mean utilities of major stroke (Rankin Scale 4 to 5) and minor stroke (Rankin Scale 2 to 3) were calculated, stratified by study population and elicitation method. Additionally, the modified Rankin Scale was mapped onto the EuroQol classification system. Utilities were obtained from 23 articles. Patients at risk for stroke assigned utilities of 0. 26 and 0. 55 to major and minor stroke, respectively. Stroke survivors assigned higher utilities to both major (0. 41) and minor stroke (0. 72). The EuroQol completed by stroke survivors revealed a utility of 0. 32 and 0. 71 for major and minor stroke, respectively. Utilities elicited by the Standard Gamble were generally higher, while those obtained by the Visual Analogue Scale were lower than the Time Trade Off values. Remaining variation between utilities may be caused by differences in definitions of the health states. The mapped EuroQol indicated a utility of 0. 64 for minor stroke and a value just below <b>zero</b> for major <b>stroke.</b> Conclusions—: For minor stroke, a utility between 0. 50 and 0. 70 seems to be reasonable for both decision analyses and cost-effectiveness studies. The utility of major stroke may range between 0 and 0. 30 and may possibly be negative...|$|R
50|$|Pressure. In {{a typical}} pressure-compensated pump, the swash plate angle is {{adjusted}} through {{the action of}} a valve which uses pressure feedback so that the instantaneous pump output flow is exactly enough to maintain a designated pressure. If the load flow increases, pressure will momentarily decrease but the pressure-compensation valve will sense the decrease and then increase the swash plate angle to increase pump output flow so that the desired pressure is restored. In reality most systems use pressure as a control {{for this type of}} pump. The operating pressure reaches, say, 200 bar (20 MPa or 2900 psi) and the swash plate is driven towards <b>zero</b> angle (piston <b>stroke</b> nearly <b>zero)</b> and with the inherent leaks in the system allows the pump to stabilise at the delivery volume that maintains the set pressure. As demand increases the swash plate is moved to a greater angle, piston stroke increases and the volume of fluid increases; if the demand slackens the pressure will rise, and the pumped volume diminishes as the pressure rises. At maximum system pressure the output is once again almost zero. If the fluid demand increases beyond the capacity of the pump to deliver, the system pressure will drop to near zero. The swash plate angle will remain at the maximum allowed, and the pistons will operate at full stroke. This continues until system flow-demand eases and the pump's capacity is greater than demand. As the pressure rises the swash-plate angle modulates to try to not exceed the maximum pressure while meeting the flow demand.|$|R
40|$|The flow {{fields of}} slowly flying bats and faster-flying birds differ in that bats produce two vortex loops during each stroke, one per wing, and birds produce a single vortex loop per stroke. In addition, the {{circulation}} at <b>stroke</b> transition approaches <b>zero</b> in bats but remains strong in birds. It is unknown if these difference derive from fundamental differences in wing morphology or are {{a consequence of}} flight speed. Here, we present {{an analysis of the}} horizontal flow field underneath hovering Anna’s hummingbirds (Calypte anna) to describe the wake of a bird flying at zero forward velocity. We also consider how the hummingbird tail interacts with the wake generated by the wings. High-speed image recording and analysis from three orthogonal perspectives revealed that the wing tips reach peak velocities in the middle of each <b>stroke</b> and approach <b>zero</b> velocity at <b>stroke</b> transition. Hummingbirds use complex tail kinematic patterns ranging from in phase to antiphase cycling with respect to the wings, covering several phase shifted patterns. We employed particle image velocimetry to attain detailed horizontal flow measurements at three levels with respect to the tail: in the tail, at the tail tip, and just below the tail. The velocity patterns underneath the wings indicate that flow oscillates along the ventral–dorsal axis in response to the down- and up-strokes and that the sideways flows with respect to the bird are consistently from the lateral to medial. The region around the tail is dominated by axial flows in dorsal to ventral direction. We propose that these flows are generated by interaction between the wakes of the two wings {{at the end of the}} upstroke, and that the tail actively defects flows to generate moments that contribute to pitch stability. The flow fields images also revealed distinct vortex loops underneath each wing, which were generated during each stroke. From these data, we propose a model for the primary flow structures of hummingbirds that more strongly resembles the bat model. Thus, pairs of unconnected vortex loops may be shared features of different animals during hovering and slow forward flight...|$|R
