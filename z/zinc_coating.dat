2500|$|Production of the war-time cent was {{provided}} for in an Act of Congress approved on December 18, 1942, which also set as the expiration {{date of the}} authority December 31, 1946. Low-grade carbon steel formed the base of these coins, to which a <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> [...] thick was deposited on each side electrolytically as a rust preventive. This coating {{was applied to the}} steel before the blanks were made, leaving the rims of these coins extremely susceptible to rust. The same size was maintained, but the weight was reduced from the standard [...] to , by using a lighter alloy. Production commenced on February 27, 1943, and by December 31 of that year, the three Mint facilities had produced 1,093,838,670 of the one-cent coins. The copper released for the war effort was enough to meet the combined needs of two cruisers, two destroyers, 1,243 Flying Fortresses, 120 field guns and 120 howitzers, or enough for 1,250,000 shells for large field guns.|$|E
40|$|The {{weldability}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> {{steel sheets}} is often compromised by weld seam defects caused by rapid zinc vaporisation and burned-off zinc.

40|$|Key words—Wire {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (WEDM); brass wire; <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> wire; composite wire; ANOVA Abstract — In this paper, the effect of different wire electrodes used in wire {{electrical discharge machining}} (WEDM) on the machining characteristics of AISI D 3 die steel has been presented. Three process parameters, namely type of wire (brass wire, <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> wire and composite wire), pulse on time and peak current have been considered. The process performance is measured in terms of cutting speed and surface roughness. The research outcome will identify the important parameters and their effect on performance characteristics while machining AISI D 3 material with different wire electrodes. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of multilevel factorial design indicated that all the selected parameters have significant effect on the performance characteristics. The study indicated the improvement in surface roughness with brass wire over other wires. Maximum cutting speed was obtained with composite wire as compared to <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> and brass wire.

50|$|The {{protection}} {{provided by}} hot-dip galvanizing is insufficient for products {{that will be}} constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses. For these applications, more expensive stainless steel is preferred. Some nails made today are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many outdoor applications because it is cheaper than hot-dip <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> and looks good when new. Another reason not to use hot-dip <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is that for bolts and nuts of size M10 (US 3/8") or smaller, the thick hot-dipped coating fills in {{too much of the}} threads, which reduces strength (because the dimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to fit together). This means that for cars, bicycles, and many other light mechanical products, the practical alternative to electroplating bolts and nuts is not hot-dip <b>zinc</b> <b>coating,</b> but making the fasteners from stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|Galvanizing {{generally}} {{refers to}} hot-dip galvanizing {{which is a}} way of coating steel with a layer of metallic zinc or tin. Galvanized coatings are quite durable in most environments because they combine the barrier properties of a coating with some of the benefits of cathodic protection. If the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is scratched or otherwise locally damaged and steel is exposed, the surrounding areas of <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> form a galvanic cell with the exposed steel and protect it from corrosion. This is a form of localized cathodic protection - the zinc acts as a sacrificial anode.|$|E
40|$|In WEDM {{machining}} process, {{surface finish}} quality depends on intensity {{and duration of}} spark plasma. Electrode wire diameter has {{significant effect on the}} spark intensity and yet the studies on this matter still less. Therefore, the main objectives of this studies are to compare the different diameters of <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> and uncoated brass electrode on H 13 tool steel surface roughness. The experiments were conducted on Sodick VZ 300 L WEDM and work piece material of tool steel AISI H 13 block. Electrode of <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> brass with diameters of 0. 1 mm, 0. 2 mm, 0. 25 mm and uncoated brass 0. 2 mm were used. The surface roughness of cutting was measured using the SUR-FTEST SJ- 410 Mitutoyo, surface roughness tester. The results suggest that better surface roughness quality can be achieved through smaller electrode wire diameter. The <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> improves flushing ability and sparks intensity resulting in better surface finish of H 13 tool steel.

This fact evidences {{the importance of this}} welding process control, due to its efficiency, productivity speediness and straightforward simple automation. This work aimed to study the weldability of <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> and uncoated steel sheets for automotive industry, comparing the performance of two welding equipments with two current outputkinds: alternating current (AC) and medium frequency direct current (DC). The welding parameters were kept constant: 260 kgf (force), 150 ms (time) and 7. 0 kA (welding current), based upon an optimization parameters methodology. The joints were characterized using optical metallography (spot diameter, indentation depth and weld penetration depth), mechanical tensile-shear tests and electrical measurements: contact electrical resistance, dynamic resistance and dynamic energy. The results showed that welding in medium frequency direct current was more efficient in generating heat in <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> sheets and uncoated sheets than alternating current equipment. In welding using AC and DC equipments in <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> sheets, the spot weld time formation was 25 ms longer than uncoated steel sheets spot weld time. The burn of zinc during welding did not damage the spot weld formation with AC or DC equipments. The electrical contact resistance increased with the roughnessand also presented 52 % higher in uncoated sheets than in <b>zinc</b> <b>coated</b> sheets. Finally, the increase in dynamicresistance and dynamic energy augmented the spot weld diameter for both welding equipments.

50|$|A common {{example of}} {{galvanic}} corrosion occurs in corrugated iron, {{a sheet of}} iron or steel covered with a <b>zinc</b> <b>coating.</b> Even when the protective <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is broken, the underlying steel is not attacked. Instead, the zinc is corroded because it is less noble; only {{after it has been}} consumed can rusting of the base metal occur in earnest. By contrast, with a traditional tin can, the opposite of a protective effect occurs: because the tin is more noble than the underlying steel, when the tin coating is broken, the steel beneath is immediately attacked preferentially.|$|E

50|$|A {{less obvious}} {{example of this}} type of {{protection}} is the process of galvanising iron. This process coats iron structures (such as fencing) with a coating of zinc metal. As long as the zinc remains intact, the iron is protected from the effects of corrosion. Inevitably, the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> becomes breached, either by cracking or physical damage. Once this occurs, corrosive elements act as an electrolyte and the zinc/iron combination as electrodes. The resultant current ensures that the <b>zinc</b> <b>coating</b> is sacrificed but that the base iron does not corrode. Such a coating can protect an iron structure for a few decades, but once the protecting coating is consumed, the iron rapidly corrodes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic {{spot welding}} of {{galvanized}} steel sheets {{has been conducted}} to investigate formation process of the weld microstructure, and effect of <b>zinc</b> <b>coat</b> on joint property. The joint strength showed a rapidly increase at the weld time of 0. 8 s, {{and it has the}} maximum value over 1. 0 s. In the weld time range from 0. 1 s to 0. 8 s, fracture occurred in <b>zinc</b> <b>coat</b> / steel interface. In contrast, the fracture partially occurred in the base steel in the weld time over 1. 0 s, and concaves in which the steel substrate of one specimen partially remains on the other specimen were observed. The formation process of weld microstructure of ultrasonic welding was proposed to be a two-steps process. First, <b>zinc</b> <b>coat</b> in the interface was mechanically removed by the vibration and clamping force, and some zinc particles dispersed in the weld interface. Second, the zinc particles melted due to the friction, and partially bonded regions were simultaneously formed around the zinc particles. The partially bonded regions were stirred with the steel substrate as the weld time increased. The joint strength increased by development of the stirred zone. At the weld time over 1. 2 s, the joint strength decreased due to growth of crack around the stirred zone...|$|R
