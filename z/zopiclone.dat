25|$|Rifampicin {{causes a}} very notable {{reduction}} in half-life of <b>zopiclone</b> and peak plasma levels, {{which results in}} a large reduction in the hypnotic effect of <b>zopiclone.</b> Phenytoin and carbamazepine may also provoke similar interactions. Ketoconazole and sulfaphenazole interfere with the metabolism of <b>zopiclone.</b> Nefazodone impairs the metabolism of <b>zopiclone</b> leading to increased <b>zopiclone</b> levels and marked next-day sedation.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol has an {{additive}} effect {{when combined with}} <b>zopiclone,</b> enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of <b>zopiclone</b> significantly. Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of <b>zopiclone</b> and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on <b>zopiclone</b> pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole drug interaction with <b>zopiclone.</b> Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{pharmacological properties}} of <b>zopiclone</b> include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. <b>Zopiclone</b> and benzodiazepines bind {{to the same}} sites on GABAA-containing receptors, causing an enhancement {{of the actions of}} GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of <b>zopiclone.</b> The metabolite of <b>zopiclone</b> called desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for <b>zopiclone</b> on α1 and α5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to α1, α2, α3, and α5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the parent drug <b>zopiclone,</b> which is a full agonist. The mechanism of action of <b>zopiclone</b> is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> causes {{impaired}} driving skills {{similar to}} those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take <b>zopiclone</b> unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in <b>zopiclone</b> users. <b>Zopiclone</b> induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking <b>zopiclone</b> as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand eye coordination.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> has the {{potential}} for misuse and dosage escalation, drug abuse, and drug dependence. It is abused orally and sometimes intravenously, and often combined with alcohol to achieve a combined sedative hypnotic—alcohol euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends <b>zopiclone</b> prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence. Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice. <b>Zopiclone</b> may be more addictive than benzodiazepines. Those with a history of substance misuse or mental health disorders may be at an increased risk of high-dose <b>zopiclone</b> misuse. High dose misuse of <b>zopiclone</b> and increasing popularity amongst drug abusers who have been prescribed with <b>zopiclone</b> The symptoms of <b>zopiclone</b> addiction can include depression, dysphoria, hopelessness, slow thoughts, social isolation, worrying, sexual anhedonia, and nervousness.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol {{should be}} avoided when using <b>zopiclone,</b> as alcohol and <b>zopiclone</b> enhance the effects {{of each other and}} the risk of {{dependence}} could increase.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> (brand names Zimovane and Imovane) is a nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} agent used in {{the treatment}} of insomnia. <b>Zopiclone</b> is molecularly distinct from benzodiazepine drugs and is classed as a cyclopyrrolone. However, <b>zopiclone</b> increases the normal transmission of the neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid in the central nervous system, via modulating benzodiazepine receptors {{in the same way that}} benzodiazepine drugs do.|$|E
25|$|In EEG studies, <b>zopiclone</b> {{significantly}} {{increases the}} energy of the beta frequency band and shows characteristics of high-voltage slow waves, desynchronization of hippocampal theta waves, and an increase in {{the energy of}} the delta frequency band. <b>Zopiclone</b> increases both stage 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS), while zolpidem, an α1-selective compound, increases only SWS and causes no effect on stage 2 sleep. <b>Zopiclone</b> is less selective to the α1 site and has higher affinity to the α2 site than zaleplon. <b>Zopiclone</b> is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>zopiclone</b> are {{altered by}} aging and {{are influenced by}} renal and hepatic functions. In severe chronic renal failure, the area under the curve value for <b>zopiclone</b> was larger and the half-life associated with the elimination rate constant longer, but these changes were {{not considered to be}} clinically significant. Sex and race have not been found to interact with pharmacokinetics of <b>zopiclone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The plasma protein-binding of <b>zopiclone</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to be weak, between 45 and 80% (mean 52–59%). It is rapidly and widely distributed to body tissues, including the brain, and is excreted in urine, saliva, and breast milk. <b>Zopiclone</b> is partly extensively metabolized in the liver to form an active N-demethylated derivative (N-desmethylzopiclone) and an inactive zopiclone-N-oxide. Hepatic enzymes playing the most significant role in <b>zopiclone</b> metabolism are CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. In addition, about 50% of the administered dose is decarboxylated and excreted via the lungs. In urine, the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites account for 30% of the initial dose. Between 7 and 10% of <b>zopiclone</b> is recovered from the urine, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug before excretion. The terminal elimination half-life of <b>zopiclone</b> ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 hours (5 hours on average).|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> {{and other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs are detected frequently {{in cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs. Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range and often in combination with other alcohol, illegal, or prescription drugs of abuse, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and <b>zopiclone.</b> <b>Zopiclone,</b> which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. Zaleplon or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of <b>zopiclone</b> to reduce traffic accidents. <b>Zopiclone</b> as with other hypnotic drugs is sometimes abused to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs, <b>zopiclone</b> causes {{a decrease in}} the core body temperature and is effective in decreasing sleep latency. It causes similar alterations on EEG readings and sleep architecture as benzodiazepines and causes disturbances in sleep architecture on withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. <b>Zopiclone</b> reduces both delta waves and the number of high-amplitude delta waves whilst increasing low-amplitude waves. <b>Zopiclone</b> reduces the total amount of time spent in REM sleep as well as delaying its onset. Cognitive behavioral therapy {{has been found to be}} superior to <b>zopiclone</b> in the treatment of insomnia and has been found to have lasting effects on sleep quality for at least a year after therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> also {{interacts with}} {{trimipramine}} and caffeine.|$|E
25|$|After oral administration, <b>zopiclone</b> {{is rapidly}} absorbed, with a {{bioavailability}} around 75–80%. Time to peak plasma concentration is 1–2 hours. High-fat meal preceding <b>zopiclone</b> administration {{does not change}} absorption (as measured by AUC), but reduces peak plasma levels and delays its occurrence, thus may delay the onset of therapeutic effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> {{is in the}} top-ten {{medications}} obtained using false prescription in France.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to <b>zopiclone</b> or other Z {{drugs such as}} zolpidem and zaleplon has found few clear and consistent differences between <b>zopiclone</b> and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> is {{indicated}} for the short-term treatment of insomnia where sleep initiation or sleep maintenance are prominent symptoms. Long-term use is not recommended, as tolerance, dependence, and addiction can occur with prolonged use. One low quality {{study found that}} <b>zopiclone</b> is ineffective in improving sleep quality or increasing sleep time in shift workers - more {{research in this area}} has been recommended.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> was {{developed}} and first introduced in 1986 by Rhône-Poulenc S.A., now part of Sanofi-Aventis, the main worldwide manufacturer. Initially, it was promoted as an improvement on benzodiazepines, but a recent meta-analysis found it was no better than benzodiazepines {{in any of the}} aspects assessed. On April 4, 2005, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration listed <b>zopiclone</b> under schedule IV, due to evidence that the drug has addictive properties similar to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>zopiclone</b> is not commercially available, {{although}} its active stereoisomer, eszopiclone, is sold {{under the name}} Lunesta. <b>Zopiclone</b> is a controlled substance in the United States, Japan, Brazil, and some European countries, and may be illegal to possess without a prescription. However, it is readily available in other countries where it is marketed under the brand name Imovane, {{and is not a}} controlled substance in its available 7.5mg, 5mg, and 3.75mg oral tablet formulations.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{liver disease}} {{eliminate}} <b>zopiclone</b> {{much more slowly}} than normal patients and in addition experience exaggerated pharmacological effects of the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> {{is in the}} cyclopyrrolone {{family of}} drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include suriclone. <b>Zopiclone,</b> {{although}} molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone's pharmacological properties. In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some barbiturate-like properties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> has crosstolerance with {{barbiturates}} {{and is able}} {{to suppress}} barbiturate withdrawal signs. It is frequently self-administered intravenously in studies on monkeys, suggesting a high risk of abuse potential.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> {{increases}} postural sway {{and increases}} the number of falls in older people, as well as cognitive side effects. Falls are a significant {{cause of death in}} older people.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone,</b> as {{traditionally}} sold worldwide, is a {{racemic mixture}} of two stereoisomers, {{only one of}} which is active. In 2005, the pharmaceutical company Sepracor of Marlborough, Massachusetts began marketing the active stereoisomer eszopiclone under the name Lunesta in the United States. This had the consequence of placing what is a generic drug in most of the world under patent control in the United States. Although it was expected to be available in generic form by 2010, no generic has become available there at present. However, <b>zopiclone</b> is currently available off-patent in a number of European countries, as well as Brazil, Canada, and Hong Kong. The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosagethe strongest eszopiclone derivative dosage contains 3mg of the therapeutic stereoisomer, whereas the highest <b>zopiclone</b> dosage (7.5mg) contains 3.75mg of the active stereoisomer. The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Diazepam was {{detected}} in 26% {{of cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs in Sweden, and its active metabolite nordazepam {{was detected}} in 28% of cases. Other benzodiazepines and zolpidem and <b>zopiclone</b> also were found in high numbers. Many drivers had blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines and zolpidem and <b>zopiclone.</b> In Northern Ireland in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who suffer}} from muscle {{weakness}} due to myasthenia gravis or have poor respiratory reserves due to severe chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or other lung disease, or have sleep apnoea cannot safely take <b>zopiclone,</b> nor can a patient with any untreated abnormality of the thyroid gland.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone,</b> {{similar to}} other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol consumption increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of randomized, controlled clinical trials which compared benzodiazepines against zaleplon or other Z-drugs such as zolpidem, <b>zopiclone,</b> and eszopiclone has found few clear and consistent differences between zaleplon and the benzodiazepines {{in terms of}} sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zopiclone</b> may be {{measured}} in blood, plasma, or urine by chromatographic methods. Plasma concentrations are typically less than 100 μg/l during therapeutic use, but frequently exceed 100 μg/l in automotive vehicle operators arrested for impaired driving ability and may exceed 1000 μg/l in acutely poisoned patients. Post mortem blood concentrations are usually {{in a range of}} 0.4-3.9mg/l in victims of fatal acute overdose.|$|E
25|$|Sonata (US) is {{manufactured}} by King Pharmaceuticals of Bristol, TN. Gedeon Richter Plc. manufactures zaleplon under {{the brand name}} Andante (RU). Starnoc has been discontinued in Canada but can be manufactured if a prescription is brought to a compounding pharmacy. It is prescribed rarely in the United Kingdom, with <b>zopiclone</b> being the preferred Z-drug by the National Health Service (NHS).|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon {{selectively}} binds {{with high}} efficacy to the benzodiazepine site (ω1) on the α1-containing GABA-A receptors which help produce the primary therapeutic hypnotic properties. The ultrashort half-life gives zaleplon a unique advantage over other hypnotics {{because of its}} lack of next-day residual effects on driving and other performance-related skills. Unlike nonselective benzodiazepine drugs and <b>zopiclone,</b> which distort the sleep pattern, zaleplon appears to induce sleep without disrupting the natural sleep architecture.|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{that may}} prove more {{effective}} and safer than benzodiazepines for insomnia {{is an area of}} active research. Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien), zaleplon, <b>zopiclone</b> (Imovane), and eszopiclone (Lunesta), are a class of hypnotic medications that are similar to benzodiazepines in their mechanism of action, and indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight, and they have similar—though potentially less severe—side effect profiles compared to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{is often}} {{recommended}} {{due to its}} long elimination half-life and also because of its availability in low potency doses. The non-benzodiazepine Z drugs such as zolpidem, zaleplon, and <b>zopiclone</b> {{should not be used}} as a replacement for benzodiazepines, as they have a similar mechanism of action and can induce a similar dependence. The pharmacological mechanism of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence is the internalization (removal) of receptor site in the brain and changes in gene transcription codes in the brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>zopiclone</b> {{in humans}} are stereoselective. After oral {{administration of the}} racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are {{higher than those of}} the respective antipodes.|$|E
25|$|Zaleplon, like zolpidem, <b>zopiclone,</b> or eszopiclone, are all {{specific}} agonists at the benzodiazepine GABAA α1 sub-receptor site. It also modulates the GABAA sub-sites, α2 and α3, to {{a lesser}} degree. It has no statistical significance as an anticonvulsant. However, as a pyrazolopyrimidine, zaleplon {{has served as a}} novel chemical platform from which new anxiolytics will hopefully arise. Much like zolpidem, as an imidazopyridine and also a full agonist at the GABAA α1 sub-receptor site, has been reviewed considerably with some novel contributions. See also: alpidem.|$|E
25|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of nondrug treatments for insomnia exist. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, such as <b>zopiclone,</b> offer few if any advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents such as the Melatonin receptor agonists may be more suitable and effective {{for the management of}} chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs remains to be determined.|$|E
