40|$|Abstract Galvanizing {{plant waste}} (<b>zinc</b> <b>dross)</b> {{containing}} 27. 66 % zinc was leached in HCl solutions. Zinc in solution was precipitated as Zn(OH) 2 by adding ammonium hydroxide. The product {{was characterized by}} atomic absorption spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, x-ray diffraction analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed that when heated at 500 oC, the product possesses hexagonal zincite structure. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that the shape of zinc oxide particles was spherical and compares well with the standard product. A maximum of 93. 7 % zinc contained in the dross could be extracted and converted to zinc oxide having a purity of 98. 8 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Simulation {{experiment}} {{was done to}} investigate the effects of rare earth on hot-dipped Zn- 55 %Al alloy coating. The {{results show that the}} rare earth has little effect on the <b>zinc</b> <b>dross</b> and its burning loss is about 10 %. The microstructure of coating {{is similar to that of}} solidification bath, and which is made up of phases of rich aluminum, rich zinc, rich silicon and rare earth, and intermetallic layer of Al-Zn-Fe-Si. The rare earth phase is needle or rod, and mainly distributed inside rich zinc phase and on the interface between the coating and steel substrate. The rare earth has no obvious influence on coating grain and spangle size. The appropriate addition of rare earth would be helpful to improve the coating bending formability and corrosion resistance...|$|E
40|$|Galvalume is a Continuous Galvanizing Line. InGalvalume the Zn-Al coating {{is done on}} the CR {{sheets to}} inprovetheir {{corrosion}} resistance and to improve their life. JSW IspatSteel Ltd. Kalmeshwar has to frequently replace the sink rollassembly used in Zn-Al tank of the Galvalume. The mean timebetween replacements is very less as compared to expected meantime between failures (expected MTBF). This is due to depositionof <b>zinc</b> <b>dross</b> {{on the surface of}} roller. This result in uneven orimproper Zn-Al coating on sheet surface. To avoid this sink rollhas to replace. The frequent replacement of roller assemblyresults in Stoppage of production, material loss, start-up loss andincreased cost of production. This paper proposes an alternativematerial to extend the life of sink roll and the thermal-spraycoating of various materials on traditionally used sink roll ofSS 316 L roll surface...|$|E
40|$|Zincor {{experienced}} significant {{losses of}} metallic <b>zinc</b> to <b>dross</b> during the melting of zinc cathode plates. In this study five factors affecting {{the formation of}} dross are identified from literature. Dross from both the plant and that produced in the laboratory is characterized using XRD. An empirical model, based on laboratory-scale investigations, was developed to quantify the effect these factors {{on their own or}} in combination with each other has on the amount of <b>zinc</b> loss to <b>dross.</b> The predictive capability of the model is evaluated based on the laboratory-scale investigations. Predictions are made on the effects that heat treating the cathode plates prior to melting, increasing the cathode plate thickness, washing and drying prior to melting, and loading the furnace in a controlled manner have on the amount of <b>zinc</b> loss to <b>dross...</b>|$|R
50|$|The oxygen {{flow rate}} during blowing for a three tonne {{capacity}} furnace is 20-30 Nm3/h. Zinc is initially oxidized to form a <b>zinc</b> oxide <b>dross</b> {{on the surface of}} the charge, but as lead oxide subsequently forms, a fluid slag of zinc and lead oxides is created. Most of the copper is removed at the same time as the lead. The final removal of copper to a level of 0.04% is undertaken at the end of the process by further additions of lead to collect the copper.|$|R
30|$|Concentration of zinc in {{storm water}} runoff with various others heavy metals ranged as zinc 0.008 – 0.720  mg l− 1, copper 0.001 – 0.079  mg l− 1, {{manganese}} 0.001 – 0.516  mg l− 1 and lead 0.003 – 0.010  mg l− 1, respectively (Asaf et al. 2004;Vijayaraghavan et al. 2008). Walker et al. 1999 characterized the urban runoff as zinc (0.0007 – 22.0  mg l− 1), copper (0.00006 – 1.41  mg l− 1) and lead (0.00057 – 26.0  mg l− 1). Zinc contamination in natural environment {{has been found}} in 985 sites out of 1, 662 national sites of priority risk identified by USEPA (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry 2005). Wastes containing zinc have been categorized as hazardous waste under the Basal convention and European Union (Agarwal et al. 2004). The secondary waste generated during the metallurgical operations, i.e., zinc ash, <b>zinc</b> <b>dross,</b> flux, flue dust from electric arc furnace, automobile junks and sludge, contains very high amount of zinc in the form of some sort of compound or derivatives.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{manufacturing}} {{transmission line}} tower parts has being generated hazardous waste which is required proper {{disposal of waste}} for protection of land pollution. Manufacturing Process in the manufacturing of steel angle, plates, pipes, channels are passes through conventional, semi automatic and CNC machines for cutting, marking, punching, drilling, notching, bending operations. All fabricated material Coated with thin layer of Zinc in Galvanizing plant where molten zinc is used for coating. Prior to Galvanizing, chemical like 33 % concentrated HCl Acid, ammonium chloride and d-oil being used for pretreatment of iron. The bath of water with sodium dichromate is used for cooling and protection of the galvanized steel. For the heating purpose the furnace oil burners are used. These above process the <b>Zinc</b> <b>dross,</b> Zinc ash, ETP sludge and waste pickled acid generated as hazardous waste. The RPG has made captive secured land fill site, since 1997 since then it was using for disposal of hazardous waste after completion of SLF (Secured land fill) site. The RPG has raised height from ground level then now it is being used for disposal of waste as he designed the SLF after in creasing height of from GL it is functional without leach ate or adverse impacts in the environment...|$|E
