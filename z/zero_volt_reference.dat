40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{analytical}} {{performance and}} a suggested mechanism for <b>zero</b> <b>volt</b> paper spray using chromatography paper are presented. A spray {{is generated by}} the action of the pneumatic force of the mass spectrometer (MS) vacuum at the inlet. Positive and negative ion signals are observed, and comparisons are made with standard kV paper spray (PS) ionization and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI). While the range of analytes to which <b>zero</b> <b>volt</b> PS is applicable is very similar to kV PS and nESI, differences in the mass spectra of mixtures are interpreted in terms of the more significant effects of analyte surface activity in the gentler <b>zero</b> <b>volt</b> experiment than in the other methods due to the significantly lower charge. The signal intensity of <b>zero</b> <b>volt</b> PS is also lower than in the other methods. A Monte Carlo simulation based on statistical fluctuation of positive and negative ions in solution has been implemented to explain the production of ions from initially uncharged droplets.

A tri-level sync pulse is a signal that initially goes from 0 volts DC to a negative voltage, then a positive voltage, before returning to <b>zero</b> <b>volts</b> DC again. The voltage excursions are typically 300 mV either side of <b>zero</b> <b>volts,</b> and the duration each of the two excursions is the same as a particular number of digital picture samples.|$|R

For example, the LTC6702, MAX9021 and MAX9031 have internal hysteresis desensitizing them from input noise. In place of one switching point, hysteresis introduces two: one for rising voltages, and one for falling voltages. The difference between the higher-level trip value (VTRIP+) and the lower-level trip value (VTRIP-) equals the hysteresis voltage (VHYST).|$|R

40|$|Preparative mass {{spectrometry}} was traditionally a vacuum based experiment where mass selected ion beams were deposited onto surfaces; however, recently ions have been manipulated {{in the open}} air to perform accelerated synthesis. The work of this dissertation focuses on the generation of charged ions from microdroplets and their use in organic synthesis and the preparation of atomically precise metal nanoclusters. First the mechanism for charging in the <b>zero</b> <b>volt</b> paper spray will be presented. This works builds a computational model based on the statistical fluctuation of positive and negative charges based on the theory of Dodd. It is found through experiment and simulation that in <b>zero</b> <b>volt</b> paper spray and presumably other <b>zero</b> <b>volt</b> methods the most surface active species are preferentially ionized. ^ Charged microdroplets are exploited in this dissertation for two very different applications but in seemingly similar ways. First metal salts are electrosprayed, heated, and subjected to harsh in-source conditions to cause the reduction of the metal salts into atomically precise metal clusters. This method is capable of producing atomically precise silver cluster cations and anions as well as bimetallic silver-palladium complexes. Microdroplets are also exploited to screen chemical pathways to common pharmaceutical including atropine and diphenhydramine. The two step synthesis of diphenhydramine from benzhydrol was performed in charged microdroplets and confirmed in microfluidics. While the fundamental mechanism of reaction in microdroplets and microfluidics might differ useful connections were found in the cases of atropine, diphenhydramine, and diazepam. It is envisioned that this methodology could impact drug discovery as a rapid platform for the screening of chemical pathways to both old and new molecules. The droplet reaction was extended to a “super reagent” form where a reagent of choice is sprayed onto a variety of substrate contained in a well plate or on paper. This method allows for rapid screening with hopes of screening 1000 ’s of reaction conditions per hour. ...|$|R
