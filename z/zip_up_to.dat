50|$|Goggle jackets are {{a hooded}} {{windproof}} type jacket released in 1988 made by C.P. Company for the sponsoring of Mille Miglia and open car endurance race and became popular across Europe and in Britain. They <b>zip</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> cover {{the head and}} face completely, except for two built-in goggles, sometimes covered with transparent mesh or various lenses and sometimes including a mesh mouth area for ease of breathing.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{features}} 10 levels {{which are}} introduced in increasing difficulty: Punish the Evil Merchant, Deliver the Secret Message, Rescue the Captive Ninja, Cross the Checkpoint, Execute the Corrupt Minister, Infiltrate the Manji Cult, Destroy the Foreign Pirate, Cure the Princess, Reclaim the Castle and Free the Princess. All of the levels {{take place at}} night {{to compensate for the}} technical limitations of the PlayStation; the game's high rate of redraw is reduced by setting events at night and reducing the distance the player can see. Both characters are armed with a grappling hook which allows them to <b>zip</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the tops of buildings and move freely across rooftops, which gave the game a sense of verticality that was rare among most action/adventure games of the time. Many bosses react differently to the two ninja based on their genders, highlighting the social attitudes at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Afterwards, Lex Luthor and Captain Cold were {{accepted}} onto the team. An incident involving Batman's son, Damian Wayne, during the [...] "Robin Rises Alpha & Omega" [...] story arc in Batman {{led up to}} most of the justice League battling against Glorious Godfrey and a Parademon horde from Apokolips when they captured the chaos shard and the sarcophagus of Damian and later fled back home. All the league members present, Cyborg included, state to an adamant Bruce Wayne that running headlong into unmarked X-factor territory for a suicide mission was less than ideal considering the consequences that could befall earth. This all boils over, eventually culminating with Batman hijacking Cyborg's teleportation systems to <b>zip</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Watchtower in an attempt to retrieve an experimental and highly dangerous combat suit in order to mete out his agenda; But Cyborg manages to block his administrative access so that he, Shazam, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Lex and Cold could physically restrain him, causing Batman to begrudgingly give up and retire to the batcave.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to medication, {{it is wise}} to secure the sleeper's environment in preparation for episodes by removing potentially dangerous objects from the bedroom and either place a cushion round the bed or moving the mattress to the floor for added protection against injuries. Some extreme sufferers sleep in a sleeping bag <b>zipped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their neck, and wear mittens so they can't unzip it until they awake in the morning.|$|R
50|$|During {{a weekly}} school {{assembly}} on Monday on March 15, 2010, more than 1,600 students at National Tainan Girls' Senior High School took off their long pants and revealed the shorts underneath {{at the school}} assembly on Monday to protest against the school's new regulation banning students from wearing sports shorts.The new regulation was suggested by a disciplinary teacher, surname Chen, who had just joined the school this term. She stopped students from wearing sports shorts outside physical education classes and required their sports jackets <b>to</b> be <b>zipped</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the second buttons of their shirts. The new regulations were implemented before calling {{a meeting with the}} school representatives.|$|R
40|$|We utilize {{structurally}} targeted peptides {{to identify}} a “tC fusion switch” inherent to the coil domains of the neuronal t-SNARE that pairs with the cognate v-SNARE. The tC fusion switch {{is located in the}} membrane-proximal portion of the t-SNARE and controls {{the rate at which the}} helical bundle that forms the SNAREpin can <b>zip</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> drive bilayer fusion. When the fusion switch is “off” (the intrinsic state of the t-SNARE), zippering of the helices from their membrane-distal ends is impeded and fusion is slow. When the tC fusion switch is “on,” fusion is much faster. The tC fusion switch can be thrown by a peptide that corresponds to the membrane-proximal half of the cognate v-SNARE, and binds reversibly to the cognate region of the t-SNARE. This structures the coil in the membrane-proximal domain of the t-SNARE and accelerates fusion, implying that the intrinsically unstable coil in that region is a natural impediment to the completion of zippering, and thus, fusion. Proteins that stabilize or destabilize one or the other state of the tC fusion switch would exert fine temporal control over the rate of fusion after SNAREs have already partly zippered up...|$|E

50|$|Sleepsacks are {{a type of}} bondage (BDSM) gear. Sleepsacks are {{primarily}} used to confine a person comfortably {{for an extended period}} of time. Similar to a conventional sleeping bag, a person climbs into a sleepsack and is usually <b>zipped</b> into it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> their neck. Generally sleepsacks are very tight on the body, adding to the bondage aspect of the experience.|$|R
50|$|Winzip 15.5 (April 2011): New {{compression}} algorithms {{designed for}} multi-processor systems that <b>zip</b> files <b>up</b> <b>to</b> twice as fast, new WinZip Desktop Gadget option called 'Folder I Choose' {{that allows you}} to create or select a target folder for zipping/unzipping files on a case-by-case basis, dynamic, context-sensitive icons that automatically change to reflect the WinZip tasks available to your specific situation, streamlined processes that remove unnecessary dialogs and cut down on extra steps, the ability to show/hide the Address bar, the ability to instantly jump between any instances of WinZip that you currently have open, the ability to customize {{the look and feel of}} your WinZip interface with interchangeable themes, improved destination folder management, so when you open/alter a zipped file's contents directly from an email attachment, WinZip will prompt you to save your work to a new location on your computer (rather than the email temp folder), streamlined 'Unzip and Try' processes that remove extra steps, making temporary viewing even quicker and easier, extended enterprise support that provides IT control over the addition/alteration of e-mail services.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] {{appeared}} {{as though it}} would flop, as months went by without any radio airplay or sales activity. Not until the song became a disco favorite in New York did Top 40 radio finally {{pick up on the}} song, leading the record to finally enter the Hot 100 and <b>zip</b> <b>up</b> the chart <b>to</b> number-one the week of July 6, 1974, in only its seventh week on the chart (and fourth week in the Top 40). The record also reached the top-ten in the United Kingdom. [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] {{is considered one of the}} earliest disco songs. Some authorities proclaim it to be the first disco song to hit number-one, while others give that distinction to [...] "Love's Theme" [...] by Love Unlimited Orchestra, a chart-topper from earlier in 1974. The song became a gold record. It is a heavy airplay favorite on oldie and adult contemporary stations today.|$|R
5000|$|Accuracy: The {{degree of}} {{conformity}} of {{a measure to}} a standard or a true value - see also Accuracy and precision. Accuracy {{is very hard to}} achieve through data-cleansing in the general case, because it requires accessing an external source of data that contains the true value: such [...] "gold standard" [...] data is often unavailable. Accuracy has been achieved in some cleansing contexts, notably customer contact data, by using external databases that match <b>up</b> <b>zip</b> codes <b>to</b> geographical locations (city and state), and also help verify that street addresses within these zip codes actually exist.|$|R

50|$|One {{newspaper}} {{advertisement for}} management trainees asked: 'Will curls come in? Will maxis make it?' However, the stores {{never really got}} to grips with sixties boutique culture. Author Margret Geraghty who worked {{there for a while}} in the late sixties remembers that all the sales staff had to wear nylon uniforms: 'They were cerise with a <b>zip</b> <b>up</b> the front. Forget dolly birds. They looked more like canteen assistants.' There were also blue nylon ones with zips down the back and turtle neck with bow, which were exceptionally hard <b>to</b> <b>zip</b> <b>up,</b> and the assistants used to have <b>to</b> <b>zip</b> each other <b>up.</b> The exception was the store manageress, who was permitted to wear her own clothes.|$|R
