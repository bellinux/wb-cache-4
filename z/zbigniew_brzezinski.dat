Geopolithically, nowadays Russia has great difficulties {{when it comes to}} demography, because of the decrease of birth rate, to the poor demographic density, low life expectancy and its population’s precarious general health state. All the same, nowadays Russia is the richest country in the world. Based on these considerations, the authors consider that Rusia could become a true super-power (according to <b>Zbigniew</b> <b>Brzezinski’s</b> considerations) only if it will solve its demographical problems and will build a Western-style army and economy, based on its huge economic resources...|$|R

The policy of aiding the mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation was originally proposed by Carter's national security adviser <b>Zbigniew</b> <b>Brzezinski</b> and was implemented by U.S. intelligence services.

25|$|Nations such as France, Russia and the United Kingdom are {{generally}} considered to be great powers due to their military and strategic importance, their status as recognised nuclear powers and also their permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Some academics also believe that Germany and Japan are great powers, but due to their large advanced economies and global influence as opposed to military and strategic capabilities. Italy also has seen much discussion among academics and commentators regarding its status as a great power, particularly for its position in the G7 and the nation's influence in regional and international organisations. Although broad academic support for India as a great power is uncommon, recent years have seen some in the field of political science, such as Malik Mohan (2011) and Dr. <b>Zbigniew</b> <b>Brzezinski</b> (2012) put forward the assertion that India holds the status of a great power.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new centres of power in Eurasia has entailed a re-reading of <b>Zbigniew</b> <b>Brzezinski's</b> book which drew an analogy between the Eurasian supercontinent and a grand chessboard. Following the global financial crisis {{of the last few}} years, countries like China, Russia and India have started to project greater global political and economic influence. Eventually, Eurasia has become a geopolitical symbol signifying a multipolar world order unlike fifteen years ago when Brzezinski wrote his book in a world dominated by the US superpower. The changes in the geopolitical meaning of Eurasia have also been very important for Turkey for a number of reasons. First, it is a country that is strategically located at the meeting point of Europe and Asia. Second, its economy has grown at an impressive rate throughout the 2000 s turning it into a rising Eurasian power. Third, its multi-dimensional foreign policy approach in the last decade has enabled it to develop closer relations with the Eurasian states...|$|R

Friedrich & <b>Zbigniew</b> K. <b>Brzezinski,</b> as well as Juan J. Linz and Alfred Stepan's theory of post-totalitarianism. This discussion of the theory results in a checklist, which serves as a guideline for the assessment of 35 monographs on Soviet history published between 1990 and 2009...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis Modern Dystopias and Theories of Totalitarianism {{deals with}} {{comparation}} of this two phenomena. The thesis {{is based on}} the concept of Giovanni Sartori. He understands the phenomenon of totalitarianism as ideal ending of the axis totalitarianism- democracy. Extreme points of this axis fulfill the role of unrealizable ideal regimes. In reality we can only move closer to them but modern dystopias may represent these ideal regimes. The diploma thesis is divided into theoretical and practical section. There is the analyse of five books in the theoretical section which deal with the theory of totalitarianism. The analysis contains the work of Sigmund Neumann, Hannah Arendt, Carl J. Friedrich and <b>Zbigniew</b> K. <b>Brzeziński,</b> Giovanni Sartori and Juan J. Linz. Each theory of totalitarianism is supplemented by reflection from other authors. There is the analyse of five dystopias (J. Zamjatin - We, A. Huxley - Brave New World, G. Orwell - Nineteen Eighty-four, M. Atwood - The Handmaid`s Tale, A. Moore, D. Lloyd - V for Vendetta) in the practical section. The analysis contains the storyline of the book, elements of totalitarian regime in the dystopia and inspiration of author for the world of dystopia.

The United States stopped all grain export to the Soviet Union and persuaded US athletes not to enter the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow. The Soviet Union responded by boycotting the next Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles. The détente policy collapsed. When Ronald Reagan succeeded Carter as US president in 1981, he promised a sharp increase in US defense spending and a more aggressively anti-Soviet foreign policy. This caused alarm in Moscow, with the Soviet media accusing him of [...] "warmongering" [...] and [...] "mistakenly believing that stepping up the arms race will bring peace to the world".
