50|$|In birds, <b>Z-chromosome</b> genes {{have the}} highest {{variability}}. This {{may be due to}} the fact that the <b>Z-chromosome</b> has the lowest gene density.

50|$|The marked {{difference}} {{between male and}} female chicks is due to gene dosage of the sex-linked barring gene ('barring' (B), 'nonbarring' (b+)). This gene is located on the <b>Z-Chromosome</b> of birds. Birds have different sex-chromosomes (Z and w) and a different sex-determination system compared to mammals (X and Y). Male birds have therefore two Z-chromosomes while female birds have a Z- and a dwarfed w-chromosome. This means that phenotypically barred roosters can either have the B/B or the B/b+ genotype, while a barred hen always has to have a B/- genotype. The colour-sexing of Legbar chicks, however, is only possible because the male chicks have a double dose of the sex-linked barring gene (genoype B/B), while the female chicks only have a single dose (genoype B/-), resulting in the observed down colours.|$|E

The parents and full-sib offspring were genotyped for 17 markers on the <b>Z-chromosome.</b> Phenotypic data were only available for grandoffspring. Only the segregation of male chromosomes provides information {{on the presence of}} genes, and therefore, a half-sib interval mapping approach was used.

40|$|With female heterogamety, {{the primary}} sex ratio is {{determined}} at the first meiotic division shortly before ovulation, in birds. Up to now, {{there is no evidence}} of any physiological mechanism leading to hatching sex ratio deviations. The primary follicles in prophase I are already supplied with considerable amounts of yolk and chromosomal segregation distortion appears to be highly constrained by the mechanism of meiotic division. Also, genetic interests of gametes strongly oppose any maternal attempt at control of the sex ratio. Hence, sex ratio manipulation by preferential ovulation of Z- or W-ova is argued to be implausible. More probably, to avoid any further loss of investment, sex ratio adjustment should take place early after ovulation and fertilisation via sex-specific termination of embryonic development before initiation of egg shell formation. I suggest that the widely reported influence of the position within the egg laying sequence on offspring sex could potentially serve as an explanation for a wide range of sex ratio effects found in birds. The sequence effect, in turn, might be caused by changes in concentrations of yolk testosterone over the laying sequence. This effect could be sex-specific if non-dosage compensated gene products of <b>Z-chromosomes</b> counteracted any adverse effects on embryonic survival of deviating testosterone levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Atlas flycatcher (Ficedula speculigera) is {{a poorly}} studied species in an {{otherwise}} thoroughly studied species complex. In this study I attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this species, I look for possible traces of introgression, I test whether there is contrasting patterns of polymorphism and divergence at autosomal and Z-linked genes as {{has been found in}} other flycatcher species, and finally whether the Atlas flycatcher show reduced genetic variation which would be expected due to recent habitat fragmentation. To address these problems I used multilocus sequence analysis, with loci from both autosomes and <b>Z-chromosomes,</b> and compared these with previously published sequences from two other species, the pied flycatcher (F. hypoleuca) and the collared flycatcher (F. albicollis). Finally, phenotypic measures of the Atlas flycatcher were compared with measures of these other two species. The results appear consistent with a scenario in which an ancestral flycatcher species became isolated in different refugia, presumably around the Mediterranean Sea, {{at the onset of the}} Pleistocene glaciations and diverged into the present species. I found no traces of introgression between the Atlas flycatcher and any of the two other species. Further, the Atlas flycatcher showed reduced variation at Z-linked loci compared to autosomal loci, which may indicate a complex demographic history or possibly selection. The Atlas flycatcher also showed high variation compared to the other two species, and therefore seems to have a rather large effective population size...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} traffic of male-biased genes {{out of the}} mammalian and Drosophila X-chromosomes, {{and there are also}} reports of an under-representation of male-biased genes on the X. This may reflect an adaptive process driven by natural selection where an autosomal location of male-biased genes is favored since male genes are only exposed to selection one-third of the time when X-linked. However, there are several alternative explanations to “out-of-the-X” gene movement, including mutational bias and a means for X-linked genes to escape meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis. As a critical test of the hypothesis that genomic relocation of sex-biased genes is an adaptive process, I examined the emergence, and loss, of genes on the chicken <b>Z-chromosome,</b> i. e., a female heterogametic system (males ZZ, females ZW). Here, the analogous prediction would be an emergence of male-biased genes onto, not a loss from, the <b>Z-chromosome</b> because Z is found more often in males than autosomes are. I found that genes expressed in testis but not in ovary are highly over-represented among genes that have emerged on the <b>Z-chromosome</b> during avian evolution. Moreover, genes with male-biased expression are similarly over-represented among new Z-chromosomal genes. Interestingly, genes with female-biased expression have more often moved from than to the <b>Z-chromosome.</b> These observations show that male and female heterogametic organisms display opposing directionalities in the emergence and loss of sex-biased genes on sex chromosomes. This is consistent with theoretical models on the evolution of sexually antagonistic genes in which new mutations are at least partly dominant...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a new methodical {{approach}} for the molecular {{analysis of the}} lepidopteran Z chromosome. The <b>Z-chromosome</b> DNA was collected from male mitotic spermatogonial cells of the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) by laser microdissection and then amplified by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR). Products of DOP-PCR were used to prepare painting probes and create a <b>Z-chromosome</b> DNA sequence library. Specificity of painting probes was tested on spread chromosomal preparations from testes and ovaries of the codling moth larvae using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). However, all painting probes made exhibited a low specificity for the Z chromosome: they hybridized evenly to all chromosomes in male preparations, whereas in female preparations highlighted almost the entire W chromosome. For construction of the <b>Z-chromosome</b> DNA library, DOP-PCR-generated DNA fragments were cloned, sequenced and further analyzed. A total of 30 different sequences were obtained. Only four of the sequences exhibited a significant homology to sequences in GenBank, all other represent unknown sequences. Five sequences were characterized by Southern hybridization.

We employed a genome-wide multilocus approach to examine the sexual differences in population subdivision, natural selection and linkage disequilibrium (LD) in a wild Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus) population, using genotypes at a total of 107 autosomal and Z-chromosomal microsatellites. Results: Mean observed heterozygosity was significantly higher in females (HO = 0. 567) than in males (HO = 0. 532), and autosomal markers (HO = 0. 561) were more variable than Z-chromosomal markers (HO = 0. 512). Genetic differentiation (FST = 0. 002, P < 0. 05) between the two sexes was low but significant and males were on average significantly more genetically related to each other than females. Genomescan analyses revealed that 3 out of 101 (3 %) autosomal loci were under directional selection, while 4 out of 6 (67 %) Z-chromosomal markers were indicated to be under balancing selection. This suggests a significantly greater but contrasting selection force on the <b>Z-chromosome</b> in comparison to autosomes, which is consistent with an overall significantly (P < 0. 05) lower FSTvalue for Z-chromosomal (- 0. 014, 95 % CI:- 0. 025 [...] 0. 011) than for the autosomal loci (0. 003, 95 % CI: 0. 001 - 0. 004). Analysis of syntenic marker pairs revealed high levels of LD in both sexes but significantly (P < 0. 05) lower levels of LD in the females both on autosomes and <b>Z-chromosome,</b> probably due to the higher rate of dispersal and the higher recombination rates on autosomes, as well as the pseudoautosomal markers. In both sexes LD decayed rapidly with genetic distance in a similar fashion on autosomes, while a more rapid decay of LD in <b>Z-chromosome</b> was detected in females than in males. Conclusion: We conclude that there are many clear differences in genomic architecture between the sexes studied here which can be at least partly understood in the light of higher dispersal rate of females as compared to males and the unusual structure of the <b>Z-chromosome</b> of the species...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{different}} genetic {{tools are}} used to investigate pre- and postzygotic barriers to gene exchange and their role in speciation in the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) and the collared flycatcher (F. albicollis). This species complex consists of four genetically distinct clades that apparently diverged in allopatry (I). Sequencing of introns from autosomal and Z-linked genes from the two species reveals signs of selection on the <b>Z-chromosome.</b> Sexual selection acting on Z-linked genes might explain this pattern (II). By using large-scale genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), introgression is observed at autosomal- but not Z-linked loci, mostly from the pied- to the collared flycatcher. Male plumage characters and genes involved in hybrid fitness are largely mapped to the <b>Z-chromosome</b> (III). By studying mate choice of female hybrids I {{show that there is}} a link between female preferences and the Z chromosome (IV). The rate of introgression in island versus clinal hybrid zones is consistent with regional differences in hybrid fertility. Asymmetric gene flow from allopatry on the islands may oppose reinforcement, leading to introgression and a partial breakdown of postzygotic isolation. Adaptive introgression may explain the high rate of introgression observed at one of the genetic markers (V). For late breeding female collared flycatchers it appears to be adaptive to use pied flycatchers as social fathers but conspecific males as genetic fathers. Additionally, females in mixed species pairs may reduce hybridization costs by producing an excess of male hybrid offspring that are more fertile than females (VI). In conclusion, the <b>Z-chromosome</b> appears {{to play a major role}} in flycatcher speciation. Sexual selection and reinforcement are important mechanisms in the divergence of these birds. However, gene flow from allopatry, introgression of adaptive genes and adaptive hetrospecific pairing by late breeding collared flycatcher females may work in the opposite direction...|$|E

Forty-six percent of one arm of a female's <b>Z-chromosome</b> had been translocated to a mi-crochromosome (Z-micro) by irradiation of semen. The break was 23 crossover units distal to the late feathering (K) locus. The barring (B) locus on the non-broken arm assorted almost independently of the Z-micro segment. Semen from eight sons of this Z-micro female was used to inseminate 98 dwarf (dw) broiler-type females. From karyotypes of 147 male and 149 female progeny, we identified 69 males heterozygous and 79 females hemizygous for Z-micro. Body weight of 43 males heterozygous for Z-micro was significantly {{greater than that of}} 45 normal Z paternal half-brothers at all ages from 2 to 24 weeks.

40|$|While {{behavioral}} {{sex differences}} have repeatedly been reported across taxa, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms {{in the brain}} are mostly lacking. Birds have previously shown to have only limited dosage compensation, leading to high sex bias of <b>Z-chromosome</b> gene expression. In chickens, a male hyper-methylated region (MHM) on the <b>Z-chromosome</b> {{has been associated with}} a local type of dosage compensation, but a more detailed characterization of the avian methylome is limiting our interpretations. Here we report an analysis of genome wide sex differences in promoter DNA-methylation and gene expression in the brain of three weeks old chickens, and associated sex differences in behavior of Red Junglefowl (ancestor of domestic chickens). Combining DNA-methylation tiling arrays with gene expression microarrays we show that a specific locus of the MHM region, together with the promoter for the zinc finger RNA binding protein (ZFR) gene on chromosome 1, is strongly associated with sex dimorphism in gene expression. Except for this, we found few differences in promoter DNA-methylation, even though hundreds of genes were robustly differentially expressed across distantly related breeds. Several of the differentially expressed genes are known to affect behavior, and as suggested from their functional annotation, we found that female Red Junglefowl are more explorative and fearful in a range of tests performed throughout their lives. This paper identifies new sites and, with increased resolution, confirms known sites where DNA-methylation seems to affect sexually dimorphic gene expression, but the general lack of this association is noticeable and strengthens the view that birds do not have dosage compensation...|$|E

Here, we review recent research on processes of speciation, based on studies in hybrid zones between collared (Ficedula albicollis) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). A major advantage of this study system is that questions concerning all three major sources of reproductive isolation and their interconnections can be addressed. We conclude that (i) ecological divergence is caused by divergence in life-history traits, (ii) females prefer mates of their own species based on differences in both plumage and song characteristics, (iii) male plumage characteristics have diverged but their song has converged in sympatry, (iv) there is genetic incompatibility in accordance with Haldane's rule, and (v) the <b>Z-chromosome</b> {{appears to be a}} hotspot for genes involved in sexual isolation and genetic incompatibility.

Results From the 15982 significantly expressed coding regions that have been assigned to either the autosomes or the Z chromosome (12979 in brain, 13301 in gonad, and 12372 in heart), roughly 18 % were significantly sex-biased in any one tissue, though only 4 gene targets were biased in all tissues. The gonad was the most sex-biased tissue, followed by the brain. Sex-biased autosomal genes tended to be expressed at lower levels and in fewer tissues than unbiased gene targets, and autosomal somatic sex-biased genes had more expression noise than similar unbiased genes. Sex-biased genes linked to the <b>Z-chromosome</b> showed reduced expression in females, but not in males, when compared to unbiased Z-linked genes, and sex-biased Z-linked genes were also expressed in fewer tissues than unbiased Z coding regions. Third position GC content, and codon usage bias showed some sex-biased effects, primarily for autosomal genes expressed in the gonad.

40|$|Background: The {{chromosome}} {{characteristics of}} the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, have received little attention, despite the scientific importance of this species. This study presents the characterization of chromosomes in this species by means of cytogenetic analysis and linkage mapping. Methodology/Principal Findings: Physical genomic features in the butterfly B. anynana were examined by karyotype analysis and construction of a linkage map. Lepidoptera possess a female heterogametic W-Z sex chromosome system. The WZ-bivalent in pachytene oocytes of B. anynana consists of an abnormally small, heterochromatic W-chromosome with the <b>Z-chromosome</b> wrapped around it. Accordingly, the W-body in interphase nuclei is much smaller than usual in Lepidoptera. This suggests an intermediate stage {{in the process of}} secondary loss of the W-chromosome to a ZZ/Z sex determination system. Two nucleoli are present in the pachytene stage associated with an autosome and the WZ-bivalent respectively. Chromosome counts confirmed a haploid number of n = 28. Linkage mapping had to take account of absence of crossingover in females, and of our use of a full-sib crossing design. We developed a new method to determine and exclude the non-recombinant uninformative female inherited component in offspring. The linkage map was constructed using a novel approach that uses exclusively JOINMAP-software for Lepidoptera linkage mapping. This approach simplifies the mapping procedure, avoids over-estimation of mapping distance and increases the reliability of relative marker positions. A total o...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough the sex-determining {{genes are}} known in mammals, Drosophila, and C. elegans, {{little is known}} in other animals. Fishes are an {{attractive}} group of organisms for studying the evolution of sex determination because they show an amazing variety of mechanisms, ranging from environmental sex determination and different forms of hermaphroditism to classical sex chromosomal XX/XY or WZ/ZZ systems and modifications thereof. In the fish medaka, dmrt 1 b(Y) has recently been found [1, 2] to be the candidate male sex-determining gene. It is a duplicate of the autosomal dmrt 1 a gene, a gene acting in the sex determination/differentiation cascade of flies, worms, and mammals. Because in birds dmrt 1 {{is located on the}} <b>Z-chromosome</b> [3], both findings led to the suggestion that dmrt 1 b(Y) is a “non-mammalian Sry” with an even more widespread distribution. However, although Sry was found to be the male sex-determining gene in the mouse and some other mammalian species, in some it is absent [4] and has obviously been replaced by other genes that now fulfil the same function. We have asked if the same might be true of the dmrt 1 b(Y) gene. We find that the gene duplication generating dmrt 1 b(Y) occurred recently during the evolution of the genus Oryzias. The gene is absent from all other fish species studied. Therefore, {{it may not be the}} male-sex determining gene in all fishes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Fertility, {{hatchability}} and embryo viability {{were compared}} in eggs fertilized by 20 second-generation males heterozygous for a translocation involving {{a segment of}} the <b>Z-chromosome</b> translocated to a micro-chromosome (Z-micro) and 20 of their normal half-brothers. Fertility was not affected by the Z-micro translocation; however, in all mating comparisons, hatchability was reduced approximately 50 % in fertile eggs produced by either males or females carrying the Z-micro translocation. Approximately 80 % of all embryonic deaths occurred prior to Day 4 of incubation in matings involving Z-micro carrier parents. However, embryo deaths from matings involving normal parents occur later and fit the normal bimodal distribution with peaks at 4 and 19 days of incubation. In the matings of males heterozygous for Z-micro with Z-micro females, hatchability of fertile eggs was reduced nearly 70 %. Of 171 offspring, 20 males were homozygous for and 69 males were heterozygous for Z-micro, while 37 females were carriers and 45 were normal. Even though the sex ratio was normal, the distribution significantly deviated from the expected 1 : 1 : 1 : 1. Four males homozygous for Z-micro were mated to 40 commercial Leghorn type females. Fertility was 89. 9 ± 9. 2 % and hatchability of fertile eggs was 79. 4 ± 5. 7 % from these matings. These figures were essentially normal...|$|E
40|$|The {{mapping of}} genealogical {{relationships}} between individuals, populations, subspecies and species {{is important for}} studies of evolutionary processes and biodiversity, and for conservation decisions. In this thesis, I have used several different types of molecular markers to investigate neutral genetic variation and structure at the population, subspecies and species level in three bird species or species complexes distributed in arctic and temperate regions; snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and redpoll (Carduelis flammea,C. cabaret,C. hornemanni). In addition to providing knowledge on evolutionary processes shaping genetic patterns, the analyses have implications for conservational decisions for the studied species living in the arctic environment where climatic changes may have severe impacts. I found low levels of genetic structure in all investigated groups. Snowy owls from three well separated geographic regions were analyzed with two mtDNA genes and two <b>Z-chromosome</b> introns {{and they seemed to}} constitute one panmictic population. The species was also relatively genetically diverse compared to three other owl species breeding in temperate regions. The pattern found with four genetic markers (mtDNA control region, a <b>Z-chromosome</b> intron, microsatellites and AFLPs) among dunlin populations in Western Palearctic and East Greenland did not correspond to the four subspecies recognized in the area. Rather, dunlins in this area form two genetically monophyletic groups that are geographically overlapping, and the resulting pattern is isolation by distance. Declining and fragmented dunlin populations of the subspecies southern dunlin (C. a. schinzii) were not genetically deprived compared to vital populations in more continuous habitats. Nor was the isolated dunlin population on Svalbard, this population was genetically similar to populations on East Greenland, Iceland and around the Baltic Sea. The three redpoll species were exceptionally little differentiated in mtDNA control region sequences and microsatellites. The low level of genetic structure in dunlins and redpolls is surprising considering their taxonomic status. Recent divergence of morphological characters or ongoing gene flow may explain the patterns found in both species. I suggest that the clinal variation described illustrates a more common pattern than is normally acknowledged in avian systematics, and that conservation politics may benefit from taking these patterns into consideration instead of being constrained to categorical thinking. This is important in today’s situation of declining population sizes and threatened species in an increasing number of areas and habitats.

40|$|Identification {{of genes}} {{involved}} in reproductive isolation opens novel ways to investigate links between {{stages of the}} speciation process. Are the genes coding for ecological adaptations and sexual isolation the same that eventually lead to hybrid sterility and inviability? We review the role of sex-linked genes {{at different stages of}} speciation based on four main differences between sex chromosomes and autosomes; (1) relative speed of evolution, (2) non-random accumulation of genes, (3) exposure of incompatible recessive genes in hybrids and (4) recombination rate. At early stages of population divergence ecological differences appear mainly determined by autosomal genes, but fast-evolving sex-linked genes are likely {{to play an important role}} for the evolution of sexual isolation by coding for traits with sex-specific fitness effects (for example, primary and secondary sexual traits). Empirical evidence supports this expectation but mainly in female-heterogametic taxa. By contrast, there is clear evidence for both strong X- and Z-linkage of hybrid sterility and inviability at later stages of speciation. Hence genes coding for sexual isolation traits are more likely to eventually cause hybrid sterility when they are sex-linked. We conclude that the link between sexual isolation and evolution of hybrid sterility is more intuitive in male-heterogametic taxa because recessive sexually antag-onistic genes are expected to quickly accumulate on the X-chromosome. However, the broader range of sexual traits that are expected to accumulate on the <b>Z-chromosome</b> may facilitate adaptive speciation in female-heterogametic spe-cies by allowing male signals and female preferences to remain in linkage disequilibrium despite periods of gene flow...|$|E
40|$|The Semi-collared flycatcher (Ficedula semitorquata) is {{a member}} of the {{black-and-white}} flycatcher species complex. It is poorly studied, rare, and is currently classified as “near threatened”, in the IUCN red lists of threatened species. The Semi-collared flycatcher has a patchy distribution in Europe and part of the Middle East. In this study, I analyzed sequence variation at nuclear loci of Semi-collared flycatchers, and compared the patterns found with those of three other black-and-white flycatcher species, the Pied (F. hypoleuca), Collared (F. albicollis) and Atlas flycatchers (F. speculigera). Genetic variation was found to be relatively high, compared to the other three flycatcher species and there were no signs of inbreeding. All four flycatcher species had less variation at Z-linked loci compared to autosomal loci. A comparison showed that all species combinations had fewer shared polymorphisms and more fixed substitutions at Z-linked than at autosomal loci. Selective sweeps on the <b>Z-chromosome</b> during the evolutionary history of these species is likely to have contributed to this pattern. A mismatch distribution showed signs of a recent population expansion in all four species, and a phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed a relatively deep split and that each species is monophyletic. This study supports the classification of the Semi-collared flycatcher as a separate species. Even though no signs of a small population size are found here, it is important to keep monitoring this bird, since it has gone through several declines across Europe during the last decades. Much of the decline is probably due to habitat destruction, so it is important to retain old forest in the habitat of the species...|$|E

40|$|Amplified {{fragment}} length polymorphisms (AFLP) are dominant markers {{frequently used}} to build linkage maps where heterozygosity could be inferred by a backcross breeding strategy. In the present study, we describe the utilization of an unmanipulated great reed warbler, Acrocephalus arundinaceus pedigree to infer heterozygous genotypes of AFLP markers in order to map these markers to a partial linkage map previously based on microsatellites. In total, 50 of the 83 autosomal AFLPs (60 %) and 4 of 5 Z-linked AFLPs (80 %) were mapped. For each marker, on average, 88 % of the expected number of heterozygote parents was detected. The likelihood of map assignment was {{to a large extent}} due to the number and density of microsatellite markers already in the map. The 'parsimonious linkage map', that is the map based on the most parsimonious location of all significantly linked markers, consisted of 21 autosomal linkage groups with 2 to 15 markers and had a total map size of 552 cM in males and 858 cM in females. The <b>Z-chromosome</b> linkage group with 12 markers had a size of 155 cM. The autosomal 'framework linkage map', that is the map based only on markers with an unambiguous position, had a total size of 237 cM in males and 440 cM in females, respectively. The inclusion of AFLPs enlarged the previous map substantially (e. g. the autosomal parsimonious linkage map became 441 cM and 621 cM larger for male and female recombination, respectively). The probability that an AFLP became mapped increased with increasing level of heterozygosity, whereas the probability of mapping into a framework position increased with both heterozygosity and number of genotyped individuals. Our results suggest that AFLP provides a fast and inexpensive means of enlarging genetic maps already composed of markers with high polymorphism, also in wild populations with unmanipulated pedigrees...|$|E
40|$|Decoding genomic {{sequences}} {{and determining}} their variation within populations has potential to reveal adaptive processes and unravel the genetic basis of ecologically relevant trait variation within a species. The blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus - a long-time ecological model species - {{has been used}} to investigate fitness consequences of variation in mating and reproductive behaviour. However, very {{little is known about the}} underlying genetic changes due to natural and sexual selection in the genome of this songbird. As a step to bridge this gap, we assembled the first draft genome of a single blue tit, mapped the transcriptome of five females and five males to this reference, identified genomewide variants and performed sex-differential expression analysis in the gonads, brain and other tissues. In the gonads, we found a high number of sex-biased genes, and of those, a similar proportion were sex-limited (genes only expressed in one sex) in males and females. However, in the brain, the proportion of female-limited genes within the female-biased gene category (82 %) was substantially higher than the proportion of male-limited genes within the male-biased category (6 %). This suggests a predominant on-off switching mechanism for the female-limited genes. In addition, most male-biased genes were located on the <b>Z-chromosome,</b> indicating incomplete dosage compensation for the male-biased genes. We called more than 500 000 SNPs from the RNA-seq data. Heterozygote detection in the single reference individual was highly congruent between DNA-seq and RNA-seq calling. Using information from these polymorphisms, we identified potential selection signals in the genome. We list candidate genes which can be used for further sequencing and detailed selection studies, including genes potentially related to meiotic drive evolution.
