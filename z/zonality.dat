40|$|By {{applying}} the ‘theory of synchronization’ from {{the science of}} complexity to studying the regional regularity of ore formation within the Nanling region of South China, a characteristic target-pattern regional ore <b>zonality</b> has been discovered. During the early and late Yanshanian epoch (corresponding respectively to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods), two centers of ore formation emerged successively in the Nanling region; the former is mainly for rare metals (W, Sn, Mo, Bi, Nb) and one rare-earth element (La) and was generated in the Jurassic period; whereas the latter is mainly for base metals (Cu, Pb, Zn, Sb, Hg), noble metals (Au, Ag), and one radioactive element (U) and was generated in the Cretaceous period. Centers of ore formation were brought about by interface dynamics respectively at the Qitianling and Jiuyishan districts in southern Hunan Province. The characteristic giant nonlinear target-pattern regional ore <b>zonality</b> was generated respectively from the two centers of ore formation by the spatio-temporal synchronization process of the Nanling complex metallogenic system. It induced the collective dynamics and cooperative behavior {{of the system and}} displayed the configuration of the regional ore <b>zonality.</b> Then dynamical clustering transformed the configuration into rudimentary ordered coherent structures. Phase dynamics eventually defined the spatio-temporal structures of the target-pattern regional ore <b>zonality</b> and determined their localization and distribution. The integral successive processes of synchronization-dynamical clustering-phase dynamics accomplished the regional ore <b>zonality</b> by way of “multiple field dynamics” of spatio-temporal superposition of multiple coupled pulsatory solitary wave trains of the zonal sequences of different ores. A new methodology for revealing regional ore <b>zonality</b> is developed, which will encourage further investigation of the formation of deep-seated ore resources and the onset of large-scale mineralization...|$|E

Three hypotheses are set: (1) economic convergence during times of industrial decline, (2) reproduction and deepening of north-south <b>zonality</b> and (3) concentration of economy being the dominant regional process during the periods of growth. The primary method employed in the work is examination of basic indicators of regional variability applied on GDP per capita and simple aggregate of employment and average wages. The findings are proved using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Conclusion resulting from the empirical part are following: regional convergence was confirmed only during the first years of 1990 's and during transformation was replaced by strong divergence typical for other post-communist countries. The north-south <b>zonality</b> appears to be strong, but the dominant determinant of regional development proved to be position in the settlement system hierarchy.

40|$|Abstract: From a {{geographical}} point of view, the general pattern of coastal zones (or geographical coastal <b>zonality)</b> is arranged along latitudinal gradients and gradations from the Equator to the poles, {{caused by the}} spherical shape of our planet {{and the distribution of}} heat according to the angle of incoming radiation. As the distribution of land and oceans differs between hemispheres and along latitudes, and atmospheric and oceanic circulation moves energy in all directions, the global pattern of coastal forms and processes due to climate-triggered conditions is very complex. Moreover, each single pattern is dynamic and subject to revision by changes in the climate. Some coastal zones (e. g. humid tropics or high polar zones) can be delimited rather easily, while others (e. g. temperate cool or those with alternating tropical climate) are more diffi-cult to define. This paper provides a short overview {{of the state of the}} art in geographical <b>zonality</b> of coastal environments (not only of coastlines) from the poles to the Equator, with the main emphasis on cold and warm zones, pointing to climate-induced differences in the context of Quaternary climate change or those occurring over the last centuries and decades.

Edaphic conditions and placement of phytocenoses are main trigger factors determining the ways of plant cover development {{in this part of}} Lake Baikal basin. We discuss the characteristics properties inherent in the linkage of the dynamics and spatial variability of the vegetation with the change of climate in the Baikal region. The regional conditions of the physiogeographic environment had given rise to structurally highly contrasting plant communities in this region. The increase in yearly mean summertime amounts of rainfall, combined with the rise of yearly mean winter temperatures over the last years were conducive to changes in the spatial structure of vegetation.

Samples used are from 77 drill holes and the samples were assayed for Pb, Zn, Fe, S, Cu, Ag, Cd, Sb, Bi and As. Variogram analyses were calculated for all the elements and kriging was used to construct the 3 D block model. Analysis of cross sections along and across the strike of the orebody shows that Bi and Sb form broader halos around sulphide masses and this suggests that they are pathfinder elements for the Pb and Zn elements of this orebody. The threshold concentrations (minimum anomaly) of the 10 elements were determined using the concentration-area analysis. On east–west vertical cross sections, the values of linear productivity, variability gradient and <b>zonality</b> index were calculated for each element. Based on the maximum <b>zonality</b> index of each element, the sequence of geochemical zonation pattern was determined {{from top to bottom}} of the orebody.

We investigated whether focal zone 1 steatosis and focal zone 3 steatosis are distinct subphenotypes of pediatric NAFLD. We aimed to determine associations between the <b>zonality</b> of steatosis and demographic, clinical, and histologic features in children with NAFLD. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of baseline data from 813 children (age < 18 years; mean age, 12. 8 ± 2. 7 years). The subjects had biopsy-proven NAFLD and {{were enrolled in the}} Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network. Liver histology was reviewed using the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network scoring system. Results Zone 1 steatosis was present in 18 % of children with NAFLD (n = 146) and zone 3 steatosis was present in 32 % (n = 244). Children with zone 1 steatosis were significantly younger (10 vs 14 years; P <. 001) and a significantly higher proportion had any fibrosis (81 % vs 51 %; P <. 001) or advanced fibrosis (13 % vs 5 %; P <. 001) compared with children with zone 3 steatosis. In contrast, children with zone 3 steatosis {{were significantly more likely to}} have steatohepatitis (30 % vs 6 % in children with zone 1 steatosis; P <. 001).
