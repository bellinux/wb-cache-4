We show that on a theoretical level, the effects of immigration on labour market outcomes depend on assumptions regarding the number of goods produced in the economy, and whether these goods are tradable or not. We then discuss the problems that may arise in empirical estimations, and suggests ways to address these problems. Our empirical analysis is {{based on data from}} the Labour Force Survey. There is some evidence that immigration affects employment prospects negatively; however, estimated effects are not significantly different from <b>zero.</b> <b>immigration,</b> labour market...|$|E
40|$|For the {{classical}} subcritical age-dependent branching process {{the effect of}} the following two-type immigration pattern is studied. At a sequence of renewal epochs a random number of immigrants enters the population. Each subpopulation stemming from one of these immigrants or one of the ancestors is revived by new immigrants and their offspring whenever it dies out, possibly after an additional delay period. All individuals have the same lifetime distribution and produce offspring according to the same reproduction law. This is the Bellman-Harris process with <b>immigration</b> at <b>zero</b> and <b>immigration</b> of renewal type (BHPIOR). We prove a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for such processes. Similar conclusions are obtained for their discrete-time counterparts (lifetime per individual equals one), called Galton-Watson processes with <b>immigration</b> at <b>zero</b> and <b>immigration</b> of renewal type (GWPIOR). Our approach is based on the theory of regenerative processes, renewal theory and occupation measures and is quite different from those in earlier related work using analytic tools...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in federal}} {{statutory}} policy, state criminal justice laws, and federal enforcement initiatives {{have led to}} an inflexible and <b>zero</b> tolerance <b>immigration</b> policy with respect to minor drug use. This Article traces {{the evolution of the}} statutory scheme and how various provisions in state and federal law interact to create the current policy. It proceeds to investigate the broad reach of these rules if they are fully enforced, in light of the widespread lifetime experience with minor drug use both in the United States and abroad. Drawing on the experience of law enforcement agencies that have abandoned similarly rigid rules, the Article proposes changes to the immigration law that would better reflect societal standards with respect to the appropriate lifetime consequences of past drug use. Finally, the Article argues that more systemic reform depends on developing mechanisms that will better insulate the specific criteria for denying admission from the one-way political ratchet of episodic congressional oversight...|$|R

The party's economic position was to support protectionism and trade retaliation, increased restrictions on foreign capital and the flow of capital overseas, and a general reversal of globalisation's influence on the Australian economy. Domestically, One Nation opposed privatisation, competition policy, and the GST, while proposing a government subsidised people's bank to provide 2 per cent loans to farmers, small business, and manufacturers. On foreign policy, One Nation called for a review of Australia's United Nations membership, a repudiation of Australia's UN treaties, an end to foreign aid and to ban foreigners from owning Australian land.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we offer a general method for {{analysing}} the demographic processes {{that contribute to}} population growth and redistribution in a multiregional system. The method incorporates a historical perspective {{that can be used}} to trace dynamic population processes as they evolve over time. It uses an open multiregional projection model framework for identifying the contributions to regional growth made by each of the principal demographic components of change: fertility, mortality, immigration, emigration, in-migration and out-migration. At the same time, the method recognises the importance of disaggregating the native-born and foreign-born populations. Available public data and indirect estimation techniques are used to develop the data inputs for the projection model, with which we reconstruct the regional population changes for each five-year period between 1950 and 1990. Regional growth rates for the foreign-born and native-born populations are partitioned into the separate demographic components of change, and the projection model identifies the separate contributions to regional growth made by each population. This allows a direct comparison of the impacts of immigration with those of corresponding native-born contributions effected through internal migration and natural increases. Finally, application of the method allows us to identify the contribution that recent (post- 1965) immigrant cohorts have made to the composition of the youngest age groups in each region, and also to simulate the impacts of <b>zero</b> <b>immigration</b> scenarios on regional growth...|$|E
40|$|Version of Record online: 11 JUN 2016 Australia's high {{per capita}} {{emissions}} rates makes it {{is a major}} emitter of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, but its low intrinsic growth rate means that future increases in population size will be dictated by net overseas immigration. We constructed matrix models and projected the population to 2100 under six different immigration scenarios. A constant 1 per cent proportional immigration scenario would result in 53 million people by 2100, producing 30. 7 Gt CO 2 -e over that interval. <b>Zero</b> net <b>immigration</b> would achieve approximate population stability by mid-century and produce 24. 1 Gt CO 2 -e. Achieving a 27 per cent reduction in annual emissions by 2030 would require a 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -fold reduction in per-capita emissions; an 80 per cent reduction by 2050 would require a 5. 8 - to 10. 2 -fold reduction. Australia's capacity to limit its future emissions will therefore depend primarily on a massive technological transformation of its energy sector, but business-as-usual immigration rates will make achieving meaningful mid-century targets more difficult.

30|$|We {{conduct a}} field {{experiment}} {{to show that}} discrimination in the rental market represents a significant obstacle for the residential mobility of immigrants and contributes to the ethnic residential segregation observed in large cities. We employ the Internet platform to identify vacant rental apartments in {{different areas of the}} two largest Spanish cities, Madrid and Barcelona. We send emails showing interest in the apartments and signal the applicants’ ethnicity by using native and foreign-sounding names. We find that, in line with previous studies, immigrants face a differential treatment when trying to rent an apartment. Our results also indicate that this negative treatment varies considerably with the share of immigrants in the area. In neighborhoods with a scarce presence of immigrants the response rate is 30 percentage points lower for immigrants than for natives, while this differential decays towards <b>zero</b> as the <b>immigration</b> share increases. This evidence indicates that discriminatory practices may perpetuate the spatial segregation of minority groups.|$|R

40|$|Immigration {{policies}} have been for long developed {{at the national level}} by sovereign States, seeking to determine under what conditions they allowed the entry of foreigners into their territories and their stay. European integration has allowed other actors than national governments to intervene in the control of immigration particularly since the signature of the Amsterdam Treaty. The Europeanization of migration policies is highly relevant topic (Geddes, 2001, Guiraudon, 2000) but research often focused on immigration control and securitization (Guild, 2001). The aim of this research is to examine new discourse that has progressively emerged {{since the end of the}} 1990 s and that promotes a relative openness to labour immigration (Boswell, 2003). I examine the development of this discourse at the European level and its consequences in terms of policy change in order to answer the following question: why and how the European Commission has endorsed a discourse favourable to new immigration of workers in Europe after decades of doctrine of <b>zero</b> <b>immigration</b> and in despite of restrictive positions of the Member States? For this, I scrutinize the policy-making of a European labour immigration policy from the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty (1 st May 1999) until the adoption of the Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment also called Blue Card Directive (29 th May 2009). Methodologically, the research is based on the analysis of more than 400 documents from EU institutions mainly and on 37 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in the European policy-making and finally on several hours of observatory participation. Based on the theoretical framework of discursive institutionalism (Schmidt, 2008), the dissertation explains the policy process carried out by European actors, particularly the European Commission and Direction General Justice and Home Affairs. Using the concept of discourse defined as ideas and interactions, it examines the ideas about new labour migration in Europe. It highlights the European policy-making on labour migration and how European actors reached step by step an agreement on the so-called Blue Card Directive. The dissertation shows that the European Commission - whatever the ideas it promotes - seeks primarily to legitimize its activities and position itself as a supranational actor and strengthen the competencies under the Treaties. Migrant workers categories emerging from the policy process range from the new economic migrant to the emblematic highly skilled worker who is seen as the ideal migrant. The common labour migration policy that was finally adopted leaves the Community door ajar. It is characterized by a differentiated approach and a preference for temporary immigration...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} part of the PROACTIVA 1 - 2 (2009 - 2012) and MARPROF-CV (2010 - 2014) projects, in the {{framework}} of the Canary Islands Government and UE PCT MAC 2007 - 2013 programmes respectively. Research has mainly focused on the stock assessment of the striped soldier shrimp, Plesionika edwardsii (Brandt, 1851), because it has shown moderate to high levels of fishing yield and abundances compatible with {{the development of a new}} sustainable fishery in the Cape Verde Islands. Cruises took place on board the R/V Prof. Ignacio Lozano. Four 15 -day surveys have been conducted to date: Cabo Verde 2010 - 04 (April 2010), Camar˜ao- 1 (November 2011), Camar˜ao- 2 (Mars 2012) and Camar ˜ao- 3 (July 2012). An innovative fishing gear so-called multiple semi-floating shrimp trap (MSFST) was used. Each fishing line was composed by 40 - 65 traps operating around 2. 4 m above the seafloor, using Decapterus macarellus (Carangidae) as unique bait of the traps. Fishing depth was 66 - 458 m, and efective fishing time was 16 - 18 h. Each trap was attached to the main bottom line every 15 m, and the maximum attraction of this bait was established to be 100 or 150 m, according to the experience gained from the local fishery for deep-sea lobsters. So density by area was calculated assuming two different areas of attraction of the fishing gear. Initial biomass was estimated from depletion experiments at different abundance stations by applying the Leslie & Davis (1939) method, modified by Ricker (1975). Each fishing operation was classified according to its yield (CPUE in g/trap/night). The potential fishing planar area was estimated between the isobathymetric lines between 90 and 220 m. Total biomasses (Bt) were calculated from areas (km 2) and mean minimum/maximum densities (kg/km 2). Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated from Bt using the Beddington and Cooke (1983) model by entering natural mortality (0. 6), growth rate (0. 53 year� 1) and recruitment age (1. 32 year), which are the parameters for this target species published for the Canaries. These parameters estimate a biological exploitation rate () of 0. 262. Interpolations were applied to estimate MSY for insular stocks representing lesser than 5 % of the total fishing grounds for this species in the archipelago. The MSY estimated by depletion were 30. 5 tons/year for the stock of S˜ao Vicente, Santa Luzia, Ilheus and S˜ao Nicolau, 10 tons/year for the stock of Santiago, 138. 8 tons/year for the stock of Boa Vista and Maio, and 5. 6 tons/year for the stock of Sal. The small stocks estimated by interpolation were: 4. 5 tons/year for the stock of Santo Ant˜ao, 1. 3 tons/year for the stock of Fogo, and 1. 8 tons/year for the stock of Brava and Ilheus. In total, 192. 5 tons per year was the total MSY for the striped soldier shrimp around the islands of the Cape Verde archipelago, occupying a total area of 1, 918 km 2 of new fishing grounds at between 90 and 220 m of depth. In comparison with the traditional bottom trap used in the Canary Islands, the innovative fishing gear MSFST were proved to be more selective for pandalid shrimps, minimizing the gear impact on the seafloor as well as the by-catch by reducing the discards. Depletion methods are based on the assumption of a closed system, that is with minimum or <b>zero</b> <b>immigration</b> between neighbouring areas. The straight forward decline of CPUEs obtained during the depletion experiments seems to confirm that P. edwardsii is a low mobility species, making this assumption valid at least during short-time periods. Because of the bathymetry profile of these islands,the depth range is from very close (few nautical miles in Santiago) to far away (10 - 12 n. m. in Boa Vista) to the coastline. Fishing effort should be controlled on the basis of quotas, number of fishing vessels and a precautionary approach in order to ensure that catching is commensurate with sustainable levels of exploitation. MSY estimates suggest that this new Capeverdean fishery should be carried out by specialized medium-sized fishing vessels. During the last decades a combination of shrimp trawling and industrial trapping activity has threatened over-exploitation in the Mediterranean fisheries targeting on P. edwardsii; currently the shrimp collapse has conducted to the decline of these fisheries. Can the Cape Verde regulatory bodies and all the stakeholders involved learn the lessons this teaches us about this resource management...|$|E

The source nation is assumed throughout to have immobility of capital.

Furthermore, we show that if the host nation is an exporter of capital at the point of <b>zero</b> enforcement (unrestricted <b>immigration),</b> it must have lower enforcement expenditure (compared to capital immobility) for any illegal immigration target. If it is an importer of capital at zero enforcement, there is some ambiguity. National income must be higher (lower) under capital mobility (compared to immobility) if the host nation is an importer (exporter) of capital at the target immigration level. The analysis is extended to consider endogenous determination of optimal immigration level. Under capital mobility, for a capital exporting nation, the optiaml enforcement and the national income levels are higher, whil the optiamal immigration level is lower. ...|$|R
