25|$|Without {{an actual}} comb one {{can look at}} the phase vs frequency. Without a carrier–envelope offset all {{frequencies}} are cosines. This means that all frequencies have the phase zero. The time origin is arbitrary. If a pulse comes at later times, the phase increases linearly with frequency, but still the zero-frequency phase is zero. This phase at zero frequency is the carrier–envelope offset. The second harmonic not only has twice the frequency, but also twice the phase. Thus for a pulse with <b>zero</b> <b>offset</b> the second harmonic of the low-frequency tail is in phase with the fundamental of the high-frequency tail, and otherwise it is not. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) measures how the phase increases with frequency, but it cannot determine the offset, so the name “electric field reconstruction” is a bit misleading.|$|E

40|$|The Solar Orbiter mission aims {{to study}} the Sun by linking what the {{spacecraft}} visibly detects on the Sun's surface with the measurements it makes in-situ in the solar wind, which will advance our knowledge of how the Sun controls the inner heliosphere. The spacecraft has strict magnetic cleanliness requirements that demand deviation from standard testing, analysis and data correction practices. We present advances made towards the detection of magnetometer <b>zero</b> <b>offsets</b> and the verification of unit magnetic field emissions {{in anticipation of the}} Solar Orbiter mission. We demonstrate an improvement to the detection of magnetometer <b>zero</b> <b>offsets</b> through the automatic calculation of a key parameter vital to the removal of the spacecraft field from measured data. The existing technique uses pre-existing rotations in the solar wind to calculate the magnetometer <b>zero</b> <b>offsets.</b> Our improvement uses the measured solar wind data to automatically calculate the important minimum compressional standard deviation (MCS) parameter, demonstrating an improvement in the offset calculation probability of up to 10 % at aphelion and 5 % at perihelion. We also suggest an improvement to the extrapolation of source emission measurements made close to equipment under test (EUT), in order to verify field emissions against strict magnetic cleanliness requirements. We propose the use of magnetic field scaling that follows an inverse square law close to the EUT and an inverse cube law beyond a chosen break distance 3 times the scale size of the EUT. Due to the importance of the 1 - 100 kHz range to the search coil instrument on Solar Orbiter, we study a potential improvement to the shielding effectiveness of test facilities over this frequency range. We test a small prototype design using thin high permeability layers that demonstrates shielding by a factor of 90 at 8 kHz, however when scaled up to test facility size we find that aluminium shielding is more effective.

Operation of the linear compressor with a fixed clearance of 0. 8 mm was compared with a <b>zero</b> DC <b>offset</b> operation. The fixed clearance operation requires a higher power input. The mean piston position can be controlled by using a DC bias on the drive voltage or by using a bleed flow from the compressor body to the suction side of the compressor. Using a DC bias on the drive voltage induces a higher power loss than using a bleed flow {{when there is a}} small radial clearance between the piston and cylinder.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} influence of phase shift on the measured displacement error in interferometers based on quadrature detection. This error was experimentally investigated using a two-detector homodyne quadrature laser interferometer (HQLI) with two orthogonally polarized signals. Here, the phase shift can be continuously varied by rotating a wave plate. However, {{the rotation of the}} wave plate also produces unequal signal amplitudes and different <b>zero</b> <b>offsets,</b> both of which can be corrected with an appropriate signal processing. The measured phase-shift error perfectly agrees with the theoretically determined phase-shift error region. This error is systematic, periodic and severely a symmetrical around the nominal displacement value. For the robust realization of a HQLI, a slight deviation from the aligned angle of the wave plate should not shift the phase significantly from the ideal 90 °. This may pose a problem if an additional phase shift originates from the polarization-sensitive light reflections, suchas the reflection at the nonpolarizing beam splitter...|$|R

40|$|Errors in psychrometrically {{determined}} {{values of}} leaf water potential caused by tissue {{resistance to water}} vapor exchange and by lack of thermal equilibrium were evaluated using commercial in situ psychrometers (Wescor Inc., Logan, UT) on leaves of Tradescantia virginiana (L.). Theoretical errors in the dewpoint method of operation for these sensors were demonstrated. After correction for these errors, in situ measurements of leaf water potential indicated substantial errors caused by tissue resistance to water vapor exchange (4 to 6 % reduction in apparent water potential per second of cooling time used) resulting from humidity depletions in the psychrometer chamber during the Peltier condensation process. These errors were avoided by use of a modified procedure for dewpoint measurement. Large changes in apparent water potential were caused by leaf and psychrometer exposure to moderate levels of irradiance. These changes were correlated with relatively small shifts in psychrometer <b>zero</b> <b>offsets</b> (− 0. 6 to − 1. 0 megapascals per microvolt), indicating substantial errors caused by nonisothermal conditions between the leaf and the psychrometer.
