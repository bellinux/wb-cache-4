Delay balancing using the filtering effect of CMOS-gates avoids superfluous transitions (glitches) resulting in power saving and increased circuit reliability.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that dynamic power dissipation in digital CMOS circuits depends linearly on switching activity. In this paper, we study switching activity {{in a commercial}} FPGA and propose a novel approach to pre-layout activity prediction. We examine how switching activity on a net changes when <b>delays</b> are <b>zero</b> (<b>zero</b> <b>delay</b> activity) versus when logic delays are considered (logic delay activity) versus when both logic and routing delays are considered (routed delay activity). Low-power synthesis and early power estimation are typically done {{on the basis of}} <b>zero</b> <b>delay</b> activity values, with the assumption that such values correlate well with routed delay activity values. We investigate whether this assumption is valid for FPGA technologies, where critical path delay is often dominated by interconnect delay. We then present an approach for early prediction of routed delay activity values. Our approach is novel in that it estimates each net's routed delay activity using only <b>zero</b> or logic <b>delay</b> activity values along with structural and functional properties of a circuit. Results show that in comparison with <b>zero</b> or logic <b>delay</b> activity values, the predicted activity values are substantially more representative of routed delay activity values...|$|R

40|$|Our aim is the {{development}} of a novel probabilistic method to estimate the power consumption of a combinational circuit under real gate delay model handling temporal, structural and input pattern dependencies.

A modified Boolean function, which describes the logic behavior of a signal at any time instance, including time parameter is introduced.

Based on the mathematical model and considering the modified Boolean function, a new algorithm to evaluate the switching activity at specific time instances using Ordering Binary Decision Diagrams (OBBDs) is also presented.

40|$|A new {{mechanism}} for generation of efficient <b>zero</b> phase <b>delay</b> of electromagnetic wave propagation based on wavefront modulation is investigated in this paper. Both numerical simulations and experiment {{have demonstrated the}} <b>zero</b> phase <b>delay</b> behaviors of wave propagation in a two-dimensional triangular photonic crystal. The <b>zero</b> phase <b>delay</b> propagation, independent of the propagating distance, is attributed to an invariable wavefront modulation of photonic crystal {{in the direction of}} wave propagation, where the phase velocity is perpendicular to the group velocity with parallel wavefronts (or phasefronts) extending along the direction of energy flow. This effect can be extended to the three-dimensional cases or other artificially engineered materials, and may open a new route to obtain perfect zero-phase-delay propagation for electromagnetic wave instead of using zero-index or zero-averaged-index materials and have significant potential in many applications.
