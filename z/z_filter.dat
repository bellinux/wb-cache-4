This paper focuses on the two <b>z</b> <b>filter</b> components in the original REINE pulse sequence, and investigates {{by means of a}} product operator analysis and fits to density matrix simulations the effects that their removal has on the sensitivity of the experiment and on the accuracy of the extracted J couplings. The first <b>z</b> <b>filter</b> proves unnecessary in all the cases investigated here and removing it increases the sensitivity of the experiment by a factor ∼ 1. 1 – 2. 0. Furthermore, for systems with broad isotropic chemical shift distributions (namely whose full widths at half maximum are greater than 30 times the mean J coupling strength), the second <b>z</b> <b>filter</b> can also be removed, thus allowing whole-echo acquisition and providing an additional √ 2 gain in sensitivity. Considering both random and systematic errors in the values obtained, J couplings determined by fitting the intensity modulations of REINE experiments carry an uncertainty of 0. 2 – 1. 0 Hz (∼ 1 − 10 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Establishing the {{instrumental}} sensitivity {{as a function}} of wavelength within the domain covered by the F 850 LP (<b>z)</b> <b>filter</b> is critical for a number of ACS science programs. Absolute sensitivity calibrations with hot white dwarfs showed that substantial updates up to 20 % in the blue were needed relative to pre-flight estimates, and were suggestive of a significant gradient in the far-red (0. 85 – 1. 1 microns) QE update needed (but did not suffice to constrain this well). We report here observations of several hot white dwarfs; as well as a M 7 V, a L 3. 5 V and a T 6. 5 V star in F 625 W, F 814 W and F 850 LP with ACS/WFC. The concentration of flux for the coolest stars to the longest wavelengths probed with F 850 LP provide a means of defining the quantum efficiency curve underlying this broad filter. We find, unique to the z-band filter, that over the range O, M, L, T stars that the encircled energy for small-to-moderate apertures can vary at the level of 10 s of percent. Attempts to separate out underlying QE variations and wavelength dependent PSF effects are reported on here.

The intention is to generate a training set of realistic images of galaxies of diverse morphologies and a large range of redshifts for the GEMS and COSMOS galaxy evolution projects. This training set allows other studies to investigate and quantify the effects of cosmological redshift on the determination of galaxy morphologies, distortions and other galaxy properties that are potentially sensitive to resolution, surface brightness and bandpass issues. We use galaxy images from the SDSS in the u, g, r, i, <b>z</b> <b>filter</b> bands as input, and computed new galaxy images from these data, resembling the same galaxies as located at redshifts 0. 1 <z< 1. 1 and viewed with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST ACS). In this process we take into account angular size change, cosmological surface brightness dimming, and spectral change. The latter is achieved by interpolating a spectral energy distribution that is fit to the input images on a pixel-to-pixel basis. The output images are created for the specific HST ACS point spread function and the filters used for GEMS (F 606 W and F 850 LP) and COSMOS (F 814 W). All images are binned onto the desired pixel grids (0. 03 " for GEMS and 0. 05 " for COSMOS) and corrected to an appropriate point spread function.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{behaviors}} of reddening vectors in the SDSS photometric system for galaxies of different morphologies, ages, and redshifts. As seen in other photometric systems, the dependence of reddening on the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the nonlinearity of reddening are likewise non-negligible for the SDSS system if extinction is significant (~> 1 mag). These behaviors are most significant for the g filter, which has the largest bandwidth-to-central wavelength ratio among SDSS filters. The SDSS colors involving adjacent filters show greater SED-dependence and nonlinearity. A procedure for calculating the correct amount of extinction from an observed color excess is provided. The relative extinctions between (i. e., the extinction law for) SDSS filters given by Schlegel et al., which were calculated with an older version of filter response functions, would underestimate the amount of extinction in most cases by ~ 5 to 10 % (maximum ~ 20 %). We recommend A/A_{ 5500 } values of 1. 574, 1. 191, 0. 876, 0. 671 & 0. 486 for the u, g, r, i, & <b>z</b> <b>filters,</b> respectively, as a representative extinction law for the SDSS galaxies with a small extinction (i. e., for cases where the nonlinearity and SED-dependence of the reddening is not important).

We confirm three host galaxies at redshifts 0. 7387, 0. 7401, and 0. 9286 for two of the Lyman alpha absorption systems (one with two galaxies interacting). For these systems, we are able to determine the star formation rates (SFRs); impact parameters (from previous imaging detections); the velocity shift between the absorption and emission redshifts; and, for one system, also the emission metallicity. Based on previous photometry, we find these galaxies have L L* The [OII] SFRs for these galaxies are in the range 11 - 25 M-circle dot yr(- 1) (uncorrected for dust), while the impact parameters lie in the range 35 - 54 kpc. Despite {{the fact that we have}} confirmed galaxies at 50 kpc from the QSO, no gradient in metallicity is indicated between the absorption metallicity along the QSO line of sight and the emission line metallicity in the galaxies. We confirm the anticorrelation between impact parameter and N-HI from the literature. We also report the emission redshift of five other galaxies: three at z(em) z(QSO), and two (L L*) at z(em) Z(QSO) not corresponding to any known absorption systems...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-cool dwarfs of the L {{spectral}} type (Teff= 1400 - 2200 K) {{are known}} to have dusty atmospheres. Asymmetries of the dwarf surface may arise from rotationally-induced flattening and dust-cloud coverage, and may result in non-zero linear polarisation through dust scattering. We aim to study the heterogeneity of ultra-cool dwarfs' atmospheres and the grain-size effects on the polarisation degree in a sample of nine late M, L and early T dwarfs. We obtain linear polarimetric imaging measurements using FORS 1 at the Very Large Telescope, in the Bessel I filter, and for a subset in the Bessel R and the Gunn <b>z</b> <b>filters.</b> We measure a polarisation degree of (0. 31 +/- 0. 06) % for LHS 102 BC. We fail to detect linear polarisation in the rest of our sample, with upper-limits on the polarisation degree of each object of 0. 09 % to 0. 76 % (95 % CL). For those targets we do not find evidence of large-scale cloud horizontal structure in our data. Together with previous surveys, our results set the fraction of ultra-cool dwarfs with detected linear polarisation to (30 + 10 - 6) % (1 -sigma). For three brown dwarfs, our observations indicate polarisation degrees different (at the 3 -sigma level) than previously reported, giving hints of possible variations. Our results fail to correlate with the current model predictions for ultra-cool dwarf polarisation for a flattening-induced polarisation, or with the variability studies for a polarisation induced by an hetereneous cloud cover. This stresses the intricacy of each of those tasks, but may as well proceed from complex and dynamic atmospheric processes. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, accepted by A&A.

40|$|High-resolution proton NMR {{spectra of}} complex {{molecules}} are generally crowded {{due to the}} homonuclear spin–spin couplings. Knowledge of chemical-shift frequencies from such crowded spectra are of utmost importance in identifying the spin system. These shifts would have been easily measurable had it been possible to achieve proton decoupling. Since the pioneering work of Aue et al. (1), two- dimensional J-resolved spectroscopy seems to have offered the best route to ‘‘broadband-decoupled’’ proton spectra. Subsequently, various {{attempts have been made}} to improve upon the technique (2 – 9), of which the most promising solution seems to be ‘‘purged J spectroscopy’’ (8, 9). Recently, a new proton ‘‘decoupling’’ method has been proposed (10) which uses the classic spin-echo sequence without any purging pulse. A new era has started in the field of NMR with the use of pulsed-field gradients, which in turn, is a result of technological progress in the design of high- doublequality shielded gradients. We have reported the use of these gradients for editing one-dimensional proton NMR spectra (11), where the gradients are used for suppressing artifacts arising from 180 ^o pulse imperfections and for <b>z</b> <b>filtering.</b> It was shown that the experiment can be used to identify unambiguously singlets and triplets overlapping with other multiplets. This was done by suppressing the signals arising from doublets and quartets by matching the interval between the two 90 ^o_x pulses with τ= 1 / 2 J and with the use of gradient pulses (Fig. 1 a). This process leaves the coherences of the singlets unaffected. For triplets, the central line is unaffected and the outer lines are inverted (Fig. 2 a). We report here the extensions of this pulse sequence to filter singlets and triplets without any distortions (Fig. 1 b) and to achieve ‘‘pseudo-decoupling’’ of the triplets in the proton NMR spectra (Figs. 1 c and 1 d) ...|$|R

However, a follow up program is {{needed in order to}} reject false candidates and to fully characterize the bona-fide exoplanets. Our main aims are: 1. / Detect and analyze close companions inside the typical Kepler PSF to study if they are the responsible of the dim in the Kepler light curves, 2. / Study the change in the stellar and planetary parameters due to the presence of an unresolved object, 3. / Help to validate those Kepler Objects of Interest that do not present any object inside the Kepler PSF and 4. / Study the multiplicity rate in planet host candidates. Such a large sample of observed planet host candidates allows us to do statistics about the presence of close (visual or bounded) companions to the harboring star. We present here Lucky Imaging observations for a total amount of 98 Kepler Objects of Interest. This technique is based on the acquisition of thousands of very short exposure time images. Then, a selection and combination of a small amount of the best quality frames provides a high resolution image with objects having a 0. 1 arcsec PSF. We applied this technique to carry out observations in the Sloan i and Sloan <b>z</b> <b>filters</b> of our Kepler candidates. We find blended objects inside the Kepler PSF for a significant percentage of KOIs. On one hand, only 58. 2 % of the hosts do not present any object within 6 arcsec.
