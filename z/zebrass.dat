25|$|The {{offspring}} of a zebra-donkey cross {{is called a}} zonkey, zebroid, <b>zebrass,</b> or zedonk; zebra mule is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. Zebra hinny, zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras. There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; {{there is no such}} limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.|$|E
50|$|A {{cross between}} a zebra and a donkey is known by many terms {{including}} the following: zonkey, zebonkey, zebronkey, zebrinny, zebrula, <b>zebrass,</b> zedonk, and zebadonk. Donkeys {{are closely related to}} zebras and both animals belong to the horse family. These zebra donkey hybrids are very rare. In South Africa, they occur where zebras and donkeys are found in proximity to each other. Like mules, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting meiosis.|$|E
