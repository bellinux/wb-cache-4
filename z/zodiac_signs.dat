The film depicts the story of a US-based Gujrati NRI in search of his soulmate among 12 girls (all played by Chopra) associated with the 12 <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs.</b> She received the Screen Best Actress Award nomination for her performance in the film. She was also considered for inclusion in the Guinness World Records book for being the first film actress to portray 12 distinct characters in one film. Chopra's heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements and performing at live shows (including the Miss India pageant)took its toll; she fainted during filming, and was admitted to hospital.|$|E

25|$|In Western astrology, the {{symbolism}} {{associated with the}} planets also relates to the <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> and houses of the horoscope in their various rulerships. For instance, the description of Mars is masculine, impulsive, and active. Aries is ruled by Mars and has a similar description, representing an active, masculine archetype. Similarly, the first house is also ruled by Mars, and deals with a person's physical health and strength, {{and the manner in}} which they project themselves.|$|E

25|$|Once the {{horoscope}} {{has been}} constructed {{the process of}} interpretation can begin, which involves building a complete picture of {{the personality of the}} subject, or native. Interpretation involves three main steps: noting the important features of the chart, and the processes of chart weighting and chart shaping. Chart weighting involves noting the distribution of <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> and houses in the chart, and the significance of this to the overall personality of the native. Chart shaping involves assessing the placement of the planets by aspect and position in the chart, and noting any significant patterns which occur between them.|$|E
25|$|The decans were {{a system}} of time {{measurement}} according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into ‘hours’. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over {{the course of the}} year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> {{at the time of the}} rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis. The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the Dendera Zodiac.|$|E
25|$|Having {{attended}} art college, Mercury {{also designed}} Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, {{shortly before the}} release of the band's first album. The logo combines the <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters. The original logo, as found on the reverse-side of the cover of the band's first album, was a simple line drawing. Later sleeves bore more intricate-coloured versions of the logo.|$|E

25|$|As {{opposed to}} The Sims, any age besides baby or young adult (which {{must be made}} in the University Create a Student) may be created. Instead of having to choose from already {{finished}} faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, etc.) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits. However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs.</b> A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.|$|E
25|$|In modern Western astrology {{the planets}} {{represent}} basic drives or impulses {{in the human}} psyche. These planets differ from {{the definition of a}} planet in astronomy in that the sun, moon, and recently, Pluto and Ceres (considered as dwarf planets in astronomy), are all considered to be planets for the purposes of astrology. Each planet is also said to be the ruler of one or two <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs.</b> The three modern planets have each been assigned rulership of a zodiac sign by astrologers and Ceres has been suggested as the ruler of Taurus or Virgo. Traditionally rulership of the signs was, according to Ptolemy, based on seasonal derivations and astronomical measurement, whereby the luminaries being the brightest planets were given rulership of the brightest months of the year and Saturn the coldest furthest classical planet was given to the coldest months of the year, with the other planets ruling the remaining signs as per astronomical measurement. It is noteworthy that the modern rulerships do not follow the same logic.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} Cosmos and Psyche began when Tarnas {{realized}} that {{the climax of the}} 1960s cultural revolution took place precisely during the only Uranus-Pluto conjunction in the 20th century. For Tarnas, the characteristics of the astrological entity Uranus match with those of the Greek mythical figure Prometheus better than with those of the conservative mythological figure Uranus. Tarnas associates the astrological planet Uranus with freedom and change, while Pluto is associated with evolution, instinct, and eros. Thus in Tarnas's theory, the apparent relationships (conjunctions, oppositions, and squares) of Uranus and Pluto have momentous potential for human history. (Tarnas's research has not found significant correlation between the <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> and human events.) Tarnas further observed that a Uranus-Pluto opposition occurred during the French Revolution. Like the 1960s, the French Revolution featured the characteristics of Uranus-Pluto alignment: revolution through the manifestation of the suppressed. These historical-astrological coincidences or synchronicities led Tarnas to further explore the relationship of pivotal moments in Western cultural history to the conjunctions, oppositions, and squares of the outer planets. The historical events analyzed include the Reformation, the Renaissance, Romanticism, the Scientific Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, Modernism, Postmodernism, etc.|$|E

500|$|According to Volk, books two {{and three}} {{primarily}} deal with the finer details of the zodiac. Book two opens with a preface in which Manilius presents {{a brief history of}} hexameter poetry, singling out Homer and Hesiod. His purpose, he argues, is not to insert himself into this poetic tradition, but to emphasize the uniqueness of his poem in comparison to others. According to Manilius, [...] "Every path that leads to Helicon has been trodden" [...] (omnis ad accessus Heliconos semita trita est; all other topics have been covered) and he must find [...] "untouched meadows and water" [...] (integra ... prata ... undamque) for his poetry: astrology. Manilius ends the book's preface with the assertion [...] "that the divine cosmos is voluntarily revealing itself both to mankind as a whole and to the poet in particular" [...] and, because his poetic mission has been sanctioned by fate, he is set apart from the crowd. The poet then begins his explanation of the first astrologically significant circle: the zodiac itself. He first considers the signs of the zodiac (viz. Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces), before moving on to the aspects and relationships between the signs and other objects. In this section, the poet briefly discusses the correspondences between the <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> and the Olympian gods, as well as the relationship between <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> and parts of the body. The Astronomica then considers dodecatemoria before a digression about the didactic method. The book concludes with a consideration of the second astrologically significant circle, that of the fixed circle of the observer. The last few lines are dedicated to an overview of the dodecatropos.|$|E
500|$|The album {{contains}} thirteen original songs {{written by}} Javed Akhtar. Twelve songs represent the different <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs,</b> {{with an additional}} song being a compilation of the twelve songs. Twelve different themes were created, using a different instrument for each zodiac sign, depicting the traits and personality of each girl. Sen found composing [...] "Chehra Jo Dekhe Hain" [...] most difficult, as he had to merge all the themes of the other twelve songs into one. The vocals were performed by Alka Yagnik, Udit Narayan, Shaan, Madhushree, Bela Shende, Pamela Jain, Bhavya Pandit, and Tarannum Mallik, while Sen performs most of the songs. Gowariker and his sister Ashlesha also provided the vocals for two different songs on the album. The soundtrack was released by Sony Music on 18 August 2009.|$|E
500|$|The group {{originally}} planned {{to create a}} film in conjunction with Aquemini, completing a script {{three months before the}} release of the record. OutKast met with MTV for the project, who, despite liking the idea for the film, hoped to instead buy the project and cast Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes instead, feeling they had more [...] "star power." [...] Although the duo recalls being [...] "heartbroken" [...] at the time, André 3000 and Big Boi continued to work on ideas for a collaborative film, eventually resulting in the 2006 musical Idlewild starring the group. David Browne of The New York Times viewed the album art as an homage to blaxploitation films of the 1970s.

Gowariker cast Harman Baweja after watching the trailer of his debut film, the science fiction romance Love Story 2050 (2008). He asked Harman's father, Harry Baweja, to show him the film's rushes and was impressed with his performance, calling him the best person for the part. Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs.</b> On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have always liked Priyanka's work, right from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films. So when I thought of somebody doing twelve roles I thought about her, as I thought she had the potential." [...] When Gowariker offered the film to her, Chopra instantly agreed to star in it.|$|E
500|$|With the {{occupation}} by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, Egypt became Hellenistic. The city of Alexandria {{was founded by}} Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where Babylonian astrology was mixed with Egyptian Decanic astrology to create Horoscopic astrology. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary exaltations, the triplicities of the signs {{and the importance of}} eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and four elements. 2nd century BCE texts predict positions of planets in <b>zodiac</b> <b>signs</b> {{at the time of the}} rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis. The astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy lived in Alexandria. Ptolemy's work the Tetrabiblos formed the basis of Western astrology, and, [...] "...enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1970 Mercury joined guitarist Brian May {{and drummer}} Roger Taylor who had {{previously}} been in a band called Smile. In 1971 {{they were joined by}} bassist John Deacon. Despite reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name [...] "Queen" [...] for the new band. He later said, [...] "It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it." [...] At about the same time, he changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury. Mercury designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album.
