40|$|A {{combined}} {{process was}} developed to inhibit the corrosion both in the pipeline of reclaimed water supplies (PRWS) and in downstream recirculating cooling water systems (RCWS) using the reclaimed water as makeup. Hydroxyl carboxylate-based corrosion inhibitors (e. g., gluconate, citrate, tartrate) and <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> <b>heptahydrate,</b> which provided Zn 2 + as a synergistic corrosion inhibition additive, were added prior to the PRWS when the phosphate (which could be utilized as a corrosion inhibitor) content in the reclaimed water was below 1. 7 mg/L, and no additional corrosion inhibitors were required for the downstream RCWS. Satisfactory corrosion inhibition was achieved even if the RCWS was operated under the condition of high numbers of concentration cycles. The corrosion inhibition requirement was also met by the appropriate combination of PO 43 - and Zn 2 + when the phosphate content in the reclaimed water was more than 1. 7 mg/L. The process integrated not only water reclamation and reuse, and the operation of a highly concentrated RCWS, but also the comprehensive utilization of phosphate in reclaimed water {{and the application of}} non-phosphorus corrosion inhibitors. The proposed process reduced the operating cost of the PRWS and the RCWS, and lowered the environmental hazard caused by the excessive discharge of phosphate.

It showed that the soluble phosphate in the wastewater could be directly reused as a corrosion inhibitor to prevent the RCWS from severe corrosion caused by the contaminants in the wastewater. Based on the synergetic corrosion inhibition of [GRAPHICS] and Zn 2 +, a chemical program was achieved for recirculating cooling water treatment. It contains 1 -hydroxyethylidene- 1, 1 -diphosphonic acid, polyepoxysuccinic acid, <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> <b>heptahydrate,</b> and a copolymer dispersant of LN- 104 B. In addition, LN- 104 B was verified to have excellent inhibition capability to calcium phosphate scale and zinc salts scale in the bench experiments.

The corrosion rate and the adhesion rate of the test tubes are only 0. 023 mm/a and 2. 32 mcm, respectively, which perfectly meet the requirements of the international standard of ISO 16784 - 2006. Not only can the process cut down the operating cost of RCWS, but also can reduce the environmental risk caused by excessive emission of phosphate.

Conclusion Relative standard uncertainty caused by standard solution and uncertainty caused by titration analysis of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate</b> were the main factors for the determination of calcium dihydrogen phosphate using back titration analysis of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfate...</b>|$|R
