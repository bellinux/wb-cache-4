50|$|YMF744B (DS-1S): PCI 2.2-compliant, fully 3.3V power {{processor}} {{based on}} YMF724, it adds support of <b>ZV</b> <b>port,</b> secondary AC '97 2.1 CODEC.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ZV</b> <b>port</b> is {{a direct}} {{connection}} between the PC card slot and VGA controller. Video data is transferred in real time without any buffering, removing the need for bus mastering or arbitration.|$|E
50|$|YMF754 (DS-1E): Based on YMF744, it adds {{simultaneous}} {{usage of}} <b>ZV</b> <b>port</b> and S/PDIF input, 2.5V power for core logic and PLL filter, mixing SPDIF input from mixer without prior sample rate conversion.|$|E
50|$|In computing, a zoomed video port (often simply <b>ZV</b> <b>port)</b> is a {{unidirectional}} {{video bus}} allowing a device in a PC card slot to transfer video data {{directly into a}} VGA frame buffer, so as to allow laptops to display real-time video. The standard {{was created by the}} PCMCIA to allow devices such as TV tuners, video inputs and MPEG coprocessors to fit into a PC card form factor and provide a cheap solution for both the laptop manufacturer and consumer.|$|E
50|$|Toshiba marketed both 500CS and 500CDT as fast {{notebooks}} {{that feature}} information highway with no speed limits.
