5|$|Ahead of the storm, {{officials}} in China issued warnings for <b>Zhejiang</b> and Fujian {{for the potential}} of high winds and flooding, which was later credited for reducing casualties. The Chinese army was utilized to assist in mitigating against potential flooding. Officials told boat owners to put their property in shelter, totaling 65,000vessels ordered to return to report. Coastal facilities such as seaside bathing centers were closed. Before Fitow struck China, 177,000people evacuated in Fujian and a further 574,000 evacuated their houses in <b>Zhejiang,</b> totaling 751,000people. In Shanghai, 42train or bus rides were canceled, along with 40canceled flights. Two airports in <b>Zhejiang</b> had 49canceled flights, with another 20 canceled in Fujian.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in <b>Zhejiang</b> province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon was the strongest to hit <b>Zhejiang</b> since Typhoon Sally in 1956. Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it turned toward the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.|$|E

5|$|In China, 1,001,000people in <b>Zhejiang</b> and 710,000people in Fujian were {{evacuated}} to shelters prior to Saomai's landfall. Over 20,000 soldiers and police were mobilized {{to aid in}} cleanup and rescue efforts. Officials ordered 10,286ships with 35,282fishermen to return to port in Fujian, while another 5,638ships returned to port in <b>Zhejiang.</b> Also in Fujian, all 26,800schools were closed. The Wenzhou city government ordered all businesses to close and prepare for the storm. Airlines canceled 25flights from Fuzhou Changle International Airport and another 17 from Hong Kong, while ferry service was also disrupted. During the storm, the Wenzhou Longwan International Airport closed, stranding hundreds of travelers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{examples}} of Song bridges include Guyue Bridge, a stone arch bridge in Yiwu, <b>Zhejiang</b> Province. The bridge {{was built in}} 1213, the sixth year of the Jiading Era in the Southern Song dynasty. Song-era pontoon bridges include the Dongjin Bridge, 400m (mi) long, which may still be seen today.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the typhoon, {{officials}} in China ordered the evacuation of about 2.3million people, mostly in <b>Zhejiang.</b> The typhoon also resulted in the cancellation or delay of thousands of flights, with the two main airports in Shanghai closed for 30hours. Officials near Matsa's projected landfall were advised to lower the levels in reservoirs to mitigate the threat of flooding. In <b>Zhejiang,</b> officials set up shelters for about 35,000 boats to prevent marine damage. Due to the potential for rough seas, officials closed the port at Ningbo and Shanghai and also canceled some ferry service. Matsa was predicted to be first typhoon to affect Beijing in 11years by dropping heavy amounts of rainfall. Local officials advised water operators to lower water levels to prevent flooding. Up to 100mm (4in) of rainfall was forecast for the city, and officials prepared to evacuate 40,000residents in the outskirts of the city.|$|E
5|$|Rowing oar: Rowing oars {{have been}} used since the early Neothilic period; a canoe-shaped pottery and six wooden oars dating from the 6000 BC have been {{discovered}} in a Hemudu culture site at Yuyao, <b>Zhejiang.</b> In 1999, an oar measuring 63.4cm (2ft) in length, dating from 4000 BC, has also been unearthed at Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan.|$|E

5|$|The Minyue {{surrendered}} after a Han {{naval force}} led by Zhuang Zhu was dispatched from Shaoxing in northern <b>Zhejiang,</b> and withdrew from Eastern Ou. The Yue tribes of Eastern Ou {{were transferred to}} the north, between the Yangtze River and Huai River.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} silk {{was found at}} the sites of Yangshao culture in Xia County, Shanxi, where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a sharp knife, dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BCE. The species was identified as Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom {{can also be seen}} from the sites of Hemudu culture in Yuyao, <b>Zhejiang,</b> dated to about 4000 BCE. The earliest example of silk fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a Yangshao site in Qingtaicun at Rongyang, Henan. Scraps of silk were found in a Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang in Huzhou, <b>Zhejiang,</b> dating back to 2700 BCE. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 – c. 1046 BCE).|$|E
5|$|The storm left {{nearly all}} of <b>Zhejiang</b> without power and cut half of all {{communication}} links. The heavy damage prompted officials to declare a state of emergency. In Wenzhou alone, over 18,000homes were destroyed, and 3,850factories were forced to shut down. Also in Wenzhou, Saomai left over 213,000people without clean water. 193people died in the city. In Cangnan County, the typhoon damaged 450schools, totaling ¥25million (RMB, $3.1million USD). Rainfall across the state flooded 56provincial roads and highways. Six people died in Lishui after being crushed by a landslide. Throughout <b>Zhejiang,</b> economic losses totaled ¥4.9billion (RMB, $610million), of which ¥4.5billion (RMB, $560million) was in Wenzhou.|$|E

5|$|Ye Qianyu {{was born}} Ye Lunqi (葉綸綺) in Tonglu county, <b>Zhejiang</b> {{province}} in 1907. Although {{he loved to}} paint since childhood, he had neither the money nor the opportunity to seek professional training, forcing him to teach himself how to paint.|$|E
5|$|A Han {{naval force}} led by Zhuang Zhu {{departed}} from Shaoxing in northern <b>Zhejiang</b> towards Minyue. The Minyue surrendered {{before the arrival}} of the Han troops, and withdrew from Eastern Ou. There were plans to move the residents of Eastern Ou to the area between the Huai River and Yangtze River, following a request by the king of Eastern Ou.|$|E
5|$|An eyewall {{replacement}} {{cycle and}} weakening convection {{along the northern}} side resulted in steady weakening starting on July10. Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China. Early on July11, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning {{to the north and}} later north-northeast. Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, <b>Zhejiang,</b> or roughly 140km (80mi) south-southeast of Shanghai, around 08:40UTC. The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140km/h (85mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155km/h (100mph). Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom was the strongest typhoon to pass within 160km (100mi) of Shanghai in at least 35years, and it was the strongest landfall in <b>Zhejiang</b> since recordkeeping began in 1949. Thereafter the storm accelerated north-northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure. Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00UTC on July11. The system's low-level center completely exposed on July12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Around 18:00UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 95km/h (60mph). By 00:00UTC on July13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds, and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea.|$|E
5|$|His parents, Lin Gie-Ming and Shirley Lin, {{emigrated from}} Taiwan to the United States in the mid-1970s, {{settling}} first in Virginia {{before moving to}} Indiana, where they both attended universities. They are dual nationals of Taiwan and the U.S. Lin's paternal family are Hoklo people from Beidou, Changhua, Taiwan, while his maternal grandmother emigrated to Taiwan in the late 1940s from Pinghu, <b>Zhejiang,</b> in mainland China.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{outside of}} China was minimal and largely limited to heavy rains, {{although}} one death {{was reported in}} Taiwan. In the country, strong winds and heavy rainfall left heavy damage near the coast, {{as well as to}} farms further inland. Rananim destroyed 64,300houses and damaged another 125,000. The typhoon affected 75counties, affecting 18million people, and overall damage was estimated at ¥20.1billion ($2.44billion 2004USD, $ USD), primarily in <b>Zhejiang.</b> There were 168deaths in China, which caused the name Rananim to be retired from the naming list.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Typhoon Shanshan, the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau issued a marine warning for all {{ships in the}} areas around {{the north and the}} east coasts of the island and in the Bashi Channel. Tourists were also asked to avoid the areas due to fears over large waves. The <b>Zhejiang</b> provincial government in the People's Republic of China also asked all fishermen to return to port and ordered local authorities to help with evacuations of people from areas threatened by the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Peng staged {{his first}} {{offensive}} after becoming Defense Minister in January 1955, when he attacked and occupied {{a chain of}} islands, part of <b>Zhejiang,</b> which were still held by the Kuomintang, from which the Nationalists occasionally staged guerrilla raids as far as Shanghai. This operation led the United States to form a defense agreement with Taiwan, effectively preventing the communists from completely defeating the Kuomintang.|$|E
5|$|The Mukondo Mountain project, {{operated}} by the Central African Mining and Exploration Company in Katanga, may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world. It is estimated able to produce about one third of total global production of cobalt in 2008. In July 2009 CAMEC announced a long term agreement under which CAMEC would deliver its entire annual production of cobalt in concentrate from Mukondo Mountain to <b>Zhejiang</b> Galico Cobalt & Nickel Materials of China.|$|E

It is cruciform in plan, having a nave flanked by a lower single aisle on either side, crossed by a transept, and with a semi-circular apse projecting at the east end.|$|E
5|$|The provincial {{observatory}} of Fujian {{issued a}} typhoon warning for the province on July 11, {{well in advance}} of Bilis' final landfall. In response to the warning, officials evacuated over 800,000people from Hunan and 70,000 from <b>Zhejiang.</b> In addition, 256,000 fishermen and workers were evacuated from coastal areas in southeastern China, and 220,000 ships were ordered to return to port. In Shanghai, the evacuations caused significant rail and bus delays, and more than 210 flights {{in and out of the}} city were canceled prior to landfall.|$|E
5|$|Toilet paper: Toilet {{paper was}} first {{mentioned}} by the Sui Chinese politician and artist Yan Zhitui (531–591) {{in the year}} 589 during the Sui Dynasty, with full evidence of continual use in subsequent dynasties. By the mid 14th century during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), it was written that ten million packages of 1,000 to 10,000 sheets of toilet paper were manufactured annually in <b>Zhejiang</b> province alone.|$|E
5|$|Treetrunk coffin: The treetrunk coffin, single trunk coffin or boat coffin {{was one of}} {{the common}} burials found mainly in the {{southern}} China. One of the few earliest boat coffins are found among the 92 burial tombs in the Songze culture (4000–3000 BC) site at Jiaxing, <b>Zhejiang,</b> similar finds can also be found in the middle phase of Dawenkou culture (4100–2600 BC) sites.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Chanchu was the {{earliest}} on record to strike Guangdong at the time, having struck the country 44days {{earlier than the}} average date for the first strike. Rainfall in the country spread across Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, and <b>Zhejiang,</b> and Chanchu became {{the earliest}} typhoon to affect Shanghai in 80years. Rainfall totaled over 250mm (9.8in) in southeastern Guangdong and southwestern Fujian. In the former province, wind gusts peaked at 170km/h (106mph) in Huilai.|$|E
5|$|Across the Philippines, {{the storm}} caused $4.48million (1987USD) in damage but no deaths. Although the system stayed {{offshore}} Taiwan, the storm inflicted widespread flooding across the island that took five lives. There, 5,000families were left without power, and damage exceeded $10million. Although Gerald weakened considerably prior to making landfall, {{the storm was}} still responsible for extensive damage in the Fujian Province, where 76people perished, and 31others suffered injuries. In the neighboring <b>Zhejiang</b> Province, 28people were killed and 71others sustained injuries. Across China, 4,900homes were destroyed and 122fatalities were reported. Damage in the country amounted to $120million.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} Kaifeng, the Jurchens went on {{to conquer}} the rest of northern China, while the Song Chinese court fled south. They took up temporary residence at Nanjing, where a surviving prince was named Emperor Gaozong of Song in 1127. Jin forces halted at the Yangzi River, but staged continual raids south of the river until a later boundary was fixed at the Huai River further north. With the border fixed at the Huai, the Song government would promote an immigration policy of repopulating and resettling territories north of the Yangzi River, since vast tracts of vacant land between the Yangzi and Huai were open for landless peasants found in Jiangsu, <b>Zhejiang,</b> Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces of the south.|$|E
5|$|At 1200UTC on July13, the JTWC {{upgraded}} Billie {{further to}} typhoon status, making Billie the first tropical cyclone {{to be monitored}} by the JTWC since its inception earlier in 1959. Now tracking steadily towards the northwest, the typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200UTC {{the next day with}} maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) according to the JTWC and a minimum barometric pressure assessed by the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) at 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg). By this time Billie's eye had shrunk to a size roughly 50km (30mi) in diameter. At 0900UTC on July15, Billie passed just 30km (20mi) north of Taiwan; fifteen hours later the typhoon made landfall north of Fuzhou, China in <b>Zhejiang</b> with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph).|$|E
5|$|By October1, {{officials}} in Mainland China issued warnings for Fujian Province and urged residents to evacuate. An estimated 537,000people heeded these warnings in Fujian and a further 86,000 and 61,860 evacuated in <b>Zhejiang</b> and Guangdong provinces, respectively. The majority of evacuees {{were from the}} cities of Ningde, Fuzhou, Putian, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou, with 376,000 evacuating from Xiamen alone. Along the coast, roughly 38,000seagoing vessels returned to port. Thousands of {{officials in}} the province oversaw flood preparations. Public transportation across Fujian Province was temporarily suspended as well. The airport in Xiamen shut down late on October2 as rain bands from the storm began impacting the area. Throughout Fujian, more than 120flights were canceled.|$|E
5|$|Flare: The {{earliest}} recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' {{used by the}} Song Dynasty Chinese as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty besieged Yangzhou in 1276. These soft-shelled bombs, {{timed to}} explode in mid-air, were used to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears in a text dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in <b>Zhejiang.</b> A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih or Illustrated Military Encyclopedia written in 1791 depicts a signal gun in an illustration.|$|E
5|$|Following the flooding, {{the local}} governments in Valladolid and San Enrique {{declared}} a state of calamity to allow funds to reach flood victims. By September26, about PHP700,000 ($14,000USD) worth of relief supplies had been distributed to the affected areas. At least PHP480,000 ($10,000USD) of the calamity funds were sent to the local governments in Negros Occidental. On September20, the Chinese Government allocated ¥81million ($11.8million USD) in living subsidies for those affected by the typhoon. The International Red Cross, which was already assisting China in recovery from flooding in August, took preparatory measures and worked with local branches to get damage assessments. The <b>Zhejiang</b> Red Cross branch provided ¥200,000 ($29,000USD) in relief items to the hardest hit areas.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters at the JTWC {{initially}} projected {{the storm}} to track north of Taiwan on September12 and merge with an approaching frontal system. Contrary to this, Sarah moved {{south of the}} expected path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan. The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165km/h (105mph) late on September11. Unexpectedly, the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop and briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall 12hours later along the northeastern coast of Taiwan as a tropical storm. Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in <b>Zhejiang,</b> China as a minimal tropical storm on September13. The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights activists}} had {{previously}} alleged, and on February 28, 2017 investigative journalism reported confirmation, that child labor {{is used in}} {{a portion of the}} worldwide supply of cobalt sourced from African artisanal mines. This revelation prompted cell phone maker Apple Inc., on March 3, 2017, to stop buying the ore from suppliers such as <b>Zhejiang</b> Huayou Cobalt who source from artisanal mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and only using suppliers that are verified to meet its workplace standards. In 2017, some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and cobalt mines in the area of Cobalt, Ontario where significant deposits are believed to lie.|$|E
5|$|In {{observing a}} {{multitude}} of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did not intervene in local or central government affairs {{for the benefit of}} their local prefecture or county. This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of central government officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, <b>Zhejiang,</b> and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies.|$|E
5|$|Military {{campaigns against}} the Baiyue began under the Qin, the dynasty {{that preceded the}} Han. The First Emperor of the Qin craved for the {{resources}} of the Baiyue and ordered military expeditions against the region between 221 and 214 BC. He sent a large contingent of soldiers against Lingnan in 214 BC, comprising conscripted merchants and soldiers. Military garrisons were installed, the Lingqu Canal was constructed, and new areas were placed under Qin administration. The collapse of the Qin caused the dissolution of Qin administration in southern China. Indigenous Yue kingdoms emerged in the former Qin territories, including the Nanyue kingdom in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Vietnam, Minyue in Fujian, and Eastern Ou in <b>Zhejiang.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 2006, 20chartered buses {{took more}} than 1,000mourners – devotees, her godchildren, scores of wheelchair-bound residents, representatives from various Buddhist temples, and well-wishers – to Tse Tho Aum Buddhist Temple in Sin Ming Drive for the final prayers and cremation. The abbess' ashes were kept for 100days at her temple, before making their way to her final resting place in <b>Zhejiang</b> {{province}} in China, where her niece lives. As a follow-up to her funeral, her remains and personal items were put on one-day public display at her temple on 26 February 2006. The relics (Sariras) displayed were crystalline or pearl-like deposits found in Venerable Ho's ashes. Buddhists believe these are usually found in cremated Buddhist masters, are holy, and treat them with reverence.|$|E
