A method has been proposed by which wavelets may be used to correct the acceleration data.

50|$|For the {{measurement}} of very large strains, 5% (50 000 microstrain) or above, annealed constantan (P alloy) is the grid material normally selected. Constantan in this form is very ductile; and, in gauge lengths of 0.125 in (3 mm) and longer, can be strained to >20%. It should be borne in mind, however, that under high cyclic strains the P alloy will exhibit some permanent resistivity change with each cycle, and cause a corresponding <b>zero</b> <b>shift</b> in the strain gauge. Because of this characteristic, and the tendency for premature grid failure with repeated straining, P alloy is not ordinarily recommended for cyclic strain applications.

40|$|Abstract: Coriolis mass {{flowmeters}} (CMF) are {{claimed to}} be not affected by {{the properties of the}} liquid such as heat conductivity, heat capacity and viscosity. They are direct mass flowmeters and form a real mean along the flow profile. However, there is some evidence from field applications that the devices, in particular with single straight pipe, suffer under the null drift. Therefore, the <b>zero</b> <b>shift</b> must be adjusted to the properties of liquid, installation site and operating conditions. The <b>zero</b> <b>shift</b> is caused by asymmetry of the oscillating system. A change in the asymmetry leads to the <b>zero</b> <b>shift.</b> This paper presents two methods to determine the zero shift: a sensor and a model based approach. The first uses additional acceleration sensors to measure the vibration of the straight pipe’s mounting. The motion of the mounting represents asymmetries in dissipation. The second method utilizes a model which includes the asymmetries as parameters. These can be detected by auxiliary exitation of the oscillating system...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} constructing signature sequences for quasi-synchronous CDMA systems. The major feature of QS-CDMA is that the duration of any signature waveform is significantly longer than the maximal signal delay {{with respect to a}} common clock. In contrast to completely asynchronous CDMA systems for which all aperiodic correlations must be taken into consideration, in case of quasi-synchronous CDMA, it is sufficient to focus on a small window around the <b>zero</b> <b>shift,</b> the so-called interference window. This simplifies sequence design and allows us to reduce both the inter-symbol interference and multiple access interference drastically, thereby enhancing the system performance tremendously. This is all the more important since construction of sequences for completely asynchronous CDMA systems is a notoriously difficult problem and no such sequence sets are known. Consequently, random sequences must be used that are known to induce a significant capacit y loss. In this paper, we present two possible methods for obtaining sequences with small aperiodic correlation sidelobes {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>zero</b> <b>shift.</b> We discuss advantages and disadvantages of QS-CDMA and W-CDMA, the major air interface for third generation mobile communications systems.
