5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or with the drug <b>zonisamide,</b> and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zonisamide</b> {{and other}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide {{have been known}} to interfere with amobarbital, which has led to inadequate anesthetization during the Wada test. <b>Zonisamide</b> may also interact with other carbonic anhydrase inhibitors to increase the potential for metabolic acidosis.|$|E

25|$|<b>Zonisamide</b> is an antiseizure drug {{chemically}} {{classified as}} a sulfonamide and unrelated to other antiseizure agents. The precise mechanism by which <b>zonisamide</b> exerts its antiseizure effect is unknown, although {{it is believed that}} the drug blocks sodium and T-type calcium channels, which leads to the suppression of neuronal hypersynchronization (that is, seizure-form activity). It is also known to be a weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (similarly to the anticonvulsant, acetazolamide). It is also known to modulate GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zonisamide</b> {{has been}} studied for and used as a {{migraine}} preventative medication, when topiramate is either ineffective or cannot be continued due to side effects.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{metabolism}} of <b>zonisamide</b> is inhibited by ketoconazole, ciclosporin, miconazole, fluconazole and carbamazepine (in {{descending order}} of inhibition) {{due to their}} effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme.|$|E

25|$|<b>Zonisamide</b> is {{approved}} in the United States, and United Kingdom for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in adults and Japan for both adjunctive and monotherapy for partial seizures (simple, complex, secondarily generalized), generalized (tonic, tonic-clonic (grand mal), and atypical absence) and combined seizures. In Australia it is marketed as both an adjunctive therapy and monotherapy for partial seizures only.|$|E
25|$|By 1980, {{primidone}} {{was seen}} as not worth mentioning as an option for childhood temporal lobe epilepsy by doctors in the United Kingdom. In January 1981, Dr. O'Brien and colleagues reported that primidone had {{a positive effect on}} the essential tremor of one of their patients. This led them to initiate a twenty-person prospective study. Twelve of the participants responded well. By 1984, valproic acid was the drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and not the equally effective primidone. However, as late as 1985, primidone was {{still one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. At the close of the 1980s, primidone was still the preferred anticonvulsant for complex partial seizures in Germany. In 1989, Dainippon Pharmaceutical launched Exegran (<b>zonisamide),</b> the first new, chemically unique, non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant in decades.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, primidone, {{along with}} phenobarbital, was a second-line agent in partial {{epilepsy}} {{with or without}} secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures {{and was one of}} four agents (the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) that was used along with ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine for any absence or myoclonic seizures when valproate failed to control tonic-clonics (at least in the United States). After <b>zonisamide,</b> other new anticonvulsants came onto the market: felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin. All four were structurally distinct both from other anticonvulsants already on the market. They all had larger protective indexes than conventional agents and unlike these agents, the new ones did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals or antagonize folic acid. They seemed to be relatively mild in terms of side effects. Out of all of them lamotrigine was the most similar to phenytoin in its pattern of efficacy. Felbamate was the most effective for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and was seen as a second-line agent in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after valproate. These new agents were aggressively marketed. In 1994, felbamate became the anticonvulsant of last resort after ten people out of 100,000 came down with aplastic anemia.|$|E
500|$|Long-term {{use of the}} {{ketogenic}} diet {{in children}} {{increases the risk of}} slowed or stunted growth, bone fractures and kidney stones. The diet reduces levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which is important for childhood growth. Like many anticonvulsant drugs, the ketogenic diet has an adverse effect on bone health. Many factors may be involved such as acidosis and suppressed growth hormone. About 1 in 20 children on the ketogenic diet will develop kidney stones (compared with one in several thousand for the general population). A class of anticonvulsants known as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (topiramate, <b>zonisamide)</b> are known to increase the risk of kidney stones, but the combination of these anticonvulsants and the ketogenic diet does not appear to elevate the risk above that of the diet alone. The stones are treatable and do not justify discontinuation of the diet. Johns Hopkins Hospital now gives oral potassium citrate supplements to all ketogenic diet patients, resulting in a sevenfold decrease in the incidence of kidney stones. However, this empiric usage has not been tested in a prospective controlled trial. Kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis) is associated with the diet for four reasons: ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Zonisamide</b> is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} the symptoms of epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Chemically it is a sulfonamide. It serves as an anticonvulsant used primarily as an [...] therapy in adults with Parkinson's disease, partial-onset seizures; infantile spasm, mixed seizure types of Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, myoclonic and generalized tonic clonic seizure. Despite this it is also sometimes used as a monotherapy for partial-onset seizures.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{effective}} anti-epileptic medication for JME is valproic acid (Depakote).

Lamotrigine, levetiracetam, topiramate, and <b>zonisamide</b> are alternative anti-epileptic medications with less frequent incidence of pregnancy related complications, and they are often used first in females of childbearing age. Carbamazepine may aggravate primary generalized seizure disorders such as JME. [...] Treatment is lifelong. Patients should be warned to avoid sleep deprivation.|$|E
2500|$|A {{metallic}} taste may {{be caused}} by food and drink, certain medicines or amalgam dental fillings. It is generally considered an off flavor when present in food and drink.

Some artificial sweeteners are perceived to have a metallic taste, which is detected by the TRPV1 receptors. [...] Blood is considered by many people to have a metallic taste. A metallic taste in the mouth is also a symptom of various medical conditions, in which case it may be classified under the symptoms dysgeusia or parageusia, referring to distortions of the sense of taste, and can be caused by various kinds of medication, including saquinavir and <b>zonisamide,</b> and occupational hazards, such as working with pesticides.|$|E
