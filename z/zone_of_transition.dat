This paper presents a new study of the geometric structure of 3 D spinal curves. The spine is considered as an heterogeneous beam, compound of vertebrae and intervertebral discs. The spine is modeled as a deformable wire along which vertebrae are beads rotating about the wire. 3 D spinal curves are compound of plane regions connected together by <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition.</b> The 3 D spinal curve is uniquely flexed along the plane regions. The angular offsets between adjacent regions are concentrated at level <b>of</b> the middle <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> so illustrating the heterogeneity of the spinal geometric structure. The plane regions along the 3 D spinal curve must satisfy two criteria: (i) a criterion of minimum distance between the curve and the regional plane and (ii) a criterion controlling that the curve is continuously plane {{at the level of}} the region. The geometric structure of each 3 D spinal curve is characterized by the sizes and orientations of regional planes, by the parameters representing flexed regions and by the sizes and functions <b>of</b> <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition.</b> Spinal curves <b>of</b> asymptomatic subjects show three plane regions corresponding to spinal curvatures: lumbar, thoracic and cervical curvatures.

25|$|Star-shaped domes {{are found}} at the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, which {{contains}} domed audience halls built to mirror the heavenly constellations. The Hall of the Abencerrajes (c. 1333–91) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333–54) are extraordinarily developed examples of muqarnas domes, taking {{the tradition of the}} squinch in Islamic architecture from a functional element in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> to a highly ornamental covering for the dome itself. The structural elements of these two domes are actually brick vaulting, but these are completely covered by the intricate mocárabe stalactites. The lacy and star-shaped crossing dome of Burgos Cathedral (1567) may have been inspired by these examples, in addition to that built over the cathedral's octagonal Chapel of the Condestable (148294) in the Gothic style.|$|E
25|$|The twin-domes of the Sultaniyya complex (c. 1360) and {{the narrow}} dome of Yunus al-Dawadar (c. 1385) are unusual {{in that they}} have muqarnas {{at the base of}} their {{external}} ribs, a feature of ribbed domes in Persia. The first example of the zigzag pattern is on the dome of Mahmud al-Kurdi (1394–95), and at least fourteen subsequent domes also used it. The first example of a dome in Cairo with a star pattern is the mausoleum of al-Ashraf Barsbay. The dome of Qaytbay in Cairo's northern cemetery combines geometric and arabesque patterns {{and is one of the}} finest.

40|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century, both culture and borders remain over-determined {{concepts}} in human efforts to imagine and comprehend {{a world that}} is increasingly characterized by both flows and barriers. Culture is everywhere yet nowhere; culture is an idea ever more produced and re-produced by society. Borders are expanding prodigiously worldwide yet people in global interaction are increasingly straddling borders. Geographers have contributed substantially to our understanding of how borders work in globalization and also to how borders and cultures interact. In this paper, I explore the intersection of borders and culture in three inherently geographical contexts displayed in the Canada-United States borderlands. The first is that culture inhabits the borderlands as well as the borderlines to display and express increasingly extended <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> beyond borders between states, regions and communities. The <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> have spatial characteristics and cultural signatures. Secondly, these borderlands landscapes convey the dialectic of cultural continuity and cultural discontinuity in a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> interaction that is neither here nor there to confront the meaning of border. And, finally, in these borderlands, identity is formed and re-formed among those who claim indigeneity and others who cannot. Here, in the borderlands, pressures toward homogeneity in cultural identity vie with more extensive forces of heterogeneity to diffuse identities. Borderlands culture conveys plural expressions of identity and singular imperatives of belonging...|$|R

Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, {{and the development of}} triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. The construction of tomb towers decreased. The 7.5 meter wide double dome of Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period. The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors.|$|E
25|$|Tower tombs of this period, such as {{the tomb}} of Abdas-Samad Esfahani in Natanz, {{sometimes}} have muqarnas domes, although they are usually plaster shells that hide the underlying structures. The tall proportions of the Jameh Mosque of Varamin resulted primarily from the increased height of the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> {{with the addition of}} a sixteen-sided section above the main zone of muqarnas squinches. The 7.5 meter wide double dome of Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The inner and outer shells had radial stiffeners and struts between them. An early example of a dome chamber almost completely covered with decorative tilework is that of the Jame Mosque of Yazd (1364), as well as several of the mausoleums of Shah-i-Zinda in Samarkand. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period.|$|E
25|$|The Seljuq Empire {{introduced}} the domed enclosure {{in front of}} the mosque's mihrab, which would become popular in Persian congregational mosques, although domed rooms may have also been used earlier in small neighborhood mosques. The domed enclosure of the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, built in 1086-7 by Nizam al-Mulk, was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 Tāj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome {{at the opposite end of}} the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks. One of the largest Seljuq domes, built over the site of a Sassanian Fire Temple, was that of the Jameh Mosque of Qazvin with a span of 15.2 meters. The largest Seljuq domed chamber was the Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar, which had a large double shell, intersecting ribs over plain squinches, and an exterior elaborately decorated at the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> with arches and stucco work. The tomb of Sultan Sanjar, who reigned from 1117 to 1157, was damaged in the sack of Merv in 1221 by Tolui Khan.|$|E

New urban corridors, mega-urban and city regions are emerging across borders in the Americas. Frontiers are frequently <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> more significant in maps or landscapes rather than culturally. Due to the rapid externalisation of production and services, the flows of capital and new transport networks in Latin America, border economies are transforming their informal urban frameworks into dynamic systems of trade and migration.

It generates ‘instant urbanity’ that constructs transitory, elusive or spontaneous -randomised or not- geometries and types such as shantytowns, flea markets, junk-spaces, etc. This study reflects on the dynamic phenomena of informal conditions in border cities along the land-transport infrastructure of the Pan-American Highway through infrastructural urbanism, political geography and urban landscape’s studies.

Shared topics are: urban-rural partnerships, food planning, metropolitan polices and the territorial resilience of periurban areas. In the first part (the core of the paper) the paper underlines critical questions and establishes needs so as to move towards a new approach to development processes in periurban areas. The paper uses some key concepts to present the main outcomes: 1. Understanding complexity (multiscales in space) and dynamics (multiscales in time); 2. Identifying all the resources and opportunities; 3. Crosscutting and multi-issues. In the second part (in the final part) the paper proposes the “Ecotone” metaphor to support innovation in the approach to periurban areas. It is a “zone <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> between adjacent ecological systems, having a set of characteristics uniquely defined by space and time scales and by the strength of the interactions between adjacent ecological systems” (Hansen et al, 1992). In these terms, periurban areas may be assumed to be ecotonal <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> between urban and rural or natural systems. Using the concept of “ecotonal buffer of transition” to approach the periurban systems it is possible to connect main needs and critical questions underlined to a homogeneous framework and to emphasise on the strategic role that the peri-urban systems play for the future development of metropolitan regions oriented to a improvement of resilience of socio-ecosystems.

Such areas are located in <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> and are marked by industrial buildings, waterfronts and railroads, deteriorated buildings, and population of mixed nationalities. 	In spite of the criticisms of the concept of "delinquency area," it appears to serve a useful purpose. There is a danger that the concept may be used as an oversimplification of the problem of delinquency and crime, because of the extreme complexity of delinquency and crime causation and the inconclusive nature of most statistical data on this subject. Probably the concept of "delinquency area," if refined, would be of increasing use in research. However, {{it should be noted that}} delinquency may be of various types. Some of these types may exist in certain areas, and others may breed in other areas. If we wish to find out the dynamic factors that may cause a type or types of delinquent behavior, the concept will provide us with a starting point from which to look for these factors. For example: We may be able to find out the reasons why certain types of delinquency occur in others; or why they occur more often in certain areas than in other areas of the same city.
