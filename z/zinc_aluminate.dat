With reference to the calculated band gap of 5. 36 eV for MgAl 2 O 4, the systematic decrease in the gap is attributed to the presence of 3 d orbitals of Zn and Ga and the associated p–d hybridization in the upper valence band of <b>zinc</b> <b>aluminate</b> and gallate. Comparison of the contour maps of the electron localization function of ZnAl 2 O 4 and ZnGa 2 O 4 with that of MgAl 2 O 4 clearly shows the bonding to be less ionic in the zinc-based spinel oxides.

Department of Energy, Albany Research Center, is collaborating with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to evaluate the long-term performance and service life of these anodes. Laboratory studies were conducted on concrete slabs coated with 0. 5 mm (20 mil) thick, thermal-sprayed zinc anodes. The slabs were electrochemically aged at an accelerated rate using an anode current density of 0. 032 A/m 2 (3 mA/ft 2). Half the slabs were preheated before thermal-spraying with zinc; the other half were unheated. Electrochemical aging resulted in the formation at the zinc-concrete interface of a thin, low pH zone (relative to cement paste) consisting primarily of ZnO and Zn(OH) 2, and in a second zone of calcium and <b>zinc</b> <b>aluminates</b> and silicates formed by secondary mineralization. Both zones contained elevated concentrations of sulfate and chloride ions. The original bond strength of the zinc coating decreased due {{to the loss of}} mechanical bond to the concrete with the initial passage of electrical charge (aging). Additional charge led to an increase in bond strength to a maximum as the result of secondary mineralization of zinc dissolution products with the cement paste. Further charge led to a decrease in bond strength and ultimately coating disbondment as the interfacial reaction zones continued to thicken. This occurred at an effective service life of 27 years at the 0. 0022 A/m 2 (0. 2 mA/ft 2) current density typically used by ODOT in ICCP systems for coastal bridges.

Magnesium aluminate exhibits superior activity compared to <b>zinc</b> and cobalt-based <b>aluminates,</b> reaching full conversion {{and up to}} 81 [*]% yield of the 1 : 1 aldol product.

The use of {{advanced}} high-strength-steels (AHSS) is increasing in populary for almost every vehicle manufactures. They are {{result of a}} never-ending quest for material that allows different increases. AHSS vehicle panels are thinner, lighter and stronger that mild and many high-strength steel panels and accomplish the same desired effect for collision energy management. However the addition of AHSS used in vehicle construction has raised some concerns about the identity and characteristics of these steels, where they are commonly located, {{and to what extent}} they can be repaired. The best method to determine a steel type on a vehicle {{is to look at the}} vehicle-specific body repair information. High strength steel are generally defined as having tensile strengths between 270 and 700 MPa. Ultra high strength steels (UHSS) sre defined as steels with tensile strength greather than 700 MPa. Steel hardness is dependent on the alloying elements used during the manufacturing process. Carbon is the primary hardening element in steels, and is used varying percentages depending on the desired strength. However, many AHSS steels derive their strength from a combination of ferrite (more commonly known as iron) bainite, martensite, and retained austenite. AHSS grades have unique combinations of material and mechanical properties. Most have carefully selected chemical compositions and multiphase microstructures resulting from precisely controlled heating and cooling processes. Various strengthening mechanisms are employed to achieve a range of strength, ductility, toughness, and fatigue properties. Improved manufacturing processes have, in many cases, been key contributors to the implementation of these technologies. Conventional mild steel has a relatively simple ferritic microstructure; it typically has low carbon content and minimal alloying elements, is readily formed, and is especially sought for its ductility. Widely produced and used, mild steel often serves as a baseline for comparison of other materials. Conventional low- to high-strength steels include IF (interstitial free), BH (bake hardened), and HSLA (high-strength low-alloy). These steels generally have yield strength of less than 550 MPa and ductility that decreases with increased strength. Medium carbon steel 0, 3 % C to 0, 6 % C are selected for uses were higher mechanical properties are needed. All these medium carbon steels are suitable for wide variety of automotive application. Borron is an interstitial element and has a very low solubility in α-solid solution (≤ 0, 003 %). The primary function of borron additions to heat teratablesteels is to increase their hardness. In addition to the benefits of economy ond alloy conservation borron steel offer significan adventages of better extradability and machinability compared with borron-free steelsof equivalent hardness. Moreover steels containig borron are also less susceptible to quench cracking and distortion heat treatment. Consequently, borron-containing carbon and alloy steels are widely used in automotive, constructional, and various other application. Some investigators have reported that a small beneficial effect of borron on toughness after tempering to high hardness levels and a slightly adverse effect at lower hardness. On the other hand, for steels partialy hardened or unhardened, borron either did not have a beneficial effect on impact properties or apparently had an adverse effect. The maintain the desired B-hardness effect, strong nitrade-forming elements, such as Ti, Al, Zr and even B (at high levels) can be added to combine with the available nitrogen in B-treated steels. TiN is one of the stronest stable niitride. When using Ti to protect B, common steelmaking practice is to add at least the stoichiometric amount of Ti to precipitate any available N before B addition. The type of borron steel used on vehicle today has extremely high strength. Borron steel can have a yield point of about 1. 350 to 1, 400 N/mm 2. That’s about for times stronger than average high-strength steel. The application of borron steel to strengthen the weaker areas of the motor vehicle is obviously for the motor industry that is the correct path for them to take. Not only are there many other new steels all with differing strengths, there are also many new coatings whitch the steel has been treated with. Coatings such as <b>Zinc,</b> Bonazinc, Granocoating, <b>aluminated</b> sheet metals etc. USIBOR-BTR-Borron are also the same grade of steel, just with a different name, depending which country it comes from.

They are widely used to bond components or as next generation of MEMS igniters. In such systems, the reaction process is largely dominated by the outward migration of oxygen atoms from the CuO matrix toward the aluminum layers, and many recent studies have already demonstrated that the interfacial nanolayer between the two reactive layers {{plays a major role}} in the material properties. Here we demonstrate that the ALD deposition of a thin ZnO layer on the CuO prior to Al deposition (by sputtering) leads to a substantial increase in the efficiency of the overall reaction. The CuO/ZnO/Al foils generate 98 % of their theoretical enthalpy within a single reaction at 900 °C, whereas conventional ZnO-free CuO/Al foils produce only 78 % of their theoretical enthalpy, distributed over two distinct reaction steps at 550 °C and 850 °C.

40|$|Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} fuel for diesel engine. It is made from non-toxic, biodegradable, renewable resources, such as vegetable oils, animal fats or triglycerides. The most common process used to produce biodiesel is the transesterification reaction, also known as alcoholysis. In the transesterification reaction, triglycerides reacted with an alcohol to produce chemical compounds known as fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel). Glycerol is produced as the by-product in the transesterification reaction. The high cost of raw material and the process costs make the production of biodiesel {{more expensive than the}} petroleum diesel fuel. Transesterification reactions of pure corn oil and corn oil from Distiller 2 ̆ 7 s Dry Grain and Solubles were done in a pressurized batch reactor using methanol and ethanol as the alcohol reactants. Two different homogeneous catalysts (sodium methoxide and sodium hydroxide) and one heterogeneous catalyst (<b>zinc</b> <b>aluminate)</b> were tested to find the one that leads to the higher conversion of triglycerides to alkyl esters. The higher conversion achieved was with pure corn oil and the homogeneous catalyst sodium methoxide. A kinetic study was conducted to compare the initial reaction rates of methanol versus ethanol.

The poisoning effects of the reactants or CO 2 preadsorbed at 298 K have also been investigated. The results show that the H 2 -D 2 equilibration at low temperature is positively influenced by the presence of zinc ions on alumina but not by copper. The alumina support reduces the self-poisoning of the reactants.

The supports were obtained using a template assisted sol-gel route {{in order to achieve}} high surface areas. For the higher Zn loading (33 %), the calcination temperature has been raised from 600 °C to 800 °C then 1000 °C in order to evaluate thermal stability of these materials. Addition of zinc in alumina network leads to the formation of the spinel-type <b>zinc</b> <b>aluminate</b> structure. Chemical and physical characterizations of the catalysts have been confronted with the EtOH-SCR results, {{in order to understand the}} respective influence of the metal and support in nitrogen formation. This study shows that addition of zinc and modification of the support calcination temperature both play upon the Lewis acidic sites (LAS) concentration and density, determined by pyridine adsorption monitored by FTIR spectroscopy. This parameter is shown to be related with ammonia emission at T ≥ 350 °C. Besides, formation of nitrogen at T ≤ 350 °C is shown to be dependent on (i) the rate of acetaldehyde formation and (ii) the reactivity of acetaldehyde in SCR of NO reaction. Modification of the alumina support directly impacts these parameters.

Using these param-eters, a reasonable prediction is made for elastic and di-electric constants of ZnAl 2 O 4 and ZnGa 2 O 4. Both oxides are stable against decomposition to the component oxides. The fitting of the potential energy surface of these oxides to the equation of state yields the bulk modulus and its pres-sure derivative. The bulk modulus is predicted to be higher in ZnAl 2 O 4 as compared with that in ZnGa 2 O 4, whereas the pressure derivative remains the same in both oxides. On the other hand, the octahedral and tetrahedral volumes of ZnGa 2 O 4 are greater than those of ZnAl 2 O 4.

The calculated formation energies of the native defects suggest the preference of disorder in the cat-ion sublattice over the Schottky and Frenkel defects. Al-though the degree of disorder is expected to be small, it is likely to influence the vacancy population in the lattice.

High-resolution TEM studies reveal a non-uniform nanostructure of mechanosynthesized aluminate consisting of ordered grains surrounded or separated by disordered surface and interfacial regions. Due to the capability of 27 Al MAS NMR to probe the local environment of the Al cations, valuable insights into the short-range structure of ZnAl 2 O 4 on the Ångström length scale are provided. It is demonstrated that the as-prepared aluminate possesses a partly inverse spinel structure with a far-from equilibrium arrangement of cations and distorted polyhedra, which are spatially confined {{to the surface and}} interfacial regions with a volume fraction of ca. 50 % and a thickness of ca. 1 nm. The response of the nanostructured ZnAl 2 O 4 to subsequent thermal treatment is further investigated. It turned out that the thermally induced grain growth is accompanied by a release of microstrain, by a shrinkage of the lattice parameter, as well as by a variation in the oxygen parameter and metal–oxygen bond lengths. Evidence is given of the thermally induced redistribution of cations approaching their equilibrium positions.

AZO was considered as an alternative low-cost transparent conductive oxide material instead of indium tin oxide in photovoltaic cells and displays[1, 2].

As a wide-bandgap semiconductor material, ZnAl 2 O 4 was also used as host of phosphors doping with Mn and rare earth ions[5, 6]. AZO and ZnAl 2 O 4 thin films have been deposited by different techniques[7], such as sol–gel coating[8], pulsed laser deposition[9], chemical vapor deposition[10], radio-frequency sputtering[11], and atomic layer deposition (ALD)[12, 13]. Recently, ALD technology has been employed to grow transparent conductive AZO films with low resistivity in the order of 10 − 3 Ω·cm[14, 15]. However, the correlation between the optical and the electrical properties in the ALD of AZO films has not yet been understood very well. Meanwhile, ZnAl 2 O 4 film deposited on porous or nanostructure supporting materials by ALD technology may have large surface area and potential applications in catalysts and phosphors. However, since the ZnAl 2 O 4 films need to be synthesized by annealing ZnO/Al 2 O 3 composite films at elevated temperatures, the preferable crystallization of ZnO in the ALD of ZnO/Al 2 O 3 composite films may strongly influence the purity of the synthesized ZnAl 2 O 4 films.

It {{is very important for}} various applications to be able to control morphology of low dimensionality nanostructures. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, synthesis and characterization of well aligned ZnO nanorods and nanorods/nanowalls nanostructures and the understanding of growth morphology are described. By using a simple vapour phase transport (VPT) and condensation process, we have grown low dimensionality ZnO nanostructures on a-plane sapphire with gold (Au) catalyst. The catalytic growth of various nanostructures is controlled by the conventional vapour liquid solid (VLS) mechanism. We demonstrate that morphology of ZnO nanostructure could be controlled by varying the parameters viz., substrates, growth duration, growth temperature, and Au catalyst thickness. Temperature dependent photoluminescence analysis indicates the ZnO nanostructures are of excellent optical quality. In the case of samples showing both nanorod and nanowall morphologies, we observe an intense excitonic emission at 3. 37 eV at low temperature and the intensity decays rapidly with increasing the temperature. We propose this peculiar behaviour is due to high surface to volume ratio. associated with the nanorod/nanowall systems. The use of such nanostructures in room temperature optoelectronic devices appears to be dependent on the control or elimination of such surface effects.

40|$|AbstractAll {{processing}} systems of waterworks produce {{a substantial amount}} of sludge with the residues of treatment chemicals used as coagulants (commonly aluminum-based). Landfill is usually considered as a common disposal strategy for sludge and the incineration residues in most metropolitan areas worldwide However, the aluminum and/iron contained in the sludge will be largely wasted in landfills, and the metal ions might also be leached out and cause further pollution to the surrounding areas. Therefore, the need for “waste-to-resource” makes the increasing incentive to develop economically viable reuse and recycling options. The major elements in the incinerated ash of municipal wastewater sludge are aluminum and silicon detected from XRF results, which are major components for glass-ceramics. Therefore, in this study, the incineration ash of waterworks sludge was reused as raw materials to produce the glass-ceramics, and the metal transformation mechanisms were further explicated via the combination of advanced techniques. The ZnAl 2 O 4 spinels were produced with large quantity when sintering zinc oxide with ashes of waterworks sludge.
