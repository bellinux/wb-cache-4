5|$|To {{ensure the}} mission to steal a <b>Zero</b> <b>Point</b> Module is a success, Dr. McKay (David Hewlett) proposes to use Dr. Weir (Torri Higginson) and her nanites to access the Asuran {{collective}} and guide them; should the Asurans take her over, McKay would activate a kill switch on the nanites, which would also effectively kill Weir. With their experimental jumper ready, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) leaves Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) in command of Atlantis. The jumper's hyperdrive works and they arrive over the Asuran homeworld (M7R-227). With Weir's access, Sheppard and Ronon (Jason Momoa) easily steal the <b>Zero</b> <b>Point</b> Module. McKay then finds a code that will cause the Asurans to attack the Wraith and convinces Sheppard to upload a programme to reactivate this dormant code.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E

By the modified method, we can obtain accurate <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> by simple iterations. We also extend this problem to a multivariable case. Applications to the spectral analysis of M/G/ 1 type Markov chains are discussed. Important characteristics of these chains, e. g., the boundary vector and the matrix G, {{can be derived}} from <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of a matrix function and corresponding null vectors. Numerical results are shown. 1...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> energy {{of the system is}} too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E

30|$|The {{theory of}} {{monotone}} operators has {{appeared as a}} powerful and effective tool for studying a wide class of problems arising in different branches of social, engineering, and pure sciences in a unified and general framework. There is a notion about monotone operators {{and it is one}} of generalized sums of two monotone operators; see [15, 16] and the references therein. In recent years, monotone operators have received a lot of attention for treating <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of monotone operators and fixed point of mappings which are Lipschitz continuous; see [17 – 22] and the references therein. The first algorithm for approximating the <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the maximal monotone operator was introduced by Martinet [23]. He considered the proximal point algorithm for finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of a maximal monotone operator. Then, Passty [24] introduced a forward-backward algorithm method for finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the sum of two operators. There are various applications of the problem of finding <b>zero</b> <b>points</b> of the sum of two operators; see [25 – 29] for example and the references therein.|$|R

25|$|Thermodynamic {{temperature}} {{is defined by}} the third law of thermodynamics in which the theoretically lowest {{temperature is}} the null or <b>zero</b> <b>point.</b> At this point, absolute zero, the particle constituents of matter have minimal motion and can become no colder. In the quantum-mechanical description, matter at absolute zero is in its ground state, which is its state of lowest energy. Thermodynamic temperature is often also called absolute temperature, for two reasons: one, proposed by Kelvin, that it does not depend on the properties of a particular material; two that it refers to an absolute zero according to the properties of the ideal gas.|$|E
25|$|At any {{temperature}} {{greater than}} absolute zero, microscopic potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly converted into one another, but the sum remains constant {{in an isolated}} system (cf. table). In the classical picture of thermodynamics, kinetic energy vanishes at zero temperature and the internal energy is purely potential energy. However, quantum mechanics has demonstrated that even at zero temperature particles maintain a residual energy of motion, the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> energy. A system at absolute zero is merely in its quantum-mechanical ground state, the lowest energy state available. At absolute zero a system of given composition has attained its minimum attainable entropy.|$|E

The Jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally {{high levels of}} n-heptane in its resin, for which reason its distillate was designated as the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> for one octane rating. Floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components, and n-nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses. Emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane, pentane, and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels, though they are not {{generally considered to be}} a major component of biogenic air pollution.|$|E

25|$|Physical chemists often model {{bonding with}} the quantum {{harmonic}} oscillator, simplifying a hydrogen-hydrogen bond as two balls {{connected by a}} spring. The quantum harmonic oscillator is itself based on Hooke's Law and acts as a good approximation of the Morse potential that accurately describes bonding. Modeling hydrogen and deuterium in a chemical reaction demonstrates the energy distributions of isotopes in products and reactants. Lower energy levels for the heavier isotope deuterium can be explained mathematically by the harmonic oscillator's dependence on the inverse of the reduced mass, denoted μ. Thus, a larger reduced mass is a larger denominator and thus a smaller <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> energy and a lower energy state in the quantum well.|$|E
25|$|The {{street system}} of Peoria {{is based on}} the city of Phoenix {{traditional}} grid system, with most roads oriented either north-south or east-west. The <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> is in downtown Phoenix at Central Avenue and Washington Street. Since Peoria is always west of zero, its north-south numbered Streets are Avenues. Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6km) apart (until you are north of roughly Pinnacle Peak Road). The one-mile (1.6km) blocks are divided into approximately 800 house numbers although this varies. 83rd Avenue, being 8300 West. The numbers in Phoenix start at Central Avenue at a half-mile increment, going west to 7th Avenue ½ mile from Central but considered the arterial. Then the numbers go to 19th (1 mile from 7th), 27th, 35th, 43rd, 51st, 59th, 67th (in many places Peoria's eastern border), 75th, 83rd, 91st, 99th, and so on. In northern Peoria streets are more curvilinear and begin to not follow the north-south route due to rivers, mountains, and terrain challenges. The northern end of the city does still follow the alignment theory and still has blocking according to Phoenix.|$|E

Lorne (Kavan Smith) and a squadron of F-302s are sent to temporarily block the beam using a large moon fragment, so that shield power can be redirected into the stardrive. However, the beam resumes as the city lifts off, briefly grazing the central tower before the shield can be restored. Weir is severely injured and is taken to the infirmary by Beckett's replacement, Jennifer Keller (Jewel Staite). Atlantis jumps into hyperspace, but the stardrive unexpectedly shuts down well before they reach their destination. McKay realizes that they are marooned in deep space, with only 24 hours before the shield runs out of power and the city's occupants are exposed to space.|$|E
