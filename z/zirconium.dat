5|$|<b>Zirconium</b> carbide and <b>zirconium</b> nitride are {{refractory}} solids. The carbide is {{used for}} drilling tools and cutting edges. <b>Zirconium</b> hydride phases are also known.|$|E
5|$|At room {{temperature}} <b>zirconium</b> exhibits a hexagonally close-packed crystal structure, α-Zr, which changes to β-Zr, a body-centered cubic crystal structure, at 863°C. <b>Zirconium</b> {{exists in the}} β-phase until the melting point.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium must {{be removed}} from <b>zirconium</b> for nuclear {{applications}} because hafnium has a neutron absorption cross-section 600 times greater than <b>zirconium.</b> The separated hafnium {{can be used for}} reactor control rods.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{transition}} metals, <b>zirconium</b> forms a {{wide range}} of inorganic compounds and coordination complexes. In general, these compounds are colourless diamagnetic solids wherein <b>zirconium</b> has the oxidation state +4. Far fewer Zr(III) compounds are known, and Zr(II) is very rare.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>zirconium</b> {{is composed}} of five isotopes. 90Zr, 91Zr, 92Zr and 94Zr are stable, although 94Zr is predicted to undergo double beta decay (not observed experimentally) with a half-life of more than 1.10×1017years. 96Zr has a half-life of 2.4×1019years, and is the longest-lived radioisotope of <b>zirconium.</b> Of these natural isotopes, 90Zr is the most common, making up 51.45% of all <b>zirconium.</b> 96Zr is the least common, comprising only 2.80% of <b>zirconium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several details {{contribute}} {{to the fact that}} there are only a few technical uses for hafnium: First, the close similarity between hafnium and <b>zirconium</b> makes it possible to use <b>zirconium</b> for most of the applications; second, hafnium was first available as pure metal after the use in the nuclear industry for hafnium-free <b>zirconium</b> in the late 1950s. Furthermore, the low abundance and difficult separation techniques necessary make it a scarce commodity.|$|E
5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to <b>zirconium</b> powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} <b>zirconium</b> tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% <b>zirconium</b> oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for <b>zirconium</b> exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, <b>zirconium</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, <b>zirconium</b> is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that <b>zirconium</b> is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of <b>zirconium</b> is 1855°C (3371°F), and {{the boiling point}} is 4371°C (7900°F). <b>Zirconium</b> has an {{electronegativity}} of 1.33 on the Pauling scale. Of the elements within the d-block with known electronegativities, <b>zirconium</b> has the fifth lowest electronegativity after hafnium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zirconium</b> is a {{by-product}} of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne, the price for unwrought <b>zirconium</b> metal decreased from $39,900 to $22,700 per ton. <b>Zirconium</b> metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zirconium</b> {{is a good}} nuclear fuel-rod {{cladding}} metal, {{with the}} desirable properties of a very low neutron capture cross-section and good chemical stability at high temperatures. However, because of hafnium's neutron-absorbing properties, hafnium impurities in <b>zirconium</b> would cause it to be far less useful for nuclear-reactor applications. Thus, a nearly complete separation of <b>zirconium</b> and hafnium is necessary for their use in nuclear power. The production of hafnium-free <b>zirconium</b> is the main source for hafnium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zirconium</b> is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and {{malleable}} metal that is solid at room temperature, {{though it is}} hard and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, <b>zirconium</b> is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. <b>Zirconium</b> is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35K.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zirconium</b> is {{relatively}} abundant in S-type stars, {{and it has}} been detected in the sun and in meteorites. Lunar rock samples brought back from several Apollo missions to the moon have a high <b>zirconium</b> oxide content relative to terrestrial rocks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zirconium</b> {{tungstate}} has {{the unusual}} property of shrinking in all dimensions when heated, whereas most other substances expand when heated. Zirconyl chloride {{is a rare}} water-soluble <b>zirconium</b> complex with the relatively complicated formula Cl8.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{reserves}} {{have been}} infamously estimated to last under 10 years by one source {{if the world}} population increases and demand grows. In reality, since hafnium occurs with <b>zirconium,</b> hafnium can always be a byproduct of <b>zirconium</b> extraction {{to the extent that}} the low demand requires.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium was {{separated}} from <b>zirconium</b> through repeated recrystallization of the double ammonium or potassium fluorides by Valdemar Thal Jantzen and von Hevesey. Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer {{were the first to}} prepare metallic hafnium by passing hafnium tetraiodide vapor over a heated tungsten filament in 1924. This process for differential purification of <b>zirconium</b> and hafnium is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|If the {{abundance}} of elements in Earth's crust is compared for titanium, <b>zirconium</b> and hafnium, {{the abundance}} decreases with increase of atomic mass. Titanium is the seventh most abundant metal in Earth's crust and has an abundance of 6320ppm, while <b>zirconium</b> has an abundance of 162ppm and hafnium has only an abundance of 3 ppm.|$|E
5|$|Klaproth also {{discovered}} <b>zirconium</b> in the mineral zircon in 1789 and named {{it after the}} already known Zirkonerde (zirconia).|$|E
5|$|Many metals such as <b>zirconium</b> {{undergo a}} similar {{reaction}} with water {{leading to the}} production of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Materials {{fabricated}} from <b>zirconium</b> {{metal and}} ZrO2 {{are used in}} space vehicles where resistance to heat is needed.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} hafnium and <b>zirconium</b> {{are used in}} super alloys to improve the {{properties}} of those alloys.|$|E
5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. <b>Zirconium</b> powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. OSHA recommendations for <b>zirconium</b> are 5mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10mg/m3 short-term exposure limit. Only limited data exists on the toxicology of hafnium.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{metal and}} its alloys {{have a wide}} range of applications, where the {{corrosion}} resistance, the heat stability and the low density (light weight) are of benefit. The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and <b>zirconium</b> has been in nuclear reactors. <b>Zirconium</b> has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, <b>zirconium</b> (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in nuclear reactors, while hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors, because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with <b>zirconium</b> having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, <b>zirconium</b> is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and {{it is commonly used}} for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E
5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and <b>zirconium</b> occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the <b>zirconium</b> in zircon is replaced by hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Electrodes {{containing}} <b>zirconium</b> oxide (or zirconia) {{increase the}} current capacity while improving arc stability and starting and increasing electrode life.|$|E
5|$|Five {{isotopes}} of <b>zirconium</b> {{also exist}} as metastable isomers: 83mZr, 85mZr, 89mZr, 90m1Zr, 90m2Zr and 91mZr. Of these, 90m2Zr has the shortest half-life at 131nanoseconds. 89mZr {{is the longest}} lived with a half-life of 4.161minutes.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective nuclear charge by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing it between the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in <b>zirconium</b> ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and <b>zirconium,</b> as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between <b>zirconium</b> and hafnium made a separation difficult and, without knowing what to look for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of <b>zirconium,</b> and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles <b>zirconium</b> and {{is found in}} many <b>zirconium</b> minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, {{though it was not}} identified until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element to be discovered. Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to <b>zirconium</b> (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by <b>zirconium</b> impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is {{estimated}} to make up about 5.8 ppm of the Earth's upper crust by mass. It does not exist as a free element on Earth, but is found combined in solid solution with <b>zirconium</b> in natural <b>zirconium</b> compounds such as zircon, ZrSiO4, which usually has about 1–4% of the Zr replaced by Hf. Rarely, the Hf/Zr ratio increases during crystallization to give the isostructural mineral hafnon (Hf,Zr)SiO4, with atomic Hf > Zr. An old (obsolete) name {{for a variety of}} zircon containing unusually high Hf content is alvite.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and <b>zirconium.</b> At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the elements were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below <b>zirconium.</b> The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion battery {{efficiencies}} – Yet-Ming Chiang and {{his group}} at MIT showed a substantial improvement {{in the performance of}} lithium batteries by boosting the material's conductivity by doping it with aluminium, niobium and <b>zirconium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, {{can be used}} as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or disintegrating after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, <b>zirconium</b> and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or <b>zirconium</b> significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium diboride (ReB2) {{is a hard}} {{compound}} {{having the}} hardness {{similar to that of}} tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or <b>zirconium</b> diboride.|$|E
5|$|The heavy mineral sands ore {{deposits}} of the titanium ores ilmenite and rutile yield {{most of the}} mined <b>zirconium,</b> and therefore also most of the hafnium.|$|E
5|$|The most {{conclusive}} aqueous chemistry {{studies of}} rutherfordium {{have been performed}} by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, <b>zirconium,</b> {{as well as the}} pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, {{in a manner similar to}} hafnium and <b>zirconium.</b>|$|E
