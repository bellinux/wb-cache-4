40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of molecular wave packets through the simplest two types of avoided crossings of electronic energy levels in a limit where {{the gap between the}} eigenvalues shrinks as the nuclear masses are increased. For these types of avoided crossings, the electron energy levels essentially depend on only one of the nuclear configuration parameters, as is the case for all diatomic molecules. We find that the transition probabilities are of order 1 and are determined by the Landau [...] <b>Zener</b> <b>formula.</b> CPT- 95 /P. 3215 # Partially Supported by National Science Foundation Grant DMS [...] 9403401 + Supported by Fonds National Suisse de la Recherche Scientifique, Grant 8220 - 037200 # Permanent address: Centre de Physique Theorique, CNRS Marseille, Luminy Case 907, F- 13288 Marseille Cedex 9, France and PHYMAT, Universite de Toulon et du Var, B.

40|$|We {{consider}} three dimensional {{finite element}} computations of thermoelastic damping ratios of arbitrary bodies using Zener's approach. In our small-damping formulation, unlike existing fully coupled formulations, the calculation is split into three smaller parts. Of these, the first sub-calculation involves routine undamped modal analysis using ANSYS. The second sub-calculation takes the mode shape, and solves {{on the same}} mesh a periodic heat conduction problem. Finally, the damping coefficient is a volume integral, evaluated elementwise. In the only other decoupled three dimensional computation of thermoelastic damping reported in the literature, the heat conduction problem is solved much less efficiently, using a modal expansion. We provide numerical examples using some beam-like geometries, for which <b>Zener's</b> and similar <b>formulas</b> are valid. Among these we examine tapered beams, including the limiting case of a sharp tip. The latter's higher-mode damping ratios dramatically exceed those of a comparable uniform beam...|$|R
