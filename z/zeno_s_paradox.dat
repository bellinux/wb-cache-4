40|$|The {{blame for}} the {{semantic}} and set-theoretic paradoxes is often placed on self-reference and circularity. Some years ago, Yablo [1985; 1993] challenged this diagnosis, by producing a paradox that 2 ̆ 7 s liar-like but {{does not seem to}} involve circularity. But is Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> really non-circular? In a recent paper, Beall [2001] has suggested that there are no means available to refer to Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> without invoking descriptions, and since Priest [1997] has shown that any such description is circular, Beall concludes that Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> itself is circular. In this paper, we argue that Beall 2 ̆ 7 s conclusion is unwarranted, given that (1) descriptions are not the only way to refer to Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox,</b> and (ii) {{we have no reason to}} believe that because the description involves self-reference, the denotation of the description is also circular.

40|$|To {{borrow a}} {{colorful}} phrase from Kant, this dissertation offers a prolegomenon to any future semantic theory. The dissertation investigates Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> omega-liar <b>paradox</b> and draws the following consequence. Any semantic theory that accepts {{the existence of}} semantic objects must face Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox.</b> The dissertation endeavors to position Yablo 2 ̆ 7 s omega-liar in a role analogous to that which Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> has for the foundations of mathematics. Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> showed that if we wed mathematics to sets, then because of the many different possible restrictions available for blocking the paradox, mathematics fractionates. There would be different mathematics. This is intolerable. It is similarly intolerable to have restrictions on the `objects 2 ̆ 7 of Intentionality. Hence, {{in the light of}} Yablo 2 ̆ 7 s omega-liar, Intentionality cannot be wed to any theory of semantic objects. We ought, therefore, to think of Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> as a natural language paradox, and as such we must accept its implications for the semantics of natural language, namely that those entities which are `meanings 2 ̆ 7 (natural or otherwise) must not be construed as objects. To establish our result, Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> is examined in light of the criticisms of Priest (and his followers). Priest maintains that Yablo 2 ̆ 7 s original omega-liar is flawed in its employment of a Tarski-style T-schema for its truth-predicate. Priest argues that the paradox is not formulable unless it employs a 2 ̆ 2 satisfaction 2 ̆ 2 predicate in place of its truth-predicate. Priest is mistaken. However, it will be shown that the omega-liar paradox depends essentially on the assumption of semantic objects. No formulation of the paradox is possible without this assumption. Given this, the dissertation looks at three different sorts of theories of propositions, and argues that two fail to specify a complete syntax for the Yablo sentences. Purely intensional propositions, however, are able to complete the syntax and thus generate the paradox. In the end, however, the restrictions normally associated with purely intensional propositions begin to look surprisingly like the hierarchies that Yablo sought to avoid with his paradox. The result is that while Yablo 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> is syntactically formable within systems with formal hierarchies, it is not semantically so...|$|R

If introspection and perception are analogous, the relationship between beliefs and introspective knowledge of them is merely contingent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Carcinogenesis affects {{not only}} humans but almost all {{metazoan}} species. Understanding the rules driving {{the occurrence of}} cancers in the wild is currently expected to provide crucial insights into identifying how some species may have evolved efficient cancer resistance mechanisms. Recently the absence of correlation across species between cancer prevalence and body size (coined as Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox)</b> has attracted a lot of attention. Indeed, the disparity between this null hypothesis, where every cell is assumed to have an identical probability to undergo malignant transformation, and empirical observations is particularly important to understand, {{due to the fact}} that it could facilitate the identification of animal species that are more resistant to carcinogenesis than expected. Moreover it would open up ways to identify the selective pressures that may be involved in cancer resistance. However, Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> relies on several questionable assumptions, complicating the interpretation of the divergence between expected and observed cancer incidences. DISCUSSIONS: Here we review and challenge the different hypotheses on which this paradox relies on with the aim of identifying how this null hypothesis could be better estimated in order to provide a standard protocol to study the deviation between theoretical/theoretically predicted and observed cancer incidence. We show that due to the disproportion and restricted nature of available data on animal cancers, applying Peto 2 ̆ 7 s hypotheses at species level could result in erroneous conclusions, and actually assume the existence of a paradox. Instead of using species level comparisons, we propose an organ level approach to be a more accurate test of Peto 2 ̆ 7 s assumptions. SUMMARY: The accuracy of Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> assumptions are rarely valid and/or quantifiable, suggesting the need to reconsider the use of Peto 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>paradox</b> as a null hypothesis in identifying the influence of natural selection on cancer resistance mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|This study charts an {{alternative}} history for American avant-garde film through the philosophical paradoxes that structure literary modernism. I argue the American avant-garde {{more than any}} other movement is able to express how the experience of film becomes an extension of anxieties and affects that arise most poignantly in modernism. Major figures of the avant-garde from those P. Adams Sitney terms “lyricists” like Stan Brakhage and Marie Menken to “structuralists” like Hollis Frampton and Michael Snow use representations of subjective and linguistic crisis characteristic of the literary modernism of Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Beckett, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound and Charles Olson, to conceive of film as an apparatus that redefines modern subjectivity by pointing specifically to the fraught relationship between the spectator and a world in flux. I question the objectivity of Sitney 2 ̆ 7 s distinction between structuralism and lyricism by showing how both kinds of film utilize a self-reflexivity that produces a mise en abyme in which the world viewed constantly exceeds its own inscription. ^ Towards an “Infinite Cinema:” American Avant-Garde Film and its Modernist Inheritance understands the affects of the American avant-garde 2 ̆ 7 s theorizing of film in the context of subjective desires and anxieties that accompanied film 2 ̆ 7 s genesis in the 19 th century.

The period covered is from 1924 to 1955. A vector-autoregressive approach is taken because it makes no a priori assumptions about variable relationships. The causal structure of the vector-autoregressive model alone empirically determines the relationships of the relevant variables. New theoretical models are developed which help to explain the empirical findings;Among the theoretical models developed, one offers a potential solution to the paradox of investment in black school by whites {{in an era of}} segregation.
