The Slender Hypersonic Aerothermodynamic Research Program (SHARP) was initiated by NASA Ames to demonstrate sharp, passive leading edge designs for hypersonic vehicles, incorporating new ultra-high temperature ceramics. This paper will discuss how SHARP will provide an important technology base for making sharp body hypersonic vehicle designs a reality, and how this activity fits into NASA's overall program for developing next generation reusable launch vehicles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the exhaust of the switch of inverter bridge arm, the auxiliary resonant net was imbed in the circuit structure which lead to cost ascension and credibility descend. This text discusses to design a DC/AC converter based on simplex single voltage source high frequency chain inversion technology, the output is 0. 9 KW/ 115 V/ 400 Hz. The pulse direct current voltage has been created by forward circuit and absorption branch which is controlled by voltage feedback in the input terminal of inverter bridge arm. The soft-switch of inverter bridge arm using DPM has been realized by controlling open or close of switch electric circuit on the invert bridge arm at pulse voltage for <b>zero</b> <b>stages.</b> It is not adding topology complicated degree of main circuit which could assure {{the reliability of the}} inverter...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{genome-wide}} association study (GWAS) {{focused on}} low-order interactions between pairwise single-nu-cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant main effects. Little is known how high-order interactions effect, especially one among the SNPs without main effects regulates quantitative traits. Within the frameworks of linear model and generalized linear model, the LASSO with coordinate descent step {{can be used}} to simultaneously analyze thousands and thousands of SNPs for normal and discrete traits. With consideration of high-order interactions among SNPs, a huge number of genetic effects make the LASSO failing to work under the presented condition of computation. Forward LASSO analysis is, therefore, proposed to shrink most of genetic effects to be <b>zeros</b> <b>stage</b> by stage. Simulation demonstrates that our proposed method could be used instead of the LASSO method for full model in mapping high-order interactions. Application of forward LASSO method is provided to GWAS for carcass traits and meat quality traits in beef cattle...|$|R

We also provide an algorithm for obtaining a large class of realizable jump sequences and classes of Gorenstein edge ideals achieving high regularity...|$|R
40|$|Background: During development, neurons {{modify their}} axon growth mode {{switching}} from an elongating phase, {{in which the}} main axon stem reaches the target territory through growth cone-driven extension, to an arborising phase, when the terminal arbour is formed to establish synaptic connections. To investigate the relative contribution of cell-autonomous factors and environmental signals in the control of these distinct axon growth patterns, we examined the neuritogenesis of Purkinje neurons in cerebellar cultures prepared at elongating (embryonic day 17) or arborising (postnatal day <b>zero)</b> <b>stages</b> of Purkinje axon maturation. Methodology/Principal Findings: When placed in vitro, Purkinje cells of both ages undergo an initial phase of neurite elongation followed {{by the development of}} terminal ramifications. Nevertheless, elongation of the main axon stem prevails in embryonic Purkinje axons, and many of these neurons are totally unable to form terminal branches. On the contrary, all postnatal neurites switch to arbour growth within a few days in culture and spread extensive terminal trees. Regardless of their elongating or arborising pattern, defined growth features (e. g. growth rate and tree extension) of embryonic Purkinje axons remain distinct from those of postnatal neurites. Thus, Purkinje neurons of different ages are endowed with intrinsic stage-specific competence for neuritic growth. Such competence, however, can be modified by environmental cues. Indeed, while exposure to the postnatal environment stimulates the growth of embryonic axons without modifying thei...|$|R

5000|$|Jet {{engines and}} other gas turbine engines are often uprated {{by adding a}} zero-stage, {{sometimes}} written [...] '0' stage, {{to the front of}} a compressor.At a given core size, adding a stage {{to the front of the}} compressor not only increases the cycle overall pressure ratio, but increases the core mass flow. A further uprating may be done by adding another stage in front of the previously-added <b>zero</b> <b>stage,</b> in which case the new one may be known as a zero-zero stage.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{adding a}} zero (i.e. front) stage to the compressor, to {{increase}} overall pressure ratio, will require {{an increase in}} shaft speed (to maintain the same blade tip Mach number {{on each of the}} original compressor stages, since the delivery temperature of each of these stages will be higher than datum). The increase in shaft speed raises the centrifugal stresses in both the turbine blade and disc. This together with increases in the hot gas and cooling air(from the compressor) temperatures implies a decrease in component lives and/or an upgrade in component materials. Adding a <b>zero</b> <b>stage</b> also induces more airflow into the engine, thereby increasing net thrust.|$|E
