5000|$|A <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> or garden blot {{is a type}} of Southern blot that {{demonstrates}} the similarity between specific, usually protein-coding, DNA sequences of different species. A <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> compares animal species while a garden blot compares plant species. The purpose of the <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> is to detect the conservation of the gene(s) of interest throughout the evolution of different species.|$|E
50|$|FISH {{can also}} be used to compare the genomes of two {{biological}} species, to deduce evolutionary relationships. A similar hybridization technique is called a <b>zoo</b> <b>blot.</b> Bacterial FISH probes are often primers for the 16s rRNA region.|$|E
30|$|Southern blot and <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> {{analyses}} were conducted under similar conditions. In brief, a 10 -μg aliquot of genomic DNA from each species was digested with Eco RI for <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> analyses. For Southern blot analyses, each 10 -μg aliquot of genomic DNA of Indian muntjac was digested with one of five different restriction endonucleases (Bam HI, Eco RI, Hae III, Hind III, and Xho I). The digests were electrophoretically fractionated on 1 % agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane (Biodyne), and hybridized with 32 P-labeled satVI- 1 C 5 DNA. The conditions used for hybridization, filter washing, and autoradiography have been described previously (Li et al. [2000 a]).|$|E
40|$|A {{somatic cell}} hybrid mapping panel that defines seven {{regions of the}} long arm and one region of the short arm of human {{chromosome}} 6 has been developed. Utilizing this panel, 17 NotI boundary clones from a NotI linking library were regionally assigned to the long arm of chromosome 6. The majority of these clones (11) were found to localize within band regions 6 q 24 -q 27. The nonuniform distribution of NotI sites may indicate a cluster of HTF islands and likely represents a coincidence of coding sequences in this region of chromosome 6. Cross-hybridization of these linking clones to DNA from other species (<b>zoo</b> <b>blots)</b> provides further evidence for transcribed sequences in 7 of the NotI clones. These NotI clones were also used to identify corresponding NotI fragments using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, facilitating further physical mapping of this region. Finally, regional assignment of five polymorphic probes to the long arm of chromosome 6 is also presented. These hybrids and probes should facilitate {{the construction of a}} physical and genetic linkage map to assist in the identification of disease loci along chromosome 6...|$|R
40|$|Minisatellites are tandemly {{repeated}} DNA sequences {{found throughout}} the genomes of all eukaryotes. They are regions often prone to instability and hence hypervariability; thus repeat unit sequence is generally not conserved beyond closely related species. We have studied the minisatellite located in intron 9 of the human glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) gene (also known as neuroleukin, autocrine motility factor, maturation and differentiation factor) and have found, by <b>Zoo</b> <b>blotting</b> coupled with PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, that similar repeat units are present in seven other species of mammal. There is also evidence {{for the presence of}} the minisatellite in chicken. The repeat unit {{does not appear to be}} present at any other locus in these genomes. Minisatellite DNA has been reported to be involved in recombination activity, control of gene expression of nearby gene(s) (both transcriptional and translational), whilst others form protein coding regions. The high level of conservation exhibited by the GPI minisatellite, coupled with the unique location, strongly suggests a functional role. Our results from transient and stable transfections using luciferase reporter constructs have shown that the GPI minisatellite region can act to increase transcription from the SV 40 promoter, CMV promoter and the human GPI promoter...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{regulation}} of BRCA 1 gene expression and the potential importance of dysregulation of this gene in bn!ast and ovarian cancer, we have examined the 52 ̆ 7 region of the human BRCA 1 gene in detail, We have identified a new gene, NBR 2, which is partially related to the NBR 1 gene (formerly known as 1 A 1 - 3 B and mapping directly adjacent to the pseudo-BRCA 1 gene) and which lies {{head to head with}} the BRCA 1 gene, The physical distance between the transcription start sites of the NBR 2 and BRCA 1 genes is 218 bp, suggesting that regulation of the expression of both genes may be co-ordinated through a hi-directional promoter, The NBR 2 gene contains five exons spanning a genomic region of similar to 30 kb between the BRCA 1 and pseudo-BRCA 1 genes, Northern analysis showed that the NBR 2 gene is expressed in all the tissues examined, The NBR 2 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 112 amino acids and is predicted to encode a protein of similar to 12 kDa, Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the NBR 2 gene failed to identify any mutations in either breast or ovarian cancer, suggesting that if the NBR 2 gene is involved in the development of these cancers, other mechanisms for tumorigenesis may exist, Hybridisation of NBR 2 probes to <b>zoo</b> <b>blots</b> showed that the NBR 2 gene is present in human and other primates, No hybridisation to DNA from other species was observed, suggesting that genomic elements controlling BRCA 1 expression may differ between species...|$|R
30|$|We microdissected and microcloned a novel cervid {{satellite}} family {{designated as}} satellite VI from the pericentromeric/centromeric {{region of the}} chromosome X[*]+[*] 3 of Indian muntjac by chromosome microdissection and colony hybridization. A FISH study showed that the novel satellite VI was mainly present in the distal pericentromeric region of the Indian muntjac chromosome X[*]+[*] 3. It was more distal than cervid satellite I, which has been {{considered to be an}} old satellite DNA (Buntjer et al. [1998]). This newly found satellite VI DNA is organized in monomeric repeats each comprising an 11 -bp unit with the consensus sequence ATCACGTGGGA. The sequence of Indian muntjac BAC clone showed that an approximately 5  kb array of satellite VI DNA adjoined with approximately 3  kb of interspersed repetitive sequences, such as LINEs, SINEs, and LTRs. Based on the model of progressive proximal expansion, more ancient centromeric DNA might exist in more distal pericentromeric regions and is most likely organized in monomeric repeats interrupted by transposons (Schueler and Sullivan [2006]; Schueler et al. [2005]). Therefore, we suggest that the novel pericentromeric satellite VI is likely the vestige of an ancient centromeric DNA. Furthermore, we detected a 1.5 -kb satellite VI hybridization band in the genomes of deer, goat, and bull but few faint hybridization bands in the genome of boar using <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> analysis. The observed differential intensity of hybridization signals agrees that deer (Cervidae) is phylogenetically more close to goat and bull (Bovidae) than boar (Suidae) (Price et al. [2005]). Also, the result of <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> suggested that the satellite VI may already have existed in the ancestor of Artiodactyla family. Additionally, the flanking L 1 elements of satellite VI arrays shared 78 % identity with the L 1 - 1 _Ttr found in the genome of Dolphin (Jurka [2008]). Unfortunately, the Dolphin DNA is not available in our laboratory; we cannot perform a <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> study to verify whether the satellite VI DNA is presented in Dolphin species (Cetartiodactyla family) as well.|$|E
40|$|We {{recently}} {{helped to}} complete the sequence of human chromosome 21 {{at a very high}} level of accuracy. Using this sequence we identified two novel genes, designated DSCR 9 and DSCR 10, in the so-called Down Syndrome Critical Region (DSCR) by computational gene prediction and subsequent cDNA cloning. Both DSCR 9 and DSCR 10 are expressed preferentially in testis and encode functionally unknown proteins with 149 and 87 amino acid residues, respectively. <b>Zoo</b> <b>blot</b> analysis suggested that both genes are exclusive to primate genomes such as chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, crab-eating monkey and African green monkey but are not present in other non-primate mammals including mouse, dog, cat, and chicken. Comparative genomic sequence analysis of DSCR 9 and DSCR 10 with the corresponding mouse syntenic region confirmed the lack of these genes in the mouse. These results strongly suggest that DSCR 9 and DSCR 10 have emerged as a new class of gene in the primate lineage during evolution...|$|E
40|$|The Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) locus is {{localized}} on chromosome 9 q 13 in {{an interval}} less than 1 Mb between markers D 9 S 202 /FR 1 and FR 5. We cloned the FRDA candidate region in YACs, {{and we started}} a systematic search for transcripts in this region using the cDNA selection approach. Several overlapping cDNA clones mapping near the telomeric end of the FRDA minimum genetic region were isolated. <b>Zoo</b> <b>blot</b> analysis demonstrated that these cDNAs are well conserved among different species. A transcript of 4. 8 kb was identified by hybridization to a Northern blot containing human brain poly(A) + RNA. Partial sequence of these clones showed 100 % homology with a previously described anonymous brain cDNA (EST 01251). A search for mutations of this gene in FRDA patients and carriers is in progress. No mutations {{have been found to}} date, but we have identified a DNA polymorphism. This polymorphism was nonrecombinant with the disease in a previously described FRDA pedigree in which a recombination had occurred with more telomeric markers.

30|$|Based on {{the results}} of <b>zoo</b> <b>blot,</b> FISH, and copy number analysis, we {{observed}} that the considerably differential amount of satellite VI element presents in the genomes of Indian muntjac, Formosan muntjac, Formosan Sambar, Formosan sika, and Asian red deer (all belong to Old World deer) while it is less abundant or even eliminated in roe deer, black tailed deer, caribou, and Chinese water deer (New World deer) (Pitra et al. [2004]; Hernandez Fernandez and Vrba [2005]). The characterization of copy number variants of satellite VI in the related deer species agrees with the satellite DNA library model as the consequence of concerted evolution (Fry and Salser [1977]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]). The variable FISH signals of satellite VI were observed between some homologous chromosomes in Formosan muntjac, Formosan Sambar deer, and Formosan sika deer. Such different FISH signal strengths/intensities of satellite VI between the homologous chromosomes were most likely due to unequal crossing-over events. It has been suggested that a short monomer size, such as the 11 -bp monomer size of satellite VI in this study, offers ample opportunities for unequal crossing-over during meiosis and results in copy number variation between homologous chromosomes (Smith [1976]; Ugarkovic and Plohl [2002]).|$|E
40|$|Human {{and mouse}} MEA 1 /Mea 1 {{is flanked by}} two {{overlapping}} genes, a novel PEAS/Peas in a head-to-head orientation and PPP 2 R 5 D/Ppp 2 r 5 d in a tail-to-tail orientation making a P eas-Mea 1 -P pp 2 r 5 d overlapping gene complex (PMP-complex). Genomic <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> analyses and database searching revealed that Mea 1 exists only in mammals, while Peas and Ppp 2 r 5 d are conserved in eukaryotes. Mea 1 and Peas are transcribed from a testis-expressed bidirectional promoter. Mea 1 -P pp 2 r 5 d overlapping segment (MPOS) contains polyadenylation signals for both genes and shows marked conservation throughout mammals. Furthermore, the MPOS occupies 3 ′-region of transcripts of both genes is expected to form a clover-like intramolecular structure. Mouse genomic library Screening and database searches identified two MPOS-derived sequences in Odf 2 gene and RP 23 - 86 H 7 cosmid clone, respectively, in which MPOS might be a core segment for the retropositions. Thus, a key role of MPOS, a short transposable element containing polyadenylation signals on both strands, {{in the formation of}} the Mea 1 during mammalian evolution is suggested.

40|$|We {{searched for}} sex-specific DNA {{sequences}} {{in the male}} and female genomes of African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) by comparative random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assays performed on pooled DNA samples. Two sex-linked RAPD markers were identified from the male DNA pool and confirmed on individual samples, showing good agreement with phenotypic sex. Both markers were isolated, cloned and characterized. The first marker (CgaY 1) was nearly 2. 6 [*]kb long, while the length of second one (CgaY 2) was 458 [*]bp. Southern blot analysis with a CgaY 1 probe showed strong hybridizing fragments only in males and not in females under stringent conditions, indicating the presence of multiple copies of CgaY 1 in the male genome. When tested by <b>zoo</b> <b>blot</b> on the genomes of two closely related species from the Clariidae family, CgaY 1 hybridized to the DNA of Heterobranchus longifilis and generated a faint male-specific band at low stringency. CgaY 2 produced similar hybridization pattern in both sexes of C. gariepinus, C. macrocephalus and H. longifilis. Specific primers were designed to the sequences and the markers were amplified in multiplex PCR reactions together with a control band common to all individuals. This allowed for rapid, molecular sexing of the species {{on the basis of a}} simple three band (male) versus one band (female) pattern. According to our knowledge these are the first sex-specific DNA markers isolated from a siluroid fish species...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} a novel family of about 10 - 50 human endogenous retrovirus elements (HERVs) and have characterized one family member (HERV-KC 4). This retrovirus element is integrated within intron 9 of and complement C 4 A genes and also in some C 4 B genes, and is a principal contribution to interlocus and interallelic length heterogeneity of C 4 genes. The HERV-K(C 4) sequence has a typical retrovirus structure with elements of gag, pol and env domains, flanked by two long terminal repeats (LTRs) and is similar to type A, B and D retroviruses. Multiple termination codons preclude the existence of long open reading frames, suggesting that the HERV-K(C 4) sequence is no longer functional. <b>Zoo</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization reveals that New World monkeys appear to lack sequences similar to HERV-K(C 4), suggesting that integration has occurred after the divergence of Old and New World monkeys. Retrotransposition of prototype viruses is presumed to {{have led to the}} amplification and integration {{of the members of the}} family in different loci, which in humans, appear to be dispersed over several chromosomes. The absence of the HERV-K(C 4) element in some C 4 B genes in both humans and orangutangs indicate that the retrovirus inserted into the C 4 A gene after the duplication of the cluster. Subsequent spread of the HERV-K(C 4) sequence to C 4 B genes presumably occurred by interlocus sequence exchange mechanisms, such as unequal crossover and gene conversion-like mechanisms...|$|E
