50|$|Numeric columns {{have one}} punch in rows 0-9, {{possibly}} a sign overpunch in rows 11-12, {{and can be}} sorted {{in a single pass}} through the sorter. Alphabetic columns have a <b>zone</b> <b>punch</b> in rows 12, 11, or 0, a digit punch in one of the rows 1-9, and can be sorted by passing {{some or all of the}} cards through the sorter twice on that column. For more details of punched card codes see Punched card#IBM 80-column punched card formats and character codes.|$|E
5000|$|The mapping from <b>zone</b> <b>punches</b> to {{high-order}} bits. All codes translate no <b>zone</b> <b>punches</b> to a {{bit pattern}} of 00, but some encode the <b>zone</b> <b>punches</b> in 12-11-0 order, preserving alphabetical order, while others use 0-11-12 order, {{resulting in a}} partially reversed alphabet.|$|R
50|$|The top two {{positions}} of a column are called <b>zone</b> <b>punches,</b> 12 (top) and 11. For decimal data the lower ten positions represent (from top to bottom) the digits 0 through 9. An arithmetic sign {{can be specified}} for a decimal field by overpunching the field's rightmost column with a zone punch: 12 for plus, 11 for minus (CR). For Pound sterling pre-decimalization currency a pence column represented the values zero through eleven; 10 (top), 11, then 0 through 9 as above. An arithmetic sign can be punched in the adjacent shilling column. <b>Zone</b> <b>punches</b> had other uses in processing, such as indicating a master card.|$|R
50|$|Other special {{characters}} and punctuation marks {{were added to}} the card code, involving as many as three punches per column (and in 1964 with the introduction of EBCDIC as many as six punches per column). The 083 and 084 sorters recognized these multiple digit or multiple <b>zone</b> <b>punches,</b> sorting them to the error pocket.|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the IBM card in 1928, IBM created a code capable of representing alphanumeric information, later adopted by other manufacturers. This code represents the numbers 0-9 by a single punch, and uses multiple punches for upper-case letters and special characters. A letter has two <b>punches</b> (<b>zone</b> 12,11,0 + digit 1-9); most special characters have two or three <b>punches</b> (<b>zone</b> none + digit 2-7 + 8).|$|R
5000|$|In 1931 IBM began {{introducing}} multiple punches for upper-case {{letters and}} special characters. A letter has two <b>punches</b> (<b>zone</b> 12,11,0 + digit 1-9); most special characters {{have two or}} three <b>punches</b> (<b>zone</b> none + digit 2-7 + 8); a few special characters were exceptions (in EBCDIC [...] "&" [...] is 12 only, [...] "-" [...] is 11 only, and [...] "/" [...] is 0 + 1). With these changes, the information represented in a column by a combination of zones 11 and digits 1-9 is dependent on the use of that column. For example, the combination [...] "12-1" [...] is the letter [...] "A" [...] in an alphabetic column, a plus signed digit [...] "1" [...] in a signed numeric column, or an unsigned digit [...] "1" [...] in a column where the [...] "12" [...] have some other use. The introduction of EBCDIC in 1964 allowed columns with as many as six <b>punches</b> (<b>zones</b> 12,11,0,8,9 + digit 1-7). IBM and other manufacturers used many different 80-column card character encodings. A 1969 American National Standard defined the punches for 128 characters and was named the Hollerith Punched Card Code (often referred to simply as Hollerith Card Code), honoring Hollerith.|$|R
50|$|Punching distance: The {{punching}} distance {{refers to}} the <b>zone</b> where <b>punches</b> can be thrown, {{and this is the}} distance from the furthest jab to the closest hook, as long as no grappling is taking place. In addition to punches, this distance often also allows for elbows and knees. Boxing is a combat sport that concerns itself exclusively with the punching distance. However many martial arts, particularly those that employ extreme close range fighting (for example Wing Chun and Southern Praying Mantis) train ranges within punch range, but do not necessarily employ clinching techniques. This collection of ranges is often called the in-fighting range.|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} and results of experimental {{study on the}} test specimens of the stress-strain condition of flat reinforced concrete slabs of a girderless framework at punching by columns of square and rectangular section are presented. The punching shear strength of slabs at rectangular columns can be lower than at square columns with a similar length of the control perimeter. The research of influence of a form of a column cross-section on the stress-strain condition of a reinforced concrete slab in a <b>punching</b> <b>zone</b> is conducted. The comparative analysis of distribution of concrete and reinforcement deformations of reinforced concrete slabs on column perimeter depending on a ratio of the sides of cross section is made. The results of the research of сracking in a <b>zone</b> of <b>punching</b> of reinforced concrete slabs are presented here. Results of the conducted research allow expanding the base of experimental data of the considered subject and promoting improvement of modern positions {{in the theory of}} power resistance of reinforced concrete. New experimental data received in the research corresponded with the earlier offered hypothesis that in a slab there is a zone of the constrained deformation located along the perimeter around the rectangular column...|$|R

Thus the letter A, 12,1 in the punched card character code, was encoded B,A,1.|$|R
40|$|Finite Element {{software}} is developed which models deformation of poro-elastic-plastic materials. This {{software is}} used to model the effects of pore pressure generated during punch indentation on the failure {{of high and low}} permeability rocks. The growth of the plastic <b>zone</b> under the <b>punch</b> as a function of load is investigated. A Confinement Transition Load is defined based on a change in character of the growth of the plastic zone. It is shown that in highly permeable rocks, deformation induced pore pressures are always small and do not affect failure. In rocks of low permeability, dilatational hardening effects are measurable, but not large at loads below the Confinement Transition Load...|$|R
5000|$|EBCDIC [...] was devised in 1963 and 1964 by IBM and was {{announced}} {{with the release}} of the IBM System/360 line of mainframe computers. It is an eight-bit character encoding, developed separately from the 7-bit ASCII encoding scheme. It was created to extend the existing Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Interchange Code, or BCDIC, which itself was devised as an efficient means of encoding the two <b>zone</b> and number <b>punches</b> on punched cards into 6 bits. The distinct encoding of 's' and 'S' (using position 2 instead of 1) was maintained from punched cards where it was desirable to not have hole punches too close to each other to ensure the integrity of the physical card.|$|R
40|$|Sequential {{sheet metal}} forming {{processes}} can result in the accumulation of work hardening and damage effects in the workpiece material. The mechanical strength of the final component depends on the “evolution” of these two characteristics in the different production steps. The punching process, which is usually {{in the beginning of}} the production chain, has an important impact on the stress, strain and damage states in the <b>punched</b> <b>zones.</b> It is essential that the influence of these mechanical fields be taken into account in the simulation of the forming sequence. In order to evaluate the evolution of each phenomenon, and in particular damage accumulation in the forming process, it is essential to characterize the punching process. The objective of this work is to understand and identify the physical damage mechanisms that occur during the punching operation and to establish relevant numerical models to predict the fracture location. The effect of the punch–die clearance on mechanical fields distribution is also discussed in this work...|$|R
40|$|The revolutionary {{technology}} of flat slab construction by using hollow sphere {{to replace the}} ineffective concrete {{in the center of}} the slab (Bubble Beck) has many advantages, beside it is reduce the material, the load, lower the coast and increasing the span length it is also a green technology, And Since the punching shear capacity is one of the most interesting properties of flat slab, the influence of the cavities due to using the plastic balls on the punching behavior of self compacted concrete was study in this paper. also the effect of strengthening the <b>punching</b> <b>zone</b> by using different percentage of steel fiber (0. 8 %, 1 %) on the maximum punching load and deflection were included. In building, the slab is very important structural member to make a space and it is one of the largest member consuming concrete. As the people getting interest of long span buildings the slab thickness is on the increase. The increasing of slab thickness makes slab heavier, and it leads to increase column and base size. Thus, it makes building consume more materials such as concrete and steel...|$|R
40|$|Punching {{shear failure}} {{is a major}} problem {{encountered}} in the design of reinforced concrete flat plates. The utilization of shear reinforcement via shear studs or other means has become a choice for improving the punching shear capacity. In this study, a new alternative of reinforcement, the introduction of rebar mesh at the middle of flat plate thickness covering the <b>punching</b> <b>zone</b> and anchored outside this zone, is proposed. Nevertheless, in this investigation, the proposed reinforcement system is examined for interior columns only. An experimental work consisting of eight specimens, of normal and high strength concrete, and an expanded analytical work using the finite element method had been carried out in order to investigate the effect of this additional reinforcement for both normal strength and high strength concrete. The computer program ANSYS-V 12. 0 has been utilized in the finite element analysis. The obtained results indicate that, the proposed shear reinforcement system has a positive effect in the enhancement of both the punching shear capacity and the strain energy of interior slab–column connection of both normal and high strength concrete. The general finite element software ANSYS can be used successfully to simulate the punching shear behavior of reinforced concrete flat plates...|$|R
40|$|Better {{wear and}} {{strength}} properties {{are required for}} upholstery textiles, this being the main distinction {{in opposition to the}} clothing textiles. It is crucial that the fabrics carry not only the best tensile properties, but are also investigated for the deformation properties, both inside and outside, by considering friction and loads appearing in the process of upholstery. Upholstery fabrics must be chosen considering the tensile properties and the deformational behaviour at low-stress loading, therefore the aim of this work was to investigate and evaluate the upholstery materials performance properties under uniaxial and biaxial deformations in respect to low-stress and breaking loading. Experimental analysis of upholstery materials uniaxial low-stress properties defined by the KES-F testing system was performed and the effect of the properties of upholstery materials determined by the KES-F testing system upon creep deformation processes was defined in this dissertation. Creep and relaxation processes of upholstery materials in respect to the anisotropy level under uniaxial loadings were analyzed. The effect of fused upholstery system structure upon the variations of its spatial shape under biaxial punching was defined as well as the effect of uniaxial pre-tension level upon biaxial punching deformation of fused upholstery systems was evaluated. Finally, the effect of friction in the contact <b>zone</b> between the <b>punch</b> and upholstery material surface during biaxial deformation process was determined...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental research}} results and their analysis {{in respect of}} flat reinforced concrete slabs resting on point supports or soil in case of concentrated punching force. However the conducted researches have shown a number of incompatibilities accepted in computational model standards that appear {{in the form of}} critical parameters in the <b>punching</b> <b>zone</b> and configuration of computational (critical) sections in comparison with an actual pattern of slab crack formation and their collapse in the places of concentrated force application. Moreover, the computational methods do not take into account at all an influence of longitudinal reinforcement on both principal axis of the building frame or take it into account this phenomenon by empirical dependence indirectly. In view of the above-mentioned facts an accumulation of new experimental data is considered as an expedient process with the purpose to identify a physical pattern of flat reinforced concrete slabs operation under concentrated punching force. The paper makes it possible to revise a calculative methodology and, preserving a high reliability, it also permits to improve efficiency of a floor construction of the whole framework. It has been determined that longitudinal reinforcement of reinforced concrete slabs is actively involved in their work under concentrated punching force and exerts a prominent influence on their resistance to punching force. The paper presents a possible approach pertaining to evaluation of a longitudinal reinforcement influence on resistance of reinforced concrete slabs to punching force with due account of regulations of the appropriate standardized documents.  </p...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} flow fields in slow deformation of a granular ensemble, composed of hard spherical, monodisperse particles. The model system is that of indentation by a flat punch under approximately plane-strain conditions. In the experiments, the region around the punch is imaged in-situ using a high speed imaging system. Flow parameters such as spatial velocity and strain are characterized using a hybrid image analysis technique. The deformation field shows various interesting features that resemble the deformation fields in the indentation of both metals and fluids. The formation of a stagnant zone right under the punch is strikingly similar to the slipline field solution for plane-strain punch indentation in plastically deforming metals. Also, regions of highly rotational flow are observed {{in the vicinity of}} the punch, resembling vortices and recirculation zones past sharp corners in fluid flow. These features illustrate the complex microscopic mechanisms underlying the deformation of granular materials, which precludes precise analysis using simple continuum constitutive laws. To better understand the microscopic mechanisms, we present numerical simulations of punch indentation using the discrete particle non-smooth contact dynamics method. By modelling the particles as perfect rigid bodies with simple Coulomb friction, it is seen that the experimental flow patterns are reproduced semi-quantitatively. The full 3 D displacement field confirms the existence of local regions of non-zero vorticity and the formation of a stagnation <b>zone</b> under the <b>punch.</b> This simple model problem perhaps illustrates the difficulty involved in formulating a micromechanical description of the deformation, based on the connectivity of the grain network...|$|R
5000|$|The {{greatest}} drama at {{the highest}} level of play in the qualifying ties, came in two Asian zone battles, both involving traditional power Malaysia. In the first of these Malaysia and Japan alternated tight victories in perhaps the longest and closest tie in Thomas Cup history. Malaysia won the last doubles match in three games to advance to the <b>zone</b> final, but <b>Punch</b> Gunalan's 17-16 third game win over Japan's Junji Honma on the second night of play shows how narrow was the difference between victory and defeat. If Malaysia had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat against Japan, however, it proceeded to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory against its next opponent, Thailand. Up three matches to none, Malaysia's undoing began when Tan Aik Huang, who had played an earlier singles, suffered a cramp and was carried off the doubles court to end the first night's play at 3 - 1. Though Aik Huang played the next day he lost both of his matches, and Gunalan's win at third singles was offset by Tan Aik Mong's singles loss. In the final and decisive match Gunalan and the veteran Ng Boon Bee, the world's top doubles team just two seasons earlier, seemed unnerved and were routed by veteran Sangob Rattanusorn and young star Bandid Jaiyen. The two Thais had also played singles and emerged as the heroes of an upset victory. Conversely, it was a sad Thomas Cup exit for three of Malaysia's [...] "greats," [...] Ng Boon Bee, Tan Aik Huang, and Punch Gunalan.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} automotive structures made of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) {{is often seen}} reduced {{by the presence of}} cut edges. An attempt is made to assess and quantify the initial damage state and the damage evolution during mechanical testing of a punched edge and a machined edge via a recently developed 3 D imaging technique called synchrotron radiation computed laminography. This technique allows us to observe damage in regions of interest in thin sheet-like objects at micrometer resolution. In terms of new experimental mechanics, steel sheets having sizes and mechanical boundary conditions of engineering relevance can be tested {{for the first time with}} in situ 3 D damage observation and quantification. It is found for the investigated DP 600 steel that the fracture <b>zone</b> of the <b>punched</b> edge is rough and that needle-shape voids at the surface and in the bulk follow ferrite-martensite flow lines. During mechanical in situ testing the needle voids grow from the fracture zone surface and coalesce with the sheared zone. In contrast, during in situ mechanical testing of a machined edge the damage starts away from the edge (∼ 800 μ m) where substantial necking has occurred. Three-dimensional image analysis was performed to quantify the initial damage and its evolution. These data can be used as input and validation data for micromechanical damage models. To interpret the experimental findings in terms of mechanical fields, combined surface digital image correlation and 3 D finite element analysis were carried out using an elasto-plastic constitutive law of the investigated DP steel. The stress triaxiality and the accumulated plastic strain were calculated in order to understand the influence of the edge profile and the hardening of the cutting-affected zone on the mechanical fields...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{the present}} study, the {{deformation}} {{mechanics of the}} springback phenomenon in the L-bending ofsheet-metal was examined and a new method that could efficiently reduce springback in the L-bending of sheetmetalwas proposed. Design/methodology/approach: Both the finite element analysis and experiments were performed to analyzethe deformation mechanics {{and the effects of}} process parameters on the formation of springback. Findings: The axial stress distribution in the bent sheet obtained by the finite element simulations was classifiedinto three zones: the bending <b>zone</b> under the <b>punch</b> corner (<b>zone</b> I), unbending zone next to the bending zone(zone II), and the stress-free zone (zone III). It is found that the stress distribution in zone I is quite uniformand hence has little influence on the springback. While the stress distribution in zone II results in a positivespringback, whereas the stress distribution in zone III produces a negative springback. The total springbacktherefore depends on the combined effect of those produced by zone II and zone III. A reverse bend approachthat can efficiently reduce springback was also proposed to reduce the springback in the L-bending process. Thefinite element analysis performed {{in the present study was}} validated by experiments as well. Research limitations/implications: Although the reverse bend approach can reduce springback efficiently, itmay cause uneven surface at the die corner area. Hence, the use of reverse bend approach must be cautious ifhigh surface quality is required. Practical implications: The proposed reverse bend approach provides the die design engineer with a novel ideato reduce the springback occurred in the L-bending of sheet metals. Originality/value: In addition to the reverse bend approach, the analysis of defomation mechanics ofspringback performed in the present study also provides researchers with a better understanding of the formationof springback...|$|R
