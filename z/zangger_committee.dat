40|$|This {{research}} analyzes China's socialization in {{the international}} Arms Control and Disarmament (ACD) field. Constructing the theoretical framework of "dynamic interaction between state and institution" in order to reconcile the "problem of agend and structure" debated in IR, the research identified the formative effects on China {{during the last two}} decades in general and in the post-CTBT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty) period in particular, which engaged China {{in the international}} ACD institutions and regimes. The socialization effects on China are recognized at the three levels: China's norm internalization (perspective), institutionalization (domestic institutions) and comprehensive participation in the international ACD regimes and institutions. The evidence based on documentary works and a few interviews suggests that the engagement in international institutions is promoting a Chinese nexus in these institutions, creating new Chinese interests and socializing China into building consensus to resolving international ACD issues. The evolution and differentiation of Chinese perspectives on ACD issues resulted into the view that stresses China's role and responsibility within the regimes. The "new security concept" based on mutual security and restructuring of domestic ACD institutions in the late 1990 s were the products of the socialization that "dynamic interaction" fostered. During the CTBT talks, China showed the norm-complying and establishing attitude. China also committed to the nuclear test ban norm by sustaining the nuclear test moratorium since 1996. The socialization process led China to more comprehensive and constructive participation in the international ACD institutions and regimes as China joined the <b>Zangger</b> <b>Committee</b> and supported the FMCT (Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty) after its accession to the CTBT. As constructivists argue that state can reshape structure by process. China reconstituted its interests and identities throughout the interaction with the international ACD institutions. China's more proactive role within ACD institutions and regimes will give it more constitutive socialization influence, but the role is basically entrenched in "state enhancement functionalism. ...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the basic}} rules in trade law is the freedom of trade. However, such rule {{encounters}} some limits when the object of trade is constituted by strategic and sensitive items, among which there are the so-called 'dual-use' goods and technologies. Despite the difficulty to define them, {{there is a common}} understanding that they are materials and items normally used for civilian/peaceful purposes but which may also have military application. Because of their 'sensitiveness' and their risk to affect security, health, the environment etc., their trade needs to be controlled. One form of controlling their trade is represented by the imposition of sanctions to be adopted in case of violation of trade rules. In our understanding, there are three categories of sanctions: (a) ‘supranational’ ones, enacted at the international and European Union (EU) level, which are addressing the whole States (‘comprehensive’ sanctions, such as embargoes, boycotts and financial measures), or specific individuals or groups involved in legal activities (‘targeted’ or ‘smart’ sanctions, such as asset freezes and travel bans); (b) ‘implementing’ ones, which are enacted at national level. They consist of administrative, civil or criminal rules implementing legally binding/‘hard law’ supranational rules (i. e., national sanctions for violation of international or regional embargoes or other trade sanctions), and those implementing politically binding or ‘soft law’ rules (i. e., national sanctions for the violation of export control regimes, which are the guidelines for dual-use trade, provided by international forum of countries within the <b>Zangger</b> <b>Committee,</b> the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Australia Group, the Wassenaar Arragement and the Missile Technology Control Regime, and at the EU level through the Regulation 428 / 2009); and (c) ‘unilateral sanctions’ and ‘countermeasures’, which are National autonomous measures against another State or the single citizens of that State. In this paper, the focus is posed on the first category only. It aims to analyse - with a comparative approach - on the one hand, the types of measures adopted {{at the level of the}} United Nations (UN) on the basis of Chapter VII of the UN Charter and through the Security Council resolutions and, on the other one, the restrictive measures introduced within the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU...|$|E
40|$|During an October 2008 {{speech to}} the Nuclear Energy Agency, IAEA Director General Mohamed Elbaradei stated that more than fifty {{countries}} had expressed interest in developing nuclear power programs to meet their growing energy demands. ' This phenomenon, referred to commonly as the nuclear renaissance, has now {{become one of the}} most significant security challenges facing the international community. Under Article IV of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), non-nuclear weapons states have the right to develop nuclear energy as well as to receive transfers of nuclear technology as long as they use their programs strictly for peaceful purposes. Following the entry into force of the NPT two nuclear export control regimes were developed with the aim of controlling and managing the trade of nuclear materials from suppliers to receivers as well as multilaterally coordinating nuclear safeguards activities. While the two regimes, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the <b>Zangger</b> <b>Committee,</b> have played an important role in facilitating the goals of the NPT, the regimes lack the international legal mandate and enforcement power to act in a coordinated and effective manner to meet the challenges presented by the current nuclear proliferation threats facing the international community. In order to better understand the shortcomings of the global nuclear export control system, this article will evaluate the international legal context of existing controls. This necessitates a study of the documents and practices of both organizations in order to determine how a lack of legal foundation affects their ability to execute non-proliferation activities. In addition, evaluating the effectiveness of nuclear export controls necessitates a serious analysis of the circumstances in which they function and the elements that give them force, such as the international non-proliferation legal context, legal aspects of the regimes' organization, and the national implementation of the guidelines agreed to by regime members. The article determines the status of nuclear export controls in international law by evaluating their potential basis in international treaty law and international customary law. To achieve this task, it will be composed of two main parts. The first part evaluates nuclear export control regimes in international treaty law based on their organization, documents, and relationship with international legal non-proliferation tools. The second part evaluates the concrete activities of these regimes in the international sphere in order to determine whether state practice provides a basis for any status of nuclear export control regimes in customary international law. Evaluating the international legal status of nuclear export control regimes will allow for a deeper analysis in the conclusion of this article pertaining to current challenges to the nuclear export control system...|$|E
