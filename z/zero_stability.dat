50|$|Of {{all modern}} strain gauge alloys, {{constantan}} is the oldest, {{and still the}} most widely used. This situation {{reflects the fact that}} constantan has the best overall combination of properties needed for many strain gauge applications. This alloy has, for example, an adequately high strain sensitivity, or gauge factor, which is relatively insensitive to strain level and temperature. Its resistivity (49.0 x 10−8 Ω·m) is high enough to achieve suitable resistance values in even very small grids, and its temperature coefficient of resistance is fairly low. In addition, constantan is characterized by good fatigue life and relatively high elongation capability. However, constantan tends to exhibit a continuous drift at temperatures above 65 °C (150 °F); and this characteristic should be taken into account when <b>zero</b> <b>stability</b> of the strain gauge is critical over a period of hours or days. Constantan is also used for electrical resistance heating and thermocouples.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} for investigating {{the stability and}} damping present in centrally preloaded radially symmetric multi-mass flexible rotor bearing systems is presented. In general, one needs to find the eigenvalues of the linearized perturbation equations, though <b>zero</b> frequency <b>stability</b> maps may be found by solving as many simultaneous non-linear equations as there are dampers; {{and in the case}} of a single damper, such maps may be found directly, regardless of the number of degrees of freedom. The technique is illustrated for a simple symmetric four degree of freedom flexible rotor with an unpressurized damper. This example shows that whereas <b>zero</b> frequency <b>stability</b> maps are likely to prove to be a simple way to delineate multiple solution possibilities, they do not provide full stability information. Further, particularly for low bearing parameters, the introduction of an unpressurized squeeze film damper may promote instability in an otherwise stable system...|$|R

Secondly, the thermal-modal model of the cylinder resonator with several defects such as mass imbalance, frequency split (FS), and geometry errors are developed by ANSYS. Simulation results show that with the increase of temperature, angular positions of the vibration mode axes obviously change, which leads to a dramatic zero bias drift. Finally, several major influence factors on the angular position stability of vibration mode axes, including frequency split, geometry errors, thermal elastic modulus coefficient (TEMC) and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) are analyzed in detail.

40|$|Protein folding {{mechanisms}} are probed experimentally using single-point mutant perturbations. The relative {{effects on the}} folding (ϕ-values) and unfolding (1  - ϕ) rates are used to infer the detailed structure of the transition-state ensemble (TSE). Here we analyze kinetic data on >  800 mutations carried out for 24 proteins with simple kinetic behavior. We find two surprising results: (i) all mutant effects are described by the equation:. Therefore all data are consistent with a single ϕ-value (0. 24) with accuracy comparable to experimental precision, suggesting that the structural information in conventional ϕ-values is low. (ii) ϕ-values change with stability, increasing in mean value and spread from native to unfolding conditions, and thus cannot be interpreted without proper normalization. We eliminate stability effects calculating the ϕ-values at the mutant denaturation midpoints; i. e., conditions of <b>zero</b> <b>stability</b> (ϕ 0). We then show that the intrinsic variability is ϕ 0  =  0. 36  ±  0. 11, being somewhat larger for β-sheet-rich proteins than for α-helical proteins. Importantly, we discover that ϕ 0 -values are proportional to {{how many of the}} residues surrounding the mutated site are local in sequence. High ϕ 0 -values correspond to protein surface sites, which have few nonlocal neighbors, whereas core residues with many tertiary interactions produce the lowest ϕ 0 -values. These results suggest a general mechanism in which the TSE at <b>zero</b> <b>stability</b> is a broad conformational ensemble stabilized by local interactions and without specific tertiary interactions, reconciling ϕ-values with many other empirical observations...|$|E
