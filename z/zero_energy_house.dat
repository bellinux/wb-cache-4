40|$|A {{comparative}} study is being conducted {{to measure the}} actual performance of a <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>House</b> design. Ideally, a <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> produces {{as much energy as}} it consumes in a year’s time. Two identically-sized houses (1610 sq ft), constructed side-by-side in southwest Las Vegas, Nevada, are equipped with a network of sensors that measure every aspect of energy usage in each home. One house is used as a baseline (standard comparison) house and was built using conventional construction techniques. The other house, the <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>House,</b> employs many energy saving features, solar power generation, and supplemental solar water heating. Both houses are utilized as model homes in an actual housing development, so it is reasonable to believe that both will experience similar and consistent usage. The data logged onsite are automatically collected every day (in an almost real-time basis) and sent via telephone connection to the Center for Energy Research at UNLV for analysis. Results are posted on the web. This paper describes the differences in construction details between the two houses.

40|$|The Net <b>Zero</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>House</b> (NZEH) {{presented}} in this paper is an energy efficient house that uses available solar technologies to generate at least as much primary energy as the house uses {{over the course of the}} year. The computer simulation results show that it is technically feasible to reach the goal of NZEH in the cold climate of Montreal. In terms of the life cycle energy use, which considers the operating and embodied energy of the house, the energy payback time is 8. 4 - 8. 7 Â years, when the NZEH is compared with an average house that complies with the provincial code. The energy payback ratio of the combisystem is 3. 5 - 3. 8 compared with the heating system of conventional house. By converting solar energy, the combisystem supplies at least 3. 5 times more energy than the energy invested for manufacturing and shipping the system.

40|$|Receiving some of {{the highest}} levels of solar {{irradiance}} in the world, Australia is an ideal location for widespread implementation of solar energy technologies and smart buildings, designed {{to take advantage of the}} excellent solar resource. This thesis explores the concept of achieving a zero energy residential dwelling in the Sydney climate through energy efficient and passive solar design coupled with a photovoltaic/thermal (PVT) system. A simple house was modelled to determine the optimal values of the key design variables that would result in a low space energy consumption and low life cycle cost. The optimised low energy house resulted in an annual space energy consumption of 252 kWh, representing a 94 % reduction compared with the NSW BASIX standard and requiring only minimal heating and cooling. Results for the best performing low energy house models are shown to have a lower life cycle cost compared with a conventional brick veneer house model designed to meet the NSW BASIX building requirements. A PVT air system was investigated as an option for transforming the low energy house into a <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> with an emphasis on the winter performance. A holistic system design approach was used to design an experimental PVT air system that would maximise the thermal and electrical energy outputs and minimise the required fan energy. Simple and detailed theoretical models were presented as a physically meaningful representation of the PVT collector and provide a good match with experimental results. The optimum air flow rate range was determined to be 0. 04 - 0. 06 kg/s. m 2 which produced a temperature rise of 5 - 8 °C at midday for a typical sunny winter's day in Sydney. A unique result was achieved whereby the additional PV energy generated due to ventilation is in excess of the fan energy requirement. This was made possible through energy efficient hydraulic design using large ducts to minimise the pressure loss and selection of a fan that would produce high air flow rates at a low input power. The PVT system also demonstrated good potential for night purge ventilation cooling in summer. An affordable <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> in Sydney is therefore a very achievable goal with currently available building materials, energy efficiency measures and solar energy technologies...|$|E

40|$|Minimum energy {{efficiency}} standards for new housing are typically informed by regulatory impact statements, underpinned by lifecycle costing (LCC) analysis. While LCC techniques are empirical and testable, such analysis {{is informed by}} considerable assumptions on key parameters. These assumptions are often heavily contested in the literature and by built environment stakeholders, but there is limited exploration of their implications within wider policy developments. This paper addresses this gap by analysing {{the impact of a}} number of assumptions and their implications within a LCC analysis of <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>housing</b> options in Victoria, Australia. The results show that changes to assumptions on key parameters have significant impact on LCC outcomes, with associated policy implications. Analysis shows that there is a requirement for a detailed review and debate of the assumptions applied within LCC analysis which is used to inform the development of minimum {{energy efficiency}} standards in Australia and internationally. In particular, as housing is a long-lived infrastructure, the issue regarding the use of assumptions based upon historical data or data based upon future predictions is critical to the development of policy and energy efficiency standards...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a thermal analysis {{and design of}} a fully equipped, air-conditioned, <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>house</b> located in a desert compound at 24. 5 ° latitude. Unlike previous designs the home is two floors high, which makes the balancing of energy supply and demand even more challenging. The roof of the house carries an array of retractable Photovoltaic modules and cover. During day light hours the modules convert the incident sun energy into useful electrical power, while shielding the roof from direct sun-radiation. At night time, the roof cover and modules are retracted to expose the roof to the cool night-sky, thus enhancing cooling. The paper employs time-dependent modeling of Solar input and heat transfer to predict the roof, wall and window temperature distributions and cooling loads, as well as energy generated by the modules.

In consideration of load usage patterns and PV generation of smart home, this study proposes an ESS control algorithm that uses constant energy of energy network while making maximum use of ESS.

The proposed algorithm makes a smart home a load of energy network with low uncertainty and complexity. The simulation results show that the optimal ESS operating target power not only makes the smart home use power constantly from the energy network, but also maximizes utilization of the ESS.

In this work, we present an optimal control model for studying the economic and grid interaction benefits of smart charging of electric vehicles (EV), vehicle-to-grid, and space heating load control for residential houses with on-site photovoltaics (PV). A case study is conducted on 1 – 10 net <b>zero</b> <b>energy</b> <b>houses</b> with detailed empirical data, resulting in 8 – 33 % yearly electricity cost savings per household with various electric vehicle and space heating system combinations.

Permitting electricity transfer between the houses and EV charging stations at workplaces increases self-sufficiency significantly, but it provides limited economic benefit. The additional cost savings from vehicle-to-grid compared to smart charging are minor due to increased battery degradation, despite a significant self-sufficiency increase. If the optimization is conducted without taking the battery degradation cost into account, the added monetary value of vehicle-to-grid can even be negative due to the unmanaged degradation. Neglecting battery degradation completely leads to overestimation of the vehicle-to-grid cost benefit. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The house was designed using a ‘systems’ approach to integrate the building technologies for thermal and electrical energy systems, based on the concept of buildings as power stations, using the renewable energy systems as part of the building envelope. The aim was to produce a house that achieves an ‘energy positive’ performance, which, on an annual basis, generates more energy than in consumes. The house is designed for wide-scale application, so, in addition to energy performance, the focus was also on affordability and ease of build. In order to assess the performance of the house a model was needed to assess the whole building energy performance of the building and its integrated energy systems. The paper describes the development of a simulation model based around the building thermal model, HTB 2 (Heat Transfer in Buildings: version 2).
