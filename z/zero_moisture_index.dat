Time series of wetness transformations generated from Landsat imagery {{have been used to}} detect {{mountain pine}} beetle red attack damage over large areas. With the recent availability of high spatial (QuickBird) and high spectral (Hyperion) resolution satellite sensor imagery, the relationship between spectral <b>moisture</b> <b>indices</b> and levels of red attack damage may be investigated. Six <b>moisture</b> <b>indices</b> were generated from Hyperion data and were compared to the proportion of the Hyperion pixel having red attack damage.

The results corroborate the hypothesis that changes in foliage moisture resulting from mountain pine beetle attack are driving the broad-scale temporal variation in Landsat derived wetness indices. Furthermore, the results suggest that Hyperion data may be used to map low levels of mountain pine beetle red attack damage over large areas that are not consistently captured with Landsat data...|$|R

Compression tests on these species were extended to <b>zero</b> <b>moisture</b> content and near saturation, in respective ranges of - 20 to + 90 ° C. and - 20 to + 60 ° C. In addition, two low density species were included in the compression tests. Two species were also examined in bending at <b>zero</b> <b>moisture</b> content from - 20 to + 80 ° C. PART II. covers tests made at 15 per cent. nominal moisture content on standard size hoop pine specimens in compression and shear from zero to 40 ° C. and in bending at 20 and 40 ° C., also on 2 in. X 3 / 4 in. X 3 / 4 in. specimens of the same species in compression from - 20 to + 60 ° C. PART III. describes tests on hoop pine plywood. At nominal moisture contents of 8, 12, and 20 per cent., tensile and crushing strengths were examined from - 20 to + 80 ° C. Investigation of crushing strength was extended to include <b>zero</b> <b>moisture</b> content. Modulus of elasticity was examined at all the above moisture contents, but only from - 20 to + 60 ° C. PART IV. discusses tests on casein, pheno-formaldehyde and urea-formaldehyde glued joints at temperatures from - 15 to + 60 ° C. in the range 8 to 20 per cent moisture content. PART V. summarizes the more important features of the investigations in general terms and gives results of independent confirmatory tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{accuracies}} of rice classifications {{determined from}} density slices of broadband <b>moisture</b> <b>indices</b> {{were compared to}} results from a standard supervised technique using six reflective Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) bands. Index-based methods resulted in higher accuracies early in the growing season when background moisture differences were at a maximum. Analysis of depth of ETM+ band 5 resulted in the highest accuracy over the growing season (97. 74 %). This was more accurate than the highest supervised classification accuracy (95. 81 %), demonstrating the usefulness of spectral feature selection of moisture for classifying rice. 1...|$|R

Michaelian Abstract: We examined the impacts of a severe, regional drought (2001 – 2002) on trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests in the western Canadian interior. A total of 150 plots were established in 25 study areas as part of {{a regional}}-scale study (CIPHA). Aspen health and mortality were assessed annually during 2000 – 2005, and changes in stem biomass were estimated using tree-ring analysis and plot-based measurements. Net mean increment in living bio-mass for all plots was 2. 2 tha– 1 year– 1 during 2000 – 2002 but subsequently decreased to near zero. This collapse was driven by a more than two-fold increase in stem mortality and a 30 % decrease in regional stem growth during and fol-lowing the drought. The analysis showed that spatial variation in aspen productivity and biomass across the region was positively related to multiyear mean values of a climate <b>moisture</b> <b>index</b> and mineral soil silt content but was negatively related to levels of insect defoliation and wood-boring insects. In contrast, mortality and dieback was best correlated with minimum annual climate <b>moisture</b> <b>index,</b> which provided a measure of short-term drought severity. The results sup-port previous studies showing that aspen forests are moisture limited in this region, which poses concerns for the futur...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{water content}} (SWC) {{is a crucial}} {{variable}} in the thermal infrared research and is the major control for land surface hydrological processes at the watershed scale. Estimating the surface SWC from remotely sensed data using the triangle method proposed by Price has been demonstrated in previous studies. In this study, a new soil <b>moisture</b> <b>index</b> (Temperature Rising Rate Vegetation Dryness Index—TRRVDI) is proposed based on a triangle constructed using the mid-morning land surface temperature (LST) rising rate and the vegetation index to estimate the regional SWC. The temperature at the dry edge of the triangle {{is determined by the}} surface energy balance principle. The temperature at the wet edge is assumed to be equal to the air temperature. The mid-morning land surface temperature rising rate is calculated using Meteosat Second Generation—Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) LST products over 4 cloud-free days (day of year: 206, 211, 212, 242) in 2007. The developed TRRVDI is validated by in situ measurements from 19 meteorological stations in Spain. The results indicate that the coefficient of determination (R 2) between the TRRVDI derived using the theoretical limiting edges and the in situ SWC measurements is greater than that derived using the observed limiting edges. The R 2 values are 0. 46 and 0. 32; respectively (p < 0. 05). Additionally, the TRRVDI is much better than the soil <b>moisture</b> <b>index</b> that was developed using one-time LST and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) with the theoretically determined limiting edges...|$|R
