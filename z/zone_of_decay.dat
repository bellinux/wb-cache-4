The impacts were performed at velocities of 5. 9 - 6. 9 km/sec with a vertical gun ballistic range. The craters, 30 - 33 cm in diameter, reveal a radial <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> the ejecta mass per unit area with a power of - 2. 8 to - 3. 5. Material displaced from the upper 15 % of the crater depth d is represented within the whole ejecta blanked, material from deeper than 28 % of d is deposited inside 2 crater radii, and no material from deeper than 33 % of d was ejected beyond the crater rim. Shock-metamorphosed particles (glassy agglutinates, cataclastic breccias, and comminuted quartz) amount to some 4 % of the total displaced mass and indicate progressive <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> shock intensity from a peak pressure of 300 kbar. The shock-metamorphosed particles and the shock-induced change in the grain size distribution of ejected samples have close analogies to the basic characteristics of the lunar regolith.

40|$|Wave {{breaking}} is investigated experimentally by use {{of laser}} doppler velocimetry for two cases: a plunging breaker and a spilling breaker. Specifically, emphasis {{is given to the}} kinematics at breaking, the early breaking phase, and the turbulent wake generated from wave breaking. A significant contribution is provided on the amplitude behavior for a solitary wave on a beach, as it is the solitary wave that is used to conduct this study. Associated {{with the use of the}} solitary wave, a technique of flow field construction by repeated measurement with an LDV is presented. Four well defined regions of the shoaling-through-breaking solitary wave on a beach are identified and termed according to the wave amplitude behavior within each region. They are: the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> gradual shoaling, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> rapid shoaling, the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> rapid <b>decay</b> and the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> gradual <b>decay.</b> The plunging wave case studied exhibited a definite transitional zone, between the previously known - 1 / 4 and - 1 power laws, following a power law of - 3 / 5. Velocity fields for a plunger and a spiller at the point of breaking are measured and the corresponding acceleration fields are computed for each. The results show good qualitative comparison to those obtained by theoretical approaches, however, no clear mechanism is demonstrated to initiate breaking for the spilling breaker studied. The existence of counter-rotating vortices, generated from breaking, is established from velocity measurements of the flow taken during the early breaking phase and within the turbulent wake of the plunging breaker studied. The measurements indicate that the size of the vortices are roughly the same as the undisturbed depth at the point of breaking. Turbulent intensities determined within the wake of the plunging breaker illustrate its character and show that level of turbulent intensity does not progressively decrease behind the turbulent source...|$|R

Thin sediment veneers deposited on a wave-cut bench comprise 75 percent <b>of</b> the intertidal <b>zone</b> sediments <b>of</b> the Bay of Fundy. Such sediments {{are characterized by}} texture and composition {{which is similar to}} that of the underlying bedrock from which it was derived. Wave action and braided streams rework the sediments and leave the following combination of primary structures: lenficular cross-stratification; flutes; grooves; flat-topped, scoured, current, oscillation and interference ripple marks; current lineatlon; megaripples, and scour pits on the lee side of pebbles. Estuarlne clay flats are underlain by unstratified silt and clay which is drained by meandering creeks. Tidal marsh sediments consist of a silt and clay bank overlain by a thin <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>decayed</b> plant debris. Tidal flats in the lee of bedrock islands were subdivided into a higher tidal flat characterized by gravel and sand, and a lower tidal flat characterized by gravel, sand, silt and clay.

These carbonates occur as thin layers in fine-grained, diatomaceous sediments and siliceous rocks, mostly deposited during the Neogene. A combination of textural, geochemical, and isotopic evidence indicates these dolomites formed as cements and precipitates in shallow subsurface <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> high alkalinity spawned by abundant CO 2 and methane produc-tion during progressive microbial <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> organic matter. Depths and approximate temperatures of formation estimated from oxygen isotopes are 87 to 658 meters and 10 °C to 50 °C, respectively.

Highly variable car-bon isotopes (- 30 to + 16 ‰) reflect the isotopic reservoir in which the carbonates formed.

Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader {{might be a better}} option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|R

40|$|Shoaling and {{breaking}} of solitary waves is computed on slopes 1 : 100 to 1 : 8 using an experimentally validated fully nonlinear wave model based on potential flow equations. Characteristics of waves are computed at {{and beyond the}} breaking point, and geometric self-similarities of breakers are discussed {{as a function of}} wave height and bottom slope. No wave breaks for slopes steeper than 12. A breaking criterion is derived for milder slopes, based on values of a nondimensional slope parameter o. This criterion predicts both whether waves will break or not and which type of breaking will occur (spilling, plunging, or surging). Empirical expressions for the breaking index and for the depth and celerity at breaking are derived based on computations. All results agree well with laboratory experiments. The NSW equations fail to predict these results with sufficient accuracy at the breaking point. Pre-breaking shoaling rates follow a more complex path than previously realized. Post-breaking behaviors exhibit a rapid (non-dissipative) decay, also observed in experiments, associated with a transfer of potential energy into kinetic energy.

40|$|Altogether sixty {{species of}} fusulinids are {{described}} from the Carboniferous Ichinotani Formation and the Permian Mizuyagadani Formation, Fukuji, Gifu Prefecture, Central Japan. Of them six species are new. They are Pseudostaffella minatoi, P. subrotunda, Fusulinella rhomboidalis, Triticites katoi, T. ichinotaniensis and T. elongatus. The following fusulind zones are established; <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Eostaffella, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pro-fusulinella, Lower <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Fusulinella-Fusulina, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Beedeina, Upper <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Fusulinella-Fusulina, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Triticites, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pseudoschwagerina, and <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pseudo-fusulina. As a whole fusulinids treated {{in this paper}} show similarity to those of China, Korea, and especially {{to those of the}} USSR. Lithologic sequence and fusulinid succession suggest that the fusulinid fauna in Fukuji ranges continuously from the Upper Viséan to the Sakmarian, although evidence for Namurian, Vereyan, and Upper Uralian is not at all clear...|$|R
