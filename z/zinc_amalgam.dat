5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and <b>zinc</b> <b>amalgam,</b> using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals.

A method of photographing the curve followed by any drop is described, and it is shown possible to deduce the ionic charge on the drop from {{a study of the}} shape of the curve. In Sulphuric acid of fixed concentration the drop charge is found to be proportional to its volume. Results are also given for the charges in various acid concentrations between 0. 1 N and 0. 001 N. All charges are found to be reduced when the acid is saturated with mercurous sulphate. This seems to afford evidence that, in acid, the charges are due to hydrogen ions, and not to mercurous ions as had been assumed by several investigators. Results obtained in other electrolytes are also given. Some remits for drop charges, measured by a ballistic galvanometer method, are included for comparison. The method is less accurate but confirms the original results. A description is given of similar experiments with amalgam drops.

Prior to 1900 many compositions were tried but few were successful when placed in the oral environment. Around 1900, small amounts of copper and occasionally zinc added.

40|$|Nowadays the use {{of dental}} amalgam is mostly {{abandoned}} and substituted by tooth colored resin composites that can be bonded to teeth tissues by adhesive techniques. The aim of this thesis was {{to find out whether}} dark stained dentin, as often observed after removal of amalgam restorations and attributed to penetration of corrosion products, is an adequate substrate for bonding resin composite restorations. Previous studies revealed tin and zinc as main metals from amalgam in stained dentin and showed strong relation between presence of corrosion products and demineralized state of dentin. In an in-vitro study these findings were confirmed. However, the intensity of staining showed week correlation with concentration of metals. Another in-vitro study, with amalgam placed upon artificially demineralized dentin, showed staining only in demineralized specimens. Bond strength testing of three adhesive systems to dentin, that was demineralized by dental caries decay, showed product specific results and for two adhesives lower bond strength than to sound dentin. Another bond strength test revealed no differences in bond strength to amalgam stained and sound dentin for all adhesive strategies tested, but product depending differences in failure patterns. A clinical study showed good performance of extensive resin composite restorations upon amalgam removal, without adhesion related failures. It is concluded that staining of dentin does not negatively affect bond strength of resin composites in spite of differences in composition of stained and sound or caries affected dentin. It is anticipated that tin and <b>zinc</b> from <b>amalgam</b> have prosperous effects on demineralized dentin...|$|R

In the whitening group, the specimens were exposed to a 10 % carbamide peroxide gel (Opalescence® PF 10 %, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) for 14 consecutive days, 6 h per day. In the control group, the specimens were exposed to distilled water. After 14 days stored at 37 °C, all specimens were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy.

50|$|This reductive {{coupling}} can {{be viewed}} as involving two steps. First is the formation of a pinacolate (1,2-diolate) complex, a step which is equivalent to the pinacol coupling reaction. The second step is the deoxygenation of the pinacolate which yields the alkene, this second step exploits the oxophilicity of titanium.Several mechanisms have been discussed for this reaction. Low-valent titanium species induce coupling of the carbonyls by single electron transfer to the carbonyl groups. The required low-valent titanium species are generated via reduction, usually with zinc powder. This reaction is often performed in THF because it solubilizes intermediate complexes, facilitates the electron transfer steps, and is not reduced under the reaction conditions. The nature of low-valent titanium species formed is varied as the products formed by reduction of the precursor titanium halide complex will naturally depend upon both the solvent (most commonly THF or DME) and the reducing agent employed: typically, lithium aluminum hydride,zinc-copper couple, <b>zinc</b> dust, magnesium-mercury <b>amalgam,</b> magnesium, or alkali metals. Bogdanovic and Bolte identified the nature and mode of action of the active species in some classical McMurry systems, and an overview of proposed reaction mechanisms has been published. It is of note that titanium dioxide is not generally a product of the coupling reaction. Although it is true that titanium dioxide is usually the eventual fate of titanium used in these reactions, it is generally formed upon the aqueous workup of the reaction mixture.|$|R

In the fifth, sixth and seventh groups, the teeth were apicoectomized and capped on the bevelled root surface with one of the following materiais: a dentin bonding system plus composite resin, a glass ionomer cement or a compomer. Two specimens of each experimental group were evaluated for the marginal adaptation using scanning electron microscopy. The remaining 126 specimens were immersed in 2 % methylene blue dye, stored for one week at 37 ºC and the infiltration was evaluated with a stereomicroscope.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a capacidade de selamento apical e a adaptação marginal de cinco materiais odontológicos empregados na retrobturação ou recobrimento de ápices radiculares.
