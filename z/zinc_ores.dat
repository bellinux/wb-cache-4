5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in <b>zinc</b> <b>ores,</b> and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> concentrates from sulfidic <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, the output of cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 1 million tons of gallium is contained in known reserves of bauxite and <b>zinc</b> <b>ores.</b> Some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see below). Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} bauxite, <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> (and coal) are extracted.|$|E
5|$|Various {{isolated}} {{examples of}} the use of impure zinc in ancient times have been discovered. <b>Zinc</b> <b>ores</b> were used to make the zinc–copper alloy brass thousands of years prior to the discovery of zinc as a separate element. Judean brass from the 14th to 10th centuriesBC contains 23% zinc.|$|E
50|$|Through 1940, the {{production}} of primary zinc by US smelters approximated the mined production of <b>zinc</b> <b>ore.</b> When <b>zinc</b> demand increased during World War II, US smelters turned to foreign <b>zinc</b> <b>ore.</b> US-smelted <b>zinc</b> reached a high of 926,000 metric tons in 1970, then dropped as smelters closed. There were 12 primary zinc smelters in 1970, but only 7 in 1980, 3 in 1990, and two in 2000. Today, {{there is only one}} operating primary zinc smelter, in Clarksville, Tennessee, which produces zinc from mines in the East Tennessee and Middle Tennessee districts. All other <b>zinc</b> <b>ore</b> is exported, and smelted abroad.|$|R

5|$|The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), {{which is}} mostly found with <b>zinc</b> <b>ores.</b> Most other lead {{minerals}} {{are related to}} galena in some way; boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; anglesite, PbSO4, {{is a product of}} galena oxidation; and cerussite or white lead ore, PbCO3, is a decomposition product of galena. Arsenic, tin, antimony, silver, gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic <b>zinc</b> <b>ores,</b> where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E

40|$|<b>Zinc</b> <b>ore</b> {{exploration}} {{is generally}} undertaken through deep {{drilling in the}} area adjacent to the outcrop. Experience in one complex geological area suggests that, in that area, exploration might be more profitable if short holes were drilled to bedrock to locate the <b>zinc</b> <b>ore</b> body at the sub-outcrop (the interface between bedrock and the soil and glacier deposited cover). This problem is evaluated by assuming three logical shapes and sizes of ore body and selecting a method for drilling by utilizing a computer model to simulate drilling. The test results indicate that costs of using this proposed method of exploration are substantially less than the traditional approach of exploring for <b>zinc</b> <b>ore</b> and that probabilities of success can be predetermined. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{direct or}} American process starts with diverse {{contaminated}} zinc composites, such as <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> or smelter by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with {{a source of}} carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in the indirect process. Because of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process {{as compared to the}} indirect one.|$|E
5|$|About 118tonnes of {{germanium}} {{was produced}} in 2011 worldwide, mostly in China (80 t), Russia (5 t) and United States (3 t). Germanium is recovered as a by-product from sphalerite <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> where it is concentrated in amounts as great as 0.3%, especially from low-temperature sediment-hosted, massive Zn–Pb–Cu(–Ba) deposits and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits. A {{recent study found that}} at least 10,000 t of extractable germanium is contained in known zinc reserves, particularly those hosted by Mississippi-Valley type deposits, while at least 112,000 t will be found in coal reserves. In 2007 35% of the demand was met by recycled germanium.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>ores.</b> Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E

5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>ores.</b> Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was the only area where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Refinement of sulfidic <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> {{produces}} {{large volumes}} of sulfur dioxide and cadmium vapor. Smelter slag and other residues contain significant quantities of metals. About 1.1 million tonnes of metallic zinc and 130 thousand tonnes of lead were mined and smelted in the Belgian towns of La Calamine and Plombières between 1806 and 1882. The dumps of the past mining operations leach zinc and cadmium, and the sediments of the Geul River contain non-trivial amounts of metals. About two thousand years ago, emissions of zinc from mining and smelting totaled 10 thousand tonnes a year. After increasing 10-fold from 1850, zinc emissions peaked at 3.4 million tonnes {{per year in the}} 1980s and declined to 2.7 million tonnes in the 1990s, although a 2005 study of the Arctic troposphere found that the concentrations there did not reflect the decline. Anthropogenic and natural emissions occur at a ratio of 20to1.|$|E

5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan. Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around {{the beginning of the}} 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina: the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth. In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some secondary production from lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined. Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after {{the discovery}} of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of historic mining activity on the eastern slopes, particularly below Seat How. Four mines operated in this area:- Ladstock, Rachel Wood, Thornthwaite and Beckstones. Most were abandoned in the 1870s but Thornthwaite and Rachel Wood operated until December 1920. The main yields were lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>ores,</b> in particular galena, blende, cerussite and gossan.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} modern period, brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, was usually {{produced}} by a cementation process in which metallic copper was heated with calamine, a <b>zinc</b> <b>ore,</b> to make calamine brass.|$|R
50|$|Despite the setback {{the mine}} soon reopened and {{continued}} producing ore until it closed in 1886. Between 1845 and 1885 it produced 48,200 tons of 62% lead ore, 212,700 ounces {{of silver and}} 280 tons of <b>zinc</b> <b>ore.</b>|$|R
25|$|The North Caucasus, {{far eastern}} Russia, {{and the western}} edge of the Kuznetsk Basin in {{southern}} Siberia contain an abundance of lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>ores.</b> These are commonly found along with copper, gold, silver, and a large amount of other rare metals. The country has one of the largest gold reserves in the world; mostly in Siberia and the Urals. Mercury deposits can be found in the central and southern Urals and in south central Siberia.|$|E
25|$|Indium {{is another}} rare {{element in the}} boron group. Even less {{abundant}} than gallium at only 0.000005% (0.05 ppm), it is the 61st most common element in the earth's crust. Very few indium-containing minerals are known, all of them scarce: an example is indite. Indium is found in several <b>zinc</b> <b>ores,</b> but only in minute quantities; likewise some copper and lead ores contain traces. As {{is the case for}} most other elements found in ores and minerals, the indium extraction process has become more efficient in recent years, ultimately leading to larger yields. Canada is the world's leader in indium reserves, but both the United States and China have comparable amounts.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} iron, copper, arsenic and <b>zinc</b> <b>ores</b> such as arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite and {{chalcopyrite}} with sphalerite, are present as small veins and in quartz veins throughout north-trending shear zones that cut the iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. Dikes composed of quartz-feldspar porphyry run parallel to or lie within the shear zones and are {{cut by the}} mineralization. Chalcopyrite occupies later fractures which intersect massive arsenopyrite. Sparse quartz veins normally exist in or adjacent to the arsenopyrite-rich zones. Several northeast-trending deformation zones intersect pyroxenite of a mafic sill in northwest Strathy Township. Within these high-strain zones quartz veins normally contain chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite with exsolved pentlandite and traces of sphalerite and galena. Chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and pentlandite are deposited throughout shear zones which lack quartz veining. These zones are not known to contain large amounts of gold, although investigations are incomplete. It is also unknown if platinum group metals (which include platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium and ruthenium) exist in these zones because no searches for platinum group elements have been undertaken.|$|E
5000|$|Allactite {{is a rare}} arsenate mineral of metamorphosed {{manganese}} <b>zinc</b> <b>ore</b> deposits. It {{is found}} in Sweden and New Jersey, US. Its name originated from Greek αλλάκτειν (allaktein) meaning [...] "to change", referring to the strong pleochroism of the mineral.|$|R
