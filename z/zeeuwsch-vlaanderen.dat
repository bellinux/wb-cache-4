40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{analysis}} of the accident involvement of foreigners in <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen.</b> The most important questions in this are to indicate: the share of accidents with foreign drivers; whether there are accident types in which these foreign drivers are over-represented; and whether these drivers are over-represented insofar as causing these accidents. For part I see C 21926...|$|E
40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{performed}} in <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen,</b> in the period between February, 1994 and August, 1995. The cooperation of police and road authorities {{made it possible to}} obtain supplementary information about the behaviour and behavioural background of those involved in injury accidents and about the road and environmental factors of the accident locations in <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen.</b> In total, 161 injury accidents were analyzed by the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research. This represents a random sample from a total of 392 injury accidents, registered by the police in that period. The pilot study suffered initial problems. Partly for organisational reasons, the study was stopped several times. This also meant that the instructions given in advance did not benefit those people who ultimately participated in the study. The random sample proved to be insufficiently representative to enable concrete statements to be made. The supplementary material contained inconsistencies that prevented a reliable interpretation of the available data. Nevertheless, it was shown that both the police and theroad authority can provide valuable supplementary information. One important recommendation made is that the organisation, acquisition and collection of supplementary data to be provided by various organisations requires a properly functioning project management team...|$|E
40|$|Between 1821 and 1948 Himantoglossum hircinum {{was found}} in {{different}} years in 5 different places in the Netherlands, which is the northern limit of its continental range. The author considered the finds as natural but not lasting, and assumed {{the possibility of a}} new find. In 1980 the species was found again on the slope of a dike in <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen</b> (province of Zeeland) in the southwestern part of the country; in 1981 there was a second find in the dunes near Katwijk (province of Zuid-Holland) in the western coastal part of the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|In 1997, SWOV {{has made}} a plan for {{acquiring}} and passing on knowledge {{that is necessary to}} realise a Dutch `sustainably-safe' traffic system. In the first inventory reported in 1998, an overview was given of the knowledge available from the Dutch `sustainably-safe' demonstration (rural) and example projects. The demonstration projects were as follows: West <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen,</b> Oosterbeek, Grubbenhorst, and Kop van Overijssel. The example projects were: West Friesland and Westland. In this second inventory, the status quo of these demonstration and example projects is examined again. In doing so, the results are presented {{in the same way as}} was done in the first inventory. For the first inventory see ITRD E 206600...|$|E
40|$|In 1997, SWOV {{has made}} a plan for {{acquiring}} and passing on knowledge {{that is necessary to}} realise a Dutch `sustainably-safe' traffic system. In this first inventory, an overview is given of knowledge that is currently available from the Dutch `sustainably-safe' demonstration (rural) and example projects. The four demonstration projects are: West <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen,</b> Oosterbeek, Grubbenhorst, and Kop van Overijssel. The two example projects are: West Friesland and Westland. In the inventory, the knowledge is divided into four stages of development: conceptual basis, practical advices, implementation, and monitoring. This is done on at least three areas: road infrastructure, behavioural influence and regulations, and administration. For the second inventory see ITRD E 206601...|$|E
40|$|Apium repens, {{recorded}} {{for the last}} time in the Netherlands in 1961, was refound in 1983 at some localities in <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen.</b> In the past it occurred in four kinds of habitat: 1 wet pastures and banks along brooks, inundated in winter; 2 ditches at the fringe of peat areas; 3 wet dune slacks and 4 pastures along old creeks. From the first two kinds of habitat it has disappeared completely. At present one locality is known in the dune area (Schouwen, recorded in 1984). The other recent localities all belong to the fourth type, which is confined to <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen.</b> Fig. 1 shows the former and recent distribution of A. repens in the Netherlands (last record in the interior c. 1952). The creeks in whose vicinity A. repens was found (fig. 2) have long remained undiked. They have been filled for the greater part with sandy or clayey deposits, which are now in use as pastures. These show a characteristic gradient (fig. 3). On their higher side they border on arable land. Downwards the grassland becomes wetter, with an uneven surface due to trampling. Between it and the open water of the creek a reed and rush belt occurs. The wet, rugged grassland is the habitat of A. repens and also of Scirpus cariciformis. The latter species shows a pattern of decline in the Netherlands similar to that of A. repens. Characteristic of the habitat of. A. repens is a rather open and short vegetation and the water-level being slightly above the surface in winter, slightly below the surface in summer. The chief cause of its disappearance is drainage. Moreover ceasing of grazing of brook banks may have contributed to its elimination from the interior of the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|Although from 1255 up {{till now}} about 47 Physeter macrocephalus have been cast upon {{the coast of the}} Netherlands, or have come ashore alive, but very few {{materials}} have been preserved and we are in the possession of only two specimens, those of 1937, the complete skeletons of which are preserved in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden. Apart from these skeletons the following fragments are preserved : 1. The damaged upper part of the skull and three vertebrae from the animal of Scheveningen, 1617. These fragments are in the possession of the Dutch Protestant Church, Keizerstraat, Scheveningen (Van Deinse, 1918, p. 42, etc., and Plate IV). 2. The left humerus, radius, and ulna, grown together, probably from the same specimen as no. 1. This bone was found, November 1907, in a pond in The Hague, and is now kept at the Gymnasium Erasmianum, Rotterdam (Van Deinse, 1916, p. 521, etc., with 4 figures, and 1918, pp. 38, 39, 47, with 2 figures). 3. One tooth from the sperm whale of Terschelling, 1762, preserved in the West-Terschelling Museum (Van Deinse, 1946, p. 206). 4. Fragment of a lower jaw, found in 1885 in a moat at Leiden, now in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, Leiden (Van Deinse, 1918, P- 49). 5. The distal part of a humerus, and an ulna with olecranon lacking. Both pieces were found at Sas-van-Gent, <b>Zeeuwsch-Vlaanderen,</b> Zeeland, in April 1948, they are now in the Geological Museum, Leiden (Van Deinse, Nieuwe Rotterdamse Courant, July 24 th, 1948). The above mentioned two skeletons are from male sperm whales (lengt...|$|E
