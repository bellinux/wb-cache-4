Any types of pipette with the cross segment included in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal line are required to adjust to circular.Delivering tips of the genre 1 and genre 2 are different. For the genre 1, the capacities of the delivery tips is constructed at the gradual taper between 15 to 30 mm for 5 ml, and  20 to 40 mm for 10 to 50 ml. The genre 2 has a longer distance between  50 to 65 mm from the tip end. The tip end of the pipettes are perpendicular construction to the axis.

By comparison between nucleobases and methylated species, in which tautomerism cannot occur, we can access intrinsic mechanisms {{at a time}} resolution never reported so far (80 fs). At this time resolution, and using appropriate substitution, real nuclear motion corresponding to active vibrational modes along deactivation coordinates can actually be probed. We provide evidence {{for the existence of}} a two-step decay mechanism, following a 267 nm excitation of the nucleobases. The time resolution achieved together with a careful <b>zero</b> time-delay <b>calibration</b> between lasers allow us to show that the first step does correspond to intrinsic dynamics rather than to a laser cross correlation. For adenine and 9 -methyladenine a first decay component of about 100 fs has been measured. This first step is radically increased to 200 fs when the amino group hydrogen atoms of adenine are substituted by methyl groups. Our results could be rationalized according to the effect of the highly localized nature of the excitation combined to the presence of efficient deactivation pathway along both pyrimidine ring and amino group out-of-plane vibrational modes. These nuclear motions {{play a key role in}} the vibronic coupling between the initially excited pipi(*) and the dark npi(*) states.

40|$|Purpose: To {{present a}} {{practical}} method for calibrating the zero position of asymmetric jaws that provides higher accuracy {{at the central}} axis and improves dose homogeneity in the abutting region of half-beams. Methods: Junction doses were measured for each asymmetric jaw using the double-exposure technique and electronic portal imaging devices. The junction dose was determined {{as a function of}} jaw position. The shift in the zero jaw position (or in its corresponding potentiometer readout) required to correct for the measured junction dose could thus be obtained. The jaw calibration was then modified to introduce the calculated shift and therefore achieve an accurate zero position in order to provide a relative junction dose that was as close to zero as possible. Results: All the asymmetric jaws from four medical linear accelerators were calibrated with the new calibration procedure. Measured relative junction doses at gantry 0 ° were reduced from a maximum of ± 40 % to a maximum of ± 8 % for all the jaws in the four considered accelerators. These results were valid for 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams and for any combination of asymmetric jaws set to <b>zero.</b> The <b>calibration</b> was stable {{over a long period of}} time; therefore, the need for recalibrating is seldom necessary.

Since high rate, immersive (360 FOV), MTL is a relatively new device for the collection and extraction of survey data; the understanding and correction of errors within such systems is under researched. Therefore, the goal of the work presented here is to quantify the geospatial accuracy of MTL data and improve the quality of MTL data products. Quantification of the geospatial accuracy of MTL systems was accomplished through the use of residual analysis, error propagation and conditional variance analysis. Real data from two MTL systems was analyzed using these methods and {{it was found that the}} actual errors exceeded the manufacturers estimates of system accuracy by over 10 mm. Conditional variance analysis on these systems has shown that the contribution by the interactions among the measured parameters to the variances of the points in MTL point clouds is insignificant. The sizes of the variances for the measurements used to produce a point are the primary sources of error in the output point cloud. Improvement of the geospatial accuracy of MTL data products was accomplished by developing methods for the simultaneous multi-sensor calibration of the systems boresight angles and lever arm offsets, <b>zero</b> error <b>calibration,</b> temperature correction, and both spatial and temporal outlier detection. Evaluation of the effectiveness of these techniques was accomplished through the use of two test cases, employing real MTL data.

Similarly, test case 2 showed a reduction in the residuals between control points and MTL data of 2 ~ 3 cm on horizontal surfaces and 1 ~ 2 cm on vertical surfaces.

A viable periphery with a PO 2 range of 50 - 82 torr and a transition to necrotic areas of PO 2, 2 - 13 torr were observed. This transition was characterized by PO 2 gradients within distances of 50 - 300 mu at variable puncture depths. This technique should be useful in further studies of growth, necrosis, and therapy...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{formulation}} of sulphamethoxazole (S) and trimethoprin (T) (CO-TRIMOXAZOLE) in a combination mixture {{is very good}} pharmacologically since it enhances {{the efficacy of the}} individual drugs. However in this combination, difficulties in analysis on ordinary UV spectrophotometry are introduced because the two components give overlapping spectral bands on zero-order. The United States Pharmacopoea (USP) -recommended HPLC analytical method is quite expensive. Objective: The objective of the present work was to assess whether derivative spectrophotometry could be used to circumvent the overlapping spectral bands of the components and hence use it for routine analysis of the drug. Study design: Experimental Methods: The aqueous solution of the individual drugs and their binary mixutres were scanned on zero order and on first derivative at the wave length between 200 - 300 nm and at the pH of 4. 5. Results: The zero-order spectra of the compounds were completely overlapping. However the first-derivative scan offered better separa-tion and hence T was determined from the absorbance at 237. 6 nm with negligible contribution from S (since at this point it was reading zero). Likewise S was determined at a wavelength of 259 nm when T was reading <b>zero.</b> The linear <b>calibration</b> graphs were obtained for 4 - 25 mgml- 1 of S and for 4 - 20 mgml- 1 of T. Conclusion: The method is rapid, simple and can be applied successfully to assay a mixture of the two drugs in pharmaceuti-cal preparations...|$|R
40|$|The Tara Oceans Expedition (2009 - 2013) sampled {{the world}} oceans {{on board a}} 36 m long schooner, {{collecting}} environmental data and organisms from viruses to planktonic metazoans for later analyses using modern sequencing and state-of-the-art imaging technologies. Tara Oceans Data are particularly suited to study the genetic, morphological and functional diversity of plankton. The present data set provides raw validated data of continuous measurements of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), using a ProOceanus CO 2 -Pro instrument mounted on the flowthrough system. This automatic sensor is fitted with an equilibrator made of gas permeable silicone membrane and an internal detection loop with a non-dispersive infrared detector of PPSystems SBA- 4 CO 2 analyzer. A zero-CO 2 baseline is provided for the subsequent measurements circulating the internal gas through a CO 2 absorption chamber containing soda lime or Ascarite. The frequency of this automatic <b>zero</b> point <b>calibration</b> was set to be 24 hours. All data recorded during zeroing processes were discarded with the 15 -minute data after each calibration. The output of CO 2 -Pro is the mole fraction of CO 2 in the measured water and the pCO 2 is obtained using the measured total pressure of the internal wet gas. The fugacity of CO 2 (fCO 2) in the surface seawater, whose difference with the atmospheric CO 2 fugacity {{is proportional to the}} air-sea CO 2 fluxes, is obtained by correcting the pCO 2 for non-ideal CO 2 gas concentration according to Weiss (1974). The fCO 2 computed using CO 2 -Pro measurements was corrected to the sea surface condition by considering the temperature effect on fCO 2 (Takahashi et al., 1993). The surface seawater observations that were initially estimated with a 15 seconds frequency were averaged every 5 -min cycle. The performance of CO 2 -Pro was adjusted by comparing the sensor outputs against the thermodynamic carbonate calculation of pCO 2 using the carbonic system constants of Millero et al. (2006) from the determinations of total inorganic carbon (CT) and total alkalinity (AT) in discrete samples collected at sea surface. AT was determined using an automated open cell potentiometric titration (Haraldsson et al. 1997). CT was determined with an automated coulometric titration (Johnson et al. 1985; 1987), using the MIDSOMMA system (Mintrop, 2005). fCO 2 data are flagged according to the WOCE guidelines following Pierrot et al. (2009) identifying recommended values and questionable measurements giving additional information about the reasons of the questionability...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{and precise}} {{probabilistic}} prediction of daily catchment-scale streamflow requires statistical characterization of residual errors of hydrological models. This study focuses on approaches for representing error heteroscedasticity {{with respect to}} simulated streamflow, i. e., the pattern of larger errors in higher streamflow predictions. We evaluate eight common residual error schemes, including standard and weighted least squares, the Box-Cox transformation (with fixed and calibrated power parameter λ) and the log-sinh transformation. Case studies include 17 perennial and 6 ephemeral catchments in Australia and the United States, and two lumped hydrological models. Performance is quantified using predictive reliability, precision, and volumetric bias metrics. We find the choice of heteroscedastic error modeling approach significantly impacts on predictive performance, though no single scheme simultaneously optimizes all performance metrics. The set of Pareto optimal schemes, reflecting performance trade-offs, comprises Box-Cox schemes with λ of 0. 2 and 0. 5, and the log scheme (λ[*]= [*] 0, perennial catchments only). These schemes significantly outperform even the average-performing remaining schemes (e. g., across ephemeral catchments, median precision tightens from 105 % to 40 % of observed streamflow, and median biases decrease from 25 % to 4 %). Theoretical interpretations of empirical results highlight the importance of capturing the skew/kurtosis of raw residuals and reproducing <b>zero</b> flows. Paradoxically, <b>calibration</b> of λ is often counterproductive: in perennial catchments, it tends to overfit low flows {{at the expense of}} abysmal precision in high flows. The log-sinh transformation is dominated by the simpler Pareto optimal schemes listed above. Recommendations for researchers and practitioners seeking robust residual error schemes for practical work are provided.

40|$|An {{electronic}} unit denoted the Miniature Intelligent Sensor Module performs sensor-signal-conditioning functions and local processing of sensor data. The unit includes four channels of analog input/output circuitry, a processor, volatile and nonvolatile memory, and two Ethernet communication ports, all {{housed in a}} weathertight enclosure. The unit accepts AC or DC power. The analog inputs provide programmable gain, offset, and filtering as well as shunt calibration and auto-zeroing. Analog outputs include sine, square, and triangular waves having programmable frequencies and amplitudes, as well as programmable amplitude DC. One innovative aspect of the design of this unit is the integration of a relatively powerful processor and large amount of memory along with the sensor-signalconditioning circuitry so that sophisticated computer programs {{can be used to}} acquire and analyze sensor data and estimate and track the health of the overall sensor-data-acquisition system of which the unit is a part. The unit includes <b>calibration,</b> <b>zeroing,</b> and signalfeedback circuitry to facilitate health monitoring. The processor is also integrated with programmable logic circuitry in such a manner as to simplify and enhance acquisition of data and generation of analog outputs. A notable unique feature of the unit is a cold-junction compensation circuit in the back shell of a sensor connector. This circuit makes it possible to use Ktype thermocouples without compromising a housing seal. Replicas of this unit may prove useful in industrial and manufacturing settings - especially in such large outdoor facilities as refineries. Two features can be expected to simplify installation: the weathertight housings should make it possible to mount the units near sensors, and the Ethernet communication capability of the units should facilitate establishment of communication connections for the units...|$|R
40|$|The full {{analytical}} {{potential of}} heavy ion backscattering and elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) depends critically on establishing a reliable energy calibration. In {{order to make}} accurate measurements of thin film samples we have investigated {{the changes in the}} energy calibration of a Si p+-n-n+ charged particle detector subjected to heavy ion irradiation over 24 h in a time of flight-energy elastic recoil detection analysis (ToF-E ERDA) measurement. In this study a set of similar Al/ZrO 2 /Zr samples were analysed sequentially with 60 MeV 127 I 11 + ions. The calibration change for 16 O, 27 Al and 90 - 92, 95, 96 Zr were monitored by tagging individual recoils with their energy derived from the ToF. The calibration parameters for a wider range of elements (Li-Ag) were measured before and after the sequential irradiation with O, Al, Zr and I atoms. The results show that the change in the calibration could be characterised by an increase in the energy interval spanned by one channel and a slight decrease in the channel <b>zero</b> energy. The <b>calibration</b> shift for a given projectile atomic number depends linearly on the fluence of heavy particles impinging on the detector and the consequential increase in detector leakage current. This indicates that for similar irradiation conditions, a correction to account for the calibration shift may be simply determined for each sample from the number of heavy recoil counts registered or from the change in leakage current. Furthermore, the silicon charged particle detector calibration depends on recoil atomic number both before, and after, the heavy ion irradiation. The fluence-induced calibration shift for different recoils can be described by a linear dependence on recoil atomic number...|$|R
30|$|On {{handling}} the daily datasets of perennial rivers, {{it is quite}} logical to expect consecutive zero discharge values and it will have {{significant impact on the}} relationships. In the selected stations of Pattazhy, no zero discharges are present in the datasets owing to the supplemented flows to the river at the upstream of the station. In the dataset of Ayilam station, 40 % zero data values are present in the calibration set, while 60.52 % zero data values are present in the validation data. In the discharge data of Thumpamon station, 30.4 % are zero values are present in calibration and 37 % are zero values. In the discharge dataset of Malakkara station, 24 % are <b>zero</b> values in <b>calibration</b> set and 44 % are zeros in the validation set. From Tables  3 and 4, it is evident that the MEMD–GP model of Pattazhy station performs better (RMSE of 3.26 for validation data) when compared with that of other stations (RMSE values of 4.55, 13.7 and 4.15 for validation data of Ayilam, Malakkara and Thumpamon stations). However, it is consistent that in even these three stations, MEMD–GP hybrid method performed well when compared with traditional GP or model tree approaches. For example, at Ayilam station (with 60 % zero values for validation data), the MEMD–GP model results displayed an RMSE of 4.55 against the RMSE of GP and model tree-based results (6.12 and 10, respectively). Identical observations can be made for other stations also, and hence, it can be concluded that the proposed MEMD–GP model gets influenced least by the presence of zero discharges—a typical characteristics of daily discharge datasets of perennial rivers, when compared with the GP or model tree approaches.|$|R
