50|$|After a coolant leak on June 4, 2008, the European Commission {{set off an}} EU wide alarm {{through the}} European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange (ECURIE). The power plant was safely shut down to the hot <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> <b>mode</b> after a small leak in the cooling circuit. The leak was {{immediately}} located and treated. According to the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (the country's nuclear watchdog agency), no radioactive release into the environment occurred and none is expected. The event did not affect employees, the nearby population or the environment. Slovenian authorities immediately alerted the proper international institutions, including the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and ECURIE. The EU then notified (through ECURIE) the remaining EU member states, issuing an EU-wide alert. Several news agencies around the world then reported on the incident. According to Greenpeace such an EU-wide alert is very unusual. Surprisingly, the Croatian authorities were not directly informed about the incident, although Croatia is {{a participant in the}} ECURIE system. Many Croatians heard the news first through foreign media and expatriates, although Krško is located a mere 15 km from the Croatian border.|$|E

A system using this <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> control method will consume quasi-zero power when the levitated object is suspended in an equilibrium state. To realize <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> control, a spring is installed in the magnetic suspension device to counterbalance the gravitational force on the actuator in the equilibrium position. In addition, an integral feedback loop in the controller affords zero actuator current when the device is in a balanced state. In this study, a model was set up for feasibility analysis, a prototype was manufactured for experimental confirmation, numerical simulations of <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> control with nonlinear attractive force were carried out based on the model, and experiments were completed to confirm the practicality of the prototype. The simulations and experiments were performed under varied conditions, such as without springs and without <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> control, with springs and without <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> control, with springs and with <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> control, using different springs and integral feedback gains.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} the improved <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> levitation control algorithm for a quadruple hybrid EMS (Electromagnetic Suspension) system. Quadruple hybrid EMS {{system is a}} united form of four hybrid EMS systems one on each corner coupled with a metal plate. Technical issue in controlling a quadruple hybrid EMS system is the permanent magnet’s equilibrium point deviation caused by design tolerance which eventually leads to a limited <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> levitation control that only satisfies the <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> levitation {{in one or two}} hybrid EMS system among the four hybrid EMS system. In order to satisfy a complete <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> levitation control of the quadruple hybrid EMS system, the proposed method presented in this paper adds a compensating algorithm which adjusts the gap reference of each individual axe.

40|$|Neutron {{fluctuations}} {{in a constant}} multiplying medium (<b>zero</b> <b>power</b> noise) and those in a fluctuating medium (power reactor noise) have been traditionally considered as two separate disciplines that exist in two opposing limiting areas of operation (low and high power, respectively). They have also been treated by different mathematical methods, i. e., master equations and Langevin equation, respectively. In this paper we develop a theory of neutron {{fluctuations in}} a medium randomly varying in time, based on a forward-type master equation approach. This method accounts for both the <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> and the power reactor noise simultaneously. Factorial moments and related quantities (variance, power spectrum, etc.) {{of the number of}} the neutrons are calculated in subcritical systems with a stationary external source. It is shown that the pure <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> and power reactor noise results can be reconstructed in the cases of vanishing system fluctuations and high power, respectively, the latter being a nontrivial result. Further, it is shown that the effect of system fluctuations on the <b>zero</b> <b>power</b> noise is retained even in the limit of vanishing neutron number (reactor power). The results have thus even practical significance for low-power systems with fluctuating properties. The results also have a bearing on other types of branching processes such as evolution of biological systems, germ colonies, epidemics, etc., which take place in a time-varying environment...|$|R
