60|$|The {{very next}} day M. le Marquis de Firmin-Latour called upon me at my office in the Rue Daunou. Theodore let him in, {{and the first thing}} that struck me about him was his curt, haughty manner and the look of disdain {{wherewith}} he regarded the humble appointments of my business premises. He himself was magnificently dressed, I may tell you. His bottle-green coat was of the finest cloth and the most perfect cut I had ever seen. His kerseymere pantaloons fitted him without a wrinkle. He wore gloves, he carried a muff of priceless <b>zibeline,</b> and in his cravat there was a diamond the size of a broad bean.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zibeline</b> {{can also}} refer {{to either the}} sable (Martes zibellina) or its pelt, which <b>zibeline</b> was {{originally}} made from.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zibeline</b> {{can also}} {{refer to a}} heavy silk fabric with a twill weave, very similar to Mikado.|$|E
5000|$|In November and December 1794 {{she was at}} Toulon {{undergoing}} {{repairs and}} refitting. She was to be renamed <b>Zibeline</b> in 1795, but apparently she retained her original name.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Zibeline</b> ( [...] or [...] ) is a thick, {{soft fabric}} {{with a long}} nap. It is usually made of wool, such as mohair or alpaca, but can also be made from the hair of other animals, such as camels.|$|E
50|$|The heraldic furs (ermine, vair) do {{not need}} a special {{hatching}} method, as they have a special pattern that is easily recognizable even on the uncoloured illustrations. Nevertheless, there existed two heraldic furs that had their own hatchings. Also, there are in use (mainly in the Czech heraldic literature) furs like <b>zibeline</b> and marten. The colour and hatching for <b>zibeline</b> {{is the same as}} the sable (black) tincture, and the colour and hatching of marten is identical with the gules (red) tincture. So, in some countries these tinctures are also held as furs (mainly in the Czech heraldic traditions, but not in real use, and sometimes also in the German heraldry, which is also not in real use today).|$|E
5000|$|Buluqhan Khatun (died ca. 1286) (lit. [...] "Queen Buluqhan"), also Bulughan, Bulukhan, Bolgana, Bulugan, or <b>Zibeline</b> for Marco Polo (Chinese language|Chinese: 卜鲁罕), was a 13th-century Mongol princess, and the {{principal}} wife of the Mongol Ilkhanid ruler Abagha (1234 - 1282). She belonged to the Mongol tribe of the Bayaut (also Baya'ud, Chinese: 伯牙吾). Her name 'Bulughan' means 'sable' in Mongolian language.|$|E
50|$|The name sable {{appears to}} be of Slavic origin and to have entered most Western European {{languages}} via the early medieval fur trade. Thus the Russian соболь (sobol) and Polish soból became the German Zobel, Dutch Sabel; the French <b>zibeline,</b> Spanish cibelina, cebellina, Finnish soopeli, Portuguese zibelina and Mediaeval Latin zibellina derive from the Italian form (zibellino). The English and Medieval Latin word sabellum comes from the Old French sable or saible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zibeline</b> (in German Zobelfell, in Czech sobol, and in Hungarian coboly) {{was already}} {{used in the}} ancient times of heraldry. Some minnesängers applied the word Zobelfell for the black tincture, and {{the arms of the}} count von Zollern also {{contained}} <b>zibeline</b> (Zobelfell). The colour and hatching of marten (in German Marderfell, in Czech kunina, and in Hungarian nyest) is identical with the red (gules) tincture. The origin of the word gules is from the Medieval Latin word gula, which means the mouth of a carnivorous animal, and in some cases the goules are made of the marten fur (one text says goules de martre). Maybe its reddish tint came to the heraldry from the fur of pine marten. In the poem of Konrad von Würzburg we can read kelen rôt (line 985) transformed into modern German as pelzrot. (Furthermore, we can read there phrases like vîz hermelin (405), which is hermelinweiß, and zobel (400) as well.) Though the Websters Dictionary defines the meaning of pine as a white, yellowish timber and the Cambridge International Dictionary defines it as a timber usually pale in colour, no source, including heraldry textbooks, mentions it in connection with heraldry.|$|E
5000|$|The Polish {{language}} has influenced others. Particular influences appear in other Slavic languages and in German — {{due to their}} proximity and shared borders. Examples of loanwords include German Grenze (border), Dutch and Afrikaans grens from Polish granica; German Peitzker from Polish piskorz (weatherfish); German Zobel, French <b>zibeline,</b> Swedish sabel, and English sable from Polish soból; and ogonek ("little tail") — the word describing a diacritic hook-sign added below some letters in various alphabets. [...] "Szmata," [...] a Polish-Ruthenian word for [...] "mop" [...] or [...] "rag" [...] became part of Yiddish.|$|E
50|$|Gosiewski, embittered by {{the lack}} of {{nominations}} for the Diocese of Vilnius, was the protagonist of a scandal in custom, when in 1730, at a banquet, at which were present the entire chapter he threw glass and bottle to the new bishop of Vilnius, Michael Zienkowicz. In 1730, the Marquis of Monti (through Gosiewski) broke the parliament in Grodno. In 1732, in the same way Gosiewski broke the parliament in Warsaw, getting the sum of money from the French Embassy (60 thousand pounds). For the same reasons the Russian ambassador Friedrich Casimir Count von Löwenwolde paid him and Antoni Kazimierz Sapieha 1000 gold coins. Gosiewski himself also got 4 couples of <b>zibeline</b> martens and 100 gold coins.|$|E
