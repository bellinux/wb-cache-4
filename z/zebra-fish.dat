The potentiality {{of these new}} coreeshell NPs as negative CA for MRI is demonstrated and quantified. The longitudinal and transverse relaxivities of NPs with three different coating compositions were studied at a 7 T magnetic field: silica (TEOS), (3 -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) and (3 - glycidoxypropyl) methyldiethoxysilane (GPTMS). Clearly, {{it was found that}} the coreeshell NPs efficiency as CA was strongly depend on the SPIONs coating. All the three coreeshell NPs studied presented a very small effect on the longitudinal relaxation time but a pronounced one on the transverse relaxation time, leading to a very high transverse longitudinal relaxivities ratio, decisive for their efficiency as negative CA for MRI. The effect of the coreeshell NPs on the MRI contrast enhancement is obtained and quantified in a set of MRI of agar phantoms obtained at 7 T magnetic field and with a imaging gradient field of 1. 6 T/m. The coreeshell NPs were tested in <b>Zebra-fish</b> (Danio rerio) animal model. <b>Zebra-fish</b> MRI were obtained with animals injected with the three coreeshell NPs and the contrast enhancement validated...|$|E

To date, {{the distribution and}} functional characterization of GPER within reproductive and nonreproductive vertebrate organs have been restricted to juvenile and adult animals. In contrast, virtually nothing {{is known about the}} spatiotemporal distribution and function of GPER during vertebrate embryogenesis. Using <b>zebra-fish</b> as an animal model, we investigated the potential functional role and expression of GPER during embryogenesis. Based on real-time PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization, gper was expressed as early as 1 h postfertilization (hpf) and exhibited strong stage–dependent expression patterns during embryogene-sis. At 26 and 38 hpf, gper mRNA was broadly distributed throughout the body, whereas from 50 to 98 hpf, gper expression was increasingly localized to the heart, brain, neuromasts, craniofacial region, and somite boundaries of developing <b>zebra-fish.</b> Continuous exposure to a selective GPER agonist (G- 1) —but not continuous exposure to a selective GPER antagonist (G- 15) —from 5 to 96 hpf, or within three developmental windows ranging from 10 to 72 hpf, resulted in adverse concentration-dependent effects on survival, gross morphology, and somite formation within the trunk of developing zebrafish embryos. Importantly, based on co-exposure studies, G- 15 blocked severe G- 1 –induced developmental toxicity, suggesting that G- 1 toxicity is mediated via aberrant activation of GPER. Overall, our findings suggest that xenobiotic-induced GPER activation represents a potentially novel and understudied mechanism of toxicity for environmentally relevant chemicals that affect vertebrate em-bryogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Background Ethanol {{exposure}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is one of}} the leading causes of preventable birth de-fects, leading to a range of symptoms collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. More moderate levels of prenatal ethanol exposure lead to a range of behavioural deficits including aggression, poor social interaction, poor cognitive performance and increased likelihood of addiction in later life. Current theories suggest that adaptation in the hypotha-lamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and neuroendocrine systems contributes to mood alter-ations underlying behavioural deficits and vulnerability to addiction. In using zebrafish (Danio rerio), the aim is to determine whether developmental ethanol exposure provokes changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis (the teleost equivalent of the HPA), as it does in mammalian models, therefore opening the possibilities of using <b>zebra-fish</b> to elucidate the mechanisms involved, and to test novel therapeutics to alleviate deleterious symptoms.

This clock comprises a multicellular genetic network of synchronized oscillators, coupled by intercellular Delta-Notch signaling. How this synchrony is established and how its loss determines the position of segmentation defects in Delta and Notch mutants are unknown. We analyzed the clock's synchrony dynamics by varying strength and timing of Notch coupling in <b>zebra-fish</b> embryos with techniques for quantitative perturbation of gene function. We developed a physical theory based on coupled phase oscillators explaining the observed onset and rescue of segmentation defects, the clock's robustness against developmental noise, and a critical point beyond which synchrony decays. We conclude that synchrony among these genetic oscillators can be established by simultaneous initiation and self-organization and that the segmentation defect position {{is determined by the}} difference between coupling strength and noise...|$|E

Next, we fitted the DEB model to new experimental data on <b>zebra-fish</b> growth and reproduction thus improving existing models. We further analysed the DEB-model and DEB-IBM using a sensitivity analysis. Finally, the predictions of the DEB-IBM were compared to existing observations on natural zebrafish populations and the predicted population dynamics are realistic.

40|$|Abstract Components of purinergic {{signalling}} {{are expressed}} in the early embryo raising the possibility that ATP, ADP and adenosine {{may contribute to the}} mechanisms of embryonic development. We summarize the available data from four developmental models—mouse, chick, Xenopus and <b>zebra-fish.</b> While there are some notable examples where purinergic signalling is indeed important during development, e. g. de-velopment of the eye in the frog, it is puzzling that deletion of single components of purinergic signalling often results in rather minor developmental phenotypes. We suggest that a key step in further analysis is to perform combinatorial alter-ations of expression of purinergic signalling components to uncover their roles in development. We introduce the concept that purinergic signalling could create novel morphogenetic fields to encode spatial location via the concentration of ATP, ADP and adenosine. We show that using minimal assump-tions and the known properties of the ectonucleotidases, com-plex spatial patterns of ATP and adenosine can be set up.

The Runx 1 + 24 mCNE was found to possess hematopoietic-specific enhancer activity in both <b>zebra-fish</b> and mouse models. Significantly, this enhancer is active specifically in hemogenic endothelial cells (ECs) at sites where the de novo generation of HSCs occurs. The activity of this enhancer is also strictly restricted to HSCs within the hematopoietic compartment of the adult bone marrow.

CaMKIV consists of a catalytic domain and a regula-tory (Ca 2 þ/calmodulin binding and autoinhibitory) domain, which {{are located in the}} N-terminal and cen-tral regions, respectively. Here, we identified the <b>zebra-fish</b> homologue of CaMKIV (zCaMKIV) on the basis of biochemical characterization. zCaMKIV showed similar biochemical properties as well as tissue and subcellular distributions to rat CaMKIV (rCaMKIV). However, zCaMKIV had a fairly small size with a mo-lecular mass of about 40 kDa, and was devoid of a region corresponding to the C-terminal domain of rCaMKIV. Since zCaMKIV is composed of regions that are nearly equivalent to only a catalytic and a regulatory domain, it should represent a minimum size homologue possessing CaMKIV function. zCaMKIV and rCaMKIV differed in their substrate specificities, since rCaMKIV preferred histone H 1 over myelin basic protein, while zCaMKIV did not. Moreover, zCaMKIV was more readily dephosphory-lated by zebrafish nuclear CaMK phosphatase (CaMKP-N) than rCaMKIV.

Multiple steps of cardiac development, including endocardial cushion morphogenesis and development of neural crest cells, are challenged under elevated glucose condi-tions. However, the direct effect of hyperglycemia on embryo heart organogenesis remains to be investi-gated. METHODS: Zebrafish embryos in different stages were exposed to D-glucose for 12 or 24 hr to deter-mine the sensitive window during early heart development. In the subsequent study, 6 hr post-fertilization embryos were treated with either 25 mmol/liter D-glucose or L-glucose for 24 hr. The expression of genes was analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The highest incidence of cardiac malforma-tions was found during 6 – 30 hpf exposure periods. After 24 hr exposure, D-glucose–treated embryos exhib-ited significant developmental delay and diverse cardiac malformations, but embryos exposed to L-glucose showed no apparent phenotype. Further investigation of the origin of heart defects showed that cardiac looping was affected earliest, while the specification of cardiac progenitors and heart tube assembly were complete. Moreover, the expression patterns of tbx 5, tbx 20, and has 2 were altered in the defective hearts.

At 5 Hz, this number is {{of the order of}} one thousand, i. e. approximately 1 - 2 % of the brain. We demonstrate that this limitation can be greatly overcome by using Selec-tive-Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) [2 - 4]. <b>Zebra-fish</b> larvae expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP 3 were illuminated with a scanned laser sheet and imaged with a camera whose optical axis was oriented orthogonally to the illumination plane.

Methods: In this study, we examined the underlying mechanisms of Rg 3 -induced angiosuppression through modulating the miRNA expression. In the miRNA-expression profiling analysis, six miRNAs and three miRNAs were found to be up- or down-regulated in vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-induced human-umbilical-vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after Rg 3 treatment, respectively. Results: A computational prediction suggested that mature hsa-miR- 520 h (miR- 520 h) targets ephrin receptor (Eph) B 2 and EphB 4, and hence, affecting angiogenesis. The up-regulation of miR- 520 h after Rg 3 treatment was validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, while the protein expressions of EphB 2 and EphB 4 were found to decrease, respectively. The mimics and inhibitors of miR- 520 h were transfected into HUVECs and injected into <b>zebra-fish</b> embryos. The results showed that overexpression of miR- 520 h could significantly suppress the EphB 2 and EphB 4 protein expression, proliferation, and tubulogenesis of HUVECs, and the subintestinal-vessel formation of the zebra fish.

In this study, we identified several imprinted genes and their orthologs in human, mouse, and <b>zebra-fish,</b> including 30 previously identified human and mouse imprinted genes. Next, using the HomoloGene database, we identified six orthologous genes in human, mouse, and chicken; however, no orthologs were identified for SLC 22 A 18, and mouse Ppp 1 r 9 a {{was not included in the}} HomoloGene database.

Despite this singular level of conservation, no substrate or function for SULT 4 A 1 has been identified. Previous studies demonstrated that SULT 4 A 1 does not bind the obligate sulfate donor, 39 -phosphoadenosine- 59 -phosphosulfate, yet SULT 4 A 1 is classified as a SULT superfamily member based on sequence and structural similarities to the other SULTs. In this study, transcription activator-like effector nucleases were used to generate heritable mutations in the SULT 4 A 1 gene of zebrafish. The mutation (SULT 4 A 1 D 8) consists of an 8 -nucleotide deletion within the second exon of the gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation and premature stop codon after 132 AA.

KESM {{was developed in}} the Brain Networks Lab (BNL) at Texas A&M University. The KESM has been used to section animal tissue embedded in a plastic block using a diamond knife. During each cut, the plastic block containing the tissue contacts the knife and that impact induces vibrations, known as knife chatter. These vibrations introduce noise in the image captured from the cut slice. This research is aimed at determining a metric to quantify knife chatter in the images acquired using the KESM, and to test if the use of a vibrating knife reduces knife chatter. Knife chatter appears as repeated parallel streaks in the images. A quantitative characterization of knife chatter is difficult since there is no regular pattern with which it appears. Having no regular pattern makes it very challenging to detect the chatter using automated programs. Observing the Fast Fourier Transforms of the images tells us that a narrow vertical band around the central vertical axis contains information exclusively about the chatter, while most of the information about the object in the image is outside the vertical band that represents the knife chatter. Using this information, we can quantitatively characterize knife chatter as a ratio of (1) the width of the region in the Fast Fourier Transform that corresponds to the knife chatter, and (2) the width of the region that corresponds to the object. Determining if the introduction of vibrations in the KESM diamond knife affects the amount of knife chatter present in the images was achieved by sectioning specimens of nissl-stained <b>zebra-fish</b> embryos embedded into araldite blocks, at different knife vibration frequencies. External sinusoidal wave vibrations were introduced in the KESM knife from a signal generator throughout the sectioning process. These electrical signals were converted to mechanical waves {{at the tip of the}} KESM knife blade. Performing such experiments at different oscillation frequencies enabled us to compare data using the metric described above. The results indicate that sectioning tissues with external vibrations does affect the amount of total data bandwidth taken up just by the chatter, and in some cases, reduces the relative width of the bandwidth taken up by the chatter...|$|E
40|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} (AgNP) {{are one of}} {{the most}} commonly used nanomaterials in commercial products, such as food packaging materials. Humans are prone to oral exposure to AgNP through direct consumption and leachate from AgNPcontaining products to the environment. In vivo studies demonstrated that AgNP would lead to malformation in <b>zebra-fish</b> embryos in a dose-dependent manner. Maternal oral exposure to AgNP would lead to a detectable amount of silver in developing rat fetuses. Distribution and toxicity of AgNP are closely related to its physicochemical properties, such as size, surface chemistry and shape, and degree of dissolution, highlighted the importance of using AgNP of the same physicochemical properties to ensure fair comparison across different studies. The hypothesis of the present study is that maternal exposure to AgNP would lead to transplacental transfer of silver, AgNP and/or silver-containing molecules, and such transfer would result in prenatal developmental toxicity in fetuses. In order to address this hypothesis, the present study investigated the transplacental transfer of AgNP and the potential risks by using in vivo model, human placental perfusion model and human placental villous explant cultures. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated AgNP (PVP-AgNP) was chosen for the present study. In the prenatal developmental toxicity study, upon oral exposure of 150 - 600 mg/kg/day of PVP-AgNP to pregnant rats during gestation day 6 - 19, silver and silver-containing NPs were detected in kidneys, livers, brains, placentas and blood of pregnant animals. Though relatively high levels of silver and silver-containing NP were detected in placentas, fetuses were not perfectly protected from silver and silver-containing NP exposure. However, such exposure level would not lead to developmental toxicity to fetuses, as demonstrated by skeletal and visceral examination of fetuses. Human placental perfusion was conducted to investigate whether transplacental transfer of silver would also occur in human placenta. With 25 μg/ml of PVPAgNP (100 times higher than average concentration of silver in pregnant dams) in the maternal reservoir, no silver was detected in the fetal reservoir after 4 hour of perfusion. Further study would be required to increase the number of successful perfusion. The effect of PVP-AgNP exposure to human placenta was examined with the use of human placental villous explants. Upon exposure of villous explants to 0. 025 - 25 μg/ml of PVP-AgNP, no significant changes in expression of p 38 MAPK (p 38), extracellular kinases (ERK 1 / 2) and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun amino terminal kinases (SAPK/JNK), their phosphorylated forms occurred when compared to control, though a dose-dependent increase was observed in phosphorylated-mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) expression. In conclusion, 150 - 600 mg/kg/day of PVP-AgNP would lead to transplacental transfer of silver, silver ion, and/or silver-containing NP to developing fetuses in rats, but not in term human placenta using ex vivo models. Exposure of human placental tissue to 0. 025 - 25 μg/ml of PVP-AgNP for 24 hours did not seem to associate with oxidative stress. Further investigation is required for safety assurance of PVP-AgNP to the vulnerable populations. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases and {{belong to}} a larger family of metzincin peptidases. They are mainly known for their {{capacity}} to cleave structural elements of the extracellular matrix and to (in) activate many molecules involved in signal transduction. As a result, {{they are involved in}} a wide variety of biological processes. Besides a proven detrimental role in neurological diseases, a beneficial role for MMPs in key physiological and regenerative brain events is emerging, indicating these proteinases as relevant therapeutic targets in the pathological central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, MMPs not only affect migration and survival of neurons, axon guidance, myelination and synaptogenesis, they also appear to modulate neural stem cell properties and differentiation. Although an involvement of MMPs in the development and regeneration of the optic circuit was sporadically reported, the nature and working mechanisms of individual MMPs in retinal and retinotectal development are still to be elucidated. MMP 14 is a membrane-bound MMP that is involved in mediating a wide range of processes. This protein is mostly known for its detrimental role in cancers, where MMP 14 is responsible for cell migration, tumor invasion and angiogenesis, resulting in highly vascularized tumors, and thus a poor outcome for patients with high MMP 14 expression in tumor cells. Furthermore, MMP 14 is reported to be involved in blood-brain barrier disruption after cerebral ischemia or trauma and is also suggested to play a role in Parkinsons disease. Besides these detrimental functions, MMP 14 expression is crucial in bone development and has been found in the developing and adult mammalian eye. Within this study, we intended to unravel the role of zebrafish Mmp 14 a, one of the two isoforms of mammalian MMP 14, during retinal and retinotectal axon pathfinding development. Since the zebrafish eye and visual system are easy to manipulate, fairly well characterized and highly conserved in vertebrates, it forms a powerful model system to study retinal and retinotectal pathway development. In the first part of our research, we showed, using whole mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, that Mmp 14 a expression can be found in the optic circuit of the developing zebrafish, such as the inner plexiform layer, the inner nuclear layer and the retinal ganglion cell layer of the retina, as well as in the optic nerve, the postoptic commissure and the neuropil of the optic tectum. Next, genetic inactivation of Mmp 14 a using morpholino technology resulted in microphthalmia, although it did not affect early eye development or general embryo morphology. By investigating the smaller eye phenotype in more detail, we identified a prolonged retinoblast proliferation, a retarded retinal neurogenesis wave, and a delayed retinal cell differentiation and retinal lamination in zebrafish embryos after Mmp 14 a knockdown. Moreover, Mmp 14 a morphants showed a persistently impaired innervation of the optic tectum. In contrast to Mmp 14 a, knockdown of Mmp 14 b did not result in any obvious defects in retinal neurogenesis or retinotectal pathway development. Finally, we also determined some of the mechanisms and possible substrates via which Mmp 14 a regulates retinal neurogenesis and retinotectal axon pathfinding. We elucidated a possible co-involvement of Mmp 2 and Mmp 14 a and identified Laminin 1 and Cadherin 11 as possible Mmp 14 a substrates in retinal and retinotectal development. Furthermore, preliminary findings suggest a possible interaction of Shh and/or Fgf, two major extrinsic factors involved in retinal neurogenesis, with Mmp 14 a in proper optic circuit development. Altogether, these findings reveal a prominent and novel role for Mmp 14 a in the development of the neuroretina and the retinotectal pathway in <b>zebra-fish</b> and may therefore have implications for future strategies interfering with optic circuit development and/or regeneration. status: publishe...|$|E
