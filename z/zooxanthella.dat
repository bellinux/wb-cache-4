50|$|Many corals {{rely on a}} {{symbiotic}} algae called <b>zooxanthellae</b> for nutrient uptake through photosynthesis. Corals obtain about 60-85% of their total nutrition from symbiotic <b>zooxanthellae.</b> Slight increases in sea surface temperature can cause <b>zooxanthellae</b> to die. Coral hosts become bleached when they lose their <b>zooxanthellae.</b> Difference in symbionts, determined by genetic groupings (clades A-H), may explain thermal tolerance in corals. Research has shown that some corals contain thermally-resistant clades of <b>zooxanthellae.</b> Corals housing primarily clade D symbionts, and certain types of thermally-resistant clade C symbionts, allow corals to avoid bleaching as severely as others experiencing the same stressor. Scientists remain in debate if thermal resistance in corals {{is due to a}} mixing or shifting of symbionts, or thermally resistant vs. thermally-sensitive types of <b>zooxanthellae.</b> Species of coral housing multiple types of <b>zooxanthellae</b> can withstand a 1-1.5 °C change in temperature.

40|$|Understanding {{the natural}} {{heterogeneity}} of coral <b>zooxanthellae</b> density appears as {{very important to}} understand variations in coral survival due to bleaching (the loss of these micro-algal symbionts). Heterogeneity of coral bleaching at different observation scales (within a colony, among neighbouring colonies {{of the same species}} or on a wider scale) remains largely misunderstood. The present work explores intracolonial, spatial and temporal variations of <b>zooxanthellae</b> density in the coral Acropora globiceps Dana 1846, over a period of three months on the forereef of Moorea, French Polynesia. In our study, intracolonial <b>zooxanthellae</b> densities did not vary significantly. However, <b>zooxanthellae</b> densities differed slightly between inner and outer branches but this trend was not significant at 6, 12 and 18 meters depth. On a wider scale, <b>zooxanthellae</b> densities also vary spatially : a positive correlation was observed between depth and symbiont density (density increases when light intensity decreases, so according to depth). Moreover, the location of colonies exposed to different hydrodynamical conditions was not a parameter controling the concentration of <b>zooxanthellae.</b> Finally, the temporal variation of <b>zooxanthellae</b> densities did not show significant variations even if it decreased slightly over the study period.

While the benefits of symbiosis with dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium (<b>zooxanthellae)</b> for corals are well understood, {{the costs of the}} association, particularly when under stress, remain a focus of much research. One of the primary impediments to exploring the costs of symbiosis in zooxanthellate corals is {{that it is impossible to}} examine the animal host in isolation. Evidence for a cost of symbiosis with <b>zooxanthellae</b> includes the fact that direct transmission of <b>zooxanthellae</b> between generations is rare, particularly in broadcast spawning corals. Fortuitously, the absence of <b>zooxanthellae</b> in oocytes of many species and the ability to readily infect larvae with <b>zooxanthellae</b> provide an opportunity to compare individuals with and without these symbionts. Here, we use this larval model to show that individuals with <b>zooxanthellae</b> have lower survival than those lacking <b>zooxanthellae</b> when exposed to high temperature. Higher activity of anti-oxidant defenses and higher levels of oxidative cellular damage in larvae with <b>zooxanthellae</b> suggest that oxidative stress originating in the symbionts is a cause of tissue damage in the host under heat stress.

50|$|Anthopleura ballii {{contains}} unicellular dinoflagellates living {{inside the}} tissues. These are species of Symbiodinium and are {{commonly known as}} <b>zooxanthellae.</b> They are photosynthetic organisms and provide the sea anemone with nutrients and energy, the products of photosynthesis. This type of arrangement is common in corals and sea anemones in nutrient-deficient tropical seas but is rare in temperate waters, which tend to be nutrient-rich. Researchers have found that the ova become infected with maternal <b>zooxanthellae</b> just before spawning takes place. The <b>zooxanthellae</b> are restricted {{to one side of the}} ovum and during the rearrangement of tissues that takes place during the development of the embryo into a planula larva, the <b>zooxanthellae</b> are confined to the endoderm of the larva and to the gastrodermal cells of the adult. This method of acquiring <b>zooxanthellae</b> is unusual. In tropical seas <b>zooxanthellae</b> are frequently liberated into the sea by symbiotic invertebrates and occur in the faeces of predators feeding on symbiotic cnidarians. This means that there is little need for maternal transfer of symbionts. This is not the case in temperate seas where free-living <b>zooxanthellae</b> are scarce.|$|R

50|$|Cynarina lacrymalis is a large, solitary coral with {{a single}} polyp {{nestling}} in a corallite, the stony cup it has secreted. It can grow to a diameter of 15 cm. It is cylindrical with a round or oval upper surface. It is usually fixed to rock but has a pointed base and can be embedded in sand or survive unattached. There are about twenty broad white radially arranged septa (ridges) joined to the corallite wall, with secondary septa between. They have large, rounded lobes and the central axial structure (columella) in the corallite is short and broad. The septa can be seen through the transparent, fleshy mantle which contains symbiotic flagellates known as zooxanthellae which give the coral its colour. This is usually pale brown or green, sometimes with a contrasting oral disc, but also sometimes pinkish or bluish. The colour depends on which species of <b>zooxanthella</b> take up residence.

50|$|Acropora cytherea is {{a colonial}} species of coral that grows in large {{horizontal}} plates. These are formed of many tiny branchlets growing vertically or {{at an angle}} and others growing horizontally to extend the colony. They may branch and link together and near the centre the plates may become a solid mass of joined branchlets. The surface of the coral is covered by {{a thin layer of}} living tissue. This has a rough surface and contains <b>zooxanthella,</b> symbiotic, unicellular, photosynthetic algae. These give the coral its cream or pale brown colour (occasionally pale blue). The calcium carbonate skeleton is secreted by many small polyps which are joined together through an interconnecting network of channels inside the skeleton. At night, and sometimes during the day, the polyps protrude from the skeleton and extend their tentacles to feed. At other times, they contract back into the safety of the skeleton. In older specimens, particularly those exceeding 2 m in diameter, the regular structure sometimes breaks down near the centre and there are growth anomalies. It has been found that these are not deleterious to the survival of the coral and may be caused by stress factors such as raised sea temperatures.|$|E

Mathematical models based upon density-dependent decreases in the algal division frequency and increases in algal release rates during the post-bleaching recovery period accurately predict the observed recovery period (ca. 20 weeks). The models suggest that (i) the colony recovered its algal population from {{the division of the}} remaining <b>zooxanthellae,</b> and (ii) the continual loss of <b>zooxanthellae</b> significantly slowed the recovery of the coral. Possible reasons for the 'paradoxical' loss of healthy <b>zooxanthellae</b> from the bleached coral are discussed in terms of endodermal processes occurring in the recovering coral and the redistribution of newly formed <b>zooxanthellae</b> to aposymbiotic host cells. At a steady-state algal density of 2. 1 x 106 <b>zooxanthellae</b> cm- 2 {{at the end of the}} recovery period, the <b>zooxanthellae</b> would have to form a double layer of cells in the coral tissues, consistent with microscopic observations.

The large increases in the algal densities reported in corals exposed to elevated nutrient concentrations (i. e between a two- and five-fold increase in the algal standing stock) are not consistent with this theory. We suggest that increases of this magnitude are a product of the experimental conditions: reasons for this statement are discussed. We propose that the stability of the coral–algal symbiosis under non-stress conditions, and the constancy of <b>zooxanthellae</b> densities in corals reported across growth form, depth and geographic range, are related to space availability limiting algal densities.

In the present study the paraffin blocks from this experiment were re-sectioned and stained for additional analysis. The sections were then examined for variability in the following stress parameters: 1) Symbiotic <b>zooxanthellae</b> and mucosecretory cell size (coenosarc, oral disk, and the middle polyp), 2) Epithelium thickness (coenosarc and oral disk), and 3) <b>Zooxanthellae</b> mitotic index (cell doublets) of cells (coenosarc and oral disk). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also utilized for an ultrastructural study of coenosarc tissue and associated <b>zooxanthellae.</b> These included: 1) <b>Zooxanthellae</b> size comparisons with cells assessed using histological measurements, 2) <b>Zooxanthellae</b> accumulation vacuole size, and 3) <b>Zooxanthellae</b> nuclei chromosome bundle number. Significant differences were found in the tissues and cells examined from different areas of the polyp as well as with duration of sanding treatment. In sanded corals, <b>zooxanthellae,</b> mucosecretory cell sizes, and the mitotic index increased significantly through week three, and decreased significantly in week four. In addition, the epithelium thickness decreased significantly throughout the study and indicates that sedimentation causes atrophy (thinning) of the epithelium. Sediment stress related increase in mucosecretory cell (MSC) size indicates that coral mucus production increased under sediment stress. This increase in MSC cell size is correlated with subsequent increase in both <b>zooxanthellae</b> size and mitotic index. These effects may be a result of nutrient enrichment due to the chemistry of the mucus. In addition, this study also demonstrates that <b>zooxanthellae</b> sizes are distinct in different areas of the polyp and may respond differently to sanding stress. Therefore, current protocols for extracting <b>zooxanthellae</b> from corals, which results in combining cells from several sections of the polyp, may not discriminate tissue-specific <b>zooxanthellae</b> characteristics. Future culture-work in which examination of mucus related nutrient enrichment effects, and ultrastructural/ biochemical tissue-specific characteristics of the <b>zooxanthellae</b> are proposed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} inorganic nutrition in tridacnids {{to address the}} question of nutrient limitation of their <b>zooxanthellae,</b> and the influence of elevated nutrient concentrations on calcification. Experiments consisted of three-month-long exposures of cultured Tridacna gigas in outdoor tanks and indigenous T. maxima in situ to increased levels of ammonia (N) and phosphate (P), alone or in combination (N+P). Following the incubation experiments, biomass and nutrient-depletion of the symbiotic partners were measured. In addition, a more detailed study was carried out on the effect of elevated P on the <b>zooxanthellae,</b> both in situ and in culture. Major findings from the outdoor experiments were confirmed in the field study, while laboratory experiments elucidated host involvement in nutrient limitation of the <b>zooxanthellae.</b> In particular, <b>zooxanthellae</b> are N-limited in vivo, as demonstrated by the increased <b>zooxanthellae</b> density in N-supplemented clams. The decrease in ammonium-depletion by <b>zooxanthellae</b> isolated from these clams demonstrates that <b>zooxanthellae</b> have access to increased N in sea water. N-limitation of <b>zooxanthellae,</b> therefore, is a function of sea water concentrations of inorganic N, particularly ammonia, as this nutrient can diffuse across cell membranes depending on its concentration gradient. Also, <b>zooxanthellae</b> are P-limited in vivo. Regardless of ambient phosphate concentrations in sea water, <b>zooxanthellae</b> inside the animal host were not affected, and they exhibited N:P ratios (> 30 : 1) and P-depletion rates similar to those of P-starved cultured <b>zooxanthellae.</b> Host involvement in P availability to the <b>zooxanthellae</b> is strongly implicated by: (1) the unaffected acid phosphatase activity (P-liberating enzymes) and undetectable polyphosphates (P reserves) in <b>zooxanthellae,</b> regardless of the clams' P environment; and (2) rapid growth, decreased N:P ratio, and decreased P-depletion by <b>zooxanthellae</b> grown under P-sufficient culture conditions. Host influence on the algae's P environment in vivo is further substantiated by the consistently low levels of inorganic phosphate (< 0. 1 pM)) in the haemolymph surrounding the zooxanthellal tubes, despite the clams' uptake and assimilation of P from sea water (i. e., decreased N:P ratio). P-limitation of <b>zooxanthellae,</b> therefore, is independent of ambient sea water concentrations of phosphate, which cannot passively cross cell membranes. The host's role in P availability to its <b>zooxanthellae</b> is either: (1) a natural consequence of the morphological and spatial relationships between the symbiotic partners, with the host retaining phosphate for its own use before the nutrient can reach the zooxanthellae; or (2) through active P restriction by the host to control its algal population. Investigation of calcification demonstrated that increased ambient levels of N and P modified shell formation in T. gigas as follows: (1) enhanced shell-extension rates, but reduced shell weights at equivalent size; (2) changes in crystal lattice parameters based on X-ray diffractometry on the shells; and (3) structural alterations in the outer shell layer, with misshapen aragonite crystals, irregular crossed-lamellar orientation, and increased porosity. Such skeletal weakening has adverse implications for calcifying organisms in eutrophic reef waters...|$|R
