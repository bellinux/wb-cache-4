50|$|MALT {{lymphoma}} is {{an often}} multifocal {{disease in the}} organ of origin and is frequently macroscopically indistinguishable from other disease processes in the GI tract. Endoscopy is key to diagnosing MALT lymphoma, with multiple biopsies of the visible lesions required, as well as samples of macroscopically normal tissue, termed gastric mapping. Histologically, there is expansion of the marginal <b>zone</b> <b>compartment</b> with development of sheets of neoplastic small lymphoid cells. The morphology of the neoplastic cells is variable with small mature lymphocytes, cells resembling centrocytes (centrocyte like cells), or marginal zone/monocytoid B cells. Plasmacytoid or plasmacytic differentiation is frequent. Lymphoid follicles are ubiquitous to MALT lymphoma but may be indistinct as they are often overrun or colonized by the neoplastic cells. Large transformed B cells are present scattered among the small cell population. If these large cells are present in clusters or sheets, a diagnosis of associated large B-cell lymphoma should be considered. A characteristic feature of MALT lymphoma {{is the presence of}} neoplastic cells within epithelial structures with associated destruction of the glandular architecture to form lymphoepithelial lesions.|$|E

40|$|Proceedings of the 11 th International Coastal Symposium, Szczecin, PolandInternational audienceField and {{numerical}} studies recently {{challenged the}} traditional paradigm of rip currents systems that states that rip currents produce a continuous interchange of waters between the surf zone and shelf. Instead {{it is suggested}} that rip current flow fields consist of semi-enclosed, large-scale vortices that retain floating material (e. g. drifters) {{at a rate of about}} 80 - 90 %. In this paper is presented a laboratory rip current experiment over eight contrasting nature-like beach morphologies involving deployment of a large number of drifters. When the rip current was symmetric over a typical bar and rip morphology (4 out of the 8 cases), only about 10 % of the drifters entering the rip exited the surf zone, whereas when the mean rip current was asymmetric, more drifters (~ 30 - 45 %) entering in the rip exited the surf <b>zone</b> <b>compartment.</b> Drifters exiting the surf <b>zone</b> <b>compartment</b> were not systematically caught by a pulsating jet. More frequently, these drifters were likely caught in a vortex being shed offshore, as they often looped track in the vicinity of the rip head before exiting the surfzone compartment. This confirms new thoughts on rip currents that are very important from the perspective of both mixing in the nearshore and beach safety: rip currents systems only sporadically produce intense interchange between the waters of the surf zone and the shelf. Results additionally suggest that asymmetric rip current retain less floating material than symmetric rip currents...|$|E

40|$|Drop-population balance {{tools such}} as “ReDrop” have the {{potential}} to be beneficial as they allow the compartment geometry along Kühni extraction columns to be quickly and efficiently optimized. In order to reliably use this potential, a quantitative understanding of the effect of compartment geometry and operating conditions such as impeller speed and counter-current flow on mean drop residence time and drop residence-time distribution is needed. Therefore, this work systematically investigates the impact of compartment geometry and operating conditions on the residence time of drops with different diameters, using single drop measurements in lab-scale cells with Kühni compartments. For each operating point, drop movement of up to 100 single drops is recorded with a high-speed camera. Here, drop residence times are not only evaluated for the entire compartment but also for three different <b>compartment</b> <b>zones.</b> These <b>compartment</b> <b>zones</b> are the lower zone 1 between bottom stator and impeller, the impeller zone 2, and the upper zone 3 between impeller and upper stator. Additionally, drop back-mixing between the <b>compartment</b> <b>zones</b> and <b>compartments</b> as well as the number of drops hitting the upper stator or the impeller are evaluated quantitatively. Amongst other things, this detailed evaluation of drop behavior inside the compartment shows that on their way through the compartment, drops spend up to four times longer in zone 3 than in zone 1. It is then shown {{that it is possible to}} reduce compartment height by 20 % while positioning the impeller asymmetrically inside the compartment without this having any significant effect on mean drop residence time. On the basis of the experimental findings, the Zone-walk model is developed. This model describes drop residence times in Kühni compartments using stochastic methods in order to map drop interaction with internals and the velocity fields inside the compartment. The Zone-walk model is divided into three sub-models, each sub-model describing drop movement in one of the <b>compartment</b> <b>zones.</b> In this model, drops can be back- and forward-mixed between the individual <b>compartment</b> <b>zones</b> as well as between compartments. The Zone-walk model not only accurately describes the influence on drop residence times of the compartment geometries and operating conditions investigated, but can also be successfully extrapolated to further compartment geometries and liquid-liquid systems from the literature. Finally, the Zone-walk model is successfully validated in combination with “ReDrop” by comparing simulation results with data from the literature for two pilot-plant Kühni columns...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a laboratory experiment of rip current circulations over a moveable bed. The rip current characteristics over four distinct beach morphologies, exhibiting {{more or less}} developed nature-like bar-rip morphology,were investigated. For each video run, the same off shore shore-normal waves were generated by the wave maker with the same mean water level in order to study {{the sensitivity of the}} rip current characteristics {{as a function of the}} beach morphology only. In each case, a 1 -hour video run was used to track a large number (~ 30) of drifters released within the surf zone. Image coordinates were then rectifie d to still water level Cartesian coordinates to compute drifter velocities, mean characteristics and surf zone rete ntion rates. Results show the presence of classic rip current patterns with counter-rotating cells and a relatively narrowoffshore-directed jet with, for three of the situations, a reasonably symmetric shape. Non-surprisingly, it was found that rip current intensity increases with increasing relative depth of the rip channel. The wave-driven circulations were strongly unstable. Computed standard deviation in fl ow intensity and direction provides high resolution information on the spatial variability of the rip current insta bilities with, for instance, highly-pulsating and weakly directionally variable offshore-directed flow in the rip channel. Conversely to what was previously hypothesized in the literature, there was hardly trace of vortices being shed offs hore and drifters exiting the surf <b>zone</b> <b>compartment</b> were not systematically caught by a pulsating jet. The cause for drifter exiting the semi-enclosed surf <b>zone</b> <b>compartment</b> remains, however, elusive and deserves further investigations.

We show that, in mouse epidermis, Lrig 1 defines the hair follicle junctional zone adjacent to the sebaceous glands and infundibulum.

Contributions of different subsurface runoff mechanisms to the catchment discharge formation at two small forested headwater catchments are studied {{with the help of}} their natural isotopic signatures. The Uhlirska catchment (Jizera Mts., Czech Republic) is situated in headwater area of the Lusatian Neisse River. The catchment includes wetlands at the valley bottom developed over deluviofluvial granitic sediments surrounded by gentle hillslopes with shallow soils underlain by weathered granite. The Liz catchment (Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic) is situated in headwater area of the Otava River. It belongs to hillslope-type catchments with narrow riparian zones. The soil at Liz is developed on biotite paragneiss bedrock. The basic comparison of hydrological time series reveals that the event-related stream discharge variations at the Uhlirska catchment are bigger and significantly more frequent than at Liz. The analysis of isotope concentration data revealed different behavior of the two catchments during the major rainfall-runoff events. At Uhlirska, the percentage of the direct runoff formed by the event water reaches its maximum on the falling limb of the hydrograph. At Liz, the event water related fraction of the direct outflow is maximal on the rising limb of the hydrograph and then lowers.

Disruptions in the establishment of the placenta and its interactions with the maternal uterus are potential causes of pregnancy failure. In this study we investigated the pregnancy phenotype of two inbred rat strains: the Dahl Salt Sensitive (DSS) strain and the Brown Norway (BN) strain. The DSS strain is reported to have large litters, whereas the BN strain has small litters. Pregnant female rats of each strain were killed on various days of gestation. At the time of killing, the number of viable versus dead and/or resorbing conceptuses was determined. Placental tissues from viable conceptuses were collected and processed for biochemical and histologic analyses. The number of viable conceptuses at Days 8. 5 and 18. 5 of gestation was significantly greater in DSS versus BN rats. Additionally, the number of resorbing and/or dying conceptuses was significantly greater in the BN strain than in the DSS strain. Maternal responses to pregnancy and elements of placental and fetal development in DSS and BN rats differed. Immunohistologic analysis of placentation and gene expression profiles revealed that trophoblast cell invasion into the uterine mesometrial compartment was significantly less in the BN strain versus the DSS strain. In contrast, the uterine natural killer cell population was reciprocally expanded in the BN strain. The impairment in trophoblast cell invasion in BN rats was associated with a smaller junctional <b>zone</b> <b>compartment</b> of the chorioallan-toic placenta.

The cellular pathways and selective pressures involved in MZ B cell development, however, are poorly characterized. Selection of newly formed B cells into the follicular or marginal <b>zone</b> <b>compartments</b> is thought to occur via proliferative intermediates expressing high levels of CD 21 / 35 and CD 23. However, I show that CD 21 / 35 high CD 23 + splenocytes are not enriched for proliferative cells and do not significantly contribute to the generation of follicular B cells. Instead, these cells serve primarily as precursors for MZ B cells. This precursor-product relationship is supported by ontogenic relationships, steady-state kinetic labeling studies, and adoptive transfer experiments. Also, CD 21 / 35 high CD 23 + splenocytes share several key characteristics with MZ B cells, including their capacity to trap T-independent antigen and their heightened proliferative response to LPS. ^ Furthermore, B-cell deficiency promotes development of MZ B cells from multiple splenic subsets, including follicular B cells. I show that highly purified follicular B cells transferred into lymphopenic hosts differentiate via a stepwise process into marginal zone (MZ) B cells as judged by surface phenotype, anatomical localization, and functional criteria. The extent of lymphopenia in the B cell compartment of the host dictates the degree of this homeostatic response. Notch signaling, which is dispensable for the development and function of follicular B cells, is required for homeostatic proliferation and generation of MZ B cells from follicular B cells and is mitogenic for mature B cells ex vivo. Overall, my observations challenge previous models of peripheral intermediates Furthermore MZ B cells can be generated from follicular B cells in B cell maturation and suggest that MZ B cells develop via CD 21 / 35 high CD 23 + lymphopenic environments by a Notch-dependent mechanism. ...|$|R

The aims {{of this study are}} to identify the origin of Li in the different compartments and to better characterize the behavior of Li and its isotopes during water-rock interaction in a highly cation-depleted soil. The Li isotope signature (d 7 Li) of throughfall samples varies between + 11. 2 per mil and + 26. 4 per mil. As this is lower than the seawater signature (31 per mil) and vegetation does not fractionate Li isotopes, our data indicate that Saharan dust (- 0. 7 per mil) significantly contributes to the throughfall signature. Li isotope composition measured in a 12. 5 m deep soil profile varies from + 3. 9 per mil near the surface to - 13. 5 per mil at 11 m depth. Compared to unweathered andesite (+ 5 per mil), the deep soil signature is in agreement with preferential incorporation of light Li into secondary minerals. In the top soil however, our results also emphasized that atmospheric deposition (wet and dry) is a main source of Li to the soil. The decreasing d 7 Li with increasing depth is consistent with a vertical gradient of incorporation of heavy atmospheric Li, this input being maximal near the surface. At the catchment scale, throughfall and total atmospheric inputs (sea salts + Saharan dust) provide 12. 1 and 23. 9 g Li yr- 1 respectively to the Quiock Creek catchment. These fluxes represent 34 % and 67 %, respectively, of Li exported at the outlet indicating that atmospheric deposition {{is one of the main}} Li inputs to the critical zone.

Whereas BAFF enhanced long-term B cell survival primarily through the alternative, but not the classical, NF-κB pathway, it promoted immunoglobulin class switching and generation of pathogenic antibodies through the classical pathway. Activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway resulted in integrin upregulation, thereby retaining autoreactive B cells in the splenic marginal <b>zone,</b> a <b>compartment</b> that contributes to their survival.

Inadequate housing conditions can cause behavioural problems also in fish since they are complex animals with sophisticated behaviour. In this study, we investigated the influence of environmental complexity on compartment preference and behaviour in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and checker barbs (Puntius oligolepis). For the preference test, large aquaria were divided by two semi-transparent walls of Plexiglas into an empty compartment, a structured compartment enriched with plants and clay pots, and a smaller compartment in-between, where food was provided. For observation, the empty and structured compartments were divided into six zones of similar size by defining three vertical layers and two horizontal areas (back vs. front area). Seven groups of six to nine zebrafish and seven groups of seven or eight checker barbs were observed on four days each (within a time period of ten days) to assess compartment use and activity, and to assess behavioural diversity and use of <b>zones</b> within <b>compartments.</b> Both zebrafish and checker barbs showed a significant preference for the structured compartment. Nevertheless, in neither species did behavioural diversity differ between the empty and structured compartment. Zebrafish used all <b>zones</b> in both <b>compartments</b> to the same extent. Checker barbs, however, used the structured compartment more evenly than the empty compartment, where they mainly used the lower and middle zones. These results suggest that zebrafish and checker barbs have a preference for complex environments.

Several limitations with this approach have been identified including seed pinching, presence of stray light, and adaptation to plant spacing over time.

Black coloured body is chosen together with side protrusion on its traytop to block stray light. The new design is also complete with traytop variants to accommodate growing plants and increased canopy cover. The variants include 4 -hole, 2 -hole and single-hole traytops. The root compartment also includes several added sections to cope with growing plant roots. Feedlines for the misters are placed outside the container to facilitate better cleaning and the container floor is elevated with a 3 ° angle to direct water to its drain hole. Seal rings and rubber strips are added onto the plastic pucks and their insert location on the traytop to seal off against water leakage.

40|$|AaSTRACr: Modern sediments of the James River estuary {{have been}} studied to {{characterize}} the lithofacies and to relate the facies pattern to estuary morphology and the energy regime. The estuary was formed by Holocene drowning of a river valley incised in Cenozoic oastal plain deposits. Morphologic analysis of sinuosity, width-depth ratios, and convergence haracteristics reveals three compartments: 1) bay-mouth, 2) estuary funnel and 3) meander <b>zone.</b> Each <b>compartment</b> exhibits acharacteristic l thofacies reflecting different proportions of wave, tidal and fluvial energy. These lithofacies form a longitudinal tripartite pattern, i. e., sand-mud [...] sand, with coarse-grained sediment at the energetic ends of the system. The seaward facies boundary is transitional {{as a result of}} mixing fluvial and marine sediment. In contrast, the landward boundary is abrupt {{as a result of a}} rapid seaward ecrease in the river flood bedload which is partly attenuated by the tide. The tripartite facies develop in a transgressive wedge filling the path of the pre-Holocene fluvial drainage. A model is proposed for recognizing the sequence of ancient ransgressive estuarine facies. The sequence fines upward except at the mouth and reflects the seaward evolution of environments from fluvial to fluvial estuarine, estuarine and marine estuarine...|$|R
40|$|Neonatal {{white matter}} injury (nWMI) is an {{increasingly}} {{common cause of}} cerebral palsy that results predominantly from hypoxic injury to progenitor cells {{including those of the}} oligoden-drocyte lineage. Existing mouse models of nWMI utilize prolonged periods of hypoxia during the neonatal period, require complex cross-fostering and exhibit poor growth and high mor-tality rates. Abnormal CNS myelin composition serves as the major explanation for persis-tent neuro-motor deficits. Here we developed a simplified model of nWMI with low mortality rates and improved growth without cross-fostering. Neonatal mice are exposed to low oxy-gen from postnatal day (P) 3 to P 7, which roughly corresponds to the period of human brain development between gestational weeks 32 and 36. CNS hypomyelination is detectable for 2 – 3 weeks post injury and strongly correlates with levels of body and brain weight loss. Im-mediately following hypoxia treatment, cell death was evident in multiple brain regions, most notably in superficial and deep cortical layers as well as the subventricular <b>zone</b> pro-genitor <b>compartment.</b> PDGFαR, Nkx 2. 2, and Olig 2 positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cell were significantly reduced until postnatal day 27. In addition to CNS dysmyelination w...|$|R
40|$|The {{repertoire}} of B cells secreting antibodies with unique antigen-binding specificities is produced at two stages: a primary B-cell repertoire is {{formed in the}} bone marrow through immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, whereas a secondary B-cell repertoire is generated in the peripheral lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) through somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination upon antigen encounter. The latter events take place within highly specialized histological structures, designated B follicles, which are composed of distinct microanatomical compartments namely the follicle centre, lymphocytic corona and marginal <b>zone.</b> Each <b>compartment</b> comprises a particular subset of B cells, characterized by unique properties, thereby reflecting the complexity and variability in the spectrum of defence mechanisms against invading pathogens. The past years have spawned an avalanche of new data and information that encompasses both the structure and function of each compartment and its B cells. This review incorporates up-to-date information on peripheral B-cell differentiation into a challenging working model, thereby pointing to the structural and functional imprint of both the T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent immune response on the B follicle. As such, this article aims to form an excellent base for {{a better understanding of}} the normal counterpart of B-cell-derived haematological malignancies (leukemias and lymphomas). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies directed against T and B lymphocyte antigens {{was used to}} analyze the presence and localization of several lymphocyte subsets in 13 normal human spleens (3 of newborns) and 17 uninvolved spleens of patients with Hodgkin's disease. The distribution of cells in the white pulp corresponded with findings in other secondary lymphoid organs, except for the presence of a marginal <b>zone,</b> a unique <b>compartment</b> localized at the border of white and red pulp. The phenotype of the marginal zone cells indicates that {{it is likely that the}} marginal zone contains nonrecirculating as well as recirculating B cells, while T cells (of the T helper type) are also represented. Therefore, the notion that marginal zone cells are nonrecirculating IgM+, IgD- cells, appears to be an oversimplification. No clear differences were observed between spleens of patients with and without Hodgkin's disease...|$|R
40|$|A broad-based geochemical approach, {{including}} {{chemical and}} isotopic analyses of ground water, chemical analysis of aquifer materials, and laboratory water-rock experiments, {{was used to}} evaluate the origin and chemical evolution of ground water on La Palma, a volcanic island in the Canary Archipelago. Stable isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and sulfur were successfully used to delineate recharge zones and identify solute sources. Laboratory study of water-rock interactions established the source of solutes {{and the nature of the}} chemical reactions that control ground-water chemistry. Most ground water on La Palma originates in a recharge zone that encircles the island from 500 to 1800 meters above sea level. Dry fallout and seaspray are minor sources of solutes, however, evaporative concentration during recharge may produce elevated chloride levels in some portions of the island. Laboratory water-rock experiments and ground-water analyses indicate that incongruent dissolution of aluminosilicate minerals is the dominant process of solute acquisition. The geochemical evolution of most waters is controlled by the availability of dissolved carbon dioxide gas. However, oxidation of pyrite enhances the reactivity of ground water in some portions of the island. Waters in the early phases of chemical evolution appear to be in equilibrium with a kaolinite alteration product, whereas more mineralized waters have compositions consistent with smectite equilibrium. <b>Zones</b> or <b>compartments</b> of ground-water flow were delineated by classifying sampling sites into geochemically distinct groups. Eight distinct zones of ground-water flow were identified using these criteria, including superimposed but hydrologically separate flow paths...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHeadwater {{woodland}} streams {{are primarily}} heterotrophic: they receive substantial inputs {{of organic matter}} from the riparian vegetation, while autochthonous primary production is generally low. A substantial part of leaf litter entering running waters may be buried in the streambed because of flooding and sediment movement. Although the general significance of the hyporheic zone for stream metabolism has been reported early, organic matter storage within the sediment of streams has received less attention, with most studies only quantifying accumulations at the streambed surface and ignoring other stream compartments. In the present study, the amounts of three fractions of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM; > 16, 4 - 16 and 1 - 4 mm) were determined in late autumn and early spring in the interstitial and benthic zones of three head- water streams of the Montagne Noire (South-Western France) differing in their substratum grain size. Our findings demonstrated that the total CPOM content in the interstitial zone can be much (up to one order of magnitude) higher than at the sediment surface. The sandy bottomed stream exhibited a higher amount of CPOM (whatever the size fraction) than the two other streams, suggesting that the sediment particle size may be {{a major determinant of}} CPOM storage. Given the large amount of organic matter stored in the interstitial <b>zone,</b> this <b>compartment</b> may play an important role for the carbon turnover and associated trophic dynamics in the stream ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe role of BAFF in B cell self {{tolerance}} {{was examined}} by tracking {{the fate of}} anti-HEL self-reactive B cells in BAFF transgenic mice using four different models of self-reactive B cell deletion. BAFF overexpression {{did not affect the}} development of self-reactive B cells normally deleted in the bone marrow or during the early stages of peripheral development. By contrast, self-reactive B cells normally deleted around the late T 2 stage of peripheral development were rescued from deletion, matured, and colonized the splenic follicle. Furthermore, self-reactive B cells normally selectively deleted from the marginal <b>zone</b> repopulated this <b>compartment</b> when excess BAFF was present. Self-reactive B cells rescued by excess BAFF were not anergic. BAFF overexpression therefore rescued only self-reactive B cells normally deleted with relatively low stringency and facilitated their migration into otherwise forbidden microenvironments. This partial subversion of B cell self tolerance is likely to underlie the autoimmunity associated with BAFF overexpression...|$|R
