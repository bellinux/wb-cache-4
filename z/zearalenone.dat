25|$|The {{reaction}} {{occurs in}} the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene. The mechanism begins with formation of the 2-pyridinethiol ester (scheme 19). Proton-transfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center, providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product. One of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of <b>zearalenone</b> (scheme 20).|$|E
5000|$|Zearalenone: <b>Zearalenone</b> (6-10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl-B-resorcyclic acid lactone), a {{secondary}} metabolite from Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) {{was given the}} trivial name <b>zearalenone</b> as a combination of G. zeae, resorcylic acid lactone, -ene (for {{the presence of the}} C-1′ to C-2 double bond), and -one, for the C-6′ ketone. Almost simultaneously, a second group isolated, crystallized, and studied the metabolic properties of the same compound and named it F-2. Much of the early literature uses <b>zearalenone</b> and F-2 as synonyms; the family of analogues are known as zearalenones and F-2 toxins, respectively. Perhaps because the original work on these fungal macrolides coincided with the discovery of aflatoxins, chapters on <b>zearalenone</b> have become a regular fixture in monographs on mycotoxins (see, for example, Mirocha and Christensen [...] and Betina [...] ). Nevertheless, the word toxin is almost certainly a misnomer because <b>zearalenone,</b> while biologically potent, is hardly toxic; rather, it sufficiently resembles 17β-estradiol, the principal hormone produced by the human ovary, to allow it to bind to estrogen receptors in mammalian target cells [...] <b>Zearalenone</b> is better classified as a nonsteroidal estrogen or mycoestrogen. Sometimes it is called a phytoestrogen. For the structure-activity relationships of <b>zearalenone</b> and its analogues, see Hurd [...] and Shier.|$|E
50|$|The TLC {{method for}} <b>zearalenone</b> is: normal phase silica gel plates, the eluent: 90% dichloromethane, 10% v/v acetone; or reverse phase C18 silica plates; the eluent: 90% v/v methanol, 10% water. <b>Zearalenone</b> gives unmistakable blue {{luminiscence}} under UV.|$|E
50|$|Several Fusarium species produce toxic {{substances}} of considerable concern to livestock and poultry producers, namely deoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and <b>zearalenone.</b> <b>Zearalenone</b> {{is the primary}} toxin, causing infertility, abortion or other breeding problems, especially in swine.|$|E
5000|$|... α-Zearalenol is a nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} of the resorcylic acid lactone group {{related to}} mycoestrogens found in Fusarium spp. It is the α epimer of β-zearalenol {{and along with}} β-zearalenol is a major metabolite of <b>zearalenone</b> formed mainly in the liver but also {{to a lesser extent}} in the intestines during first-pass metabolism. A relatively low proportion of β-zearalenol is formed from <b>zearalenone</b> compared to α-zearalenol in humans. α-Zearalenol is about 3- to 4-fold more potent as an estrogen relative to <b>zearalenone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mycoestrogens: {{taleranol}} (β-zearalanol), α-zearalenol, β-zearalenol, zearalanone, <b>zearalenone,</b> zeranol (α-zearalanol) ...|$|E
5000|$|Those {{produced}} by fungi {{are known as}} mycoestrogens (e.g., <b>zearalenone).</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Zearalenone</b> Other {{supplements}} {{are unlikely}} to have been spoiled with the mould.|$|E
5000|$|Mycoestrogens are estrogens {{produced}} by fungi. Among important mycoestrogens are <b>zearalenone,</b> zearalenol and zearalanol [...] Although {{all of these}} can be {{produced by}} various Fusarium species, [...] zearalenol and zearalanol may also be produced endogenously in ruminants that have ingested <b>zearalenone.</b> Alpha-zearalanol is also produced semisynthetically, for veterinary use; such use is prohibited in the European Union.|$|E
50|$|Zearalanone (ZAN) is a semi-synthetic mycoestrogen {{that is a}} {{derivative}} of <b>zearalenone</b> (ZEN).|$|E
50|$|Fusarium acaciae-mearnsii is an fungus {{species of}} the genus Fusarium which {{produces}} <b>zearalenone</b> and zearalenol.|$|E
50|$|One ingredient, kava {{may cause}} liver damage. Black cohosh {{has been shown}} to have no estrogenic effect in vivo or in vitro. Hops contain estrogen-like compounds, called prenylflavonoids, of the most potent is 8-prenylnaringenin. Hops' role on {{fertility}} lacks research. Prenylflavonoids from hops have anticancer properties. <b>Zearalenone</b> and its derivatives are a class of xenoestrogens associated with many herbal bust enhancement products. There have been some indications that <b>Zearalenone</b> can increase the size of breasts in humans, but there are no tests of efficacy or safety. <b>Zearalenone,</b> produced by a toxic fungus, is a mycoestrogen that stimulates the growth of breast cancer cells, increases the chance of estrogen dependent breast cancer, and may reduce fertility. Other supplements are unlikely to have been spoiled with the mould.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other species}} in genus Fusarium, this fungus {{produces}} mycotoxins. It {{is a source}} of nivalenol, 4-acetylnivalenol, and <b>zearalenone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Zearalenone</b> can {{permeate}} {{through the}} human skin.However, no significant hormonal effects are expected after dermal contact in normal agricultural or residential environments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zearalenone</b> is {{heat-stable}} and {{is found}} worldwide {{in a number}} of cereal crops, such as maize, barley, oats, wheat, rice, and sorghum.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its actions on the classical estrogen receptors, <b>zearalenone</b> {{has been found to}} act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).|$|E

50|$|Resorcylic acid lactones are a {{group of}} estrogenic compounds. They are lactones of resorcylic acid. Examples include the mycoestrogens (and {{synthetic}} analogues) <b>zearalenone,</b> zearalanone, zeranol (α-zearalanol), taleranol (β-zearalanol), α-zearalenol, and β-zearalenol.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{finished}} beer is not contaminated with the fungi, 33% of commercially brewed sorghum beer contained aflatoxins and 45% of home-brewed beers contained <b>zearalenone</b> and/or ochratoxin A {{in the final}} product.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other mycotoxins, {{sampling}} food commodities for <b>zearalenone</b> must {{be carried out}} to obtain samples representative of the consignment under test. Commonly used extraction solvents are aqueous mixtures of methanol, acetonitrile, or ethyl acetate followed by a range of different clean-up procedures that depend in part on the food and on the detection method in use. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) methods and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are commonly used. HPLC alone is not sufficient, as it may often yield false positive results. Today, HPLC-MS/MS analysis is used to quantify and confirm the presence of <b>zearalenone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The hormones {{banned by}} the EU in cattle farming were estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, zeranol, {{melengestrol}} acetate and trenbolone acetate. Of these, the first three are synthetic versions of endogenous hormones that are naturally produced in humans and animals, and also occur {{in a wide range}} of foods, whereas the last two are synthetic and not naturally occurring, which mimic the behaviour of endogenous hormones. Zeranol (alpha-zearalanol) is produced semi-synthetically, but it also occurs naturally in some foods. It is one of several derivatives of <b>zearalenone</b> produced by certain Fusarium. [...] Although its occurrence in animal products can be partly due to its ingestion in such feeds, alpha-zearalanol can also be produced endogenously in ruminants that have ingested <b>zearalenone</b> and some <b>zearalenone</b> derivatives in such feeds. [...] The EU did not impose an absolute ban. Under veterinary supervision, cattle farmers were permitted to administer the synthetic versions of natural hormones for cost-reduction and possibly therapeutic purposes, such as synchronising the oestrus cycles of dairy cows. All six hormones were licensed for use in the US and in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Trichosporon mycotoxinivorans is a yeast species purportedly {{useful in}} the {{detoxification}} of various mycotoxins. It was first isolated from the hidgut of Mastotermes darwiniensis. It {{has been shown to}} detoxify mycotoxins such as ochratoxin A and <b>zearalenone.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, the International Journal of Food Microbiology {{published}} {{a study that}} claimed [...] "mycotoxin contamination in pet food poses a serious health threat to pets", and listed them: aflatoxins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes, <b>zearalenone,</b> fumonisins and fusaric acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zearalenone</b> (ZEN), {{also known}} as RAL and F-2 mycotoxin, is a potent estrogenic {{metabolite}} produced by some Fusarium and Gibberella species. Particularly, is produced by Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium cerealis, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium verticillioides, and Fusarium incarnatum.|$|E
50|$|The NITL is the {{diagnostic}} {{center for the}} rapid detection of mycotoxins and plant, food, and feed pathogens. The laboratory can determine the concentrations of the mycotoxins, aflatoxin B1 and M1, ochratoxin A, <b>zearalenone,</b> fumonisin and red tide toxins to as low as 5 ppb.|$|E
50|$|Some {{naturally}} occurring compounds produced by plants and fungi can carry serious health risks. One potential risk is an increased chance of breast cancer. Some {{of the ingredients}} included in supplements are carcinogenic, including don quai. By altering the body's hormonal levels, certain ingredients, including <b>zearalenone,</b> may reduce fertility.|$|E
50|$|Although zeranol may {{increase}} cancer cell proliferation in already existing breast cancer, dietary exposure {{from the use}} of zeranol-containing implants in cattle is insignificant. Zeranol may be found as a contaminant in fungus-infected crops. It is 3 to 4 times more potent as an estrogen than the related compound <b>zearalenone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some other {{examples}} of putative EDCs are polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) and -furans (PCDFs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenol derivatives {{and a number of}} pesticides (most prominent being organochlorine insecticides like endosulfan, kepone (chlordecone) and DDT and its derivatives, the herbicide atrazine, and the fungicide vinclozolin), the contraceptive 17-alpha ethinylestradiol, as well as naturally occurring phytoestrogens such as genistein and mycoestrogens such as <b>zearalenone.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fusarium toxins are {{produced}} by over 50 species of Fusarium and {{have a history of}} infecting the grain of developing cereals such as wheat and maize. They include a range of mycotoxins, such as: the fumonisins, which affect the nervous systems of horses and may cause cancer in rodents; the trichothecenes, which are most strongly associated with chronic and fatal toxic effects in animals and humans; and <b>zearalenone,</b> which is not correlated to any fatal toxic effects in animals or humans. Some of the other major types of Fusarium toxins include: beauvercin and enniatins, butenolide, equisetin, and fusarins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zearalenone</b> {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} solid. It exhibits blue-green fluorescence when {{excited by}} long wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light (360 nm) and a more intense green fluorescence when excited with short wavelength UV light (260 nm). In methanol, UV absorption maxima occur at 236 (e = 29,700), 274 (e = 13,909) and 316 nm (e = 6,020). Maximum fluorescence in ethanol occurs with irradiation at 314 nm and with emission at 450 nm. Solubility in water is about 0.002 g/100 mL. It is slightly soluble in hexane and progressively more so in benzene, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, methanol, ethanol, and acetone. It is also soluble in aqueous alkali.|$|E
50|$|The {{contributions}} of Rama Rao {{are reported to}} be noteworthy {{in the area of}} organic synthesis, especially asymmetric synthesis. He is known to have developed cheaper methodology for the synthesis of anti-tumour antibiotics such as Anthracyclines, Fredericamycin-A, Cervinomycins A1 and A2, Aronorosin, and Lavendamycin. He evolved a new method for the construction of the spiro2,2-nonane system, a constituent of Fredericamycin A, a first time achievement in the world, and succeeded in its total synthesis. He proposed alternative methodologies for the synthesis of MeBmt, a variety of amino acid present in cyclosporin-A and of FK-506k, a 23-membered macrolide with 14-asymmetric carbons, which are reported to be noteworthy achievements in the field of asymmetric synthesis. His work also covered the synthesis of depsipeptides such as Jaspamide and Geodiamolides and macrolides, namely <b>Zearalenone,</b> Rifamycin-S, Rhizoxin and Rapamycin.|$|E
50|$|Gibberella zeae, {{also known}} {{by the name of}} its anamorph Fusarium graminearum, is a plant {{pathogen}} which causes fusarium head blight, a devastating disease on wheat and barley. The pathogen is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining grain with mycotoxins, mainly deoxynivalenol, which inhibits protein biosynthesis; and <b>zearalenone,</b> an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against F. graminearum, no completely resistant variety is currently available. Research on the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab infection.|$|E
5000|$|Niche {{areas for}} {{application}} of MIPs are in sensors and separation. Despite the current good health of molecular imprinting in general, one difficulty {{which appears to}} remain to this day is the commercialization of molecularly imprinted polymers. Even though no molecularly imprinted silica product has reached the market yet, at least several patents (123 patents, up to 2010, according to Scifinder data base), on molecular imprinting, were held by different groups. That some commercial interest existed is also confirmed {{by the fact that}} MIP Technologies, offers a range of commercially available MIP products and Sigma-Aldrich produces SupelMIP for Beta-agonists, Beta-blockers, pesticides and some drugs of abuse such as Amphetamine and that POLYINTELL designs, manufactures and markets AFFINIMIPSPE products [...] for instance for mycotoxins such as Patulin, <b>Zearalenone,</b> Fumonisins, Ochratoxin A, for endocrine disruptors (Bisphenol A, Estrogens derivatives etc...) or for the purification of radiotracers before their use in Positron emission tomography (PET).|$|E
