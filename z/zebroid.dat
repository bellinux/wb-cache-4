25|$|The {{offspring}} of a zebra-donkey cross {{is called a}} zonkey, <b>zebroid,</b> zebrass, or zedonk; zebra mule is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. Zebra hinny, zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras. There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; {{there is no such}} limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.|$|E
5000|$|James Cossar Ewart FRS FRSE (26 November 1851 [...] - [...] 31 December 1933) was a Scottish zoologist. He {{is mainly}} remembered for his {{cross-breeding}} experiments with zebras, creating <b>zebroid,</b> zedonk, Zorse, zonkey and zebrule as [...] "new species", generally known to his local population as Tartan Cuddies.|$|E
50|$|A <b>zebroid</b> (also zedonk, zorse, zebra mule, zonkey, and zebmule) is the {{offspring}} of any cross between a zebra and any other equine: essentially, a zebra hybrid. In most cases, the sire is a zebra stallion. Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam, called a zebra hinny, or donkra, do exist but are rare. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. Charles Darwin noted several zebra hybrids in his works.|$|E
40|$|On-demand {{delivery}} of {{audio and video}} clips in peer-to-peer vehicular ad-hoc networks is an emerging area of research. Our target environment uses data carriers, termed <b>zebroids,</b> where a mobile device carries a data item {{on behalf of a}} server to a client thereby minimizing its availability latency. In this study, we quantify the variation in availability latency with <b>zebroids</b> as a function of a rich set of parameters such as car density, storage per device, repository size, and replacement policies employed by <b>zebroids.</b> Using analysis and extensive simulations, we gain novel insights into the design of carrier-based systems. Significant improvements in latency can be obtained with <b>zebroids</b> at the cost of a minimal overhead. These improvements occur even in scenarios with lower accuracy in the predictions of the car routes. Two particularly surprising findings are: (1) a naive random replacement policy employed by the <b>zebroids</b> shows competitive performance, and (2) latency improvements obtained with a simplified instantiation of <b>zebroids</b> are found to be robust to changes in the popularity distribution of the data items...|$|R
40|$|On-demand {{delivery}} of {{audio and video}} clips in a vehicular network is a growing area of interest. A given repository of such data items, each with an associated popularity, may {{be available to the}} passengers of the vehicles. The vehicles themselves are equipped with a 'TiVO' like device that has several gigabytes of storage and a wireless interface allowing short range communication at 10 s to 100 s of Megabits per second. The goal is to minimize the latency between request issuance and the time till a copy of the requested item is encountered. This latency is termed the availability latency. This thesis explores two generic tools to alleviate availability latency: (a) data replication (b) data delivery scheduling. With the replication study, we propose a general optimization formulation that seeks to minimize average availability latency subject to a storage constraint per vehicle. We explore the effects of a family of popularity-based replication schemes on availability latency. When the vehicles follow a 2 D random walk based mobility model, via analysis and extensive simulations, we determine the optimal replication scheme that minimizes latency across a wide parameter space with major dimensions being data item size and client trip duration. Once an appropriate static replication scheme has allocated replicas, the vehicles themselves may be employed as data carriers to further improve availability latency. These data carriers are termed <b>zebroids.</b> However, a <b>zebroid's</b> local storage may be completely exhausted. Hence, to accommodate this new data item, it may need to evict an existing one. Various replacement policies such as LFU, LRU, random etc. are examined and their relative performance is studied. Via analysis and extensive simulations we study the behavior of <b>zebroids</b> as a function of large parameter space comprising data item repository size, storage per vehicle, number of vehicles, popularity distribution of the data items, different replacement schemes for <b>zebroids</b> etc. We validate the Markov model based observations with two independent validation phases employing (a) freeway traffic information on a city map (b) real world traces from a small bus network...|$|R
50|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to train zebras for riding, since they have better {{resistance}} than horses to African diseases. Most of these attempts failed, as would have initial attempts to tame wild horses, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or <b>zebroids</b> (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over purebred zebras.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zebroid</b> is {{the term}} {{generally}} used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a portmanteau of the 's name and the 's name. There is generally no distinction made as to which zebra species is used. Many times when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of dwarfism. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring phenotype.|$|E
50|$|Although zebra {{species may}} have {{overlapping}} ranges, {{they do not}} interbreed. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévys zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in {{a high rate of}} miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the <b>zebroid,</b> zeedonk, zony, and zorse. In certain regions of Kenya, plains zebras and Grévys zebra coexist, and fertile hybrids occur.|$|E
50|$|Zebroids are {{preferred}} over zebra {{for practical}} uses, such as riding, because the zebra {{has a different}} body shape from a horse or donkey, and consequently {{it is difficult to}} find tack to fit a zebra. However, a <b>zebroid</b> is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a purebred horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring. Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.|$|E
50|$|Donkeys {{and wild}} equids have {{different}} numbers of chromosomes. A donkey has 62 chromosomes; the zebra has between 32 and 46 (depending on species). In {{spite of this}} difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid {{has a number of}} chromosomes somewhere in between. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile due to a phenomenon called Haldane's Rule. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes. Horses have 64 chromosomes, while most <b>zebroids</b> end up with 54 chromosomes.|$|R
50|$|The Natural History Museum at Tring {{was once}} the private museum of Lionel Walter, 2nd Baron Rothschild, and {{is located in the}} grounds of the former Rothschild family home of Tring Park. The {{building}} was constructed in 1889 to house his collection of mounted specimens and first opened to the public in 1892. The Rothschild family gave the Museum and its contents to the nation in 1937. Lionel Walter bred hybrids between zebras and horses (<b>zebroids)</b> and a hybrid foal is on display. He was frequently seen riding a zebra-drawn carriage. The museum's Zebra Cafe alludes to Lord Rothschild's love of zebras and has photographs of his trained zebras harnessed to open carriages.|$|R
50|$|The {{offspring}} of a zebra-donkey cross {{is called a}} zonkey, <b>zebroid,</b> zebrass, or zedonk; zebra mule is an older term, but still used in some regions today. The foregoing terms generally refer to hybrids produced by breeding a male zebra to a female donkey. Zebra hinny, zebret and zebrinny all refer to the cross of a female zebra with a male donkey. Zebrinnies are rarer than zedonkies because female zebras in captivity are most valuable when used to produce full-blooded zebras. There are not enough female zebras breeding in captivity to spare them for hybridizing; {{there is no such}} limitation on the number of female donkeys breeding.|$|E
5000|$|Horses can crossbreed {{with other}} equine species to produce hybrids. These hybrid types are not breeds, but they {{resemble}} breeds in that crosses between certain horse breeds and other equine species produce characteristic offspring. The most common hybrid is the mule, {{a cross between}} a [...] "jack" [...] (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, the hinny, is {{a cross between a}} stallion and a jenny (female donkey). Most other hybrids involve the zebra (see <b>Zebroid).</b> With rare exceptions, most equine hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. [...] A notable exception is hybrid crosses between horses and Equus ferus przewalskii, commonly known as Przewalski's horse.|$|E
50|$|Zorses {{combine the}} zebra {{striping}} overlaid on colored {{areas of the}} hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. It is understood that tobiano (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect {{is seen in the}} <b>zebroid</b> named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.|$|E
5000|$|Zebroids {{physically}} resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes {{generally do}} not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto {{parts of the body}} or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a roan, Appaloosa, Pinto horse/paint, piebald, or skewbald), this pattern might be passed down to the <b>zebroid,</b> in which case the stripes are usually confined to nonwhite areas. The alternative name [...] "golden zebra" [...] relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the quagga. In zebra-donkey hybrids, there is usually a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.|$|E
5000|$|In 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga {{stallion}} to a chestnut Arabian mare. The {{result was}} a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882-1927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of telegony, or paternal impression. In Origin of Species (1859), Charles Darwin mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote [...] "In Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga." [...] In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a [...] "triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra" [...] displayed at London Zoo. This would have required the <b>zebroid</b> sire to be fertile.|$|E
50|$|Today, various zebroids are bred as {{riding and}} draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos. Zorses are bred in Africa {{and used for}} {{trekking}} on Mount Kenya; the zebra parent gives resistance to the nagana pest disease. A zorse (more accurately a zony) was born at Eden Ostrich World, Cumbria, England, in 2001 after a zebra was left in a field with a Shetland pony. It {{was referred to as}} a Zetland. Usually, a zebra stallion is paired with a horse mare or donkey mare, but in 2005, a Burchell's zebra named Allison produced a zonkey called Alex sired by a donkey at Highland plantation in the parish of Saint Thomas, Barbados. Alex, born 21 April 2005, is apparently the first zonkey in Barbados. In 2007, a stallion, Ulysses, and a zebra mare, Eclipse, produced a <b>zebroid</b> named Eclyse, displaying an unusually patchy color coating. The Wild Animal Safari in Springfield, Missouri, and its sister location in Pine Mountain, Georgia, have several zedonks as of 31 March 2010. In July 2010, a zedonk was born at the Chestatee Wildlife Preserve in Dahlonega, Georgia. Another zebra-donkey hybrid, like the Barbados zonkey sired by a donkey, was born 3 July 2011 in Haicang Safari Park, Haicang, Xiamen, China. A zonkey, Ippo, was born 21 July 2013 in an animal reserve, in Florence, Italy. Khumba, the offspring of a zebra dam and a dwarf albino donkey sire, was born on 21 April 2014 in the zoo of Reynosa in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E
40|$|In an ad-hoc {{network of}} mobile devices, a device is termed a <b>zebroid</b> when it carries a data item {{residing}} on a server-device to a client-device referencing that item. The system employs a <b>zebroid</b> when its travel path intersects {{that of the}} server and the client and this information is known in advance. The motivation for use of a <b>zebroid</b> is to minimize the delay incurred by the client for the referenced data item, termed the availability latency. This paper considers the performance of alternative policies that manage the identity of data items assigned to a <b>zebroid</b> when its storage is exhausted. One novel policy is LoDeR that manages storage of zebroids based on the demographics of a geographical region where the <b>zebroid</b> rendezvous with the client. Experimental results demonstrate a host of tradeoffs between the different performance metrics such {{as the number of}} data items lost by a policy and the percentage of requests that reference these data items, availability latency, and number of replaced data items. The mobility model has a significant impact on these metrics for a given policy...|$|E
40|$|Zebroids are mobile {{devices that}} carry a {{referenced}} data item from a server containing that data item to a client that requested it. An environment employs zebroids {{in order to}} minimize the availability latency incurred by the client. A device acts as a <b>zebroid</b> when it is in close vicinity of a server and travels along a path that rendezvous with the client. Over time, the storage capacity of the <b>zebroid</b> might become occupied with data items. To carry the requested data item, it must evict one or more of its existing data items. The primary contribution {{of this study is to}} quantify the latency-overhead tradeoff associated with alternative replacement policies that might be employed by a <b>zebroid.</b> We employ a simulation study to quantify the tradeoffs associated with policies such as Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), and a simple random policy. Obtained results highlight the parameter space where the use of zebroids provides superior performance when compared with a static data placement strategy that does not use zebroids. We verify this and the other observed trends using a simple analytical approximation of latency for a 2 D random walk mobility model. 1...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{expression}} of keratin (K) 13 and K 19 in cutaneous warts of renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and immunocompetent individuals (ICIs). DESIGN: Retrospective, nonrandomized immunohistochemical study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Specimens from cutaneous warts of RTRs and ICIs were retrieved from {{the archives of the}} Department of Pathology, University Medical Center St Radboud, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Twenty-one warts from RTRs and 21 from ICIs were examined. Nine RTRs (10 specimens) received either systemic acitretin or topical all-trans retinoic acid, and their effect on both keratins was assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and expression patterns of K 13 and K 19 in warts of RTRs vs ICIs and the effect of retinoids. RESULTS: A significantly higher percentage of warts of RTRs expressed K 13 compared with warts of ICIs (86 % vs 14 %, 18 vs 3 cases, respectively; P<. 001). In warts of RTRs, retinoid treatment correlated significantly with a particularly strong, segmental K 13 expression pattern, which we termed <b>zebroid.</b> Without use of retinoids, K 13 was mostly restricted to suprabasal single cells. Keratin 19 was absent in all warts of both patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Retinoids strongly correlate with K 13 in a characteristic <b>zebroid</b> pattern in warts of RTRs, making K 13 a sensitive marker for retinoid bioactivity in skin (lesions) of RTRs. In non-retinoid-treated RTRs, K 13 is also frequently found in warts but without the dramatic <b>zebroid</b> pattern noted in retinoid-treated warts...|$|E
