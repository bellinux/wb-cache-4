The effects of carbon vacancies on structural and mechanical properties are investigated. We highlight that the distribution of carbon vacancies has significant influence on volume, Pugh's ratio, and hardness.

40|$|Cubic {{carbides}} (titanium, tantalum, niobium, and <b>zirconium</b> <b>carbides)</b> can {{constitute a}} significant proportion of so-called cubic and cermet grades, where it is added to substitute a portion of tungsten carbide. It is thus critical to understand and be able to thermodynamically model the cubic carbide systems. In order to do this, the thermodynamic descriptions of lower order systems, such as the Ti-Cr-C system, need to be well studied. To approach this goal, an extensive literature survey of thermodynamic data and phase diagram information on the Ti-Cr-C system, the Ta-Cr-C system, the Nb-Cr-C system and the Zr-Cr-C is presented in this work. Experiments are performed in the Ti-Cr-C system using powder metallurgy and heat treatments. The solubility of Cr in FCC_TiC phase was experimentally measured at 1773 K and compared with previous studies showing that the solubility reported earlier is too large. Thereafter, a re-optimization of FCC_TiC and liquid interaction parameters of the Ti-Cr-C system was performed taking into account the experimental data obtained both from previous studies and this work.

40|$|Owing {{to their}} {{attractive}} properties {{such as high}} melting point, high thermal and electrical conductivity, high stiffness and hardness, the carbides of the IV group of transition metals are potential candidate materials for ultra-high temperature applications. Despite their good properties in aggressive environment, the use of monolithic materials is limited due to their poor sinterability. Recently, MoSi 2 has been disclosed as an efficace sintering aid for sintering of hafnium and <b>zirconium</b> <b>carbides,</b> as it allows the densification of high density materials at ambient pressure and at temperatures below 2000 ?C. In {{order to understand the}} governing mechanisms during sintering, the microstructure of dense HfC and ZrC composites containing 20 vol% of MoSi 2 was analyzed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In the HfC+MoSi 2 system, besides the starting constituent compounds, a mixed phase was detected and identified as (Mo 0, 5 Hf 0, 5) 5 Si 3. The formation of this intermediate phase indicates the possibility of mutual solubility between the starting compounds. With regard to the ZrC-MoSi 2 system, several ZrxSiy compounds and SiC were detected. For both the systems investigated, the high wettability of the silicide based phases (Mo-Si, Zr-Si, Hf-Si) on the matrix grains (HfC, ZrC) suggests that sintering is aided by a liquid-silicide phase, acting as a medium for matter transport via diffusion between neighbouring grains. The formation and evolution of intermediate phases and the densification mechanisms are discussed in the light of phase diagrams and thermodynamical calculation...|$|R

A pulsed KrF excimer laser was used for surface treatment, with the aim of tailoring the surface roughness of conventional ceramics such as Alumina, Silicon carbide.

40|$|International audienceZirconium carbide (ZrC) is a {{refractory}} ceramic presenting interesting properties {{such as a}} high melting point, a very high hardness and a good thermal stability. For these reasons, this material is considered {{as a candidate for}} fuel coating for fourth-generation reactors in particular for the Gas cooled Fast Reactors (GFR). The ceramic temperature could reach 1200 °C in normal reactor operation and reach 1700 °C in accidental conditions. It is therefore important to assess the ZrC thermal retention capacity regarding abundant and/or volatile fission products. This paper deals with the behavior of Xenon which is the major gaseous fission product created during fission. Previous studies have shown that Xenon remained motionless in an "Oxygen-poor" matrix such as ZrC 0. 95 O 0. 05, up to temperatures of 1800 °C. However, Zirconium oxycarbides are known to be very sensitive to oxidation. This study aims therefore at studying the behavior of Xenon in Zirconium oxycarbide samples with different Oxygen contents. Xenon is introduced by ion implantation and the samples are annealed in secondary vacuum in the temperature range 1400 °C- 1800 °C. The Oxygen profiles are determined by using the 16 O(4 He, 4 He) 16 O nuclear reaction at 7. 5 MeV and the concentration profiles of Xenon are measured by Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry at each step of the treatment. The results show that the behavior of the material during annealing with respect to oxidation is strongly related to its initial Oxygen content. More generally, the higher the initial Oxygen content, the more important is the oxidation. Consequently, the Xenon migration is enhanced in Oxygen rich <b>Zirconium</b> <b>carbides...</b>|$|R
