50|$|<b>Zabbix</b> {{started as}} an {{internal}} software project in 1998. After three years, in 2001, {{it was released}} to the public under GPL. It took three more years until the first stable version, 1.0, was released in 2004.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zabbix</b> version {{numbering}} scheme has changed. While {{the first two}} stable branches were 1.0 and 1.1, after 1.1 {{it was decided to}} use odd numbers for development versions and even numbers for stable versions.

50|$|BigPanda's {{product is}} {{software}} {{as a service}} for IT incident management that monitors, analyzes, and correlates machine alerts to create high-level IT incidents. It integrates with monitoring tools, including traditional monitoring systems from Hewlett Packard and IBM along with others like New Relic, AppDynamics, Splunk, Nagios or <b>Zabbix.</b> The platform also integrates with several deployment and configuration management tools like Chef, Ansible, Puppet, and others.|$|E
50|$|Octopussy is {{compatible}} {{with a lot of}} GNU/Linux system distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, CentOS, RHEL and even meta-distributions as Gentoo or Arch Linux. Although Octopussy was originally designed to run under GNU/Linux, it could be ported to other Unix variants like FreeBSD with minimal effort. Octopussy has extensive report generating features and also various interfaces to other software, like e.g. NSCA (Nagios), Jabber/XMPP and <b>Zabbix.</b> With the help of software like Snare even Windows EventLogs can be processed.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{software}} {{monitoring systems}} and network management software market offers such products as Nagios, <b>Zabbix,</b> HP BTO. All these solutions provide UI for system administrators, support for management protocols (like SNMP or JMX), alerting and configuration subsystem. The main approach of SNAMP is to extend functionality of existing monitoring tools used in enterprise. For example, {{the need to}} monitor Java-based software using [...] System Center Operations Manager 2003 cannot be satisfied directly (because SCOM doesn't support JMX natively), but it is easily solved by SNAMP via configuring JMX-to-SNMP transformation.|$|E
50|$|The 8th {{edition of}} the conference was held on 23 April 2015 in the Marriott Warsaw.

The agenda covered 17 keynotes and lectures as well as a discussion panel.Key topics of this edition were: Cloud, IT Infrastructure and IT Security.|$|E
30|$|The <b>Zabbix</b> 10 {{monitoring}} system is employed {{in order to}} support alerting system administrators. <b>Zabbix</b> is a network {{monitoring system}} with support to triggered notifications. SADF creates a list of alerts, which is used as the basis for populating a monitoring template configured into <b>Zabbix.</b> This template includes information about the affected host, its service, and the discovered vulnerability, with its respective CVSS. Through the template, <b>Zabbix</b> can detect the alerts sent by SADF, creating triggers for each alert into <b>Zabbix</b> monitoring screen that should be permanently exhibited on the Network Operation Center. We have employed <b>Zabbix</b> on SADF because this is the monitoring solution used by the network administration team of where SADF is being deployed.|$|E

The thesis also describes the fundamentals of how <b>Zabbix</b> works, especially in large enviroments. In {{the second part of the}} thesis we compare existing optimizations of the database structure which divides large, parent tables into small partitions. The most suitable solution is chosen which is then modified for the BUT network needs. Using this optimization we achieved a decrease of the processor utilization on the <b>Zabbix</b> server and a significant decrease in the growth of data on its hard drive...|$|E

40|$|Control centres of {{telephony}} {{operators and}} other smaller companies that route telephone traffic {{have a system}} of regularly monitoring calls in real time. Dedicating {{a lot of attention}} to the quality of service, mostly monitoring and controlling quality of larger patterns of calls going to different destinations. The aim of the thesis was to implement improvements in the field of controlling quality of VoIP telephony, enabling visual representations of formal quality indicators of calls such as ASR, NER, ACD. Research was made of the existing tools on the market at the moment and summarized the requirements of the system. The thesis presents a solution of implementing ELK stack for editing data, making statistical analysis and visualization of quality indicators of calls. While evaluating this solution an upgrade is suggested for using <b>Zabbix</b> output of data filtered in Logstash to send them directly to <b>Zabbix</b> server. Findings are given resulting from pre-established system requirements...|$|E
30|$|Health {{monitoring}} {{often requires}} {{the writing of}} bespoke software and frequently relies on plugin and extension mechanisms exposed by monitoring tools. Nagios, <b>Zabbix</b> and Icinga all cater to this use case. Network monitoring is a wide use case which includes the monitoring of network performance, network devices and network services. This use case overlaps with health monitoring but focuses more upon network conditions opposed to simply the services available on that network. This often includes DoS detection, routing health detection, network partition detection and so forth. Tools which cater to network monitoring include Cacti, mrtg and ntop.|$|E
30|$|Cacti [61], GroundWork [62], Munin [63], OpenNMS [64], Spiceworks [65], and <b>Zabbix</b> [66] are all {{enterprise}} monitoring {{solutions that}} have seen extensive use in conventional server monitoring which now see some usage in cloud monitoring. These systems have similar functionality and utilise a similar set of backend tools including RRDTool, MySQL and PostgreSQL. These systems, like several {{discussed in this}} section, were designed for monitoring fixed server deployments and lack the supports for elasticity and scalability that more cloud-specific tools offer. The use of these tools in the cloud domain is unlikely to continue as alternative, better suited tools become increasingly available.|$|E
