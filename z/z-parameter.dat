40|$|Abstract – In the {{analysis}} of magnetic circuits, reluctances are commonly modeled as resistances and magnetomotive forces modeled as electromotive forces. In this way the magnetic flux and flux density can be determined easily. However, a close examination should reveal that it is fundamentally wrong to use a resistance, which is a lossy component, to model reluctance, which is a lossless component. This confusion may result in serious problems in {{the analysis}} and computer simulation of mixed electric and magnetic circuits. The gyrator approach of modeling can resolve the problem. However, due to the unwillingness of electrical engineers to accept the term gyrator, {{it has never been}} widely used. In this paper we propose to revitalize the gyrator model and to further develop it into a <b>z-parameter</b> model. Since z-parameters are well-defined parameters of the 2 -port networks, engineers/students in the electrical engineering discipline should find the <b>z-parameter</b> model much easier to understand and to manipulate. In addition, we also propose some strategies to introduce the <b>z-parameter</b> model of magnetic circuits into the curriculum of electrical engineering courses...|$|E

40|$|Grain size determines to a {{large degree}} the {{mechanical}} properties of the friction stir processed (FSP) material. Developed in this work is a numerical (FEM) based-model for predicting values of the Zener-Hollomon parameter (<b>Z-parameter)</b> as function of input process parameters during friction stir processing of AZ 31 B. Prediction of Z values is desirable given that direct relations exist between the <b>Z-parameter</b> and the average grain size in the dynamically recrystallized zone (DRX). For this purpose, utilized in this work is a robust finite element model with a suitable constitutive equation and boundary conditions the results of which have been previously validated against published experimental data. A virtual test matrix constituting of 16 cases (4 spindle speed, N, x 4 feed, f) was run. Based on resulting state variables of strain rates and temperatures at a representative point within the stir zone, a statistically-validated power equation model was developed that relates <b>Z-parameter</b> values to input parameters of speed and feed. The results of the numerically developed power equation were validated against experimental results. This model can be readily used in future control frameworks to FSP produce AZ 31 B sheets of a predefined target grain size. N/...|$|E
