5|$|Zinc oxide {{itself is}} non-toxic; {{however it is}} {{hazardous}} to inhale zinc oxide fumes, as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature. This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass {{is close to the}} boiling point of zinc. Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (<b>zinc</b> <b>plated)</b> <b>steel,</b> can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E

The chromate coating acts as paint does, protecting the zinc from white corrosion, thus making the part considerably more durable, depending on the chromate layer's thickness. Steel and iron cannot be chromated directly. Chromating <b>zinc</b> <b>plated</b> <b>steel</b> does not enhance zinc's cathodic protection of the underlying steel from rust.|$|E
50|$|Many valves have {{a spring}} for spring-loading, to {{normally}} shift the disc into some position by default but allow control to reposition the disc. Relief valves commonly use a spring {{to keep the}} valve shut, but allow excessive pressure to force the valve open against the spring-loading. Coil springs are normally used.

40|$|Five {{corrosion}} protective painls, {{including three}} used as on-rust ones, were tested for their anticorrosive effects at the outdoor exposure test yard of University of the Ryukyus, beginning on September 1, 1988. First, clean JIS SS 41 mild <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> of 15 x 15 cm x 3. 2 mm each were exposed outdoor for 3 months,then they were removed {{of the resulting}} rust {{by means of a}} wire brush to retain slight rust. These specimens together with new plate specimens which were cleaned by grit blasting to retain no rust, were coated with the same protective paints. In addition, three kinds of uncoated steel sheets (JIS SS 41 mild steel, JIS SPCD cold rolled carbon steel and JIS SPA - H weathering steel), and two kinds of <b>zinc</b> coated <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> (JIS SGCC hot dip zinc coated steel and zinc hot dip galvanized mild steel) were used as the specimens to obtain the atmospheric corrosion data. The results obtained by this outdoor exposure test are as follows. 1) After 6 month exposure, the three kinds of uncoated steel sheets showed equal corrosion rates of about 10 mg/dm^ 2 /day. Their corroded conditions were also equal to each other. The two kinds of <b>zinc</b> coated <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> were increased in weight slightly due to oxidation of zinc. 2) Both the specimens coated with protective paints on their surfaces with slight rust and with no rust, respectively, showed no fault and no difference in their appearance. All paints coated on the surfaces with no rust showed good adhesive strength, and onc on-rust paints showed poor adhesive strength. 3) The results of cross cut test were nearly the same as those of pull off test, except when the overcoatability between the undercoat and the top coat was poor. 4) The impact strength of the coated paints in the initial stage was poorer than that after exposure.
