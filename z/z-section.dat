The stress bearing skin was riveted to spars and ribs. Owing to its future use as a dive-bomber, stressed skin construction was employed with the use of <b>Z-section</b> frames and stringers. Slotted ailerons were fitted to the outer wing sections. The inner split flaps were electrically operated and had a maximum flap angle of 55Â°. The ailerons were linked to the flap system to permit partial operation as flaperons, meaning if the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped down.The design of the rear and front spar attachments revealed the flanges of the spar were flushed with the wing surface making the most efficient structure. The outer wing leading edges were double-skinned. In the wing space, a hot air feed was fitted, using heat pumped through lagged pipes from the engines to warm up and de-ice the wings. The ducts were located just forward of the front spar flanges and in between the main spars where they could escape into the wing. The hot air could escape through the apertures at the aileron hinges. A diversion pipe was also installed in the engine nacelle, which could shut down the hot air flow to the ducts and divert the air out through bottom end of the nacelle if de-icing was not required.The fuel and oil tanks were located in the wing and centre section. The two outer fuel tanks were located next to the outer side of the engine nacelle. The outermost fuel tank contained a 160 L fuel capacity, while the tank closest to the engine could accommodate 44 imp gal of oil. Both were sandwiched in between the main and rear main spar. Between the fuselage and inner side of the engine nacelle, the 795 L main tanks were located. In the centre section a 1050 L fuel tank was installed forward of the bomb bay.|$|E

40|$|New, {{optimised}} section shapes {{are being}} developed and implemented by industry for portal frames of cold-formed steel profiles. These should meet the perpetual need for larger column heights and spans. For such structures, the most practical solution for longer column/girder members under larger loads remains the double section. Fabricated from two standard Z, C or Î£ shapes, it has bolted interconnections discretely along the length. The actual strength and stiffness characteristics of such sections are not predicted by design codes and, in practice, conservative assumptions are made. The European standard EN 1993 - 1 - 3 does not suggest how profile interaction could be implemented in design. A built-up member, made from two non-symmetrical <b>Z-sections,</b> was tested so that the actual strength and stiffness characteristics can be obtained. 12 tests were performed in weak axis bending. The spacing between interconnections was varied, so that its effect can also be studied.

30|$|A {{noticeable}} {{difference was}} observed {{between the two}} microfibre scaffolds 18 % and 16 %. The viability and growth of cells were significantly higher in 16 % scaffolds than in all other scaffolds before 10 Â days of culture. After that, there was no remarkably higher cell growth and the cell viability decreased in this scaffold after 14 Â days. In comparison to that, cell viability was significantly higher in 18 % fibre networks after 10 Â days of culture. The characteristics of scaffolds (TableÂ  2) show that 16 % possessed the largest mesh size (sizes from 20 to 100 Â Î¼m); followed by the mesh size of 18 % nanofibre (sizes from 20 to 50 Â Î¼m). <b>Z-sections</b> of confocal images revealed that the depth of cell growth inside scaffolds {{was consistent with the}} order of mesh size. Cells were growing deepest in 16 % followed by 18 % scaffolds. Indeed, MG 63 cells in 18 % were well-distributed in the 3 D structure of the scaffold (FigureÂ  5). The different behaviour of cells in the two micro-fibre scaffolds is probably due to the different pore structure of the scaffolds. Boudriot et al. suggested that the lack or at least reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients in the core of scaffolds diminishes metabolic activity of cells (Boudriot et al. 2006). In this study, the most porous scaffold 16 % allowed adhesion of MG 63 cells on the bottom area of the scaffolds, where they proliferated initially quite well. However, an increasing number of cells inside the scaffold increases the oxygen consumption and leads probably to hypoxic conditions after 10 Â days. By contrast, the well-distributed cells in 3 D structure and the free space remained inside 18 %PCL scaffolds provide better oxygen supply to the cells. This is also reflected by the reduced metabolic activity of cells in 16 % scaffolds measured by QBlue assays, while cell quantities measured by the modified LDH assay were not different.|$|R
40|$|T-cadherin is {{a unique}} member of the cadherin {{superfamily}} that shares the ectodomain organization with classical cadherins, but lacks both transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions and is instead anchored to the plasma membrane through a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. The function of T-cadherin has not been revealed yet. The special structure of T-cadherin might endow this molecule with specific intracellular targeting properties and functions that are distinct from classical cadherins. T-cadherin was originally cloned from chicken embryo brain and then was also found in mouse and human nervous and cardiovascular systems; however, T-cadherin in the keratinocytes and skin tissue is still an unknown area {{that remains to be}} explored. To test whether the unusual truncated T-cadherin is expressed in keratinocytes, we performed the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of T-cadherin, as well as several classical cadherins (E-, P-, and N-cadherin), on the mouse keratinocyte cell line Pam 212, fibroblast NIH 3 T 3, and melanoma cell B 16. The result indicated that mouse keratinocytes expressed the mRNA of truncated T-cadherin apart from classical cadherins, E-, and P-cadherin. To confirm the expression of T-cadherin in mouse keratinocytes, immunocytochemistry staining was carried out on Pam 212 cells by using rabbit anti-T-cadherin antibody and rat antimouse E- and P-cadherin antibody. The result of immunofluorescence staining proved that T-cadherin was expressed in mouse keratinocytes. In order to analyze the distribution patterns of T-cadherin and classical cadherins on the keratinocytes, 3 D scanning was performed by using a confocal microscope. From the <b>Z-sections</b> and XZ-sections, it was clearly demonstrated that T-cadherin was distributed diffusely on the whole cell surface, while E- and P-cadherin were concentrated on the cellâcell contacts. To examine the expression and the localization of T-cadherin on skin tissue, the frozen sections of the mouse back skin were immunohistochemically labeled by using anti-T-cadherin antibody. It was found that T-cadherin was intensively expressed only on the basal cell layer of the mouse skin. Apart from mouse keratinocytes and mouse skin, we further examined the expression of T-cadherin in human keratinocytes and human skin by western blot, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry staining. The same results were achieved with human samples. In this study, we found and verified that T-cadherin was expressed on the mouse and human keratinocytes and specifically localized on the basal cell layer of skin. The nature of T-cadherin function and its mechanism of localization at the basal cell layer of skin are important issues to be addressed concerning this unique member of the cadherin family and its physiologic and pathologic roles in the skin...|$|R

40|$|The use of cold-formed steel {{structures}} is increasing rapidly {{around the world}} due to the many advances in construction and manufacturing technologies and relevant standards. However, the structural behaviour of these thin-walled {{steel structures}} is characterised by a range of buckling modes such as local buckling, distortional buckling or flexural torsional buckling. These buckling problems generally lead to severe reduction and complicated calculations of their member strengths. Therefore {{it is important to}} eliminate or delay these buckling problems and simplify the strength calculations of cold-formed steel members. The Hollow Flange Beam with two triangular hollow flanges, developed by Palmer Tube Mills Pty Ltd in the mid- 1990 s, has an innovative section that can delay the above buckling problems efficiently. This structural member is considered to combine the advantages of hot-rolled I-sections and conventional cold-formed sections such as C- and <b>Z-sections</b> (Dempsey, 1990). However, this structural product was discontinued in 1997 due to the complicated manufacturing process and the expensive electric resistance welding method associated with severe residual stresses (Doan and Mahendran, 1996). In this thesis, new fastening methods using spot-weld, screw fastener and self-pierced rivet were considered for the triangular Hollow Flange Beams (HFBs) and the new rectangular hollow flange beams (RHFBs). The structural behaviour of these types of members in axial compression was focused in this research project. The objective of this research was to develop suitable design models for the members with triangular and rectangular hollow flanges using new fastening methods so that their behaviour and ultimate strength can be predicted accurately under axial compression. In the first stage of this research a large number of finite element analyses (FEA) was conducted to study the behaviour of the electric resistance welded, triangular HFBs (ERW-HFBs) under axial compression. Experimental results from previous researchers were used to verify the finite element model and its results. Appropriate design rules based on the current design codes were recommended. Further, a series of finite element models was developed to simulate the corresponding HFBs fastened using lap-welds (called LW-HFBs) and screw fasteners or spot-welds or self-piercing rivets (called S-HFBs). Since the test specimens of LW-HFBs and S-HFBs were unavailable, the finite element results were verified by comparison with the experimental results of ERW-HFB with reasonable agreement. In the second stage of this research, a total of 51 members with rectangular hollow flanges including the RHFBs made from a single plate and 3 PRHFBs made from three plates fastened with spot-welds and screws was tested under axial compression. The finite element models based on the tests were then developed that included the new fasteners, contact simulations, geometric imperfections and residual stresses. The improved finite element models were able to simulate local buckling, yielding, global buckling and local/global buckling interaction failure associated with gap opening as agreed well with the corresponding full-scale experimental results. Extensive parametric studies for the RHFBs made from a single plate and the 3 PRHFBs made from three plates were undertaken using finite element analyses. The analytical results were compared with the predictions using the current design rules based on AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and the new direct strength method. Appropriate design formulae based on the direct strength method for RHFBs and 3 PRHFBs were developed. This thesis has thus enabled the accurate prediction of the behaviour and strength of the new compression members with hollow flanges and paved the way for economical and efficient use of these members in the industry...|$|R
40|$|In normal haemostasis, key receptors {{on human}} blood platelets, {{glycoprotein}} (GP) IbÎ± of the GPIb-IX-V complex that binds von Willebrand factor (VWF) and GPVI that binds collagen, initiate rapid platelet activation and secretion of agonists such as ADP, leading to {{activation of the}} platelet integrin Î±IIbÎ² 3 (GPIIb-IIIa) that mediates platelet aggregation (thrombus formation). The haemostatic response is critical for blood loss following injury, however defects in this process can increase bleeding risk, or lead to thrombotic disease such as myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. It is currently poorly understood how changes in expression levels of these platelet-specific receptors, GPIbÎ± and GPVI, on human platelets control platelet function and/or are related to bleeding/thrombotic risk in disease. The overall aim of studies described in this thesis is to develop reliable quantitative methods for analysing human platelet receptor expression and function in platelet-rich plasma or whole blood. Importantly, these flow cytometry-based methods use relatively small volumes of blood {{and can be used}} for analysis both in clinical samples at normal to low platelet count or normal to high platelet size, and in experimental systems including microfluidic analysis of thrombus formation using confocal imaging. The specific aims are (i) to analysis surface expression of platelet GPIbÎ±, GPVI, Î±IIb (of the integrin Î±IIbÎ² 3) and a tetraspanin CD 9 (control) using phycoerythrin (PE) -conjugated mouse monoclonal antibodies in platelet-rich plasma from healthy donors with normal platelet size; (ii) to establish a new 2 -colour flow cytometry-based assays for analysis of platelet GPIbÎ±/GPVI expression in platelet-rich plasma and in whole blood from individuals with abnormally large platelets (macrothrombocytopenia), using PE-conjugated antibodies against GPIbÎ± and GPVI together with an Alexa 488 -conjugated anti-Î±IIbÎ² 3 antibody (Abciximab) to overcome the difficulty of identifying oversized platelets in whole blood; and (iii) to evaluate the functional consequences of different expression levels of platelet GPIbÎ± and GPVI on the rate and extent of thrombus formation on a collagen-coated surface under flow conditions using whole blood anticoagulated with the thrombin inhibitor, hirudin. The major results include establishing the normal range of expression levels of GPIbÎ±, GPVI, Î±IIbÎ² 3 and CD 9 in > 100 healthy donors. The 2 -colour assay was validated using platelet-rich plasma and whole blood from healthy donors, and in a small number of whole blood samples with macrothrombocytopenia, demonstrating significantly lower GPIbÎ± expression in 5 individuals with the rare inherited defect of GPIb-IX, Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). Finally, the consequences of altered surface expression of platelet receptors was analysed by flowing blood at arterial shear rates over a collagen-coated surface ex vivo, where platelet adhesion is dependent on the GPIbÎ±-VWF interaction. Analysis of healthy donors (n = 22) showed a significant correlation between surface expression levels of GPIbÎ± and thrombus surface coverage and volume on a capillary coated with collagen type I at an input shear rate of 1800 s- 1 under steady flow conditions, whereas a correlation of both GPIbÎ± and GPVI and thrombus volume was observed at the same input shear rate (1800 s- 1) but under pulsatile flow conditions (n = 8). For this analysis, thrombi of platelets stained with the membrane dye, DiOC 6, were analysed over 3 - 15 min using confocal imaging of 0. 5 -micron <b>z-sections</b> under conditions of steady or pulsatile flow. Together, these studies are significant because they provide an approach for profiling receptor expression on human platelets in small samples of blood, including at low platelet count or where analysis may be complicated by increased platelet size, and relating changes in expression of these receptors to platelet thrombus formation under flow conditions. In future, these studies can increase understanding of potential anti-platelet targets to attenuate shear-dependent thrombosis, and provide new diagnostic approaches to evaluate bleeding or thrombotic risk and use of antiplatelet agents in individuals.

40|$|Until recently, the {{hot-rolled}} steel {{members have}} been recognized as {{the most popular and}} widely used steel group, but in recent times, the use of cold-formed high strength steel members has rapidly increased. However, the structural behavior of light gauge high strength cold-formed steel members characterized by various buckling modes is not yet fully understood. The current cold-formed steel sections such as C- and <b>Z-sections</b> are commonly used because of their simple forming procedures and easy connections, but they suffer from certain buckling modes. It is therefore important that these buckling modes are either delayed or eliminated to increase the ultimate capacity of these members. This research is therefore aimed at developing a new cold-formed steel beam with two torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a slender web formed using intermittent screw fastening to enhance the flexural capacity while maintaining a minimum fabrication cost. This thesis describes a detailed investigation into the structural behavior of this new Rectangular Hollow Flange Beam (RHFB), subjected to flexural action The first phase of this research included experimental investigations using thirty full scale lateral buckling tests and twenty two section moment capacity tests using specially designed test rigs to simulate the required loading and support conditions. A detailed description of the experimental methods, RHFB failure modes including local, lateral distortional and lateral torsional buckling modes, and moment capacity results is presented. A comparison of experimental results with the predictions from the current design rules and other design methods is also given. The second phase of this research involved a methodical and comprehensive investigation aimed at widening the scope of finite element analysis to investigate the buckling and ultimate failure behaviours of RHFBs subjected to flexural actions. Accurate finite element models simulating the physical conditions of both lateral buckling and section moment capacity tests were developed. Comparison of experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the buckling and ultimate failure behaviour of RHFBs can be simulated well using appropriate finite element models. Finite element models simulating ideal simply supported boundary conditions and a uniform moment loading were also developed in order to use in a detailed parametric study. The parametric study results were used to review the current design rules and to develop new design formulae for RHFBs subjected to local, lateral distortional and lateral torsional buckling effects. Finite element analysis results indicate that the discontinuity due to screw fastening has a noticeable influence only for members in the intermediate slenderness region. Investigations into different combinations of thicknesses in the flange and web indicate that increasing the flange thickness is more effective than web thickness in enhancing the flexural capacity of RHFBs. The current steel design standards, AS 4100 (1998) and AS/NZS 4600 (1996) are found sufficient to predict the section moment capacity of RHFBs. However, the results indicate that the AS/NZS 4600 is more accurate for slender sections whereas AS 4100 is more accurate for compact sections. The finite element analysis results further indicate that the current design rules given in AS/NZS 4600 is adequate in predicting the member moment capacity of RHFBs subject to lateral torsional buckling effects. However, they were inadequate in predicting the capacities of RHFBs subject to lateral distortional buckling effects. This thesis has therefore developed a new design formula to predict the lateral distortional buckling strength of RHFBs. Overall, this thesis has demonstrated that the innovative RHFB sections can perform well as economically and structurally efficient flexural members. Structural engineers and designers should make use of the new design rules and the validated existing design rules to design the most optimum RHFB sections {{depending on the type of}} applications. Intermittent screw fastening method has also been shown to be structurally adequate that also minimises the fabrication cost. Product manufacturers and builders should be able to make use of this in their applications...|$|R
