5000|$|The {{most common}} {{synthesis}} {{used to produce}} a high molecular weight form of the polymer is ring-opening polymerization of [...] "glycolide", the cyclic diester of glycolic acid. Glycolide can be prepared by heating under reduced pressure low MW PGA, collecting the diester by means of distillation. Ring-opening polymerization of glycolide can be catalyzed using different catalysts, including antimony compounds, such as antimony trioxide or antimony trihalides, zinc compounds (<b>zinc</b> <b>lactate)</b> and tin compounds like stannous octoate (tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate) or tin alkoxides. Stannous octoate is {{the most commonly used}} initiator, since it is approved by the FDA as a food stabilizer. Usage of other catalysts has been disclosed as well, among these are aluminium isopropoxide, calcium acetylacetonate, and several lanthanide alkoxides (e.g. yttrium isopropoxide). The procedure followed for ring-opening polymerization is briefly outlined: a catalytic amount of initiator is added to glycolide under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 195 °C. The reaction is allowed to proceed for about two hours, then temperature is raised to 230 °C for about half an hour. After solidification the resulting high MW polymer is collected.|$|E

In a cross sectional study, 100 lactating women who were sited under care of Isfahan rural and urban health centers were selected by multistage cluster and simple random sampling. The food recall questionnair was completed and 10 ml blood sample was obtained from each subject. Serum zinc level was measered by atomic absorption. &# 13; Results. Mean age of participants was 24. 7 ± 4. 9 years. Mean zinc concentration was 70. 4 ± 8. 01 µg/dl. About 63 percent of subjects had serum zinc level less than 75 µg/dl (significant zinc deficiency) and of this group 19 / 1 percent had severe zinc deficiency (less than 60 µg/dl). The mean of serum zinc level by BMI ( 25) were 63. 1, 70 and 75. 7 (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|Abstract In this paper, the {{antibacterial}} {{effects of}} the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens-produced bacteriocin subtilo-sin, both alone and in combination with curcumin, e-poly-L-lysine (poly-lysine), or <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate,</b> were examined against Listeria monocytogenes. Results indicated that subtilosin inhibits both of the studied bacterial strains, Scott A (wild-type, nisin sensitive) and NR 30 (nisin resistant). However, L. monocytogenes Scott A was more sensitive to subtilosin and pure curcumin. In addition, subtilosin was more active at an acidic pH. Subtilosin in combination with encapsulated curcumin displayed partial synergy against L. monocytogenes ScottA. It also had synergistic activity against both L. monocytogenes Scott A and L. monocytogenes NR 30 when combined with <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate.</b> Only an additive effect was observed for subtilosin when combined with non-encapsulated curcumin or poly-lysine against the mentioned strains. Thus, using the combination of subtilosin with curcumin, poly-lysine, or <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate,</b> a lower effective dose {{can be used to}} control L. monocytogenes infection. Our findings suggest that subtilosin could be used as alternative bacteriocin to nisin, providing an opportunity to use a novel natural and effi-cacious biopreservative against L. monocytogenes in food preservation.

40|$|Atopic eczema is {{an incurable}} {{disorder}} of the skin. Sufferers are afflicted with hypersensitivity to environmental agents such as soaps (detergents), animal dander, pollen, specific foods {{and sometimes even}} water. Genetic mutations in atopic eczema compromise {{the development of the}} stratum corneum resulting in xerotic skin that is prone to cracking and increased permeability which leads to irritation due to the influx of exogenous material through the skin. The causes of atopic eczema are due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors and it is, therefore, a difficult disease to manage. Emollients and topical corticosteroids are the mainstay treatments for eczema. However, they do not treat the underlying cause of the flare-ups frequently seen in the condition; the damaged skin barrier. Defects in the skin barrier arise from premature desquamation of the stratum corneum. The main contributors to barrier breakdown are the up-regulation of skin proteases that are located in the skin. Since zinc is a known protease inhibitor, it would thus follow that a topical treatment for skin barrier repair should be developed. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are to successfully incorporate zinc into a formulation to develop a novel class of treatment for eczema and to assess the delivery of the element into the skin. In this thesis, methods to assess and characterise changes to skin barrier function and to extract and quantify zinc in the stratum corneum have been established. The development of two novel topically applied formulations containing <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> as the active ingredient (1 % w/w <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> cream and a 2 % w/v <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> formulation) has been achieved and the uptake of zinc from the preparations in vitro determined. Further, the in vitro percutaneous penetration of zinc from three commercially available preparations has been investigated and compared to that recovered from the stratum corneum after passive diffusion with the novel zinc formulations. Additionally, in vivo uptake of zinc into human stratum corneum from Sudocremis ® reported. Scanning electron microscopy has revealed the distribution of zinc on the surface of skin treated with various formulations and has also allowed the efficiency of two cleaning procedures to be ascertained. The delivery of zinc from the novel topical formulation; 1 % w/w <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> cream, was more efficient than that the three commercial formulations and shows promise as a new approach to treat atopic eczema...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Despite {{the vital}} effects of zinc on infant growth, the low zinc store of mothers {{especially}} in poor communities {{may lead to}} low content of zinc in their newborns.

Reported herein is the development of a rapid method to simultaneously measure group-specific bactericidal and acidogenesis-mitigation effects of dentifrices on oral bacteria. Saliva was incubated aerobically and anaerobically in Tryptone Soya Broth, Wilkins-Chalgren Broth with mucin, or artificial saliva and was exposed to dentifrices containing triclosan/copolymer (TD); sodium fluoride (FD); stannous fluoride and <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> (SFD 1); or stannous fluoride, <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> and stannous chloride (SFD 2). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined turbidometrically whilst group-specific minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were assessed using growth media and conditions selective for total aerobes, total anaerobes, streptococci and Gram-negative anaerobes. Minimum acid neutralization concentration (MNC) was defined as the lowest concentration of dentifrice at which acidification was inhibited. Differences between MIC and MNC were calculated and normalized with respect to MIC to derive the combined inhibitory and neutralizing capacity (CINC), a cumulative measure of acidogenesis-mitigation and growth inhibition. The overall rank order for growth inhibition potency (MIC) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was: TD> SFD 2 > SFD 1 > FD. Acidogenesis-mitigation (MNC) was ordered; TD> FD> SFD 2 > SFD 1. CINC was ordered TD> FD> SFD 2 > SFD 1 aerobically and TD> FD> SFD 1 > SFD 2 anaerobically. With respect to group-specific bactericidal activity, TD generally exhibited the greatest potency, particularly against total aerobes, total anaerobes and streptococci.

All volunteers were examined by a calibrated examiner for the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (Turesky modification) and Löe-Silness Gingival Index (GI). Gingival severity was also measured by the percentage of sites with positive gingival bleeding. During six weeks, oral hygiene consisted of brushing twice daily with a toothbrush and toothpaste and rising with their assigned mouthwash. Plaque and gingival parameters were assessed at baseline, after four and six weeks of product use. Statistical analyses were performed separately for plaque and gingival indices, by ANOVA, paired t-test and ANCOVA (α < 0. 05). After 4 and 6 weeks, all mouthwashes groups presented statistically significant reductions in plaque and gingival parameters as compared to baseline. In comparison to the positive control, the test group presented additional reductions in dental plaque of 19. 8 % and 16. 8 %, after 4 and 6 weeks, respectively.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of oral {{diseases such as}} dental caries and periodontitis and the universal need for effective control of oral health has stimulated {{a great deal of}} interest in oral hygienic formulations both scientifically and commercially driven. Such formulations are normally deployed as complex formulations commonly containing antimicrobial actives together with excipients, where both classes of ingredients may contribute to the bacteriological effect of the oral hygienic product. However, the mode of action and/or the bacteriological and microecological effects of exposure of microorganisms to oral hygiene products are poorly understood. In this context, this doctoral dissertation represents a series of investigations to contribute to knowledge in the area. The impact of selected oral antimicrobial actives (triclosan, sodium lauryl sulphate, stannous fluoride and <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate)</b> on a key aspect of bacterial cellular membrane function was investigated. This involved measuring major cellular respiratory pathways during exposure to the test agents using two types of tetrazolium dyes possessing different redox potentials as respiration pathway indicators. Spectrophotometric analyses indicated that sub-lethal levels of triclosan and sodium lauryl sulphate act as uncoupling agents, an observation not previously been reported. Sub-lethal concentrations of stannous fluoride and <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> however, blocked cellular respiration with resulting shifts towards glycolytic/fermentative pathways. The contribution of a variety of test agents to the overall antimicrobial effect of a complex formulation (Listerine®) was investigated {{in order to understand the}} relative efficacy of the actives. This was achieved by testing the essential oils present in the formulation singly and in combination utilising in vitro models. The use of the hydroxyapatite disc model (HDM) to grow salivary microcosms to test the efficacy of the ingredients revealed hitherto unreported synergistic activity between the active ingredients thymol and menthol. Proprietary dentifrices (Colgate Total® and Crest ProHealth®) containing the antimicrobial agents triclosan or stannous fluoride/zinc lactate, respectively, were comparatively evaluated. This was performed by simultaneously establishing salivary microcosms in Sorbarod Biofilm Devices (SBDs). Following the establishment of dynamic steady-states, paired devices were dosed with each of the two proprietary dentifrices. Bacteriological data generated after multiple dosing indicated that both dentifrices were comparably effective in the reduction of all tested bacterial functional groups in the plaque models. However, data generated using HDM models indicated greater reductions in Gram-negative anaerobes after exposure to Colgate total®. The observations presented in this thesis may contribute to the development of oral formulations with optimised antimicrobial efficacies against adventitious pathogens present in the oral cavity and help in reducing the incidence of oral diseases and potentially related systemic interface.

Compression molded polymer films were allowed to degrade in a pH = 7. 0 phosphate buffer containing pseudomonas lipase. Data show that copolymers with CL contents lower than 25 % are not degradable and the degradation rate increases with CL content for CL-rich copolymers. Various soluble degradation products are detected in the degradation medium, including CL 1 to CL 3 and LA 1 to LA 4 homo-oligomers, and CL 2 LA 1 co-oligomer. The presence of LA homo-oligomers and CL 2 LA 1 co-oligomer suggests that pseudomonas lipase can not only degrades PCL, but also LA short blocks along PCL/PLA copolymer chains. On the other hand, little changes of compositions are detected during degradation, in agreement with a surface erosion mechanism as shown by ESEM...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA unique {{crystallization}} {{behavior of}} Poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) / poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) stereocomplex was observed when a PLLA/PDLA blend (50 / 50) {{was subjected to}} specific melting conditions. PLLA and PDLA were synthesized by ring opening polymerization of L- or D-lactide using <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> as catalyst. PLLA/PDLA blend was prepared through solution mixing followed by vacuum drying. The blend was melted under various melting conditions and subsequent crystallization behaviors were analyzed by using DSC, XRD, NMR and ESEM. Stereocomplex was exclusively formed from the 50 / 50 blend of PLLA and PDLA with relatively low molecular weights. Surprisingly, stereocomplex crystallization was distinctly depressed when higher melting temperature and longer melting period were applied, in contrast to homopolymer crystallization. Considering predominant interactions between PLLA and PDLA chains, a novel model of melting process is proposed to illustrate this behavior. It is assumed that PLLA and PDLA chain couples would preserve their interactions (melt memory) when the stereocomplex crystal melts smoothly, thus resulting in a heterogeneous melt which can easily crystallize. The melt could gradually become homogeneous at higher temperature or longer melting time. The strong interactions between PLLA and PDLA chain segments are randomly distributed in a homogeneous melt, thus preventing subsequent stereocomplex crystallization. However, the homogeneous melt can recover its ability to crystallize via dissolution in a solvent...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} polylactide-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLAPEG) block {{copolymers}} {{with a high}} PEG fraction were synthesized by the ring-opening polymerization of L-orD-lactide {{in the presence of}} mono- or dihydroxyl PEGusing nontoxic <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> as a catalyst. Micelles were then prepared by direct dissolution of the obtained water-soluble copolymers in an aqueous mediumwithout heating or using any organic solvents. Large anisotropic micelles instead of conventional spherical ones were observed from a transmission electron microscopy examination. Various parameters influencing the structure of the novel micelles were considered, such as the copolymer chain structure, molar mass, PEG fraction, copolymer concentration, and stereocomplexation between L- and D-PLA blocks. Anisotropic micelles were obtained for both diblock and triblock copolymers but vanished with increasing molar mass of the copolymers. The morphology of micelles strongly depends on the PEG fraction. Anisotropic micelles were found only in an intermediate EO/LA ratio range in which a higher PEG fraction leads to a higher length/width ratio of micelles. Stereocomplexation between L- and D-PLA or a lower concentration disfavors the formation of anisotropic micelles. Under appropriate concentrations, spherical and anisotropic micelles coexist in the same micellar solution. Moreover, it was found that anisotropic micelles are susceptible to further self-assemble into more organized complex aggregates. Similar results were obtained from light scattering and aqueous gel permeation chromatography measurements. A novel model is proposed to explain the formation of anisotropic micelles and the effects of various parameters on the structure of micelles in an aqueous medium...|$|E
40|$|Zinc supplementation {{decreases}} the morbidity of {{lower respiratory tract}} infection in pediatric patients in the developing world. We sought to determine if zinc mediates a specific inhibitory effect against the major cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract disease, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We determined the in vitro inhibitory effect of three zinc salts (zinc acetate, lactate, and sulfate) on the replication of RSV at various concentrations of 10 and 1 mM and 100 and 10 μM. The degree of inhibition of RSV replication was examined {{in the presence of}} zinc during preincubation, adsorption, or penetration and was compared with that caused by salts of other divalent cations. Complete inhibition of RSV plaque formation was observed at 1 and 10 mM, representing reductions that were ≥ 106 -fold. At the lowest concentration tested, 10 μM, we observed ≥ 1, 000 -fold reductions in RSV yield when zinc was present during preincubation, adsorption, penetration, or egress of virus. The therapeutic indices, determined as ratios of 50 % toxicity concentration to 50 % inhibitory concentration, were 100, 150, and 120 for zinc acetate, <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate,</b> and zinc sulfate, respectively. The inhibitory effect of zinc salts on RSV was concentration dependent and was not observed with other salts containing divalent cations such as calcium, magnesium, and manganese. RSV plaque formation was prevented by pretreatment of HEp- 2 cell monolayer cultures with zinc or by addition of zinc to methylcellulose overlay media after infection. The {{results of this study suggest}} that zinc mediates antiviral activity on RSV by altering the ability of the cell to support RSV replication...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes, a major {{foodborne}} pathogen, {{has been}} responsible for many outbreaks and recalls. Organic acids and antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) such as nisin are produced by lactic acid bacteria and are commercially used to control pathogens in some foods. This study examined the effects of lactic acid (LA) and its salts in combination with a commercial nisin preparation on the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A and its nisin-resistantmutant. Because of an increase in its activity at a lower pH, nisin was more active against L. monocytogenes when used in combination with LA. Most of the salts of LA, including potassium lactate, at up to 5 % partially inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes and had no synergy with nisin. Zinc and aluminum lactate, as well as zinc and aluminum chloride (0. 1 %), worked synergistically with 100 IU of nisin per ml to control the growth of L. monocytogenes Scott A. No synergy was observed when zinc or aluminum lactate was used with nisin against nisin-resistantL. monocytogenes. The nisin-resistant strain was more sensitive to Zn lactate than was wild-type L. monocytogenes Scott A; however, the cellular ATP levels of the nisin-resistant strain were not signi -cantly affected. Changes in the intracellular ATP levels of the wild-type strain support our hypothesis that pretreatment with <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> sensitizes cells to nisin. The similar effects of the salts of hydrochloric and lactic acids support the hypothesis that metal cations are responsible for synergy with nisin.

Sixty systemically healthy volunteers receiving dental prophylaxis were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the following experimental groups (15 per group) : (i) rinsing with 0. 075 % CPC, 0. 28 % Zn and 0. 05 % F (CPC+Zn+F), (ii) water or (iii) 0. 12 % chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX), and (iv) no rinsing. Viable bacteria were collected from different locations in the dental office on enriched TSA plates and anaerobically incubated for 72 hours. The colonies were counted and species were then identified by Checkerboard DNA&# 8211;DNA Hybridization. The total number of colony-forming units (CFUs) detected in the aerosols from volunteers who rinsed with CPC+Zn+F or CHX was statistically significantly (p< 0. 05) lower than of those subjects who did not rinse or who rinsed with water. When all locations were considered together, the aerosols from the CPC+Zn+F and CHX groups showed, respectively, 70 % and 77 % fewer CFUs than those from the No Rinsing group and 61 % and 70 % than those from the Water group. The mean proportions of bacterial species from the orange complex were statistically significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in aerosols from the CPC+Zn+F and CHX groups compared with the others two groups. In conclusion, the mouthwash containing CPC+Zn+F, is effective in reducing viable bacteria in oral aerosol after a dental prophylaxis with ultrasonic scaler...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{evaluates the}} impact of {{long-term}} supplementation of different forms of zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) {{on the content of}} these substances in the blood and hair of goats. Two analogous supplementation experiments were performed. 37 goats divided into four groups were used in the first trial with the Zn supplemen-tation. Group A (n = 10) was a control group (with no Zn administered). A further three groups (B, C, D) were supplemented with Zn in various forms. Group B (n = 9) with zinc oxide, Group C (n = 9) with <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> and Group D (n = 9) with zinc chelate. The second trial with Se supplementation was carried out on 20 goats divided into four groups. Group E (n = 5) was a control group. The other three groups were administered Se. Group F (n = 5) was supplied with a selenium lactate-protein complex, Group G (n = 5) with sodium selenite and Group H (n = 5) with selenium yeast. Three months later blood and hair samples were taken from all animals and Zn and Se concentrations were determined in whole blood, plasma, and hair. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was determined in the Se supplementation trial group. At the end of the trial the Zn concentrations in plasma and whole blood were without major differences between the groups. The plasma concentration of Zn did not increase from the initial value {{at the start of the}} trial. In hair the average concentration of Zn was 95. 2 – 100. 0 mg/kg in all groups. No conclusive relation was confirmed between the values of Zn in hair and its concentration in blood.

Four cell lines, namely 3 T 3 -J 2, C 3 H 10 (1 / 2), A 431, and HaCat, and three primary cell cultures, namely rat endothelial cells, rat smooth muscle cells, and human dermal fibroblasts, were then allowed to grow in the presence of LA and GA at various concentrations taken within the selected 10 - 1000 mg/cm 3 range. Little or no effect was observed on the proliferation of all cells except human keratinocytes, whose growth was dramatically inhibited by GA at concentrations as low as 10 mg/cm 3. The inhibiting effect of GA was confirmed by considering the growth of keratinocytes on films made of the same copolymer, in comparison with poly(DL-lactic acid) and polystyrene taken as references.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Morning breath odor is an often-encountered complaint. This double-blind, crossover, {{randomized}} study {{aimed to}} examine the bad breath-inhibiting effect of 3 commercially available mouthrinses on morning halitosis during an experimental period of 12 days without mechanical plaque control. METHODS: Twelve medical students with a healthy periodontium refrained from all means of mechanical plaque control during 3 experimental periods of 12 days (with intervening washout periods of at least 3 weeks). A professional oral cleaning preceded each period. During each experimental period, as the only oral hygiene measure allowed, the students rinsed twice a day {{with one of the}} following formulations in a randomized order: CHX-Alc (a 0. 2 % chlorhexidine [CHX] solution); CHX-NaF (CHX 0. 12 % plus sodium fluoride 0. 05 %); or CHX-CPC-Zn (CHX 0. 05 % plus cetylpyridinium chloride 0. 05 % plus <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> 0. 14 %). After 12 days, morning breath was scored via volatile sulfur compound (VSC) level measurements of the mouth air and organoleptic ratings of the mouth air, the expired air, and a scraping of the tongue coating. At the 12 -day visit, a questionnaire (subjective ratings) was completed and samples taken from both the tongue coating and the saliva for anaerobic and aerobic culturing and vitality staining. The de novo supragingival plaque formation was also recorded. All parameters were correlated with the baseline registrations. RESULTS: Although oral hygiene during the 3 experimental periods was limited to oral rinses, bad breath parameters systematically improved, {{with the exception of a}} slight increase in VSC levels while using CHX-Alc, a finding which was associated with the direct influence of the CHX on the sulfide monitor. The oral microbial load after the use of CHX-NaF remained unchanged, while for the CHX-Alc and CHX-CPC-Zn, significant reductions in both aerobic and anaerobic colony forming units (CFU) /ml were noticed in comparison with baseline data for both tongue coating and saliva samples. The composition of microflora, on the other hand, did not reveal significant changes. The supragingival plaque formation was inhibited, in descending order, by CHX-Alc, CHX-CPC-Zn, and CHX-NaF. The subjective scores for the rinses indicated a higher appreciation for CHX-CPC-Alc and CHX-NaF because of a better taste and fewer side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that morning halitosis can be successfully reduced via daily use of mouthrinses. CHX-Alc and CHX-CPC-Zn mouthrinses result in a significant reduction of the microbial load of tongue and saliva. status: publishe...|$|E

This double blind, crossover, randomised study assessed the efficacy of several antiseptic mouthrinses or slurry vs. a control solution {{in the prevention of}} morning bad breath during an experimental period of 7 days without mechanical plaque control. Methods: Sixteen dental students with a healthy periodontium abolished, after a thorough professional cleaning, all means of mechanical plaque control during five experimental periods of 7 days, interleaved by washout periods of at least 3 weeks. During each experimental period, as the only oral hygiene measure, the students rinsed twice a day with one of the following formulations (in a randomised order) : a 0. 2 % chlorhexidine-alcohol mouthrinse (CHX-Alc), a 0. 05 % CHX + 0. 05 % cetylpyridinium chloride + 0. 14 % <b>zinc</b> <b>lactate</b> mouthrinse (CHX-CPC-Zn), an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (125 ppm F-/ 125 ppm F-) containing mouthrinse (AmF/SnF 2 Mr), a slurry of a tooth paste (AmF/SnF 2 Sl) containing amine fluoride (350 ppm F-) and stannous fluoride (1050 ppm F-) and a placebo solution (placebo). At days 0, 3 and 7, morning breath was scored via VSC level measurements of the mouth air, and organoleptic ratings of the mouth air and tongue coating. At the same visits both the degree of gingival inflammation and the de novo plaque formation were rated. At the end of each period a questionnaire for subjective ratings was completed and microbiological samples were taken from the tongue dorsum, the saliva and the supragingival plaque for anaerobic and aerobic culturing. Results: Although oral hygiene during the experimental periods was limited to rinsing, bad breath parameters systematically improved (P or= 0. 5 log reduction with a superiority (P < 0. 005) for the CHX-Alc when compared to the two others). Changes in the bacterial load on the tongue dorsum could only be detected for the CHX-Alc solution (0. 5 log). The antibacterial effect of the placebo solution and the slurry were negligible. The composition of microflora on the other hand did not reveal significant changes. The de novo supragingival plaque formation was significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited by the three mouthrinses with a slight superiority for the CHX-Alc solution. The degree of gingival inflammation at day 7 remained low (< 0. 16) for all products. The CHX-Alc solution scored significantly worse for the subjective evaluation (questionnaires) concerning taste and sensitivity of tongue). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that morning breath odour can be successfully reduced by the sole twice daily use of CHX-Alc, CHX-CPC-Zn or AmF/SnF 2 Mr mouthrinses, which all significantly reduced the bacterial load in the saliva and retarded the de novo plaque formation. status: publishe...|$|E
