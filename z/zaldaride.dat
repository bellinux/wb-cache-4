40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to compare the efficacy of a new calmodulin antagonist, <b>zaldaride</b> maleate, with that of placebo or loperamide in persons with traveler's diarrhea. One hundred seventy-nine patients were randomized to receive loperamide(4 mg followed by 2 mg after each unformed stool), <b>zaldaride</b> maleate (20 mg four times per day), or placebo. During the initial 48 hours of therapy, <b>zaldaride</b> maleate decreased the number of unformed stools by 30 % and the duration of illnessby 23 %when compared with placebo. Loperamidewas superior to both <b>zaldaride</b> maleate and placebo during the initial hours of treatment. However, after 48 hours of treatment, loperamide and <b>zaldaride</b> maleate were equally efficacious, decreasing by> 50 % the number of unformed stools passed in a 24 -hour interval (P, not significant), and were both superior when compared with placebo (P <. 0001 and P =. 0048, respectively). The apparent superiority of loperamide early {{in the course of}} therapy appeared to be related to a loading-dose effect and not to any differences in antidiarrheal properties. <b>Zaldaride</b> maleate, a pyrrolo-benoxazepine with calmodulin-inhibiting properties, has previously been shown to be an effec-tive agent when compared with placebo for the treatment of diarrhea during short-term travel in Mexico [1]. Currently available antimotility agents, including loperamide, decrease gastrointestinal transit time, which may be deleterious in the treatment of certain enteric infections [2]. Thus, a distinct ad-vantage of this novel inhibitor is its effective antidiarrheal activity due to its antisecretory properties, which does not inter-fere with gastrointestinal transit time [3]. The objectives of the present study were to confirm the efficacy of <b>zaldaride</b> maleate for the symptomatic relief of acute diarrhea and to compare its efficacy with that of loperamide, an agent with known antidiar-rheal activity [4]...|$|E
40|$|Mustard agent affects several {{pathways}} {{that contribute}} to its toxicity. Some of the pathways involve calcium poisoning and protein degradation, {{but it is not}} clear how these pathways affect vesicant-induced toxicity. This makes it difficult to develop a good screening test to evaluate chemicals which might be used to antagonize or mitigate mustard’s actions in cells. We examined here a screening test that uses live human tissue (human whole blood) and describe how monitoring the tissue after exposure to potential drugs and a vesicant can be used to estimate the overall effect of a drug or combination of drugs on vesicant exposure. Antagonizing cell death pathways of calcium poisoning (<b>zaldaride</b> maleate [CGS 9343 B]; C) or protein degradation (Leupeptin; L) does not satisfactorily resolve vesicant-induced toxicity. However, antagonizing pathways simultaneously might be successful. Moreover, when used with an oxidizing agent (copper-based polyoxometalate; P) that may reduce vesicant toxicity, the effectiveness of these antagonists might be improved. This approach was evaluated using a simple human whole blood (HWB) in vitro system. Prior treatment (30 min) of heparinized (40 U/mL) HWB (n= 9) without (buffer vehicle) or with C (13. 6 µg/mL), L (0. 5 mg/mL) or P (5. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To present {{evidence-based}} {{recommendations on}} traveling abroad safely so family physicians can advise travelers {{on how to}} reduce risk of accidents, diarrhea, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and how to treat diarrhea themselves if medical care is unavailable. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: A MEDLINE search from 1990 to November 1998 found 163 articles on travel and accidents, 504 on travel and diarrhea, and 42 on travel and STDs. Titles and abstracts were reviewed, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews were sought. The Cochrane Collaboration database of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was searched for studies relevant to family physicians. MAIN MESSAGE: For preventing diarrhea, RCTs demonstrate that bismuth subsalicylate, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are useful prophylactics. Once travelers have diarrhea, RCTs show that loperamide and <b>zaldaride</b> reduce symptoms and duration; quinolones, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and oral aztreonam reduce abdominal symptoms and time to last liquid stool by several days; azithromycin is effective in treatment of ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective in treating cyclospora. There are no RCTs of preventing accidents and STDs abroad. Health Canada has issued a statement summarizing the risks of acquiring STDs abroad. CONCLUSION: Family physicians can advise their patients on how to reduce risk of travelers' diarrhea and how to treat it themselves on holiday. There is expert {{advice on how to}} reduce risk of STDs...|$|E
