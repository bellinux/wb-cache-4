5|$|Although the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA in Santa Clara Valley {{produces}} <b>Zinfandel</b> {{from just}} , the <b>Zinfandel</b> from that region {{is known for}} its complexity and depth.|$|E
5|$|Historically, California <b>Zinfandel</b> vines {{were planted}} {{as a field}} blend {{interspersed}} with Durif (Petite Sirah), Carignan, Grenache, Mourvèdre, Mission and Muscat. While most vineyards are now fully segregated, California winemakers continue to use other grapes (particularly Petite Sirah) in their <b>Zinfandel</b> wines. <b>Zinfandel</b> is grown on approximately 11% of California's vineyard land area. Around 400,000 short tons (350,000 tonnes) are crushed each year, depending on the harvest, placing <b>Zinfandel</b> third behind Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon and just ahead of Merlot.|$|E
5|$|In California, 20% of the Zinfandel-growing {{counties}} hold 80% of the <b>Zinfandel</b> growing area; however, major producing {{areas such}} as San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, and Madera County produce <b>Zinfandel</b> primarily for blends or jug wine.|$|E
50|$|Ridge also {{focuses on}} single-estate wines where the grapes for a {{particular}} label are all grown at the same vineyard. The signature wine of Ridge is its Monte Bello, a field blend of Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with varying percentages of other grapes grown in the same location, usually including Merlot, Petit Verdot, and occasionally Cabernet Franc.Ridge's <b>Zinfandels</b> (or mostly-Zinfandel field blends) constitute {{the bulk of the}} winery's production. Using grapes from selected sites from all over the state and bottling them each under their own label, Ridge <b>Zinfandels</b> emphasize the particular characteristics of each growing site and may show different aging characteristics than do other <b>Zinfandels.</b> Among the best known of the Ridge <b>Zinfandels</b> or Zinfandel-blends are those from Geyserville, York Creek, and Lytton Springs.|$|R
5000|$|Cline Cellars Winery is {{a family}} owned and {{operated}} winery located in the Carneros wine appellation of Sonoma County, California that specializes in <b>Zinfandels</b> and French Rhône-style wines.|$|R
50|$|Alderbrook Winery was a {{winery in}} Healdsburg, California, United States. The winery {{was owned by}} the Terlato Wine Group and {{produced}} upwards of 30,000 cases a year. Their signature wines were <b>Zinfandels</b> using grapes from the Dry Creek Valley AVA.|$|R
5|$|Joseph W. Osborne {{may have}} made the first wine from <b>Zinfandel</b> in California. He planted <b>Zinfandel</b> from Macondray at his Oak Knoll {{vineyard}} just north of Napa, and his wine was much praised in 1857. Planting of <b>Zinfandel</b> boomed soon after, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California.|$|E
5|$|Lodi {{has some}} of the oldest <b>Zinfandel</b> vines in California. While often used for White <b>Zinfandel</b> production, in the red style, Lodi Zinfandels have a {{reputation}} for being juicy and approachable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zinfandel</b> {{is grown}} across the {{continental}} United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles {{that range from}} late harvest dessert wines, rosés (White <b>Zinfandel)</b> and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and fortified wine {{in the style of}} port. The quality and character of American <b>Zinfandel</b> wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker.|$|E
5000|$|She {{is one of}} {{the first}} {{pioneering}} professional female winemakers, having begun her career at Dry Creek Vineyard in Sonoma County in 1980. She started as winemaker who specializes in <b>Zinfandels,</b> and won recognition for wine produced using that grape in California.|$|R
5000|$|Ousterhout {{and wife}} Nancy also own and manage Ousterhout Wine and Vineyards. The wines have won {{compliments}} and awards, with Vinography writing [...] "you can't {{go wrong with}} Ousterhout", and Wine & Spirits magazine selecting their wines among the best <b>Zinfandels</b> and the best California wines.|$|R
50|$|Sonoma County {{is home to}} {{more than}} 250 wineries with eleven {{distinct}} and two shared American Viticultural Areas, including the Sonoma Valley AVA, Russian River Valley AVA, Alexander Valley AVA, Bennett Valley AVA and Dry Creek Valley AVA, the last of which is known for the production of high-quality <b>Zinfandels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari had {{suggested}} to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be the}} Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali {{was the same as}} <b>Zinfandel,</b> among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the <b>Zinfandel</b> Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on <b>Zinfandel.</b> With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Sonoma {{county has}} a Zinfandel-producing land area {{second only to}} that of San Joaquin County. The county {{contains}} the warm Dry Creek Valley AVA, known for its juicy <b>Zinfandel</b> with bright fruit, balanced acidity and notes of blackberry, anise and pepper. Dry Creek Valley produces <b>Zinfandel</b> {{in a variety of}} styles ranging from the high-alcohol Amador style to balanced, spicy wines.|$|E
5|$|While the Napa Valley AVA {{is known}} {{primarily}} for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah, Napa also produces <b>Zinfandel</b> wines described as plummy and intense, tasting of red berry fruits with cedar and vanilla. <b>Zinfandel</b> in Napa {{tends to be}} made in a claret style like red Bordeaux.|$|E
6000|$|... --True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's no {{straight}} sport going now. Lenehan {{gets some}} good ones. He's giving Sceptre today. <b>Zinfandel's</b> the favourite, lord Howard de Walden's, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him.

2500|$|Today, White <b>Zinfandels</b> are {{considered}} part of the [...] "blush wine" [...] category of noticeably sweet, pale pink wines that often have very slight carbonation to give the wine a balance of acidity and some [...] "liveliness". Very often winemakers will blend aromatic varierties like Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Muscat to add to the fruity nose of the wine.|$|R
50|$|The Rockpile AVA is {{situated}} at the northwest point of the Dry Creek Valley AVA, past Healdsburg. The area was first planted by Italian immigrants {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Many of today's vineyards were formerly occupied by a reservoir created by the Warm Springs Dam on the Russian River. The area is known for its fruity, ripe <b>Zinfandels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Amador has a {{reputation}} for big, full-bodied <b>Zinfandel.</b> These extra-ripe wines have been called jammy, briary, and brambly, having aromas of sweet berries.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both <b>Zinfandel</b> and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, {{but they are}} not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according to whether it is <b>Zinfandel</b> or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality <b>Zinfandel.</b> Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and <b>Zinfandel</b> sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E
5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes. Some winemakers choose to vinify the bunches with these {{varying levels of}} ripeness, while others hand-harvest the bunches, even by single berries, in multiple passes through the vineyards over several weeks. This extensively laborious practice is one component in {{the high cost of}} some <b>Zinfandels.</b>|$|R
25|$|A rosé wine {{incorporates}} some of {{the color}} from the grape skins, {{but not enough to}} qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins to stain the wort), saignée (removing juice from the must early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and blending (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling, or sparkling, {{with a wide range of}} sweetness levels from dry Provençal rosé to sweet White <b>Zinfandels</b> and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.|$|R
2500|$|A rosé (from French rosé; {{also known}} as rosada in Portugal and Spanish-speaking {{countries}} and rosato in Italy) {{is a type of}} wine that incorporates some of the color from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine.

Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes and can be found all around the globe.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{the grape}} was {{fermented}} and shipped north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and <b>Zinfandel</b> began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style <b>Zinfandel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized <b>Zinfandel</b> as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as <b>Zinfandel</b> in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E

5000|$|Improvements in {{viticulture}} and warmer vintages {{have led}} to increasing levels of sugar in wine grapes, which have translated {{to higher levels of}} alcohol - which can reach over 15% ABV in <b>Zinfandels</b> from California. Some producers feel that this unbalances their wine, and use spinning cones to reduce the alcohol by 1-2 percentage points. In this case the wine is passed through the column once to distill out the most volatile aroma compounds which are then put to one side while the wine goes through the column a second time at higher temperature to extract alcohol. The aroma compounds are then mixed back into the wine. Some producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood argue that technological [...] "fixes" [...] such as spinning cones remove a sense of terroir from the wine; if the wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15% alcohol, Peterson argues that it should be accepted on its own terms.|$|R
5|$|San Luis Obispo, {{particularly}} the Paso Robles AVA with its hot days and cool maritime evenings, produces <b>Zinfandel</b> {{known for being}} soft and round.|$|E
5|$|Wine critics {{considered}} white <b>Zinfandel</b> to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels {{have more}} fruit and less cloying sweetness. Nevertheless, {{the success of}} this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own {{at the end of the}} 20th century as red <b>Zinfandel</b> wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in a different way.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zinfandel</b> vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. <b>Zinfandel</b> is often praised {{for its ability to}} reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E
25|$|The Redwood and Potter Valleys {{face each}} other on the west and east, respectively, just north of Lake Mendocino in the far {{northern}} reaches of Mendocino County. The areas include heavily wooden terrain with the name Redwood Valley coming from the legends of redwood trees growing so densely packed that they blotted out the sky. In the southern reaches of Redwood Valley is the Ricetti bench, a fluvial terrace the features crimson red soil, where Mendocino County's first vineyards were planted in the 1850s. Today the Redwood Valley is known for its peppery, spicy <b>Zinfandels.</b> The Redwood Valley is slightly cooler than the vineyard plantings to the south towards Ukiah, allowing the area to produce wines with more acidity and deeper color. Many of the grapes grown in the Potter Valley AVA are blended and sold under the more widely recognizable Mendocino AVA. In the 21st century, Potter Valley has developed a reputation for white grape varieties such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc as well as Pinot noir from its pockets of cooler microclimates.|$|R
2500|$|The Anderson Valley extends about 10 miles (16km) from {{end to end}} and {{contains}} over 20 different types of alluvial soils. The area around the cities of Philo and Navarro, California in the center and north end of the valley receive considerably more cooling fog influence than the plantings closer to Boonville in the south. Despite being called a [...] "valley", very few vineyards are planted on flat land. Much of the Anderson Valley is planted on a series of steep hills that range in elevation from 800–1300 feet (244–396 m). On the mountain ridges above the valley, the cooling influence of the fog can not quite reach the vineyards planted at these elevations. The direct exposure to the sun gives these isolated patches of vineyards more warmth which contributes to the spicy, berry notes of the <b>Zinfandels</b> produced {{in this part of the}} Anderson Valley. While some of these vineyards are still part of the Anderson Valley, many were siphoned off into the boundaries of the Mendocino Ridge AVA when it was established in 1997. As a series of disparate mountain ridges, the Mendocino Ridge was the first non-contiguous AVA established in California.|$|R
5|$|The Croatian form Crljenak Kaštelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its {{own right}} before the link to <b>Zinfandel</b> was revealed.
