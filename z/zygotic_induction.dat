5000|$|<b>Zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> was {{discovered}} while {{the location of}} prophage λ was being mapped using Hfr x F− matings. When the F− was lysogenic for λ, lysogeny was mapped to the gal locus. However, when the Hfr parent was lysogenic, lysogeny (i.e., the prophage) was not inherited by any of recombinants, which were recovered by growing them as colonies on the appropriate agar medium. The reason is that transfer of the λ prophage into the F− recipient was accompanied by immediate induction of bacteriophage production within the F− cell. Subsequent lysis of this [...] "zygote" [...] released the new bacteriophage particles. If mating terminated before the prophage was transferred, phage was not produced, and recombination proceeded in the zygote. These observations provided evidence that genetic markers was transferred in one direction during conjugation, from the Hfr to F− cell. These experiments also showed that Lederberg's model was incorrect since <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> would have prevented any recombinant from forming had all of the chromosome from the Hfr cell were {{to be transferred to}} the F− cell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> {{occurs when}} a {{bacterial}} cell carrying the silenced DNA of a bacterial virus in its chromosome transfers the viral DNA along with its own DNA to another bacterial cell lacking the virus, causing {{the recipient of the}} DNA to break open. In the donor cell, a repressor protein encoded by the prophage (viral DNA) keeps the viral genes turned off so that virus is not produced. When DNA is transferred to the recipient cell by conjugation,the viral genes in the transferred DNA are immediately turned on because the recipient cell lacks the repressor. As a result, lots of virus is made in the recipient cell, and lysis eventually occurs to release the new virus.|$|E
40|$|The psiB and ssb {{genes of}} IncI 1 plasmid ColIb-P 9 {{reside in the}} leading region, {{which is the first}} portion of the plasmid to be {{transferred}} during conjugation. These genes are expressed in a transient burst in newly-formed transconjugants via a process known as <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction,</b> and are thought to promote establishment of the immigrant plasmid. One hypothesis for the regulation of <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> is that the genes are activated as part of a conjugation-induced heat-shock response. Both ssb and psiB are damage-inducible and have putative sigma 32 -dependent promoter sequences. Data are presented showing that <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> occurs when sigma 32 levels are limited and that conjugation fails to induce the heat- shock response, as measured using a sigma 32 -dependent reporter construct. A second hypothesis is that <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> results from a transient loss of negative supercoiling during plasmid transfer. The finding that neither psiB nor ssb expression is strongly induced in vegetative cells treated with coumermycin is inconsistent with this hypothesis. A third possibility is that psiB and ssb are regulated by a plasmid-encoded trans-acting repressor which is absent from the recipient cell. This hypothesis was tested with an entry-exclusion mutant of ColIb, created by insertional inactivation of the eex locus. When ColIb was transferred to a recipient harbouring this mutant, <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> was observed. This finding also demonstrates that <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> is independent of vegetative replication, since the incoming and resident plasmids are incompatible. Previous work suggested that psiB and ssb are closely linked to promoters. However, data obtained using RP 4 - and ColIb-mobilisable constructs carrying different portions of the leading region suggest that at least 5 kb of upstream DNA is necessary for <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> of both genes, thus indicating that they are induced as part of a leading region operon...|$|E

Evidence that prophage 186 is induced by ultraviolet irradiation or by treatment with nalidixic acid or mitomycin C is now presented. The phage yields were similar to those from lysogens of the inducible phage lambda, and the induction required a recA+ host. A noninducible mutant of 186 was isolated from its heat-inducible derivative, 186 cIts, that was no longer inducible by ultraviolet irradiation but remained heat inducible. That <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> of 186 after transfer from a lysogenic male to a non-lysogenic recipient did not occur is indicated by the following findings: (i) there was only a slight increase in phage titer; (ii) similar levels of recombinants were obtained for markers adjacent or distal to the phage integration site, whether the recipient was lysogenic or not, and there was no effect on the gradient of marker transfer; (iii) lysogenic recombinants were readily found and the co-transfer of 186 with adjacent markers was the same to lysogenic or non-lysogenic recipients.

40|$|AbstractMost natural conjugative IncF {{plasmids}} encode a fertility inhibition {{system that}} represses transfer gene {{expression in the}} majority of plasmid-carrying cells. The successful spread of these plasmids in clinically relevant bacteria has been suggested to be supported by a transitory derepression of transfer gene expression in newly formed transconjugants. In this study, we aimed to monitor the extent of transitory derepression during agar surface matings in situ by comparing plasmid spread of the IncF plasmid R 1 and its derepressed mutant R 1 drd 19 at low initial cell densities. A <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> strategy was used to visualize the spatial distribution of fluorescent transconjugants within the heterogeneous environment. Epifluorescence and confocal microscopy revealed different transfer patterns for both plasmids, however, spread beyond the first five recipient cell layers adjacent to the donor cells was not observed.

These results cannot rule out that transitory derepression contributes to the limited R 1 plasmid invasion, but other factors like nutrient availability or spatial structure seem to limit plasmid spread...|$|E
40|$|A gene {{function}} carried by a plasmid, causing arrest of cell division in Escherichia coli, {{has been identified}} as the product of a short open reading frame of the prophage Rac, previously designated orfE, expressed only under conditions of prophage induction. Because Rac carries a killing function expressed under conditions of <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction,</b> an orfE-defective Rac 1 strain was constructed. This strain had lost the killing function, indicating that orfE is kil. Division inhibition by kil was specifically relieved by overexpression of essential division gene ftsZ. The kil gene product acts independently of the min operon, and its effects are increased in conditions of high cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein-cAMP complex levels in the cell. Furthermore, at high levels of expression, kil product distorts the rod shape of the cells. These features distinguish kil-encoded protein from the inhibitory product of gene dicB, which occupies a similar genetic location in Kim (Qin), another defective prophage of Escherichia coli. Three defective lambdoid prophages, Rac, QSR 9, and Kim (Qin), have been identified in the genome of Escherichia coli K- 12 (3, 21).

40|$|AbstractThe {{separation}} of the germ line from the soma is a classic concept in animal biology, and depending on species is thought to involve fate determination either by maternally localized germ plasm (“preformation” or “maternal inheritance”) or by inductive signaling (classically termed “epigenesis” or “zygotic induction”). The latter mechanism is generally considered to operate in non-bilaterian organisms such as cnidarians and sponges, in which germ cell fate is determined at adult stages from multipotent stem cells. We have found in the hydrozoan cnidarian Clytia hemisphaerica that the multipotent “interstitial” cells (i-cells) in larvae and adult medusae, from which germ cells derive, express a set of conserved germ cell markers: Vasa, Nanos 1, Piwi and PL 10. In situ hybridization analyses unexpectedly revealed maternal mRNAs for all these genes highly concentrated in a germ plasm-like region at the egg animal pole and inherited by the i-cell lineage, strongly suggesting i-cell fate determination by inheritance of animal-localized factors. On the other hand, experimental tests showed that i-cells can form by epigenetic mechanisms in Clytia, since larvae derived from both animal and vegetal blastomeres separated during cleavage stages developed equivalent i-cell populations. Thus Clytia embryos appear to have maternal germ plasm inherited by i-cells but also the potential to form these cells by <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction.</b> Reassessment of available data indicates that maternally localized germ plasm molecular components were plausibly present in the common cnidarian/bilaterian ancestor, but that their role {{may not have been}} strictly deterministic...|$|E
40|$|Conjugational {{transfer}} of the TOL plasmid (pWWO) was analyzed in a flow chamber biofilm community engaged in benzyl alcohol degradation. The community consisted of three species, Pseudomonas putida RI, Acinetobacter sp. strain C 6, and an unidentified isolate, D 8. Only P. putida RI could act as a recipient for the TOL plasmid. Cells carrying a chromosomally integrated lacIq gene and a lacp-gfp-tagged version of the TOL plasmid were introduced as donor strains in the biofilm community after its formation. The occurrence of plasmid-carrying cells was analyzed by viable-count-based enumeration of donors and transconjugants. Upon {{transfer of}} the plasmids to the recipient cells, expression of green fluorescence was activated {{as a result of}} <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> of the gfp gene. This allowed a direct in situ identification of cells receiving the gfp-tagged version of the TOL plasmid. Our data suggest that the frequency of horizontal plasmid transfer was low, and growth (vertical transfer) of the recipient strain was the major cause of plasmid establishment in the biofilm community. Employment of scanning confocal laser microscopy on fixed biofilms, combined with simultaneous identification of P. putida cells and transconjugants by 16 S rRNA hybridization and expression of green fluorescence, showed that transconjugants were always associated with noninfected P. putida RI recipient microcolonies. Pure colonies of transconjugants were never observed, indicating that proliferation of transconjugant cells preferentially took place on preexisting P. putida RI microcolonies in the biofilm...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of the germline is a critical, yet surprisingly evolutionarily labile, event {{in the development of}} sexually reproducing animals. In the fly Drosophila, germ cells acquire their fate early during development through the inheritance of the germ plasm, a specialized maternal cytoplasm localized at the posterior pole of the oocyte. The gene oskar (osk) is both necessary and sufficient for assembling this substance. Both maternal germ plasm and oskar are evolutionary novelties within the insects, as the germline is specified by <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> in basally branching insects, and osk has until now only been detected in dipterans. In order to understand the origin of these evolutionary novelties, we used comparative genomics, parental RNAi, and gene expression analyses in multiple insect species. We have found that the origin of osk and its role in specifying the germline coincided with the innovation of maternal germ plasm and pole cells {{at the base of the}} holometabolous insects and that losses of osk are correlated with changes in germline determination strategies within the Holometabola. Our results indicate that the invention of the novel gene osk was a key innovation that allowed the transition from the ancestral late zygotic mode of germline induction to a maternally controlled {{establishment of}} the germline found in many holometabolous insect species. We propose that the ancestral role of osk was to connect an upstream network ancestrally involved in mRNA localization and translational control to a downstream regulatory network ancestrally involve...|$|E

40|$|Salmonella typhosa hybrids able to adsorb lambda were {{obtained}} by mating S. typhosa recipients with Escherichia coli K- 12 donors. After adsorption of wild-type λ to these S. typhosa hybrids, no plaques or infective centers could be detected.

The lysogenic state {{which resulted in the}} S. typhosa hybrids after gal+ transduction differed from that of E. coli. Ability to produce λ, initially present, was permanently segregated by transductants of the S. typhosa hybrid. S. typhosa lysogens did not lyse upon treatment for phage induction with mitomycin C, ultraviolet light, or heat in the case of thermoinducible λ.

40|$|AbstractTo assess {{alternative}} methods for introducing expressing transgenes into the germ line of zebrafish, transgenic fish that express a nuclear-targeted, enhanced, {{green fluorescent protein}} (eGFP) gene were produced using both pseudotyped retroviral vector infection and DNA microinjection of embryos. Germ-line transgenic founders were identified and the embryonic progeny of these founders were evaluated for the extent and pattern of eGFP expression. To compare the two modes of transgenesis, both vectors used the Xenopus translational elongation factor 1 -α enhancer/promoter regulatory cassette. Several transgenic founder fish which transferred eGFP expression to their progeny were identified. The gene expression patterns are described and compared for the two modes of gene transfer. Transient expression of eGFP was detected 1 day after introducing the transgenes via either DNA microinjection or retroviral vector infection. In both cases of gene transfer, transgenic females produced eGFP-positive progeny even before the zygotic genome was turned on. Therefore, GFP was being provided by the oocyte before fertilization. A transgenic female revealed eGFP expression in her ovarian follicles. The qualitative patterns of gene expression in the transgenic progeny embryos after <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> of gene expression were similar and independent of the mode of transgenesis. The appearance of newly synthesized GFP is detectable within 5 – 7 h after fertilization. The variability {{of the extent of}} eGFP expression from transgenic founder to transgenic founder was wider for the DNA-injection transgenics than for the retroviral vector-produced transgenics. The ability to provide expressing germ-line transgenic progeny via retroviral vector infection provides both an alternative mode of transgenesis for zebrafish work and a possible means of easily assessing the insertional mutagenesis frequency of retroviral vector infection of zebrafish embryos. However, because of the transfer of GFP from oocyte to embryo, the stability of GFP may create problems of analysis in embryos which develop as quickly as those of zebrafish...|$|E

Restriction and modification of phages by fi− R factors. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 477 – 486. 1966. —An fi− R factor, which restricts phages λ, T 1, and T 7 without modifying them, {{was found to}} restrict and not to modify an F−-specific phage, W- 31, in Escherichia coli K- 12, but not to restrict phage P- 22 in Salmonella typhimurium LT- 2, whereas other fi− R factors restricted and modified P- 22 but not W- 31; fi+ R factors did not restrict these phages. Transduction and lysogenization with phages λ and P- 22 were reduced by these fi− R factors in K- 12 and LT- 2, respectively, and the transducing phages λ and P- 22 were modified by these fi− R factors. Spontaneous as well as ultraviolet-induced production of phage P- 22 and <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> of phage λ were not significantly affected by any R factor.

40|$|Background: Germline {{specification}} in {{some animals}} {{is driven by}} the maternally inherited germ plasm during early embryogenesis (inheritance mode), whereas in others it is induced by signals from neighboring cells in mid or late development (induction mode). In the Metazoa, the induction mode appears as a more prevalent and ancestral condition; the inheritance mode is therefore derived. However, regarding germline specification in organisms with asexual and sexual reproduction it has not been clear whether both strategies are used, one for each reproductive phase, or if just one strategy is used for both phases. Previously we have demonstrated that specification of germ cells in the asexual viviparous pea aphid depends on a preformed germ plasm. In this study, we extended this work to investigate how germ cells were specified in the sexual oviparous embryos, aiming to understand whether or not developmental plasticity of germline specification exists in the pea aphid. Results: We employed Apvas 1, a Drosophila vasa ortholog in the pea aphid, as a germline marker to examine whether germ plasm is preformed during oviparous development, as has already been seen in the viviparous embryos. During oogenesis, Apvas 1 mRNA and ApVas 1 protein were both evenly distributed. After fertilization, uniform expression of Apvas 1 remained in the egg but posterior localization of ApVas 1 occurred from the fifth nuclear cycle onward. Posterior co-localization of Apvas 1 /ApVas 1 was first identified in the syncytial blastoderm undergoing cellularization, and later we could detect specific expression of Apvas 1 /ApVas 1 in the morphologically identifiable germ cells of mature embryos. This suggests that Apvas 1 /ApVas 1 -positive cells are primordial germ cells and posterior localization of ApVas 1 prior to cellularization positions the preformed germ plasm. Conclusions: We conclude that both asexual and sexual pea aphids rely on the preformed germ plasm to specify germ cells and that developmental plasticity of germline specification, unlike axis patterning, occurs in neither of the two aphid reproductive phases. Consequently, the maternal inheritance mode implicated by a preformed germ plasm in the oviparous pea aphid becomes a non-canonical case in the Hemimetabola, where so far the <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> mode prevails in most other studied insects...|$|E
40|$|The IncIl conjugative plasmid ColIb-P 9 {{carries a}} psiB gene that {{prevents}} induction of the SOS response in host bacteria. This locus {{was found to}} be located 2. 5 kb downstream of the ssb (single-stranded DNA- binding protein) gene in the leading region of ColIb. This portion of the plasmid is transferred first to the recipient cell during conjugation and is strikingly similar to part of the leading region of the otherwise distinct F plasmid. Determination of the nucleotide sequence of ColIb psiB demonstrated that the gene has 84 % identity with the psiB gene of F. Promoterless lacZ fusions on ColIb were created to leading region genes ssb and psiB and to sog, a representative transfer gene. It was found that expression of all three genes is increased when the ColIb transfer system is derepressed, but ssb and psiB are expressed at a much lower level than sog. Expression of psiB and ssb is increased when the host cell is exposed to UV- irradiation or mitomycin C treatments. The DNA-damage inducibility of ssb and psiB is recA and lexA-independent showing that neither gene is a component of the SOS regulon. Expression of both psiB and ssb is strongly enhanced in conjugatively infected recipient cells. No enhanced synthesis of Sog polypeptides was detected following conjugation showing that the <b>zygotic</b> <b>induction</b> of ssb and psiB is not a general property of plasmid genes. The implication is that PsiB and SSB proteins function in the transconjugant cell, rather than in the primary donor. It has been proposed that PsiB acts to prevent triggering of the SOS response during conjugation by transferring single-stranded DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, carriage of the psiB gene by ColIb was shown to prevent a low level of SOS induction following conjugation. Plasmids that carry ssb and psiB genes have replicons belonging to the RepFIC family. It is postulated that the trigger for SOS induction during conjugation may be generated during the initial replication of the plasmid in the newly infected recipient cell rather than by the process of single-stranded DNA transfer...|$|E
