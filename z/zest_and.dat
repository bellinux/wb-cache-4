[...] "The script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski posits Wood {{as a classic}} American optimist, a Capraesque hero with little to be optimistic about, since {{he was also a}} classic American loser. That's a fine start, but the film then marches in staid chronological order."

Sanjukta Sharma of Mint found the film to be an [...] "immensely effective reimagination of Shakespeare" [...] and particularly praised Kapoor for playing his part with [...] "impressive <b>zest</b> <b>and</b> inventiveness".

His cause of death was never known, while some (even contemporaries) speculated he was poisoned, but no conclusive evidence to support such a claim have ever been found. Based on sparse descriptions of his illness and subsequent investigations, some medical historians suggest the cause of death might have been a disease related to cholera. [...] However, one account states, [...] "following a cheerful conversation with other officers who had congregated for a military council in his tent on Sunday, 13 August N.S. he had eaten some cucumbers with <b>zest</b> <b>and</b> washed them down with mead, and from that contracted dysentery.
