50|$|No-till farming (also called <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> {{or direct}} drilling) {{is a way}} of growing crops or pasture from year to year without {{disturbing}} the soil through tillage. No-till is an agricultural technique which increases the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil and increases organic matter retention and cycling of nutrients in the soil. In many agricultural regions it can reduce or eliminate soil erosion. It increases the amount and variety of life in and on the soil, including disease-causing organisms and disease suppression organisms. The most powerful benefit of no-tillage is improvement in soil biological fertility, making soils more resilient. Farm operations are made much more efficient, particularly improved time of sowing and better trafficability of farm operations.|$|E
50|$|Crop {{rotations}} {{also affect}} {{the timing and}} length of when a field is subject to fallow.

Such management practices that succeed in retaining suitable soil cover in areas under fallow will ultimately reduce soil loss. In a recent study that lasted a decade, it was found that a common winter cover crop after potato harvest such as fall rye can reduce soil run-off by as much as 43%, and this is typically the most nutritional soil.|$|E

This land is very susceptible to wind erosion during summer fallow because multiple tillage operations during fallow degrade and expose the soil to high winds. We examined possible alternatives to conventional tillage for reducing the emission of windblown PM 10 (particulate matter ≤ 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter) during summer fallow. Soil was subject to seven (conventional), five (reduced), three (delayed-minimum), and <b>zero</b> (no) <b>tillage</b> operations between harvest in July 2004 and sowing in August 2005. Sediment catch and PM 10 concentration and wind speed profiles were measured after each tillage operation and sowing under simulated high winds (using a portable wind tunnel) to estimate horizontal sediment and PM 10 flux. Horizontal sediment and PM 10 flux generally decreased with a decrease in number or intensity of tillage operations. No tillage resulted in the lowest sediment and PM 10 flux after most tillage operations; no tillage, however, is not yet an economically viable management option for the region. Sediment and PM 10 flux were typically lower for reduced and delayed-minimum tillage than for conventional tillage. Our study suggests that PM 10 flux can be reduced from agricultural soils during the summer fallow phase of a wheat-fallow rotation by using reduced or delayed-minimum tillage practices.

Specifically, we determined microbial respiration rates, enzyme activities, carbon source utilization and the functional chemistry of the soil organic matter in temperate well drained soils that had been zero tilled for seven years against annually tilled soils. Zero tilled soils contained 9 % more soil C, 30 % higher microbial biomass C than tilled soil and an increased presence of aromatic functional groups indicating greater preservation of recalcitrant C.

Furthermore, microbial enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, cellulase, xylanase, β-glucosidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase were higher in zero tilled soils.

Suction tubes were installed for soil water collection at the depths 0. 15, 0. 50, and 1. 0 m by pumping soil water with a peristaltic pump. Soil water evaporation was estimated using stable isotopes of water. The mean isotopic composition of the soil water at 0. 15 m soil depth were - 1. 15 parts per thousand (delta O- 18) and - 0. 75 parts per thousand (delta D) and were highly enriched compared with the isotopic compositions of the site precipitation.

Northeast India is characterized by high soil acidity/Al+ 3 toxicity, heavy soil, and carbon loss, severe water scarcity during most parts of year though it is known as high rainfall area. The extent of soil and nutrient transfer, causing environmental degradation in North eastern India, has been estimated to be about 601 million tones of soil, and 685. 8, 99. 8, 511. 1, 22. 6, 14. 0, 57. 1, and 43. 0 thousand tones of N, P, K, Mn, Zn, Ca, and Mg, respectively. Excessive deforestation coupled with shifting cultivation practices have resulted in tremendous soil loss (200 [*]t/ha/yr), poor soil physical health in this region. Studies on soil erodibility characteristics under various land use systems in Northeastern Hill (NEH) Region depicted that shifting cultivation had the highest erosion ratio (12. 46) and soil loss (30. 2 – 170. 2 [*]t/ha/yr), followed by conventional agriculture system (10. 42 and 5. 10 – 68. 20 [*]t/ha/yr, resp.). The challenge before us is to maintain equilibrium between resources and their use to have a stable ecosystem. Agroforestry systems like agri-horti-silvi-pastoral system performed better over shifting cultivation in terms of improvement in soil organic carbon; SOC (44. 8 %), mean weight diameter; MWD (29. 4 %), dispersion ratio (52. 9 %), soil loss (99. 3 %), soil erosion ratio (45. 9 %), and in-situ soil moisture conservation (20. 6 %) under the high rainfall, moderate to steep slopes, and shallow soil depth conditions.

In addition, current agricultural practices such as deep plowing of soil or burning of forest and crop residues favor CO 2 emissions and contribute to global warming. The deforestation rate in SEA is important (0. 91 % per year of the forest area) and soil degradation is important either by erosion or acidity (63 % of the total land area). Conservation agriculture (CA) is an alternative land-use system reconciling economic viability, social balance, soil fertility restoration, and environmental conservation as well as climate change adaptation, which are crucial elements for the long-term improvement of smallholders' living conditions and poverty alleviation. A basket of CA technologies, including <b>zero</b> or reduced <b>tillage,</b> direct seeding, crop rotations, soil cover, and residue management has been developed in different countries. Adoption of CA technologies has regenerated fertility of degraded soils, provided livestock with high-quality forage, and increased soil carbon sequestration.

The International Water Management Institute focusses through various research for development projects on improving irrigation water management, increasing groundwater recharge and assessing the environmental impact of irrigation for various soils throughout the Amhara, Oromia and SNNPR region. Irrigation scheduling tools have been introduced at individual and scheme based small holder farms for the irrigation of high value horticultural and fodder crops to improve water and crop productivity and reduce nutrient leaching. Simultaneously groundwater recharge experiments were carried out using deep tillage and soil & water conservation practices in the rainy season. In these studies, soils are sampled, irrigation quantified, soil moisture measured and standard agronomic practices monitored. Additionally, socio-economic data are being collected on household composition, land holding, labor involved in as well as income generated by the various technologies. Preliminary results showed that crop productivity was not effect while reducing water between 18 - 35 % as function of the prevailing soil types. For the groundwater recharge studies lowest runoff values and highest crop productivity values were observed in the deep tillage plots compared to <b>zero</b> and normal <b>tillage.</b> The socio-economic as well as biophysical data are used in field as well as watershed models to assess the environmental and economic impact of various irrigation scenarios throughout the agro-ecological zones...|$|R
40|$|There {{is little}} {{consensus}} on how agriculture will meet future food demands sustainably. Soils and their biota {{play a crucial}} role by mediating ecosystem services that support agricultural productivity. However, a multitude of site-specific environmental factors and management practices interact to affect the ability of soil biota to perform vital functions, confounding the interpretation of results from experimental approaches. Insights can be gained through models, which integrate the physiological, biological and ecological mechanisms underpinning soil functions. We present a powerful modelling approach for predicting how agricultural management practices (pesticide applications and tillage) affect soil functioning through earthworm populations. By combining energy budgets and individual-based simulation models, and integrating key behavioural and ecological drivers, we accurately predict population responses to pesticide applications in different climatic conditions. We use the model to analyse the ecological consequences of different weed management practices. Our results demonstrate that an important link between agricultural management (herbicide applications and zero, reduced and conventional tillage) and earthworms is the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM). We show how <b>zero</b> and reduced <b>tillage</b> practices can increase crop yields while preserving natural ecosystem functions. This demonstrates how management practices which aim to sustain agricultural productivity should account for their effects on earthworm populations, as their proliferation stimulates agricultural productivity. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that conventional tillage practices have longer term effects on soil biota than pesticide control, if the pesticide has a short dissipation time. The risk of earthworm populations becoming exposed to toxic pesticides will be reduced under dry soil conditions. Similarly, an increase in soil organic matter could increase the recovery rate of earthworm populations. However, effects are not necessarily additive and the impact of different management practices on earthworms depends on their timing and the prevailing environmental conditions. Our model can be used to determine which combinations of crop management practices and climatic conditions pose least overall risk to earthworm populations. Linking our model mechanistically to crop yield models would aid the optimization of crop management systems by exploring the trade-off between different ecosystem services...|$|R

Weed flora in maize crop was mainly composed of Ageratum conyzoides L. (57 and 70 %, at 60 and 90 DAS, respectively), Polygonum alatum L. (19 and 10 %, respectively) and Commelina benghalensis L. (7 and 6 %, respectively), Echinochloa colona (L.) Link, Panicum dichotomiflorum L., Eleusine indica L., Digitaria sanguinalis L. and Cyperus spp. were the other weeds as a whole constituted 17 and 14 %, respectively. Manual seed drill in kharif remaining at par with multi-crop planter resulted in significantly lower count of A. conyzoides and other weeds as compared to <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> (204. 5 m- 2) at 60 DAS. Similarly, manual seed drill in rabi remaining at par with conventional tillage gave significantly lower count of A. conyzoides as compared to <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> and multi-crop planter. <b>Zero</b> <b>tillage</b> in kharif resulted in significantly highest P. alatum L. dry weight (4. 58 g m- 2) at 90 DAS. Weed flora in wheat was composed of Vicia sativa L. (38 and 39 % during 2009 - 10 and 2010 - 11, respectively), Lolium temulentum L.

40|$|An {{aggressive}} {{research and}} validation program launched in 1984 in Azuero, Panama, yielded a recommendation advocating <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> for maize production. Ten years later, maize farmers in Azuero used three land preparation methods: conventional tillage, <b>zero</b> <b>tillage,</b> and minimum tillage (an {{adaptation of the}} <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> technology). This study aimed to quantify the adoption of zero and minimum tillage for maize in Azuero; identify factors influencing adoption of the different land preparation practices; and analyze {{the implications of the}} findings for future maize research and extension. Between 1985 and 1994, farmers in Region I of Azuero changed from conventional tillage to zero (33 %) and minimum tillage (43 %). In Regions II and III, most farmers still practiced conventional tillage in 1994, although 34 % had switched to minimum tillage. Across regions, adoption of conservation tillage was motivated by potential cost savings rather than longer term considerations such as reduced soil erosion. The factors that limit adoption of conservation tillage vary by region. In Region I, adoption of conservation tillage is limited by land rental rather than ownership and by lack of conservation tillage planting equipment. In Regions II and III, lack of information about conservation tillage technology limits the probability of adoption. Future research should examine soil compaction, a key variable for understanding differences between the adoption of minimum and <b>zero</b> <b>tillage.</b> Another area that merits further research is the link between weeds and conservation tillage: several farmers reported using the technology to obtain better weed control. The long-term effects of conservation tillage should also be assessed. Extension in Regions II and III should seek to accelerate adoption of conservation tillage, particularly <b>zero</b> <b>tillage.</b> In Region I, extension should steer the change process from minimum to <b>zero</b> <b>tillage.</b> Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|The book {{introduces}} soil management {{issues and}} is suitable mainly for {{second and third}} year students on degree courses in Environmental Sciences, Geography and Agriculture. While teaching soil management courses, both authors noted that no single book covered all the main aspects of soil management. In the early 21 st century, society faces many problems and challenges associated with soil management, which need practical and sustainable solutions. This book develops an overview of problems of soil management and strategies for their solution. Such a broad remit does not permit detailed reviews. However, each Chapter concludes with references and suggestions for further reading and so provides pathways to more detailed and advanced studies. Chapter 1 reviews the scale and nature of soil management problems. In Chapter 2 patterns and processes of water and wind erosion are examined, along with techniques for soil conservation. Chapter 3 addresses the inter-related problems of desertification and salinization of arid soils. This includes {{a review of the}} extent and severity of the problems and the relative importance of human and natural causes. The issue of the amelioration of arid soils is considered, including the feasibility of desert reclamation and soil desalinization. Optimal use of soil requires careful consideration of soil water and in Chapter 4 soil water management issues are investigated, specifically irrigation, drainage and their environmental consequences. Chapter 5 explores the related problems of chemical pollution of soil, water and the atmosphere. These include agricultural and industrial sources of pollution. The problems posed by nitrate, phosphate, pesticides and pathogenic micro-organisms are also reviewed. Chapter 6 considers the various natural and industrial causes of soil acidification, and the effects of acidification on plant, animal and human health. The Chapter concludes with a review of procedures to combat acidification. Chapter 7 considers the nature of soil structure and how it can be modified. This includes discussion of the benefits and problems of <b>zero</b> and conventional <b>tillage</b> practises. The problems of soil compaction and the reclamation and restoration of quarries, landfill sites and mine-spoil are also considered. Chapter 8 considers the importance of soil organic matter conservation, including the dynamics of organic matter in soils, its loss through agricultural activities and methods of increasing its abundance in soil. The value of crop residues and implications of peat wastage are also considered. Climatic change is currently receiving intense investigation and soils play an important role, as discussed in Chapter 9. Soils affect the global carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide cycles and budgets, and possibilities for managing soils to minimize emissions of these ‘greenhouse’ gases are discussed. However, the history and likely causes of recent and earlier climate change in the past suggest that our future climate may well be influenced in unexpected ways by natural factors as well as by increasing greenhouse gases. The concluding Chapter 10 summarizes the prospects in the 21 st Century, in particular the changing problems and solutions in the face of growing global population and global warming. The effects of urbanization on the extent and quality of soils and suitable techniques for soil reclamation, rehabilitation, restoration and recreation are examined. The Chapter concludes with a consideration of relationships between soils and environmental health and the potential for improved soil management for habitat creation. The soil is a fundamental constituent of the Earth’s system, maintaining a careful state of equilibrium within the biosphere. However, this natural balance is being increasingly disturbed by a variety of anthropogenic and natural processes, leading to the degradation of many soil environments. Soil Management provides a comprehensive and authoritative introduction to the many problems, challenges and potential solutions facing soil management in the twenty-first century. Covering topics such as erosion, desertification, salinization, soil structure, carbon sequestration, acidification and chemical pollution, the book also develops a prognosis for the future of soil management faced with growing populations and global warming. Written with the needs of students in mind, each chapter provides a broad overview of a particular problem, approaches to its solution and concludes with references and suggestions for further reading, so providing a pathway to more detailed and advanced study...|$|R
40|$|The ACIAR-managed project CS 1 / 1996 / 013, Herbicide-resistant weeds {{of wheat}} in India and Australia: {{integrated}} management, {{was designed to}} find a long-term method of control of Phalaris minor, a problem weed of the rice–wheat cropping system of north-western India. By 1993, the weed had developed resistance to isoproturon, a herbicide which had delivered effective weed control for 15 years. The short-term solution, implemented before the ACIAR project commenced, involved identification and registration of {{a new set of}} herbicides. But these new herbicides were expensive. To ensure high adoption they needed to be combined with changes in wheat-growing techniques that would provide cost savings to help farmers pay for them. And to avoid the re-emergence of chemical resistance, they needed to be used sparingly as one element in a broader approach to weed management. The project team used these circumstances to field-test and encourage adoption of <b>zero</b> <b>tillage,</b> a technology that agronomists had been advocating for many years, but which had failed to capture the interest of Indian farmers. <b>Zero</b> <b>tillage</b> has the potential to deliver big cost savings. In addition, it provides prospects for yield increases by allowing early sowing of wheat and avoiding soil degradation. Project research established that <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> also provided effective weed control with only a moderate reliance on chemicals, making the re-emergence of herbicide resistance remote. We calculate a gain to the Indian economy of around $ 1800 million in net present value terms over the next 30 years from the adoption of <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> to control Phalaris minor infestation in the rice–wheat areas of north-western India. This leads to an extremely high ratio of benefits to project costs. <b>Zero</b> <b>tillage</b> by itself is clearly a profitable technology. It does not need a weed problem to justify its introduction. Without the ACIAR project, <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> would have been introduced to the region, though somewhat later than what has occurred. On the assumption that the ACIAR project has advanced the adoption profile of <b>zero</b> <b>tillage</b> by 3 years, we calculate gains that can be attributed to ACIAR’s role of $ 238 million in net present value terms over the next 30 years. This gain has been achieved with total expenditures on the ACIAR-managed project amounting to only $ 1. 3 million in present values. herbicide-resistant weeds, wheat, weed, India, Australia, integrated management, phalaris minor, rice-wheat cropping systems, chemical resistance, weed management, <b>zero</b> <b>tillage,</b> cost saving, net present economy, high benefits, profitable technology, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries, Farm Management, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, International Development, Production Economics,...|$|E

This research, {{carried out in the}} period of 2011 - 2014, had as main purpose the determination of influence of tillage practices and residue management on rainfall use efficiency, maize yield and its stability, in order to evaluate the advantages of conservation agriculture (CA) in the time of stabilization of direct seeding effects, in comparison with traditional chisel tillage. The maize grain yields are presented for each {{crop management}} practices, as follows: (1) chisel tillage, retained crop residues being chopped and incorporated (ciz); (2) <b>zero</b> <b>tillage,</b> retained crop residue chopped and kept on the field in short flat condition (rvt); (3) <b>zero</b> <b>tillage,</b> crop residues kept on the field in short root-anchored condition (1 / 2 rva), and (4) <b>zero</b> <b>tillage,</b> crop residues kept on the field in tall root-anchored condition (1 / 1 rva).
