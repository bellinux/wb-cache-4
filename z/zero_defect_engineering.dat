The dependence of soliton stabilities on modulation depth of the PT potentials is studied.

Dr. Deming stressed the importance of establishing a level of variation, or anomalies, acceptable to the recipient (or customer) in the next phase of a process. Often, some defects are quite acceptable, and efforts to remove all defects would be an excessive waste of time and money. Another criticism leveled at the <b>Zero</b> <b>Defect</b> manufacturing philosophy is the cost inherent with implementing it versus the benefits achieved post-implementation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{customers}} expect <b>zero</b> <b>defects</b> with JIT delivery {{from their}} suppliers of the specified quantities {{as a matter}} of standard practice. More importantly, customers expect us to help them know what they need in terms of quantities and quality now and for the future. No other change process adds long-term value as quickly as <b>zero</b> <b>defects.</b> Companies failing to embrace this quality culture face difficult challenges. To achieve this level of performance requires tremen-dous focus in your organization and throughout its supply base. The four-broad processes and eight steps discussed here will help an organization create a quality culture of <b>zero</b> <b>defects.</b> Introduction. The Global Supply Management team at Delphi is undergoing a lean trans-formation to further enhance competitiveness and to improve supplier relationships. Continu-ous improvement of supplier quality is a key element in lean transformation. Delphi quality control has identified poor supplier quality as a major potential systemic problem. A lean transformation will fail without continued requisite quality from suppliers. In 2002, the Delph...|$|R

[...] Interest in the program from outside firms, including Litton Industries, Thiokol, Westinghouse, and Bendix Corporation, was keen and many made visits to Martin to learn about it. Their feedback was incorporated and rounded out the program. In particular, General Electric suggested that error cause removal be included in the program.|$|R

40|$|The {{foundation}} for any quality {{system must be}} solid and secure. If a company {{does not have a}} strong foundation it will find itself constantly fighting quality issues. Automotive manufacturers have long demanded that their suppliers strive for <b>zero</b> <b>defects</b> in parts that they produce (Industrial Weekly, Oct 2003). The reason is clear: sensors that fail in airbags, brakes and other components can cause loss of life. However, the consumer market has not yet embraced the <b>zero</b> <b>defect</b> concept, but many final users are now demanding that the parts they purchase are free of defects. “Zero Defects ” was originally introduced by Crosby and first used in the automotive industry. One of the major foundations of a <b>Zero</b> <b>Defect</b> program are the 5 ’S” (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, Shitsuke), which has been used in Japan for sometime and recently introduced to the American Semiconductor industry.
