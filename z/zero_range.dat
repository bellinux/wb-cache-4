The result is via a robust argument formulated for a broad class of deposition-type processes.

Methods: The 11 P. aeruginosa strains included were isolated from eyes, contact lenses, lens cases and lens care solutions. Cell surface hydrophobicities were determined from water contact angle measurements and surface charges were measured as a function of pH using particulate micro-electrophoresis. Results: Strains resistant to polyquaternium- 1 had an isoelectric point (IEP; pH where the bacterial zeta potential is <b>zero)</b> <b>ranging</b> from 4. 0 to 5. 5, whereas susceptible strains were more negatively charged than resistant strains and had an IEP between 1. 3 and 1. 9.

40|$|We review {{product form}} {{blocking}} {{measures in the}} general framework of nearest neighbor asymmetric one dimensional misanthrope processes. This class includes exclusion, <b>zero</b> <b>range,</b> bricklayers, and many other models. We characterize the cases when such measures exist in infinite volume, and when finite boundaries need to be added. By looking at inter-particle distances, we extend the construction to some 0 - 1 valued particle systems e. g., q-ASEP and the Katz-Lebowitz-Spohn process, even outside the misanthrope class. Along the way we provide a full ergodic decomposition of the product blocking measure into components that are characterized by a non-trivial conserved quantity. Substituting in simple exclusion and <b>zero</b> <b>range</b> has an interesting consequence: a purely probabilistic proof of the Jacobi triple product, a famous identity that mostly occurs in number theory and the combinatorics of partitions.

40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} to evaluate the influence of polarization filtering on the detection and identification range of a thermal sensor. The scenarios evaluated were based on environmental parameters and ship temperatures recorded during the EOPACE measurement series in San Diego bay in 1996. These scenarios represent a FLIR sensor on a platform in level flight at 100 m or 1000 m approaching a ship target, represented as a gray body at the recorded ship hot-spot temperature. The polarized version of the SEARAD sea radiance code was used to provide sea background radiance and propagation characteristics for both ship target and background. Apparent Temperature Difference was calculated versus range for horizontally polarized and unpolarized imaging. Maximum range was determined for both cases by comparison to a generic Minimum Resolvable Temperature function representing a typical LWIR Common Module FLIR. Preliminary results for the polarized case predict greater apparent temperature difference at ranges to around 10 kilometers. Unresolved apparent anomalies in the computed results suggest that target temperatures are under-estimated. Empirical correction of the <b>zero</b> <b>ranges</b> temperature difference suggests polarized identification range {{of the order of}} 25 to 30 km. Improvements to the modeling are proposed.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the ground-state properties of unpolarized two-component Fermi gas by the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) methods. Using an extrapolation to the <b>zero</b> effective <b>range</b> of the attractive two-particle interaction, we find E/E_ {{free to be}} 0. 212 (2), 0. 407 (2), 0. 409 (3) and 0. 398 (3) for 4, 14, 38 and 66 atoms, respectively. Our {{results indicate that the}} dependence of the total energy on the effective range is sizable and the extrapolation is therefore quite important. In order to test the quality of nodal surfaces and to estimate the impact of the fixed-node approximation we perform released-node DMC calculations for 4 and 14 atoms. Analysis of the released-node and the fixed-node results suggests that the main sources of the fixed-node errors are long-range correlations which are difficult to sample in the released-node approaches due to the fast growth of the bosonic noise. Besides energies, we evaluate the two-body density matrix and the condensate fraction. We find that the condensate fraction for the 66 atom system converges to 0. 56 (1) after the extrapolation to the <b>zero</b> interaction <b>range.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
