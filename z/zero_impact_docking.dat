40|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} to define <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> or near <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> buildings. Most of these are based on measuring performance or on metric benchmarks regarding the quantity or quality of the various resources employed during a building’s life cycle. However, the problem underlying these efforts is that the resources are measured independent of each other, leading to restrictive overall design approaches. Most existing definitions focus on breaking even with a single resource, such as energy, water or materials, during the building’s life cycle. In fact, the building community needs to set a collective definition for what constitutes a <b>zero</b> ecological <b>impact</b> building, conflating all the resources involved. In this paper, we discuss this deficiency and suggest a shift in thinking necessary to define <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> buildings. The resulting definition allows us to examine broader criteria including land management, carbon neutrality, energy neutrality, water efficiency and material neutrality.

Low <b>impact</b> <b>docking</b> {{means that the}} contact forces during mating are greatly reduced {{and as a result}} this alleviates the large loads that the structure is required to withstand and it eliminates the need for impact energy to achieve spacecraft interface alignment and capture. Low impact berthing means that the SCS mating forces are smaller than the IDSS requirement, making it possible to perform berthing within the force limits of the robotic arm on station.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} trials {{to develop a}} {{definition}} for <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> or near <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> buildings.

Most existing definitions focus only on one resource, such as energy, water or materials, during the building life cycle. Thus the building community needs to set a collective definition for buildings with <b>zero</b> ecological <b>impact,</b> conflating all resources. In this paper, we discuss this problem and suggest a necessary shift towards a collective <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> buildings definition.

40|$|In this paper, an {{impedance}} {{control algorithm}} based on velocity for capturing two low <b>impact</b> <b>docking</b> mechanisms (LIDMs) is presented. The main {{idea of this}} algorithm is to track desired forces when the position errors of two LIDMs are random by designing {{the relationship between the}} velocity and contact forces measured by a load sensing ring to achieve low <b>impact</b> <b>docking.</b> In this paper, the governing equation of an impedance controller between the deviation of forces and velocity is derived, and simulations are designed to verify how impedance parameters affect the control characteristics. The performance of the presented control algorithm is validated by using the MATLAB and ADAMS software for capturing simulations. The results of capturing simulations demonstrate that the impedance control algorithm can respond fast and has excellent robustness when the environmental errors are random, and the contact forces and torques satisfy the low impact requirements...|$|R

This specification defines the technical requirements for the iLIDS GFE delivered to the NDSP by the iLIDS project. This document contains requirements for two iLIDS configurations, SEZ 29101800 - 301 and SEZ 29101800 - 302. Requirements with the statement, iLIDS shall, are for all configurations. Examples of requirements that are unique to a single configuration may be identified as iLIDS (- 301) shall or iLIDS (- 302) shall. Furthermore, to allow a requirement to encompass all configurations with an exception, the requirement may be designated as iLIDS (excluding - 302) shall. Verification requirements for the iLIDS project are identified in the Verification Matrix (VM) provided in the iLIDS Verification and Validation Document, JSC- 63966. The following definitions differentiate between requirements and other statements: Shall: This is the only verb used for the binding requirements.

We demonstrate that dynamic wetting {{plays an important}} role in the spreading at low velocity, characterized by the dynamic contact angle at maximum spreading. In the energy balance, we account for the dynamic wettability by introducing the capillary energy at <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> velocity, which relates to the spreading ratio at <b>zero</b> <b>impact</b> velocity. Correcting the measured spreading ratio by the spreading ratio at zero velocity, we find a correct scaling behaviour for low and high impact velocity and, by interpolation between the two, we find a universal scaling curve. The influence of the liquid as well as the nature and roughness of the surface are taken into account properly by rescaling with the spreading ratio at zero velocity, which, as demonstrated, is equivalent to accounting for the dynamic contact angle...|$|R
