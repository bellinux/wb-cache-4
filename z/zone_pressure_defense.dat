5000|$|If a team {{is behind}} in the game, playing a zone is a poor {{strategy}} because zones usually allow the offense to take more time off the clock on each possession, which limits the time remaining for the losing team to reduce the lead. It also reduces the chances of stealing the ball from the attackers and attempting a quick counterstrike across open field. This is not always true; there are <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> <b>defenses</b> that can often cause quicker shots by the opponent or result in turnovers ...|$|R

40|$|The {{responses}} to deglutition {{of the lower}} oesophageal high <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> were studied in 13 healthy subjects. The recording assembly included three perfused pressure recording catheters, whose recording orifices were at the same axial level, and a more distally situated pH electrode. Relaxation and contraction progressed in a sequential fashion {{along the length of}} the high <b>pressure</b> <b>zone.</b> At the time of maximum relaxation, a small pressure gradient, which was greatest at a point approximately 1 cm distal to the pressure inversion point, was maintained between stomach and oesophagus. The frequency of post-deglutitive contractions in the high <b>pressure</b> <b>zone,</b> which were observed to occur distal to the pressure inversion point in all subjects, steadily increased as the recording assembly was withdrawn proximally. The amplitude of such contractions was greater in the high <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> than in the distal oesophagus.

50|$|The {{distribution}} system of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) {{is one of}} the largest in the United States. As of June 2003, DWU provided retail water service to just over 1.2 million people within the Dallas city limits. The major {{distribution system}} facilities include 28 pump stations (including the high service pump stations at the three water treatment plants), 11 ground storage reservoirs, 9 elevated tanks, and 78 vault structures separate from the major facilities, in addition to over 4600 mi of distribution and transmission main. The distribution system is divided into 17 <b>pressure</b> <b>zones</b> to maintain adequate water pressures throughout the system. There are four major <b>pressure</b> <b>zones</b> (Central Low,North High, East High, and South High), and five smaller secondary <b>pressure</b> <b>zones</b> (Meandering Way High, Red Bird High, Trinity Heights, Pleasant Grove, and Cedardale) which comprise most of the Dallas service area. Each of the nine major and secondarypressure zones are supplied by one or more pump stations and have elevated or ground storage facilities that establish the static hydraulic gradient for each zone. The remaining eight <b>pressure</b> <b>zones</b> are supplied from an adjacent <b>pressure</b> <b>zone</b> via <b>pressure</b> reducing valve, or single, small booster pump station.
