5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained Treponema pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the <b>Ziehl–Neelsen</b> stain.|$|E
25|$|If the {{effusion}} {{is caused}} by infection, microbiological culture may yield the infectious organism responsible for the infection, sometimes before other cultures (e.g. blood cultures and sputum cultures) become positive. A Gram stain may give a rough indication of the causative organism. A <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain may identify tuberculosis or other mycobacterial diseases.|$|E
500|$|Acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacteria, are {{resistant}} to decolorisation by acids during staining procedures. The high mycolic acid content of Mycobacteria {{is responsible for the}} staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain or acid-fast stain, in which the acid-fast bacilli are stained bright-red and stand out clearly against a blue background.|$|E
500|$|Using {{histological}} {{stains on}} expectorated samples from phlegm (also called [...] "sputum"), scientists can identify MTB under a [...] microscope. Since MTB retains certain stains even after being treated with acidic solution, it {{is classified as}} an acid-fast bacillus. The most common acid-fast staining techniques are the <b>Ziehl–Neelsen</b> stain and the Kinyoun stain, which dye acid-fast bacilli a bright red that stands out against a blue background. Auramine-rhodamine staining and fluorescence microscopy are also used.|$|E
500|$|The Gram stain, {{developed}} in 1884 by Hans Christian Gram, characterises bacteria {{based on the}} structural characteristics of their cell walls. The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the [...] "gram-positive" [...] cell wall stain purple, while the thin [...] "gram-negative" [...] cell wall appears pink. By combining morphology and Gram-staining, most bacteria can be classified as belonging to one of four groups (gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, gram-negative cocci and gram-negative bacilli). Some organisms are best identified by stains other than the Gram stain, particularly mycobacteria or Nocardia, which show acid-fastness on <b>Ziehl–Neelsen</b> or similar stains. Other organisms {{may need to be}} identified by their growth in special media, or by other techniques, such as serology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Buruli ulcer is usually {{based on the}} characteristic appearance of the ulcer in an endemic area. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, then PCR using the IS2404 target is helpful, {{but this is not}} specific for M. ulcerans. The <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain is only 40–80% sensitive, and culture is 20–60% sensitive. [...] Simultaneous use of multiple methods may be necessary to make the diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Sputum smears and {{cultures}} {{should be done}} for acid-fast bacilli if the patient is producing sputum. [...] The preferred method for this is fluorescence microscopy (auramine-rhodamine staining), which is more sensitive than conventional <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> staining. In cases {{where there is no}} spontaneous sputum production, a sample can be induced, usually by inhalation of a nebulized saline or saline with bronchodilator solution. A comparative study found that inducing three sputum samples is more sensitive than three gastric washings.|$|E

50|$|Mycobacteria are {{classical}} acid-fast organisms. Stains used in {{evaluation of}} tissue specimens or microbiological specimens include Fites stain, <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain, and Kinyoun stain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> {{staining}} is used {{to stain}} species of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.|$|E

50|$|The Kinyoun method, or Kinyoun stain, is an {{acid-fast}} procedure used {{to stain}} any {{species of the}} genus Mycobacterium, Nocardia and Cryptosporidium species. It involves {{the application of a}} primary stain (carbol fuchsin), a decolorizer (acid-alcohol), and a counterstain (methylene blue). Unlike the <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain (Z-N stain), the Kinyoun method of staining does not require heating. In the <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain, heat acts as a physical mordant while phenol (carbol of carbol fuschin) acts as the chemical mordant. Since the Kinyoun stain is a cold method (no heat applied), the concentration of carbol fuschin used is increased.|$|E
50|$|Together with {{microbiologist}} Franz Ziehl, Neelsen {{developed the}} <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain, {{a method for}} the staining of acid-fast bacteria, used to this day in the diagnosis of tuberculosis and to detect {{the presence of other}} mycobacteria.|$|E
50|$|Franz Ziehl {{introduced}} the carbol fuchsin stain for the tubercle bacillus in 1882. With pathologist Friedrich Neelsen (1854-1898), {{he developed the}} <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain, {{also known as the}} acid-fast stain, which is used to identify acid-fast bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Auramine O {{can be used}} {{to stain}} {{acid-fast}} bacteria (e.g. Mycobacterium, where it binds to the mycolic acid in its cell wall) in a way similar to <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain. It can also be used as a fluorescent version of Schiff reagent.|$|E
50|$|Microscopic {{analysis}} {{is an important}} activity of the pathologist and the laboratory assistant. They have many different colourings at their disposal (GRAM, MGG, Grocott, <b>Ziehl-Neelsen,</b> …). Immunofluorescence, cytochemistry, the immunocytochemistry and FISH are also used in order make a correct diagnosis.|$|E
5000|$|If {{tuberculosis}} is possible, examination for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (either a <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> or Kinyoun stain, and mycobacterial cultures) {{should be}} done. A {{polymerase chain reaction}} for tuberculous DNA may be done, or adenosine deaminase or interferon gamma levels may also be checked.|$|E
5000|$|Smears {{from the}} {{necrotic}} base of ulcers stained by the <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> method often reveal clumps of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Appropriately selected biopsy specimens {{that include the}} necrotic base and the undermined edge of lesions with subcutaneous tissue are nearly always diagnostic.|$|E
50|$|Eosinophilia and {{elevated}} IgE levels are chief hematological findings. Also <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain {{can be used}} to differentiate between mature T. saginata and T. solium, in most cases T. saginata will stain while T. solium will not, but the method is not strictly reliable.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{is usually}} {{performed}} by needle aspiration biopsy or excisional biopsy {{of the mass}} and the histological demonstration of stainable acid-fast bacteria {{in the case of}} infection by M. tuberculosis (<b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain), or the culture of NTM using specific growth and staining techniques.|$|E
50|$|New {{fuchsine}} can be {{used for}} staining acid-fast organisms, e.g. by <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain, and for making Schiff's reagent. As a primary amine, the dye can be diazotized in the laboratory, and the resulting diazonium salt used as a trapping agent in enzyme histochemistry.|$|E
50|$|If the {{effusion}} {{is caused}} by infection, microbiological culture may yield the infectious organism responsible for the infection, sometimes before other cultures (e.g. blood cultures and sputum cultures) become positive. A Gram stain may give a rough indication of the causative organism. A <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain may identify tuberculosis or other mycobacterial diseases.|$|E
50|$|In {{solution}} with phenol (also called carbolic acid) as an accentuator it {{is called}} carbol fuchsin and {{is used for the}} <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> and other similar acid-fast staining of the mycobacteria which cause tuberculosis, leprosy etc. Basic fuchsine is widely used in biology to stain the nucleus, and is also a component of Lactofuchsin, used for Lactofuchsin mounting.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain, {{also known}} as the {{acid-fast}} stain, was first described by two German doctors: the bacteriologist Franz Ziehl (1859-1926) and the pathologist Friedrich Neelsen (1854-1898). It is a special bacteriological stain used to identify acid-fast organisms, mainly Mycobacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most important of this group because it is responsible for tuberculosis (TB). Other important Mycobacterium species involved in human disease are Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum and members of the Mycobacterium avium complex. Acid-fast organisms like Mycobacterium contain large amounts of lipid substances within their cell walls called mycolic acids. These acids resist staining by ordinary methods such as a Gram stain. It {{can also be used to}} stain a few other bacteria, such as Nocardia. The reagents used are <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> carbol fuchsin, acid alcohol, and methylene blue. Acid-fast bacilli will be bright red after staining.|$|E
50|$|However, {{diagnosis}} may be difficult. Nocardiae are gram positive weakly acid-fast branching rod-shaped {{bacteria and}} can be visualized by a modified <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain like Fite-Faraco method. In the clinical laboratory, routine cultures may be held for insufficient time to grow nocardiae, and referral to a reference laboratory may be needed for species identification. Infiltration and pleural effusion are usually seen via x-ray.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{component}} of <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain.Carbol fuchsin {{is used as a}} dye to detect acid fast bacteria because it is more soluble in the cells wall lipids than in the acid alcohol. If the bacteria is acid fast the bacteria will retain the initial red color of the dye because they are able to resist the destaining by acid alcohol.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Buruli ulcer is usually {{based on the}} characteristic appearance of the ulcer in an endemic area. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, then PCR using the IS2404 target is helpful, {{but this is not}} specific for M. ulcerans. The <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain is only 40-80% sensitive, and culture is 20-60% sensitive. Simultaneous use of multiple methods may be necessary to make the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|The auramine-rhodamine stain (AR), {{also known}} as the Truant auramine-rhodamine stain, is a {{histological}} technique used to visualize acid-fast bacilli using fluorescence microscopy, notably species in the Mycobacterium genus. Acid-fast organisms display a reddish-yellow fluorescence. Although the auramine-rhodamine stain is not as specific for acid-fast organisms (i.e. Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Nocardia) as the <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain, it is more affordable and more sensitive, therefore it is often utilized as a screening tool.|$|E
50|$|Sputum smear microscopy, {{using the}} <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> {{staining}} technique, is employed {{as the standard}} case-finding tool. Two sputum samples are collected over two days (as spot-morning/morning-spot) from chest symptomatics (patients with presenting {{with a history of}} cough for two weeks or more) to arrive at a diagnosis. In addition to the test's high specificity, the use of two samples ensures that the diagnostic procedure has a high (>99%) test sensitivity as well.|$|E

5000|$|The {{lymph nodes}} of the {{subjects}} were minced and stained according to the <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> technique. Within 12-17 days a culture was produced that could be analyzed on a molecular level [...] "Richter". M. bohemicum contains combinations of α-, keto-, metoxy-, and dicarboxy-mycolates that are not commonly found in slow-growing bacteria3 [...] Other distinct characteristics of M. bohemicum is identifiable by its unique 16S rDNA nucleotide sequence {{as well as its}} variation in the ITS sequence region of 16S-23S.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} on this staining method {{is used in}} mycology to differentially stain acid-fast incrustations in the cuticular hyphae of certain species of fungi in the genus Russula. It is also useful {{in the identification of}} some protozoa, namely Cryptosporidium and Isospora. The <b>Ziehl-Neelsen</b> stain can also hinder diagnosis in the case of paragonimiasis because the eggs in an ovum and parasite sputum sample (OnP) can be dissolved by the stain, and is often used in this clinical setting because signs and symptoms of paragonimiasis closely resemble those of TB.|$|E
