50|$|<b>Zenarestat</b> (FK-366; FR-74366) is an aldose reductase inhibitor. It was {{investigated}} {{as a treatment}} of diabetic neuropathy and cataract, but its development was terminated.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{clarifying}} the {{gender differences in the}} urinary excretion of organic anions and the gene expression of organic anion transporters in rats. The renal clearance with regard to the plasma concentration (CL(urine,p)) of taurocholate, dibromosulfophthalein (DBSP), and <b>zenarestat,</b> all substrates and/or inhibitors of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 (Oatp 1), was much higher in female than in male rats. The following results imply that the transport system(s) for the reabsorption of <b>zenarestat</b> across the luminal side exhibits a gender difference: 1) the renal uptake clearance assessed by an in vivo integration plot analysis of <b>zenarestat</b> from the blood side does not show any clear gender differences; 2) the renal clearance with regard to the kidney concentration (CL(urine,k)) of <b>zenarestat</b> in female rats was approximately 30 times higher than in male rats; and 3) both CL(urine,p) and CL(urine,k) were increased in male rats by the coinfusion of DBSP, which is an inhibitor of organic anion transporters. Northern and Western blot analyses confirmed a previous finding that the gene expression of Oatp 1, which is localized at the apical plasma membrane of the kidney, was much higher in the kidneys of male rats. Overall, a gender difference in urinary excretion is commonly observed for several organic anions, including Oatp 1 substrates and inhibitors, and Oatp 1 and/or transporters that have a similar substrate specificity to Oatp 1 could be involved in such a phenomenon involving its substrates...|$|E
