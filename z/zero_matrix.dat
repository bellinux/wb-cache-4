5|$|The {{polynomial}} pA in an indeterminate X {{given by}} evaluation the determinant det(XIn−A) {{is called the}} characteristic polynomial of A. It is a monic polynomial of degree n. Therefore the polynomial equation pA(λ)=0 has at most n different solutions, that is, eigenvalues of the matrix. They may be complex even if the entries of A are real. According to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, pA(A) = 0, that is, the result of substituting the matrix itself into its own characteristic polynomial yields the <b>zero</b> <b>matrix.</b>|$|E
5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 <b>zero</b> <b>matrix</b> corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E

It is sometimes sufficient to use the matrix equation above {{and the fact that}} Q is a stochastic matrix to solve for Q. Including the fact that the sum of each the rows in P is 1, there are n+1 equations for determining n unknowns, so it is computationally easier if on the one hand one selects one row in Q and substitute each of its elements by one, and on the other one substitute the corresponding element (the one in the same column) in the vector 0, and next left-multiply this latter vector by the inverse of transformed former matrix to find Q.|$|E
