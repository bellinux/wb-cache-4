More than 97. 5 % and 90 % of the nitrate in inflow was removed after 8. 8 and 161 hours at 250 and 195 mg 1 - 1 for the packed-bed reactor and fermentor system, respectively. The nitrate was quickly denitrified at very low flow rates (0. 11 m h- 1) for the packed-bed reactors, but as the flow rate was greater than 0. 13 m 1 - 1, the nitrate removal rate increased as the flow rate increased. In the static fermentor system, the denitrification can be described by a secondary reaction, but at a flow rate between 1. 31 to 1. 49 m h- 1, the reactor performance can be described using the <b>zero-order</b> <b>reaction</b> in the packed-bed reactor.
