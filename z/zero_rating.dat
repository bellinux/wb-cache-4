An additional discretionary relief, of up to 20%, can also be applied for. The <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> relief for unoccupied properties will apply where a property is unoccupied but will, when next occupied, be used wholly or mainly for charitable purposes (or those of a community amateur sports club).|$|E
500|$|During the 2006 Chicago Bears season, Grossman {{became the}} first Bears quarterback to start all sixteen games since Erik Kramer in 1995. [...] In a season dubbed as a [...] "roller coaster ride" [...] by Grossman himself, the fourth-year quarterback had several {{productive}} performances, which were seemingly diluted {{by a handful of}} turnover-ridden games, especially in Week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals, where Grossman fumbled twice and threw four interceptions. While earning a passer rating of at least 100 in seven games, he earned a sub 50 rating in five games during the latter portion of the season. Grossman, who was named as the NFC Offensive Player of the Month in September, concluded the season's final month with a 64.4 passer rating, including a <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> during the season’s finale game against the Packers. [...] Grossman's work ethic drew criticism, when he admitted that he was not adequately prepared to play, and later claimed the game to be [...] "meaningless." [...] After noticing that his words had been misinterpreted, he rationalized his statement days later. His inconsistent performance drew criticism, and calls for Smith to bench Grossman in favor of the veteran Brian Griese.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{goods and}} {{services}} are [...] "zero-rated". The <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> is treated like a positive rate of tax calculated at 0%. Supplies subject to the <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> are still [...] "taxable supplies", that is, they count as having VAT charged on them. In the UK, examples include most food, books, medications, and certain kinds of transport. The <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> is not featured in the EU Sixth Directive as it was intended that the minimum VAT rate throughout Europe would be 5%. However, zero-rating remains in some member states, most notably the UK and Ireland, as a legacy of pre-EU legislation. These member states have been granted a derogation to continue existing zero-rating but cannot add new goods or services.An EU Member State may uplift their domestic <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> to a higher rate, for example to 5% or 20%, however, EU VAT rules do not allow a reversal back to the <b>Zero</b> <b>rate</b> once it has been given up. Interestingly, Member States may institute a reduced rate on a previously <b>zero</b> <b>rated</b> item even where EU law does not provide for a reduced rate, however if a Member State makes an increase from a <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> to the prevalent standard rate, they may not then decrease down to a reduced rate unless specifically provided for in EU VAT Law (Annexe III of EU Dir 2006/112 list sets out where a reduced rate is permissible).|$|R

2500|$|The {{amount of}} {{capsaicin}} in the fruit is highly variable and dependent on genetics and environment, giving almost {{all types of}} Capsicum varied amounts of perceived heat. [...] The most recognizable Capsicum without capsaicin is the bell pepper, a cultivar of Capsicum annuum, which has a <b>zero</b> <b>rating</b> on the Scoville scale. The lack of capsaicin in bell peppers {{is due to a}} recessive gene that eliminates capsaicin and, consequently, the [...] "hot" [...] taste usually associated {{with the rest of the}} Capsicum family. There are also other peppers without capsaicin, mostly within the Capsicum annuum species, such as the cultivars Giant Marconi, Yummy Sweets, Jimmy Nardello, and Italian Frying peppers(also known as the Cubanelle).|$|E

This is problematic because, as it will be shown, unemployment has adverse effects on both individuals and societies. Assuming that the primary aim of economics is to improve people’s lives, it behooves us to find a solution to the problem of unemployment. Two solutions will be offered. The first works within the confines of the capitalist system –it requires instituting welfare policies that alleviate the adverse effects of unemployment. The second involves a paradigm change –it requires replacing capitalism with an alternative economic system that is consistent with a <b>zero</b> <b>rate</b> of unemployment...|$|R
