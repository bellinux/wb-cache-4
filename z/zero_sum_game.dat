40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. In this thesis a new solution concept is developed for n-player, nonzero <b>sum</b> <b>games.</b> The solution concept is based in reinterpreting the n-player nonzero <b>sum</b> <b>game</b> into 2 -player <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> <b>games.</b> The n-player nonzero <b>sum</b> <b>game</b> is first rewritten as an n + 1 player coalition game. The definition of <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> payment is that one player pays the other what he gets in a given outcome (coalition of the n + 1 player game). Who pays whom depends on the coalition. More than one 2 -player <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> interpretation <b>game</b> always results from the procedure, and criteria are established to select one of the <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> interpretation <b>games.</b> The solution concept defines results identical to the minimax concept when applied directly to <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> 2 -player <b>games.</b> When applied to 2 -player prisoner’s dilemma games, the solution procedure assigns mixed strategies to the prisoners, thereby “resolving” the dilemma. The mixed strategies vary with the payoffs (up to a linear transformation). For prisoner’s dilemma matrices which {{have been used in}} large numbers of gaming experiments, the solution concept predicts dynamically, i. e., by play number, the “fraction of cooperative choices” for (approximately) the first 30 plays. In addition, the mixed strategy appears in a game between each subject (prisoner) and the n + 1 st player (district attorney), suggesting that the subjects have been playing against the experimenter. Empirical evidence for this conclusion is given. A theorem is proved for n-player prisoner’s dilemma games. Game theory is reviewed to show the roots of this solution concept in the heuristic use of <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> n-player <b>games</b> in the von Neumann and Morgenstern theory, and in rational decision making models, e. g., “games against Nature. ” The empirical and formal difficulties of the equilibrium point solution concept for nonzero <b>sum</b> <b>games</b> are discussed. Detailed connections between game theory and cybernetics are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A central {{question}} in game theory and artificial intelligence {{is how a}} rational agent should behave in a complex environment, given that it cannot perform unbounded computations.

First we connect this to zero-sum games, proving a counter-intuitive generalization of the classic min-max theorem to zero-sum games {{with the addition of}} strategy costs. We then show that potential games with strategy costs remain potential games. Both zero-sum and potential games with strategy costs maintain a very appealing property: simple learning dynamics converge to equilibrium. bounded rationality, <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> <b>games,</b> potential games, strategic complexity. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{establish}} global convergence {{results for}} stochastic fictitious play for four classes of games: games with an interior ESS, <b>zero</b> <b>sum</b> <b>games,</b> potential games, and supermodular games. We {{do so by}} appealing to techniques from stochastic approximation theory, which relate the limit behavior of a stochastic process to the limit behavior of a differential equation defined by the expected motion of the process. The key result in our analysis of supermodular games is that the relevant differential equation defines a strongly monotone dynamical system. Our analyses of the other cases combine Lyapunov function arguments with a discrete choice theory result: that the choice probabilities generated by any additive random utility model {{can be derived from}} a deterministic model based on payoff perturbations that depend nonlinearly on the vector of choice probabilities.
