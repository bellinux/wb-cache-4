An outer shell of toy vehicle is taken for instance in the experiment. A small distance between the two magnets or large magnetic field intensity provides larger magnetic force and discharge ability. A higher current rating with magnetic-assistance can avoid the difficulty of dreg discharge, thus reducing the finish time. Pulsed direct current can slightly promote the finishing effect, but the machining time is increased. Thus the magnetic-assistance electrochemical finishing without pulsed current is recommended for the finish process. It is a great contribution that the magnetic-assistance electrochemical finishing just needs quite short to make the freeform surface of workpiece smooth and bright...|$|R
