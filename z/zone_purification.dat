40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the steps of}} a two-step <b>zone</b> <b>purification</b> procedure for completed minicells filled with ultrahigh-purity succinonitrile (SCN) in which the CNS is under its own vapor pressure. The solid-liquid equilibrium, as determined by melting and freezing point measurements, is therefore {{considered to be a}} realization of the triple-point. The freezing-point plateaus measured at a variety of bath temperatures demonstrated both the fundamental reproducibility of the measurement for a given sample and the lack of dependence of that measurement on the bath temperature which controls the freezing rate. The measurement reproducibility and the sample consistency indicate that the method described is indeed suitable for the preparation of pure material which can be used for the purposes of thermistor and thermometer calibration at 58. 0796 + or - 0. 0015 C...|$|E
40|$|A {{generalized}} appartus {{was designed}} and developed to measure high temperature-high pressure vapor-liquid-equilibrium (VLE), gas solubility, and pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data for compounds and mixtures which are of interest in coal liquefaction processes. The heart of the apparatus was a novel variable volume equilibrium cell which consisted of a precision positive displacement pump in which the pump's cylinder itself was utilized as the equilibrium cell. V-L-E data on H(, 2) -Tetralin systems were measured at 150 (DEGREES), 189. 6 (DEGREES), and 268. 7 (DEGREES) C. The pressure range was 19. 5 to 321. 43 atm. The solubility of H(, 2) in 2 -ethylanthraquinone was measured at 150 (DEGREES), 200 (DEGREES), and 250 (DEGREES) C and for pressures up to 247. 69 atm. Molar volumes of saturated liquid tetralin were measured from 93. 79 (DEGREES) to 224. 64 (DEGREES) C. Compressibility factors were measured for benzene at 158. 56 (DEGREES), 181. 68 (DEGREES), and 202. 64 (DEGREES) C. The saturated molar volumes at each temperature {{were obtained from the}} intersection of each isotherm with the respective vapor pressure. These values were used along with a literature vapor pressure correlation(' 64) to calculate the enthalpy of vaporization, (DELTA) H(,(V)), of benzene at the three temperatures. The values of (DELTA) H(,(V)) were 137. 4, 127. 3, and 120. 8 Btu/ 1 bm at 158. 56 (DEGREES), 181. 68 (DEGREES), and 202. 64 (DEGREES) C, respectively. The corresponding values calculated by Organic(' 54) were 139, 130, and 120 Btu/ 1 bm. Vapor pressures of the following six compounds were measured on another apparatus designed by Dr. S. C. Hwang of this laboratory: Tetralin, from 82. 29 (DEGREES) to 267. 20 (DEGREES) C; m-cresol, from 114. 98 (DEGREES) to 322. 48 (DEGREES) C; Naphthalene, from 91. 44 (DEGREES) to 295. 01 (DEGREES) C; 2 -methylnaphthalene, from 130. 22 (DEGREES) to 325. 34 (DEGREES) C; Biphenyl, from 71. 43 (DEGREES) to 327. 54 (DEGREES) C; and Quinoline, from 64. 96 (DEGREES) to 328. 14 (DEGREES) C. A <b>zone</b> <b>purification</b> apparatus {{was designed and}} fabricated to purify the compounds used in VLE, PVT, solubility and vapor pressure measurements. The Grayson-Streed(' 31) (GS) and the Modified Regular Solution Theory (MRST) (' 30) were used to predict the VLE data for H(, 2) -Tetralin systems. The predictions from the two correlations were compared with the data obtained in this work. The predictions from Riedel, Frost-Kalkwarf-Thodos and Nieto-Thodos vapor pressure correlations were compared with the experimental data obtained in this work. In general, if the temperature is not close to the triple or the critical points, all these correlations predict vapor pressures within (+OR-) 5 % of the experimental data...|$|E

Studies of purity and stoichiometry were done by Inductively Coupled Plasma and Differential Scanning Calorimetric methods. These results were compared with those obtained from the same starting material through <b>zone</b> melting <b>purification</b> and with previous reports. Palladium contacts were attached to Teflon substrates with areas of 2 cm 2 and lead iodide films 50 to 500 μm in thickness were deposited onto it by sublimation of the purified material at near 390 °C. Deposition conditions such as source state (powder, bulk), source-substrate distance and deposition time were optimized. Front palladium thermal deposition contacts and acrylic encapsulation were done on the radiation penetrating surface and electrical properties such as apparent resistivity and current density were measured.

30|$|Additional file 4 {{showed the}} heavy metal {{contamination}} {{factors in the}} pilot wetland. Generally, in east block, contamination factors for Cr, Cu, and Ni were high in pretreatment zone and factors for Cd and Pb were high in deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone.</b> In west block, contamination factors for Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb were high in pretreatment zone, while factors for Cr, Ni were high in deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone.</b> The four root-channel parts had relatively high contamination factors, but lower than those at the outlets of wetland. Spatial variations of contamination factors in structural units (e.g., high/low water level ditch, plant bed) were investigated to analyze metal accumulation effects in root-channel zones (Table  4). The results reveal differences in contamination factors between the two blocks. In the east block, the contamination factors of Cd, Zn, and Pb in the ditches of the second part were higher {{than those in the}} first part, whereas the contamination factors of Cr, Cu, and Ni exhibited no distinct variance. The contamination factors of Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn exhibited the opposite trend and those of Cd and Pb exhibited no clear variance. The contamination factors of Pb were lower in the plant bed of the second part; the contamination factors of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn exhibited the opposite trend. Moreover, contamination factors in low ditches were often lower than those in high ones.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} on the results of the {{investigation}} of lead iodide material properties. The effectiveness of <b>zone</b> refining <b>purification</b> methods on the material purity is determined by ICP-MS and ICP-OES and correlated to the electrical and physical material properties. We show that this zone refining method is very efficient in removing impurities from lead iodide and we also determine the segregation coefficient for some of these impurities. Triple axis x- ray diffraction (TAD) analysis has been used to determine the crystalline perfection of the lead iodide after applying various cutting, etching, and fabrication methods. The soft lead iodide crystal was found to be damaged when cleaved by a razor blade, but by using a diamond wheel saw, followed by etching, the crystallinity of the material was improved, as observed by TAD. Low temperature photoluminescence also indicates an improvement in the material properties of the purified lead iodide. Electrical properties of lead iodide such as carrier mobility, were calculated based on carrier- phonon scattering. The results for the electrical properties were in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|<b>Zone</b> melting <b>purification</b> {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out on the clathrate, Ba 8 Ga 16 Ge 30. The impurities present have been identified and their approximate concentrations measured. Trace impurities were determined to be approximately 240 parts per million (ppm) in the most impure sample to 17 ppm in the most pure sample. The temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity are reported as a function of sample purity as well as the room-temperature Hall coefficient. Microprobe analysis suggests that the samples are nonstoichiometric with excess Ge relative to Ga, and there are indications of the presence of defects. Single-crystal x- ray investigations as well as synchrotron powder diffraction measurements support the presence of defects, but the x-ray data cannot accurately determine the relative amounts of Ga and Ge. Band-structure calculations in the generalized gradient approximation show that the measured Hall and Seebeck coefficients are consistent with a defect lattice of approximate stoichiometry Ba 8 Ga 14 Ge 31. Although the figure of merit (ZT) is found to be the highest for the purest sample, the dominant contribution to transport is conjectured to arise from deviations from the ideal stoichiometry and not impurities.

30|$|In total, 71 {{sediment}} {{samples from}} ponds/ditches and 16 soil samples from plant beds {{were collected on}} December 7 – 8, 2012 (Figure  1). We assigned sample sites in representative areas of the wetland to obtain information regarding key processes. As the area of pilot wetland was small, boats {{could not be used}} to collect samples. Then sample sites in water lifting and falling zone as well as deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone</b> were not in the middle part but we try our best to collect the most representative samples. The sampling site numbers were assigned as follows. Single “C” before site names indicates sites in the central channel, with C 1 for the inlet and C 2 in sites beside the water pump stations controlling the step-feed process. Similarly, the use of prefix “W” and “E” before site names indicate sites in the west and east blocks, respectively. Two equivalent sedimentary samples from the inlets of the east and west sides were mixed as one; this sample is labeled “Source” (or “A”). According to the hydraulic flow pathways, the first part lies before the pump station and contains pretreatment zone (B) and root-channel zone I (C), whereas the second part includes the water lifting and falling zone (D), root-channel zone II (E), and the deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone</b> (F). The outlets of the wetlands are indicated by “Outlet” (or “G”). Within each zone, we used numbers to label different sites along the water flow pathways. In each root-channel zone, the ditches lead the water deep into the wetland and let the water penetrate through the root-channels under the plant beds. “H” and “L” refer to ditches with high and low water levels, respectively, and “P” indicates sites of soil samples from plant beds.|$|R

30|$|Constructed root channel wetland (CRCW) {{can remove}} {{many types of}} {{pollutants}} and {{plays an important role}} in water pollution control and the ecological rehabilitation of water environments (Wang et al. 2014). However, metals cannot be decomposed; rather, they must be changed morphologically to allow transportation and transformation of their special characteristics (González-Alcaraz et al. 2013; Yeh et al. 2009). When source water first enters the pilot wetland (i.e., in the pretreatment zone), the relatively wide water surface and slow hydraulic flow rates induce primarily the precipitation of TSS and organic matter. Owing to the special configuration of high/low ditches and plant-bed systems, metals can become further enriched in ditches and/or plant beds in root-channel zone I. In the present study, we found metal contents to be relatively low in these previous units, with little deposition in the water lifting and falling zone. The contamination factors of metals in root-channel zone II increased sharply with respect to those in previous zones. Metal deposition in the deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone</b> was much poorer than that in the root-channel zone, although the deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone</b> still promoted effective accumulation of metals owing to its slower hydraulic flow and wider water area. Previous studies have shown that, in constructed wetland, heavy metal contents in sediments typically decline gradually along hydraulic flow pathways (Obarska-Pempkowiak and Klimkowska 1999). Wetlands are believed to select their most favorable evolution direction in accordance with the surrounding environment. In the present study, metal content, contamination factors and RI were found to vary dramatically between five functioning zones, particularly between the two root-channel zones. Specifically, RI was found to first decline and then increase along the water flow pathways, reaching extremely high values in the two root-channel zones in the second part. This definitively proves that root-channel zones may become “hot sites” acting as sinks for heavy metals in this pilot wetland (Wang et al. 2014). Moreover, the results suggest that obvious deposition and accumulation of heavy metals occurred in CRCW, further highlighting the efficiency of this innovative technology for the mitigation of the ecological risk of metals.|$|R
40|$|When {{developing}} a first-generation product, an iterative approach often yields the shortest time-to-market. In order to optimize its performance, however, a fundamental {{understanding of the}} theory governing its operation becomes necessary. This paper details the optimization of the Tata Swach, a consumer water purifier produced for India. The primary objective of the work was to increase flow rate while considering other factors such as cost, manufacturability, and efficacy. A mathematical model of the flow characteristics through the filter was developed. Based on this model, a design tool was created to allow designers to predict flow behavior without prototyping, significantly reducing the necessity of iteration. Sensitivity {{analysis was used to}} identify simple ways to increase flow rate as well as potential weak points in the design. Finally, it was demonstrated that maximum flow rate can be increased by 50 % by increasing the diameter of a flow-restricting feature while simultaneously increasing the length of the active <b>purification</b> <b>zone.</b> This can be accomplished without significantly affecting cost, manufacturability, and efficacy.

30|$|Twelve {{water and}} nine plant samples were {{collected}} on August 3, 2013 for further investigation of metal contents and risk levels {{in the water column}} and plants of the wetland in full flourish. Water samples are indicated by “W” (west wetland) or “E” (east wetland) and numbers, while plant samples are expressed by “P” and numbers. Samples W 1 – 6 and E 1 – 6 represent key sites at the intersections between two functioning zones, i.e., the inlet of the wetland (where the source water feeding the wetland enters the system), outlet of the pretreatment zone, outlet of root-channel zone I, outlet of the water lifting and falling zone, outlet of root-channel zone II, and outlet of the deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone</b> (i.e., the exit of the whole wetland). Water samples for the analysis of metal contents were stored after filtering through 0.45 -μm filter membranes before adding HNO 3. General water samples were stored at cold temperatures after their temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and redox potential (Eh) had been analyzed. All types of emerged aquatic plants present were sampled to provide a representative indication of plant conditions in the wetland; such plant samples were stored in plastic bags after determination of their stem diameter, height, and density from random samples.|$|R
40|$|Ethylene Oxide was ﬁrst {{reported}} in 1859 as being prepared from {{the reaction of}} potassium hydroxide on ethylene chlorohydrins. But nowadays it is mainly prepared by direct oxidation of ethylene with oxygen on silver based catalyst. In its ﬁnal product stream along with ethylene oxide many other impurities like formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, unconverted ethylene, water and other inert gases are also present. So its puriﬁcation consist of many stages which includes stripping zone, scrubbing zone, phase separator, an ethylene oxide <b>puriﬁcation</b> <b>zone</b> and their interconnections. In its scrubbing step ethylene oxide is scrubbed from other impurities with help of excess of water which needs to be removed {{so it can be}} reused for scrubbing purpose as well as to get pure ethylene oxide. For commercial purpose like its use in epoxy paints, as surfactants demands highly pure ethylene oxide having purity of more than 99. 5 %.

30|$|Although the Changshuitang pilot wetland {{has been}} {{operational}} for only 1  year and performed poorly {{compared with the}} Shijiuyang wetland in terms of plant diversity and metal removal rate, it achieved better water quality using a more reasonable design for similar environmental and soil matrix conditions. In particular, its unique design helped enhance removal rates for metals and heavy metals. However, no extremely obvious decline of RI was observed in the pilot wetland, particularly compared with that between the wetland inlet (Site A, source water sediment) and the wetland outlet (Site G, exit of deep <b>purification</b> <b>zone).</b> This {{may be due to}} instability of wetland structure and function, low biodiversity, and the unstable effects of water purification (Saeedreza et al. 2012). The effects of metal accumulation in the pilot wetland’s primary operation (one-year period) were comparatively lower than those in the relatively developed Shijiuyang wetland (four-year period). In addition, it may be important that the hydraulic flow pathways (direct length ca. 200 – 300  m) and hydraulic retention time (ca. 2.3 d) are both relatively small under a hydraulic flow rate of 0.27  m/d. This may be insufficient for thorough interaction between water and sediments/soil (Bilal et al. 2009). Moreover, the very low concentrations of metals (except Zn) in the source river water do not provide a considerable pollution load to the wetland, where the optimum treatment efficiency of such metals may be achieved under conditions in which an allochthonous source input is present. At present, RI in the pilot wetland is far below the threshold value of 150, indicating little environmental damage. Nevertheless, metal contents at the outlet of the pilot wetland remain relatively high owing to the effects of accumulation; this {{can be attributed to the}} internal interweaved “capillary” filtration functions, which can be visualized by considering the whole pilot wetland as the glomerulus of a kidney. Decreases in flow velocity at the restricted exit of the wetland will promote metal deposition accompanied by particulate settling (Bilal et al. 2009; Brix and Arias 2005). Nonetheless, more long-term monitoring data will be required to assess the actual removal of metals and the transformation of metal forms. Moreover, further emphasis should be placed on the effects of long-term operation, accumulation effects, the use of aquatic plants, and the effects of novel CRCW techniques on the removal of metals (especially heavy metals) in future.|$|R
