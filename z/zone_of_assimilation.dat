50|$|Kirikongo is {{an archaeological}} site {{located in the}} Mouhoun Bend region of Burkina Faso. The {{importance}} of Kirikongo and investigations of other sites in the Mouhoun River drainage system is that the system remains relatively unexplored and was inhabited by the ancestors of the Bwa.

The site consists of several mounds that each represented a household.|$|R
40|$|The {{simplest}} {{model for}} the Matachewan-Hearst Dike (MHD) magmas is assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC), presumably occurring {{at the base of}} the crust during underplating. Subduction zone enriched mantle sources are not required. Trace elements suggest that the mantle sources for the MHD were depleted, but possessed a degree of heterogeneity. Rates <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> were approximately 0. 5 (= Ma/Mc); the contaminant mass was less than 20 percent. The contaminant was dominated by tonalites-randodiorites, similar to xenoliths and rocks in the Kapuskasing Structural <b>Zone</b> (KSZ). <b>Assimilation</b> <b>of</b> partial melts of light-rare earth and garnet-bearing basaltic precursors may have produced some the MHD magmas. Apparently, previous underplating-AFC processes had already produced a thick crust. The silicic granitoid assimilant for the MHD magmas was probably produced by earlier processing of underplated mafic crust (4, 5, 10, 21 and 30). Calculations suggest that the derived silicic rocks possess negative Ta and Ti anomalies even though they were not the product of subduction...|$|R
40|$|The Sugar Pine area {{includes}} nine {{square miles}} in northern Madera County, {{on the western}} slope of the Sierra Nevada. Intrusive rocks of the Sierra batholith surround a central roof pendant and associated minor bodies of strongly folded and metamorphosed Paleozoic sediments. The main mass of the intrusive is tonalite, petrogaphically notable for the selective albitization of its potash feldspar. It contains an abundance of diorite and gabbro and many small pegmatite and aplite dikes complete the Jurassic intrusive sequence. The metamorphic rocks are mainly quartzite, with some schist and calcareous beds, the last giving rise to three distinct metamorphic rock types. The margin of the pendant is locally marked by a <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> partial <b>assimilation</b> and reconstitution. Post-Jurrasic fracturing, perhaps involving some displacement, serves as structural control for several springs in the area. Tungsten mineralization is associated with one of two large pegmatites intruding the central pendant. Scheelite occurs disseminated in lenses of tactite, a restricted facies of the metamorphosed calcareous beds. Some tactite lenses carry over one per cent of scheelite, but small total volume of ore makes the exploitation of the deposit impractical...|$|R

40|$|The article {{explores the}} shift in the {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> immigrants who arrived in the United States throughout the 20 th century.
