5000|$|<b>Zilpaterol</b> (<b>zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride; codenamed RU 42173) is a β2 {{adrenergic}} agonist. Under {{its trade}} name, Zilmax, {{it is used}} to increase the size of cattle and the efficiency of feeding them. Zilmax is produced by Intervet, a subsidiary of Merck & Co., and marketed as a [...] "beef-improvement technology". [...] <b>Zilpaterol</b> is typically fed in the last three to six weeks of cattle's lives, with a brief period (three days in the US) before death for withdrawal, which allows the drug to mostly leave the animal's tissues.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zilpaterol</b> has two chiral carbons and {{consequently}} four optical enantiomers. These enantiomers are: (6R,7R)-, (6R,7S)-, (6S,7R)- and (6S,7S)-. RU 42173 corresponds to racemic trans-zilpaterol hydrochloride, {{a mixture of}} the (6R,7R)-(−)- and (6S,7S)-(+)-enantiomers.|$|E
50|$|Beta-adrenergic agonists, or β-agonists, are non-hormonal growth promotants {{that help}} animals put on muscle instead of fat. Ractopamine (brand names include Optaflexx and Paylean) and <b>zilpaterol</b> (brand name Zilmax) {{received}} FDA approval in 1999 and 2003, respectively. They are also approved in Mexico, South Africa, and Canada. 160 countries restrict {{the importation of}} beef which has been raised with β-agonists. Temple Grandin {{was one of the}} first to describe the potential problems with the supplement. Cattle may arrive at the plant with a stiff gait, acting like they have both stiff muscles and sore feet. The problem could be muscle fatigue. Zilpateral enhances the growth of “fast-twitch” fibers, a type of muscle fiber that fatigues more easily. On August 16, 2013 Merck and Co., the makers of Zilmax, suspended the sale of the product in the US and Canada. But problems may exist with all β-agonists supplementation, and not just for animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{family of}} β-agonists {{includes}} β1-, β2-, and β3-agonists such as clenbuterol, ractopamine, cimaterol, <b>zilpaterol</b> and salbutamol. They possess similar chemical structures with different substituent {{groups on the}} phenyl ethanolamines. Due to their significant nutrition redistribution function, β-agonists have been applied in the livestock industry such as pigs and ruminants to reduce carcass fat and increase muscle mass while improving growth rate and feed conversion (Bareille and Faverdin, 1996, Bergen et al., 1989, Byrem et al., 1998, Cardoso and Taveira, 2002, Shook et al., 2009 and Williams et al., 1987). Unfortunately, β-agonists deposited in animal tissues can cause acute poisoning when consumed by humans, particularly in people with symptoms of muscular tremors, cardiac palpitation, nervousness, headache, muscular pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills (Brambilla et al., 2000). Therefore, the use of β-agonists in animal feeds has been banned in many countries such as the EU and China (Mitchell and Dunnavan, 1998 and Prezelj et al., 2003). There are still illicit usages of β-agonists in animal feeds in many countries.|$|E

TitgemeyerTwo {{experiments}} analyzed {{effects of}} zilpaterol-HCl and nitrogen supplementation {{in the form}} of either dried distiller’s grains with solubles (DDGS) or urea fed to steers. In Experiment 1, steers were fed corn-based diets: control (CON; 10. 2 % CP), urea (UREA; 13. 3 % CP), or DDGS (14. 9 % CP). Nitrogen intake differed among treatments (99, 151, and 123 g/d for CON, DDGS, and UREA). Urea-N synthesis tended to be greater for DDGS (118 g/d) than for UREA (86 g/d), which tended to be greater than CON (52 g/d). Urinary urea-N excretion was greater ([italics]P[italics]< 0. 03) for DDGS (35. 1 g/d) and UREA (28. 6 g/d) than for CON (12. 7 g/d). Gut entry of urea-N (GER) was numerically greatest for DDGS (83 g/d), intermediate for UREA (57 g/d), and least for CON (39 g/d). Urea-N returned to the ornithine cycle tended to be greater for DDGS (47 g/d) than for UREA (27 g/d) or CON (16 g/d). The percent of microbial N flow derived from recycled urea-N tended ([italics]P[italics]= 0. 10) to be greater for DDGS (35 %) than for UREA (22 %) or CON (17 %). The percent of urea production captured by ruminal bacteria was greater ([italics]P[italics]< 0. 03) for CON (42 %) than for DDGS (25 %) or UREA (22 %). Experiment 2 diets were identical to those used in Experiment 1. In addition, steers were also fed either 0 or 60 mg/d zilpaterol-HCl. Dietary CP was 9. 6, 12. 4, and 13. 7 % for CON, UREA, and DDGS, respectively. <b>Zilpaterol</b> increased ([italics]P[italics]< 0. 01) total DMI and N intake; however, <b>zilpaterol</b> did not affect urea entry rate ([italics]P[italics]= 0. 80) or GER ([italics]P[italics]= 0. 94).

The 5 treatments were: 1) grass-fed on pasture (Grass); 2) concentrate-fed (C); 3) concentrate-fed and implanted (CI) with a trenbolone acetate/estradiol implant, DE); 4) concentrate-fed and fed <b>zilpaterol</b> beginning on d 38 of the feeding period (CZ); and 5) concentrate-fed, implanted and fed <b>zilpaterol</b> (CIZ). Hot carcass weights and dressing percentages were higher (P < 0. 05) for all concentrate-fed cows than grass-fed cows. The CIZ cows had the largest and grass-fed cows the smallest longissimus muscle (LM) areas. Total subprimal weights were lightest for cuts from the grass-fed cows; and CIZ cows had greater weights than those from C cows. Sensory panelists found LM steaks from C and grass-fed cows were more tender than steaks from CZ and CIZ cows; and steaks from CI cows were more tender than steaks from CIZ cows. However, no tenderness differences were observed among treatments for knuckle (KN) steaks. In another study, carcasses from 31 fed cows and 24 fed steers were used to investigate the effects of aging (7 or 28 d) on LM retail display; aging and enhancement (blade tenderization and enhancement solution injection) on LM tenderness; and aging on enhanced KN, top blade, and top sirloin steaks. Steaks (LM) aged 7 d had less discoloration and were more color stable than steaks aged for 28 d.

No differences were observed between {{any of the four}} treatment groups concerning live feedlot performance. Bulls receiving the S 30 and Zh treatments had lower internal carcass fat distribution compared to C bulls (P < 0. 05). Bulls receiving the S 40 treatment had a lower % fat in the prime rib-cut compared to Zh bulls (P < 0. 05). Carcasses from S 30 bulls had higher pH values 24 hours post mortem compared to carcasses from Zh bulls (P < 0. 01). Meat samples from Zh bulls had higher shear force, which indicates less tender meat, compared to samples from S 40 bulls (P < 0. 05). Change in serum creatinine levels increased only in Zh treated bulls from the start to the end of treatment and may reflect a higher protein turnover in Zh bulls.

Furthermore, saleable yield as a percentage of CSW was increased (P = 0. 03) 1. 18 percentage units when included in the diet for 20 d. Steers fed ZH for 20 d had heavier strip loins (4. 47 vs. 4. 12 kg, P = 0. 02), tenderloins (2. 75 vs. 2. 49 kg, P = 0. 02), and ribeye rolls (5. 74 vs. 5. 30 kg, P = 0. 01) than steers not fed ZH. These advantages are further demonstrated as a percentage of CSW. Strip loins (P = 0. 06), tenderloins (P = 0. 04), and ribeye rolls (P = 0. 04) of ZH-fed steers had a greater percentage of CSW than controls. <b>Zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride also increased the percentage of CSW of the 3 primary components of the round when fed for 20 d. The knuckle was 0. 10 percentage units heavier (P = 0. 11), the top round was 0. 24 percentage units heavier (P = 0. 04), and the bottom round was 0. 22 percentage units heavier (P = 0. 03) in ZH-fed steers when compared with steers not fed ZH. Based on these data, it can be concluded that ZH significantly increased sub-primal cutting weights, yields, and percentage saleable yield of calf-fed Holstein steers when fed for at least 20 d before slaughter. <b>Zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride increased percentage of CSW of subprimal cuts from Holstein steers in the round and to a lesser degree in the loin...|$|E

This paper describes an off-line two-dimensional (2 D) LC-MS method and its integration with software tools for data preprocessing and multivariate statistical analysis. The 2 D LC-MS method was optimized in order to minimize peptide loss prior to sample injection and during the collection step after the first LC dimension, thus minimizing errors from off-column sample handling. The second dimension was run in fully automated mode, injecting onto a nanoscale LC-MS system a series of more than 100 samples, representing fractions collected in the first dimension (8 fractions/sample). As a model study, the method was applied to finding biomarkers for the antiinflammatory properties of <b>zilpaterol,</b> which are coupled to the β 2 -adrenergic receptor. Secreted proteomes from U 937 macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharide in {{the presence or absence of}} propanolol or <b>zilpaterol</b> were analysed.

40|$|Trial one was {{conducted}} at the United States Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) near clay center, NE {{during the summer of}} 2014. The objective of this trial was to measure the effects of supplementing <b>zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride (ZH) for the final 21 days of the finishing period, and shade, on performance, body temperature, respiration rate, and mobility of finishing beef steers. Feeding ZH increased hot carcass weight, dressing percent, longissimus muscle area, and reduce USDA yield grade. Shade did not affect steer performance and did not reduce body temperature. <b>Zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride increased respiration rate when compared to control cattle and had minimal effect on animal mobility. <b>Zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride and shade had little effect on steer body temperature. Trial 2 and 3 were conducted during the summer and fall/winter of 2014 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Agricultural Research and Development Center (ARDC) near mead, NE. The objective of these trials was to assess the effects of environmental conditions on body temperature and blood metabolites across season on finishing steers. Body temperature was correlated to environmental temperature during both trials however the correlations weren’t as strong for the winter trial. Many blood metabolites were correlated to environmental and rumen temperatures suggesting that blood metabolites are affected by environmental conditions. Trial 4 {{was conducted}} at UNL ARDC with the objective to determine the effect of feeding Agrimos (Lallemand Animal Nutrition; Montreal, Canada) and 2. 5 -cm ground wheat straw to finishing steers, during the summer, on body temperature and panting score in addition to performance, and blood metabolites. Hot carcass weight, dressing percent, LM area, and marbling score were not different between treatments. The addition of Agrimos (Lallemand Animal Nutrition; Montreal, Canada) increased steer body temperature with no impact on steer performance. The addition of finely ground wheat straw decreased steer panting score and reduced feed efficiency over both the control and Agrimos fed cattle. Control cattle had greater 12 th rib fat depth and as a result USDA yield grade. Advisor: Galen E. Erickso...|$|E

Crossbred feedlot heifers (n = 33; initial BW 464 +/- 6 kg) were blocked by BW and assigned to 1 of 3 treatments: no GP (CON; n = 11); implant, no <b>zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride (IMP; n = 11); implant and <b>zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride (COMBO; n = 11). Heifers assigned to receive an implant were administered Component TE- 200 on d 0 of the study, and the COMBO group received 8. 3 mg/kg DM of <b>zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride for the final 21 d of feeding with a 3 d withdrawal period. Following harvest, strip loins were collected and fabricated into 4 roasts and aged for 3, 14, 21, or 35 d postmortem. Fiber type was determined by immunohistochemistry. After aging, objective tenderness and collagen solubility were measured. There was a treatment x day of aging (DOA) interaction for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF; P 0. 31). Soluble collagen amount tended to be affected (P = 0. 06) by a treatment x DOA interaction which was due to COMBO muscle having more soluble collagen than the other 2 treatments on d 21 of aging (P < 0. 02). Correlation analysis indicated that type I, IIA, and IIX fiber CSA are positively correlated with WBSF at d 3 and 14 of aging (P < 0. 01), but only type IIX fibers are correlated at d 21 and 35 of aging (P < 0. 03). At these time periods, total and insoluble collagen became positively correlated with WBSF (P < 0. 01). This would indicate that relationship between muscle fiber CSA and WBSF decreases during postmortem aging, while the association between WBSF and collagen characteristics strengthens.

ThomsonThe {{widespread}} use of beta adrenergic agonists in beef cattle production has been adopted by the beef industry {{in recent years to}} improve weight gain and feed efficiency {{at the end of the}} feeding period. During this feeding period, anecdotal reports of increased mortality during the timeframe in which beta agonists were being fed to cattle was also reported, and confirmed in epidemiologic studies. Additionally, adverse animal welfare events at abattoirs in cattle fed beta adrenergic agonists were reported in August 2013. The objectives of this dissertation were to investigate physiologic and management factors that may be associated with adverse effects of the use of beta adrenergic agonists in cattle. Two studies were conducted, one to establish normal Holter monitor registration values and evaluate the electrocardiographic effects of <b>zilpaterol</b> and ractopamine hydrochloride on finishing steers, and one to develop a model to investigate the physiologic effects of forced exercises in finished cattle, which was hypothesized to be a possible factor in reported adverse cattle welfare events in August 2013. Thirty steers were enrolled to evaluate the effect of ractopamine, <b>zilpaterol</b> or negative control on arrythmia and mean heart rate at 4 different time periods during a 28 day feeding period. Cattle fed ractopamine and <b>zilpaterol</b> had increased heart rate (P < 0. 05) but no differences in arrythmia rates were found. Forty steers were enrolled in a study at a commercial feeding facility to develop a model for fatigue in cattle forced to run 1, 540 m compared to control cattle walked 1, 540 m. Blood lactate, cortisol, rectal temperature, heart rate was increased (P < 0. 05), blood pH decreased (P < 0. 01) and to have reduced locomotion, as measured by pedometers, during the 48 hour period following handling compared to controls. Additionally cattle that were fatter and forced to run had increased lactate (P = 0. 057) and lower blood pH (P < 0. 01) than thinner cohorts.

Crossbred heifers (n = 20; 556 ± 7 kg BW) were randomized into two treatment groups: 1) Control (CON) : no ZH, and 2) <b>Zilpaterol</b> (ZIL) : supplemented with ZH at 8. 33 mg / kg (DM basis). The ZIL group was supplemented ZH for 20 d, with a 3 -d withdrawal period. On d 24, heifers received an intravenous bolus of CRH (0. 3 µg / kg BW) and VP (1. 0 µg / kg BW). Blood samples were collected at 30 - and 60 -min intervals for serum, and 60 -min intervals for plasma and whole blood, from - 2 to 8 h relative to the challenge. Heifers were harvested to collect organ weights and histology samples on d 25, 26, and 27. There was a treatment (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) effect for vaginal temperature (VT), with ZIL having a 0. 1 °C decrease in VT. A treatment x time effect (P = 0. 002) was observed for non-esterified fatty acid such that concentrations were increased in CON heifers at 4, 6, 7, 7. 5, and 8 hrs. There was a treatment effect for cortisol (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and epinephrine (P = 0. 003) with ZIL having decreased concentrations. Glucose concentrations within the longissimus muscle were greater (P = 0. 03) in CON heifers. Lactate concentrations and glycolytic potential within the biceps femoris were greater in CON heifers (P = 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of different <b>zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride (ZH) levels and feeding methods on the growth performance and carcass traits of Japanese quails. In this trial, 224 male quails with 34 days of age were distributed into seven treatments. A factorial arrangement with three ZH levels (0. 2, 0. 225, and 0. 25 mg zilpaterol/kg of live weight− 1) × two feeding methods (ZH supplementation daily or every two days) plus a control treatment (no ZH supplementation) was applied. The weight gain of birds fed ZH every two days was significantly higher than those fed ZH daily during the period of 41 - 47 days (p= 0. 03). During the period of 34 - 40 days, ZH-supplemented birds presented higher weight gain (p< 0. 001) and better feed conversion ratio (p= 0. 005) compared with the control group. Moisture, protein, ash, and cholesterol levels of the combination of breast and leg were not affected (p≥ 0. 10) by <b>zilpaterol</b> supplementation. Leg muscle fat and protein contents of control birds were higher and lower compared with ZH-supplemented birds, respectively (p= 0. 002 and p= 0. 05).

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the ‘omics’ techniques (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) and systems biology, has caused fundamental changes in the drug discovery process and many other fields in the life science area. In this thesis we explored the possibilities to apply these holistic technologies to investigate the effects of known and potential anti-inflammatory compounds on macrophages. For this purpose we made use of a monocyte-like human histocytic lymphoma cell line U 937. U 937 cells can be induced by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) to undergo differentiation into a macrophage-like phenotype. The two differentiation stages, monocyte and macrophage, were compared by using oligonucleotide microarrays and 2 -D gel electrophoresis in combination with principal component analysis (PCA). This differentiation study is described in Chapter 2. The differential expression of three protein biomarkers, gamma interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT), cathepsin D and adipocyte-fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) were biologically validated by Western blot and real time polymerase chain reaction (real time PCR). GILT and A-FABP were also found to be differentially expressed at the mRNA level {{as indicated by the}} results of the microarray experiment. Moreover, the transcriptomics data revealed a large number of additional putative differentiation markers in U 937 macrophages, many of which are known to be expressed in peripheral blood-derived macrophages. From the results presented in Chapter 2 can be concluded that the U 937 cell line is an excellent model system for the blood-derived macrophage and that microarrays and 2 -D gel electrophoresis are suitable methods to identify biomarkers for differentiation. Chapter 3 describes the use of a systems biology approach to categorize anti-inflammatory drugs based on their mRNA, protein and lipid expression pattern, as determined by oligonucleotide microarrays, 2 -D gel electrophoresis and a LC-MS method for lipids, in combination with principal component discriminant analysis (PC-DA). The results described in this chapter demonstrate that different classes of anti-inflammatory compounds show distinct and characteristic mRNA, protein, and lipid expression patterns, which can be used to categorize known anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as to discover and classify new leads. The latter was exemplified by the categorization of <b>zilpaterol,</b> a poorly characterized -agonist. Exposure to <b>zilpaterol</b> gives rise to an almost identical expression pattern as that observed after exposure to the well-characterized  2 -agonists clenbuterol and salbutamol, suggesting that <b>zilpaterol</b> is indeed a -agonist. In addition, this study revealed potential biomarkers for the different anti-inflammatory drugs under investigation. The categorization of the anti-inflammatory drugs on the basis of proteomics data alone was not successful. The most likely explanation for this is that by the analysis of whole cell lysates, only highly abundant proteins can be visualized, while the low abundant proteins, which are often involved in important metabolic pathways, are not. Therefore, a more focused approach was used to investigate the mechanism of action of <b>zilpaterol,</b> which is described in Chapter 4. In Chapter 4, U 937 macrophages were stimulated with LPS to induce an inflammatory response. This response was inhibited by the addition of <b>zilpaterol</b> (LZ) and this inhibition was antagonized by the β 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (LZP). Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) in combination with Student’s t-test and two multivariate data analysis tools (PCA and partial least squares discriminant analysis PLS-DA) were used to examine the secreted proteome induced by the three treatments. This revealed 8 potential protein biomarkers. The protein spots were identified using nano LC-MS-MS. Only two of the identified proteins, namely macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β (MIP- 1 β) and macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α (MIP- 1 α) are known to be secreted proteins. The inhibition of MIP- 1 β by <b>zilpaterol</b> and the involvement of the β 2 -AR and cyclic adenosine- 3 ’, 5 ’-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) were confirmed using a specific immuno-assay. The experiments described in this chapter demonstrate the importance of pre-fractionation of complex protein samples before performing proteomics studies. The categorization of <b>zilpaterol</b> in Chapter 3 as a β 2 -adrenegic receptor agonist was further explored in Chapter 5. In this chapter we investigated the binding affinity of <b>zilpaterol</b> to the β 1 - and β 2 receptor by using a receptor binding assay. Furthermore, we examined the role of the β 1 - and β 2 adrenoceptor in the inhibition of the LPS induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) production and the induction of cAMP by U 937 macrophages. For this purpose we made use of a selective β 1 -receptor antagonist (atenolol), a selective β 2 -antagonist (ICI 118551) and a non-selective β-antagonist (propranolol). Finally, the inhibitory effect of <b>zilpaterol</b> on the TNF-α production was investigated in LPS-treated male Wistar rats. The results obtained in this way clearly show that <b>zilpaterol</b> is a β 2 -adrenergic agonist and a inhibitor of the LPS-induced TNF-α production by macrophages both in vivo and in vitro. The three β 2 -agonists specific biomarkers, Granulocyte Chemotactic Protein- 2 (GCP- 2 /CXCL 6), Oncostatin M (OSM), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) that were identified in Chapter 3, were further examined in Chapter 6. The three markers were significantly up-regulated both in U 937 macrophages and in blood-derived macrophages exposed to a β 2 -agonist (clenbuterol and <b>zilpaterol)</b> in the absence or presence of LPS, as determined by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Moreover, this up-regulation was also accomplished by other cyclic AMP elevating agents (forskolin, prostaglandins E 2, and dibutyryl cAMP), suggesting a role of cAMP in the up-regulation of GCP- 2 /CXCL 6, VEGF and OSM. We hypothesize that these proteins may be involved in some of the adverse effects in the treatment of asthma with β 2 -adrenergic receptor agonists. In the second part of this thesis we focussed on a multi-component drug, namely Cannabis sativa. In Chapter 7, the immuno-modulating effects of unheated and heated Cannabis extracts were investigated. This study revealed that unheated Cannabis extracts and its major non-psychoactive compound Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa) were able to inhibit the LPS induced TNF-α production both in U 937 macrophages and in blood-derived macrophages. The inhibitory effect on TNF-α was not mediated by the cannabinoid receptors CB 1 and CB 2. Furthermore, this study showed that unheated Cannabis extracts and THCa exert their inhibitory effect on the TNF-α production via a mechanism that is different from that of heated Cannabis extract and its main constituent the psychoactive compound Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The inhibition of TNF-α release by unheated Cannabis extract and THCa was prolonged over a relatively long period of time. By contrast, although THC and heated extracts initially inhibit the release of TNF-α, after longer incubation times they seem to increase TNF-α production to levels that are even higher than in the absence of THC or Cannabis extract. This difference in response of the U 937 macrophages to THC and THCa was also observed in an experiment in which we examined the effects on phosphatidylcholine specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) activity. Unheated Cannabis extract and THCa inhibited the PC-PLC activity in a dose-dependent manner, while THC induced PC-PLC activity at high concentrations. Finally, we studied the effect of THCa and unheated Cannabis extract in a pilot study using an Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. Unheated Cannabis extract and THCa had a favourable effect on the clinical and histological signs of EAE. However, these results are preliminary and not clearly significant, therefore further investigation is necessary. Chapter 8 describes the categorization of unheated and heated Cannabis extracts using the same model system as described in Chapter 3. The mRNA patterns obtained from U 937 macrophages exposed to LPS in the absence or presence of different anti-inflammatory drugs and unheated and heated Cannabis extracts were analysed using PC-DA. The study revealed that heated and unheated Cannabis extracts give rise to different expression patterns, which is in agreement with the observations made in Chapter 7 that they exert their TNF-α inhibitory effect via different pathways. Moreover, their expression patterns did not overlap with that of other classes of anti-inflammatory compounds known to inhibit the TNF-α production. These results suggest that the Cannabis extracts can not be assigned to one of the above mentioned classes of inflammatory inhibitors. Further investigation is necessary to unravel the exact mechanism of action of unheated and heated Cannabis extracts. In conclusion, the studies in this thesis show that the application of systems biology approaches are very useful in the categorization of anti-inflammatory compounds based on their mRNA and lipid expression patterns and to find specific biomarkers for these compounds. The categorization based on the protein expression pattern was less successful. This is most probably due to the fraction of proteins that was analysed on the gel. With proteomics techniques {{only a small fraction of}} proteins can be analysed simultaneously. Pre-fractionation, enrichment techniques and different analytical methods are therefore necessary to analyse a wide range of proteins with diverse physiological properties and dynamic range. The datasets obtained by transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics were analysed using statistical and pattern recognition tools. The datasets often contained a limited number of samples with respect to the large number of variables. It is therefore important to use these techniques as an explorative tool only and to validate the potential biomarkers found by additional individual measurements. Taken together, the use of systems biology for the investigation of anti-inflammatory drugs yielded very promising results, even though only a small part of the systems biology circle was used.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted using forty-one Bonsmara steers (age ± 7 months) {{to determine the}} effect of <b>zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride (ZH) on the growth performance and carcass characteristics. The trial was structured using a completely randomized design with two treatments, control and ZH group. The steers were fed ZH for 28 consecutive days {{at the end of the}} finishing period and ZH was withdrawn from the diet 2 days prior to slaughter of the animals. The steers were placed in individual pens and weighed fortnightly throughout the 4 months trial. <b>Zilpaterol</b> hydrochloride (ZH) was included in the diet at a rate of 8. 3 mg/kg of DM. Feeding of ZH increased (P 0. 05) in daily dry matter intakes (DMI). For the control group, high treatment weight gains were significantly associated with high initial weight (r = 0. 424, P = 0. 049) and also high pre-treatment body weight (r = 0. 678, P= 0. 001). Treatment weight gain increased as the initial and pre-treatment weight gain increased in the control group. For the steers that were fed ZH, there was no significant correlation between the treatment body weight gain with initial weight (r = 0. 097, P = 0. 694) and also pre- treatment live weight (r = 0. 393, P = 0. 096). Supplementation of ZH significantly increased (P 0. 05) effect on the carcass weight. The outcome of the study suggest that supplementation of ZH in the diet during the last month of the finishing period enhances growth performance and shows the repartitioning capacity of the feed additive as a beta- agonist.
