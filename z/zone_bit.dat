25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording – increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E
25|$|Because the sectors have {{constant}} angular size, the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more {{near the}} disk's center. A more space-efficient technique {{would be to}} increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk, from 18 to 30 for instance, thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector; an example is <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording. Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400 KB of storage per side and an extra 160 KB on a double-sided disk. This higher capacity came with a disadvantage: the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry, meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers. Apple eventually reverted to constant angular velocity on HD floppy disks with their later machines, still unique to Apple as they supported the older variable-speed formats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{factor of}} 306 {{cylinders}} (rather than 256 or 512, {{both of which}} are powers of two) in the calculation causes the capacity to be not conveniently close to a power of 1024; operating systems and programs using the customary binary prefixes show this as [...] "9.5625MB". Many later drives in the personal computer market used 17 sectors per track; still later, <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording was introduced, causing the number of sectors per track to vary from the outer track to the inner. Nor are drives required to have a number of active surfaces that is a power of, or even divisible by, two; drives with e.g. three active surfaces are not uncommon. All of these factors reduce the utility of the customary binary prefixes for expressing drive capacity.|$|E
50|$|The time <b>zone</b> <b>bits</b> can be {{considered}} a binary-coded representation of the UTC offset. Z1 set indicates UTC+2, while Z2 indicates UTC+1.|$|R

50|$|Each {{alphanumeric}} {{character in the}} 1401 was encoded by six bits, called B,A,8,4,2,1. The B,A <b>bits</b> were called <b>zone</b> <b>bits</b> and the 8,4,2,1 bits were called numeric bits, terms taken from the IBM 80 column punched card.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} storage, <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording (ZBR) is {{a method}} used by disk drives to store more sectors per track on outer tracks than on inner tracks. It is different from zoned constant angular velocity (Zone CAV, Z-CAV, or ZCAV).|$|E
50|$|A {{consequence}} of <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording is that contiguous reads and writes are noticeably faster on outer tracks (corresponding to lower block addresses) than on inner tracks, as more bits pass under {{the head with}} each rotation; this difference can be 25% or more.|$|E
50|$|The {{disk drive}} uses group coded {{recording}} (GCR) and contains a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, doubling as a disk controller and on-board {{disk operating system}} processor. The number of sectors per track varies from 17 to 21 (an early implementation of <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording). The drive's built-in disk operating system is CBM DOS 2.6.|$|E
5000|$|A three {{character}} {{memory address}} in an instruction was an encoding of a five digit memory address. The three low order digits {{of the five}} digit address, 000 to 999, were specified by the numeric bits of the three characters. The <b>zone</b> <b>bits</b> of the high-order character specified an increment as follows: A 1000, B 2000, B and A together 3000, giving an addressability of 4,000 memory locations. The <b>zone</b> <b>bits</b> of the low-order character specified increments of 4000, 8000, or 12000, to address 16,000 memory locations (with an IBM 1406 Storage Unit). For example, the three character address [...] "I99" [...] was a reference to memory location 3000 + 999, or 3999.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{character}} was 6 bits plus 1 odd parity bit ("R") {{composed of two}} <b>zone</b> <b>bits</b> ("X" [...] and [...] "O") and remaining four binary bits {{for the value of}} the digit in the following format: X O 8 4 2 1 R ...|$|R
5000|$|Zoned decimal {{numbers are}} stored as 1-16 8-bit bytes, each {{containing}} a <b>zone</b> in <b>bits</b> 0-3 and a digit in <b>bits</b> 4-7. The <b>zone</b> of the rightmost byte is {{interpreted as a}} sign.|$|R
50|$|This more {{efficient}} GCR scheme, {{combined with an}} approach at constant bit-density recording by gradually increasing the clock rate (zone constant angular velocity, ZCAV) and storing more physical sectors on the outer tracks than on the inner ones (<b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording, ZBR), enabled Commodore to fit 170 kB on a standard single-sided single-density 5.25-inch floppy, where Apple fit 140 kB (with 6-and-2 encoding) or 114 kB (with 5-and-3 encoding) and an FM-encoded floppy held only 88 kB.|$|E
50|$|CHS {{addressing}} is {{the process}} of identifying individual sectors on a disk by their position in a track, where the track is determined by the head and cylinder numbers. The terms are explained bottom up, for disk addressing the sector is the smallest unit. Disk controllers can introduce address translations to map logical to physical positions, e.g., <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording stores fewer sectors in shorter (inner) tracks, physical disk formats are not necessarily cylindrical, and sector numbers in a track can be skewed.|$|E
50|$|All {{three models}} utilize 5¼-inch double density floppy disks with a track spacing of 100 tracks-per-inch, {{for a total}} of 77 logical tracks per side. Data is encoded using Commodore's {{proprietary}} group coded recording scheme. Soft sectoring is used for track alignment. Like most other Commodore disk drives, these drives utilize <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording to maintain an average bit density across the entire disk. Formatted capacity is approximately 0.5 megabyte per side, or 1 megabyte (1,066,496 bytes) in 4166 blocks total.|$|E

5000|$|The Group Coded Recording (GCR) {{scheme of}} binary {{encoding}} {{is used to}} store data on the magnetic disk medium. The drive also uses variable bit-clock to enable increased data density on a standard single-density floppy disk. It {{is a form of}} constant bit-density recording done by gradually increasing the clock rate (zone constant angular velocity, ZCAV) and storing more physical sectors on the outer tracks than on the inner ones (<b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording, ZBR). Starting with the Commodore 2040 drive, this enabled Commodore to fit 170 kB on a standard single-sided single-density 5.25" [...] floppy.|$|E
50|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm.

To remedy this, Conner produced {{a limited number of}} dual-actuator drives (internally called [...] "Chinook") for high-throughput applications. These drives used the SCSI interface and had two independently controlled (by the embedded microprocessor) servo and read/write systems, and two complete sets of read/write heads. The drive firmware enabled it to dynamically reorder commands and assign them to a specific read/write system for optimum execution time, and perform read-write-verify and read-exclusive or-write operations twice as fast as comparable single-actuator systems.|$|E

50|$|If {{a sector}} {{is defined as}} the {{intersection}} between a radius and a track, {{as was the case with}} early hard drives and most floppy disks, the sectors towards the outside of the disk are physically longer than those nearer the spindle. Because each sector still contains the same number of bytes, the outer sectors have lower bit density than the inner ones, which is an inefficient use of the magnetic surface. The solution is <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording, wherein the disk is divided into zones, each encompassing a small number of contiguous tracks. Each zone is then divided into sectors such that each sector has a similar physical size. Because outer zones have a greater circumference than inner zones, they are allocated more sectors. This is known as zoned bit rate.|$|E
50|$|ATA/IDE drives {{were much}} more {{efficient}} at storing data and have replaced the now archaic MFM and RLL drives. They use <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording (ZBR), where the number of sectors dividing each track varies with the location of groups of tracks {{on the surface of}} the platter. Tracks nearer to the edge of the platter contain more blocks of data than tracks close to the spindle, because there is more physical space within a given track near the edge of the platter. Thus, the CHS addressing scheme cannot correspond directly with the physical geometry of such drives, due to the varying number of sectors per track for different regions on a platter. Because of this, many drives still have a surplus of sectors (less than 1 cylinder in size) at the end of the drive, since the total number of sectors rarely, if ever, ends on a cylinder boundary.|$|E
50|$|Because the sectors have {{constant}} angular size, the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more {{near the}} disk's center. A more space-efficient technique {{would be to}} increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk, from 18 to 30 for instance, thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector; an example is <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording. Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400 KB of storage per side and an extra 160 KB on a double-sided disk. This higher capacity came with a disadvantage: the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry, meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers.

40|$|There {{have been}} various secure routing {{protocols}} proposed for mobile ad hoc networks. Most of these protocols are analyzed by two standard techniques: simulation and security analysis. There {{has been a}} lack of work related {{to the performance of}} secure routing protocols in real network testbed. In this paper, we present quantitative results for the performance comparisons between AODV and SAODV routing protocols by using a small-scale experimental testbed, which consists of 10 laptops within a 250 m by 100 m rugby field. Apart from outdoor testing, we also compare the results with those obtained via simulation and indoor emulation. The workload includes both UDP and TCP traffic. Results show that SAODV is effective in preventing routing message tampering and data dropping attacks. For outdoor experiments, we also estimate the average distance within a communication gray <b>zone</b> under different <b>bit</b> rates...|$|R
30|$|One {{critical}} {{problem with}} this technique is that the sample has a bond layer, which changes the stress-strain fields nearby the interface when the sample is subjected to indentation at the interface. The Hertzian theory {{can no longer be}} applied to analyzing the stress-strain field in this case. Helbawi et al. [45] found that the maximum stress position shifted away from the bonded-interfaces in both finite element simulation and indentation experiments. In consequence, the maximum subsurface damage depth was away from the bonded-interfaces and was larger than the measured damage depth. However, the damage <b>zone</b> observed with <b>BIT</b> was with a higher damage density than that induced in the practical machining processes. The findings from Helbawi et al. [45] verified the limitation in BIT. Therefore, BIT cannot provide precise information on subsurface damage induced in the practical machining processes, and should not thus be recommended for quantitative detection of SSD in hard and brittle materials.|$|R
50|$|Commodore {{started its}} {{tradition}} of special disk formats with the 5¼-inch disk drives accompanying its PET/CBM, VIC-20 and Commodore 64 home computers, {{the same as}} the 1540 and 1541 drives used with the later two machines. The standard Commodore Group Coded Recording (GCR) scheme used in 1541 and compatibles employed four different data rates depending upon track position (see <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording). Tracks 1 to 17 had 21 sectors, 18 to 24 had 19, 25 to 30 had 18, and 31 to 35 had 17, for a disk capacity of 170.75 KB (175 decimal kB). Unique among personal computer architectures, the operating system on the computer itself is unaware of the details of the disk and filesystem; disk operations are handled by Commodore DOS instead, which was implemented with an extra MOS-6502 processor on the disk drive. Many programs such as GEOS bypass Commodore's DOS completely, and replace it with fast-loading (for the time) programs in the 1541 drive.|$|E
50|$|The LBA scheme replaces earlier schemes which {{exposed the}} {{physical}} {{details of the}} storage device to the software of the operating system. Chief among these was the cylinder-head-sector (CHS) scheme, where blocks were addressed {{by means of a}} tuple which defined the cylinder, head, and sector at which they appeared on the hard disk. CHS did not map well to devices other than hard disks (such as tapes and networked storage), and was generally not used for them. CHS was used in early MFM and RLL drives, and both it and its successor, extended cylinder-head-sector (ECHS), were used in the first ATA drives. However, current disk drives use <b>zone</b> <b>bit</b> recording, where the number of sectors per track depends on the track number. Even though the disk drive will report some CHS values as sectors per track (SPT) and heads per cylinder (HPC), they {{have little to do with}} the disk drive's true geometry.|$|E
