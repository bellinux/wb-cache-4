During annealing the precursor at 500 degrees C in a SnSe + Se atmosphere most of the Cu 2 -xSe is transformed to Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 via the consumption of excessive ZnSe and incorporation of Sn. However, atom probe tomography studies also reveal the formation of various nanometer-sized Cu-Sn-Se particles close to the CdS/Cu(2) ZnSnSe 4 interface.

40|$|Abstract—Transmission over {{wireless}} fading channels under {{quality of}} service (QoS) constraints is studied when only the receiver has channel side information. Being unaware of the channel conditions, transmitter is assumed to send the infor-mation at a fixed rate. Under these assumptions, a two-state (ON-OFF) transmission model is adopted, where information is transmitted reliably at a fixed rate in the ON state while no reliable transmission occurs in the OFF state. QoS limitations are imposed as constraints on buffer violation probabilities, and effective capacity formulation is used to identify the maximum throughput that a wireless channel can sustain while satisfying statistical QoS constraints. Energy efficiency is investigated by obtaining the bit energy required at <b>zero</b> spectral <b>efficiency</b> and the wideband slope in both wideband and low-power regimes assuming that the receiver has perfect channel side information (CSI). Initially, the wideband regime with multipath sparsity is investigated, and the minimum bit energy and wideband slope expressions are found. It is shown that the minimum bit energy requirements increase as the QoS constraints become more stringent. Subsequently, the low-power regime, which is also equivalent to the wideband regime with rich multipath fading, is analyzed. In this case, bit energy requirements are quantified through the expressions of bit energy required at <b>zero</b> spectral <b>efficiency</b> and wideband slope. It is shown for a certain class of fading distributions that the bit energy required at <b>zero</b> spectral <b>efficiency</b> is indeed the minimum bit energy for reliable communications. Moreover, it is proven that this minimum bit energy is attained in all cases regardless of the strictness of the QoS limitations.

While the approach in Abrevaya (1999) is -consistent, it is not applicable when censoring is present. For the case with fixed censoring, existing approaches such as those of Manski (1987) and Abrevaya (2000) apply, but their estimators converge at rates slower than, thus possessing <b>zero</b> <b>efficiency</b> compared with -consistent estimators. While the approaches by Honoré (1992) and Ridder and Tunali (1999) do produce -consistent estimators under fixed and independent censoring respectively, they require either the error distribution or the transformation function to be completely known. Our -consistent estimator for the fixed censoring case could be extended to the cases with independent and dependent censoring. Under dependent censoring, in contrast to our method, the existing approaches (e. g., Horowitz and Lee (2003), Lee (2008) and Das and Ying (2005)) require parametric specification for the transformation function or the error distribution.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of phonon contribution, a weakly coupled single orbital noninteracting quantum dot {{thermoelectric}} setup is known to operate reversibly as a Carnot engine. This reversible operation, however, occurs only in the ideal case of vanishing coupling to the contacts, wherein the transmission function is delta shaped, and under open-circuit conditions, where no electrical power is extracted. In this paper, we delve into the thermoelectric performance of quantum dot systems by analyzing the power output and efficiency directly evaluated from the nonequilibrium electric and energy currents across them. In the case of interacting quantum dots, the onequilibrium currents {{in the limit of}} weak coupling to the contacts are evaluated using the Pauli master equation approach. The following fundamental aspects of the thermoelectric operation of a quantum dot setup are discussed in detail: (a) With a finite coupling to the contacts, a thermoelectric setup always operates irreversibly under open-circuit conditions, with a <b>zero</b> <b>efficiency.</b> (b) Operation at a peak efficiency close to the Carnot value is possible under a finite power operation. In the noninteracting single orbital case, the peak efficiency approaches the Carnot value as the coupling to the contacts becomes smaller.

Based on a multi-region partial equilibrium framework of marginal carbon abatement cost curves, we find that U. S. withdrawal considerably alters the environmental and economic implications of FSU market power in permit trade. Under U. S. compliance, monopolistic permit by FSU has no impact on environmental effectiveness as compared to a competitive trading system. Aggregate emissions of Annex-B regions fall by 10 % below business-as-usual emission levels. Excess costs of market power amount to 40 % of total compliance costs under competitive permit markets. Under U. S. withdrawal, monopolistic permit supply on behalf of the Former Soviet Union will assure some environmental effects of the Kyoto Protocol, with aggregate Annex-B emissions (including U.

40|$|We {{develop a}} two {{dimensional}} model that simulates {{the response of}} the crust to prolonged mantle-derived intrusions in arc environments. The domain includes the entire crustal section and upper mantle and focuses on the evolving thermal structure due to intrusions and external tectonic forcing. We monitor the thermal response, melt fraction and volume for different environments after a definite time by considering geologically relevant melt flux and extensional tectonic rates. The amount of crustal melt versus fractionated primary mantle melts present in the crustal column helps determine crustal structure and growth through time. We observe that with a geophysically estimated flux and tectonic rate, the mantle-derived magma bodies can melt the surrounding volume of crust. We express the amount of crustal melting in terms of an efficiency; therefore we define the melting efficiency as the ratio of the melted volume of crustal material to the volume of melt expected from a strict enthalpy balance as explained by Dufek and Bergantz (2005). Melting efficiencies are less than 1. 0 in real systems because heat diffuses to sections of the crust that never melt. The maximum calculated efficiency is 0. 05 in our model while most of our simulations show <b>zero</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Additionally, maximum total melt amount is observed in relatively greater extensional environments (0. 02 m/yr) and high intrusion rates (10 ⁻² m³/m²/yr) and in long time periods (2 x 10 ⁶ years). However, maximum crustal melting in the same environment is reached in 1. 2 x 10 ⁶ years. The relative amounts of mantle-derived and crustal melts in the total volume of magma suggest that the majority of magma composition in crustal column is derived from the mantle material.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} solar cell technologies which aim at producing electricity from sunlight cheap and/or efficient. As the efficiency of silicon cells is slowly but continuously climbing, price plummeting, and production skyrocketing, there is in my opinion little room for other technologies unless they can beat silicon on efficiency. Commercial cells at over 20 % efficiency are available and lab cells have been reported at above 27 %. Comparing this to the theoretical maximum efficiency of a single junction cell which is just above 30 % shows {{that we are able}} to produce close-to-perfect silicon cells. Any technology which wants to beat this has to aim at an efficiency higher than 30 %. There are not per today many potential candidates for this. One aspect that often seems to be overlooked is what exactly 20 % efficiency means for a solar cell. For regular off-the-shelf silicon cells, this efficiency is a combination of <b>zero</b> <b>efficiency</b> at > 1100 nm, more than 70 % in the 700 – 1000 nm range and steadily decreasing efficiency towards the UV. That means that if we could convert all the solar energy to 1000 nm light, the efficiency of solar cells would be drastically increased without changing the cell itself. Unfortunately {{we do not know how}} we would do this today, but we know a few steps on the way there. Down and up conversion aims at splitting one UV photon into two lower energy photons and merging two low energy photons into one medium energy one, respectively. This would in theory double the solar cells efficiency in the UV range and enable the cell to utilize the > 1100 nm light. This work is part of work package 4 New materials for next generation solar cells (WP 4) in The Norwegian Research Centre for Solar Cell Technology (FME-Sol). The objective of this thesis is to build competence in the field of light conversion and to attempt at making an efficient down conversion film material by atomic layer deposition (ALD). This has resulted in four papers, two which are yet to be published. In addition, a significant part of the work has been devoted to popularization of science through lectures to non-scientific audiences. The potential down conversion materials that exists in the literature usually depends on the interaction between several different types of atoms and often with the host material itself as the UV absorbing material. As ALD grows the film one sub-monolayer at a time, it can give some quite unique control over the atomic distribution throughout the film. It is relatively easy to switch between several different cation cycles at will through the deposition which enables mixing of atoms that would separate or form precipitates under other conditions in addition to the ability to have some control of the nextneighbor distribution around each type of atom. Europium titanium oxides were chosen as the model system for this investigation. This system has the characteristic luminescence of Eu 3 + and strong UV absorption of TiO 2. Both binary oxides are relatively easy to synthesize by ALD. Thin films of both Eu 3 + doped anatase and amorphous EuxTiyOz was deposited, while crystalline Eu 2 Ti 2 O 7 was obtained through annealing. In addition to homogeneous mixing, sandwich structures of separated Eu 2 O 3 and TiO 2 layers were deposited. Thus, this system provides a good opportunity to investigate the relationship between the luminescence of the material and the concentration, local symmetry and interatomic arrangement and distances. The final stage of this thesis was to attempt to make a down conversion material by replacing Eu 3 + with Yb 3 +/Ln 3 +. These lanthanide pairs have been reported in literature to split one high energy excited state into two lower energy excited states. In this work, energy transfer and luminescence was observed, but efficient down conversion was unfortunately not obtained. However, ALD was shown to enable some control of the arrangement of the cations which could lead to down conversion in other material systems which are not easily obtainable by other routes...|$|E
