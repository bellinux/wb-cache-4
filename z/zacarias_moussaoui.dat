5|$|In May, Jarrah {{received}} a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, arriving in Florida in June 2000. There, he began taking flying lessons {{as well as}} training in hand-to-hand combat. Jarrah maintained contact with his girlfriend in Germany and {{with his family in}} Lebanon in the months preceding the attacks. This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, and al-Qaeda planners may have considered another operative, <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui,</b> to replace him if he backed out.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Ross and his investigative unit {{reported}} on Mohamed Atta and {{described him as}} the ringleader of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. He also {{reported on}} <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui’s</b> alleged role in the attacks and his questioning by the FBI prior to September 11.|$|R
40|$|Probable {{cause is}} {{generally}} cast in judicial opinions and the scholarly literature as a fixed probability of criminal activity. In {{the weeks before}} the September 11 attacks, FBI headquarters, applying such an unbending standard, rejected a warrant application to search <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui’s</b> laptop computer. This article, which begins with {{an analysis of the}} Moussaoui episode, argues that the probable cause standard should be calibrated to the gravity of the investigated offense and the intrusiveness of a proposed search. Tracing the evolution of probable cause from the common law through its American development, the article argues that the Supreme Court’s current insistence on a “single standard” lacks historical support. Probable cause should be recast within a reasonableness framework, embracing the common sense view that not all searches equally trench on privacy concerns and not all crimes equally threaten the social order...|$|R
50|$|According to his brother, Abd Samad <b>Moussaoui,</b> <b>Zacarias</b> {{loved to}} play {{handball}}:For Zacarias brother {{wrote in the}} Guardian, handball quickly became more than a sport—it was his passion. He was brilliant. Everyone recognized it—his trainers, his team-mates, even his opponents. For Zacarias, the future was all mapped out. He would study and play sports.|$|R
25|$|On July 31, 2006, the 1,202 {{exhibits}} presented {{during the}} case of United States v. <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> were posted online, marking {{the first time the}} exhibits of a criminal case in US courts were so published.|$|E
25|$|The {{facility}} {{is best known}} for housing inmates who have been deemed too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. These include the leaders of violent gangs who had continued to issue orders to their members from lower-security facilities: Larry Hoover of the Gangster Disciples, and Barry Mills and Tyler Bingham of the Aryan Brotherhood. ADX also houses foreign terrorists, including <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui,</b> the only person convicted in civilian court of the September 11 attacks; Faisal Shahzad, the perpetrator of the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt; and Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; as well as domestic terrorists, such as Ted Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph. Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, was housed at ADX before he was sentenced to death in 1997 and transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, which houses most federal death row inmates and is where Federal death sentences are carried out. McVeigh's co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, is serving 161 life sentences at ADX. Robert Hanssen, the former FBI agent who betrayed several spies to the Soviet Union and Russia, is serving 15 life sentences at ADX for his crimes. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombings, was transferred here from another prison in the Florence complex on July 17, 2015. The prison also houses inmates who are a high escape risk, including Richard McNair, who escaped from a county jail and two other prisons before being sent to ADX.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Substitution for Testimony of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed" [...] {{from the}} trial of <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui,</b> five people are {{identified}} as having been completely aware of the operation's details. They are bin Laden, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Abu Turab al-Urduni, and Mohammed Atef. To date, only peripheral figures have been tried or convicted for the attacks.|$|E
500|$|In mid-August, one Minnesota flight school {{alerted the}} FBI to <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui,</b> who had asked [...] "suspicious questions." [...] The FBI {{found that he}} was a radical who had {{traveled}} to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his French visa. Their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters {{due to the lack of}} probable cause.|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{also found}} a knife {{concealed}} in a cigarette lighter. They located the flight data recorder on September 13 and the cockpit voice recorder the following day. The voice recorder was found buried [...] below the crater. The FBI initially refused to release the voice recording, rejecting requests by Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher and family members of those on board. The FBI subsequently allowed the relatives of the Flight93 victims {{to listen to the}} recording in a closed session on April 18, 2002. Jurors for the <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> trial heard the tape as part of the proceedings and the transcript was publicly released on April 12, 2006.|$|E
500|$|In France, {{as many as}} [...] "80% {{percent of}} the Islamist extremists have come from Tablighi ranks, {{prompting}} French intelligence officers to call Tablighi Jamaat the 'antechamber of fundamentalism.'" [...] Among {{those who have been}} members of TJ in France are <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> (the only person to be charged in the United States in the September 11 attacks), Hervé Djamel Loiseau, a young Frenchman who died fleeing the 2001 American bombardment of Tora Bora in Afghanistan, and Djamel Beghal, an Algerian-born Frenchman and admitted member of Al Qaeda who was convicted in 2005 of plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris. In a foiled January 2008 bombing plot in Barcelona, Spain, [...] "some media reports" [...] stated that a Muslim leader in the city stated that the fourteen suspects arrested by police in a series of raids (where bomb-making materials were seized) were members of Tablighi Jamaat.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> {{was in jail}} in Minnesota {{when the}} September 11 attacks unfolded. On December 11, 2001, Moussaoui was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on six federal charges: {{conspiracy}} to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to murder United States employees, and conspiracy to destroy property. The indictment of <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> named as unindicted co-conspirators Ramzi Bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, among others, for their role in the attack [...] "to murder thousands of innocent people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eagan {{was also}} infamously visited by the [...] "20th hijacker" [...] of the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui,</b> {{prior to the}} attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. [...] Moussaoui attempted to complete flight training school, but was ultimately refused service by local resident Tim Nelson.|$|E
2500|$|A court {{affidavit}} {{filed on}} 3 February 2015 claims that <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> {{served as a}} courier between Osama bin Laden and Turki bin Faisal Al Saud in the late 1990s, and that Turki introduced Moussaoui to Bandar. <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> stated on oath and wrote to Judge George B. Daniels that Saudi royal family members, including Prince Bandar, donated to Al-Qaeda and helped finance the 11 September attacks. [...] The Saudi government continues to deny any involvement in the 9/11 plot, and claims {{there is no evidence}} to support Moussaoui's allegations in spite of numerous previous intense investigations, noting that Moussaoui's own lawyers presented evidence of his mental incompetence during his trial. Leaked information from the redacted portion of the 9/11 Commission Report states that two of the 9/11 hijackers received $130,000 in payment from Bandar's checking account.|$|E
2500|$|At Moussaoui's {{sentencing}} trial, FBI agent Greg Jones {{testified that}} prior to the attacks, he urged his supervisor, Michael Maltbie, [...] "to prevent <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> from flying a plane into the World Trade Center." [...] Maltbie had refused to act on 70 requests from another agent, Harry Samit, to obtain a warrant to search Moussaoui's computer.|$|E
2500|$|... "According {{to court}} {{transcripts}} and evidence from United States v. <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui,</b> the detainee was {{closely associated with}} three of the hijackers responsible for the [...] "9/11" [...] attacks, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah, while they lived in Hamburg during the late 1990s and early 2000. The detainee, Atta and Shehhi {{are known to have}} lived at or frequented on particular address during the same time period, 54 Marienstrasse, Hamburg, Germany 21073.|$|E
2500|$|After training, {{he would}} have moved to a safehouse in Karachi, Pakistan before {{travelling}} to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). From the UAE, the muscle hijackers came to the U.S. between April and June 2001. Waleed may have arrived in the U.S. on 23 April 2001. Some sources report that Shehri [...] "at times" [...] stayed at lead hijacker Mohamed Atta's apartment in Hamburg, Germany at some period between 1998 and 2001. Others place him with <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> in London.|$|E
2500|$|Hinrichs' roommate met Hinrichs when {{he placed}} an {{advertisement}} online for a roommate, and Hinrichs responded. The two did not socialize, and although Hinrichs showed {{the remains of}} detonated explosive devices {{to at least one}} fraternity brother, the roommate was unaware of Hinrichs' interest in explosives. [...] There was already speculation among some bloggers and pundits that Hinrichs was a Muslim, but the news of a Pakistani roommate ignited louder rumors that Hinrichs was an Islamic convert who attended the same Norman mosque <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> previously attended. Ashraf Hussein, the president of OU's Muslim Student Association, said he had never seen Hinrichs at a mosque and that he did not believe Hinrichs was Muslim. As many as eight people, Hakim Mansouri (OU student), Djamal Rabli (OU student) and others including OU Arabic language instructor Hossam Barakat, were detained by the Norman Police Department {{in the early morning hours}} of October 2 for questioning. They were again questioned the next day, after which they were cleared of suspicion.|$|E
2500|$|The mosque made {{international}} headlines when it {{was reported}} that Richard Reid, the so-called [...] "shoe bomber", had attended the mosque. Abdul Haqq Baker, chairman of Brixton Mosque, told the BBC that Reid came to the mosque to learn about Islam but soon fell in with what he called [...] "more extreme elements". <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui,</b> who was convicted of conspiring to kill citizens of the USA as part of 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks, made his initial steps into radical indoctrination in Brixton Mosque, where he met Reid, though he was expelled from the mosque after he turned up wearing combat fatigues and a backpack, and pressured the cleric to give him information on joining the jihad. Abdullah el-Faisal, a radical Muslim cleric who preached in the UK until imprisoned for stirring up hatred and later deported to Jamaica in 2007, was associated with the Brixton Mosque and began preaching to crowds of up to 500 people, but was ousted [...] by its Salafi administration in 1993. Afterward, he gave a lecture he called The Devil's Deception of the Saudi Salafis, scorning the Salafi Muslims (especially the members of the Brixton Mosque), calling them hypocrites and apostates (takfir).|$|E
2500|$|During the Spain meetings, Atta and bin al-Shibh had {{coordinated the}} details of the attacks. The 9/11 Commission {{obtained}} details about the meeting, based on interrogations of bin al-Shibh in the weeks after his arrest in September 2002. Bin al-Shibh explained that he passed along instructions from Osama bin Laden, including his desire for the attacks to be carried out as soon as possible. Bin Laden was concerned about having so many operatives in the United States. Atta confirmed that all the muscle hijackers had arrived in the United States, without any problems, but said that he needed five to six more weeks to work out details. Bin Laden also asked that other operatives not be informed of the specific data until the last minute. During the meeting, Atta and bin al-Shibh also decided on the targets to be hit, ruling out a strike on a nuclear plant. Bin al-Shibh passed along bin Laden's list of targets; bin Laden wanted the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center to be attacked, as they were deemed [...] "symbols of America." [...] If any of the hijackers could not reach their intended targets, Atta said, they were to crash the plane. They also discussed the personal difficulties Atta was having with fellow hijacker Ziad Jarrah. Bin al-Shibh was worried that Jarrah might even abandon the plan. The 9/11 Commission Report speculated that the now-convicted terrorist conspirator <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> was being trained as a possible replacement for Jarrah.|$|E
2500|$|Coulter {{also cited}} the 2002 Senate {{testimony}} of FBI whistleblower Coleen Rowley, who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors {{for refusing to}} authorize a search warrant for 9-11 conspirator <b>Zacarias</b> <b>Moussaoui</b> when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They {{knew that he was}} a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the French Intelligence Service had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that probable cause existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa should not constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in Afghanistan, and that 48 percent said they would fight for Osama bin Laden she asserted [...] "any Muslim who has attended a mosque in Europe—certainly in England, where Moussaoui lived—has had 'affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups,'" [...] so that she parsed Rowley's position as meaning that [...] "'probable cause' existed to search Moussaoui's computer because he was a Muslim who had lived in England." [...] Coulter says the poll was [...] "by the [...] "Daily Telegraph", actually it was by Sunrise, an [...] "Asian" [...] (i.e., Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. Because [...] "FBI headquarters ... refused to engage in racial profiling," [...] they failed to uncover the 9-11 plot, Coulter asserted. [...] "The FBI allowed thousands of Americans to be slaughtered on the altar of political correctness. What more do liberals want?" ...|$|E
