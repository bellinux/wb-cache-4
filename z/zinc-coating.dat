40|$|Abstract. The {{thickness}} of <b>zinc-coating</b> thickness was a parameter of significant importance on steel transmission towers. When the zinc-coating’s thickness {{does not meet}} the required standard, the tower’s steel members were easily to be corroded. However most current detection methods focusing only on the total {{thickness of}} steel coatings, and the thickness of <b>zinc-coating</b> can hardly be measured by existing methods. This paper presents the experimental analysis of different methods of zinc-coating’s thickness ’ measurement. Comparison was conducted and the most accurate and practical measuring method was proposed...|$|E
40|$|Abrasive {{blasting}} {{is one of}} {{the methods}} of surface working before hot-dip <b>zinc-coating.</b> It allows not only to remove products of corrosion from the surface, but it also affects the quality of the zinc coating applied later, thereby affecting wettability of surface being zinc-coated. The surface working can be done with different types of abrasive material...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh-performance {{magnetic}} powders of the Sm- 2 (Fe 0. 9 Co 0. 1) (17) N- 2. 9 compound {{were prepared}} by bail milling in an organic solution containing {{surface active agent}} (Aerosol OT). The subsequent <b>zinc-coating</b> process allows the powders to be stabilized against oxidation by O- 2 or H 2 O. The above two steps were optimized by investigating the powder particle size (i. e. milling time) dependence {{and the influence of}} zinc content on the treatment efficiency, in order to obtain powerful magnets...|$|E
40|$|Because of {{suitability}} for hot-dip <b>zinc-coating,</b> {{there is}} some concern about the use low silicon (Si) content in normalized or normalizing rolling S 355 J 2 +N structural steel with minimum specified yield strength of 355 MPa. However, decreasing Si content leads to a decrease of solid solution hardening, whereas decrease in strength should be compensated by alternative mechanism. One possible solution {{is the use of}} microalloying with niobium (Nb). Based on available results obtained on own and competitive material, we projected and produced S 355 J 2 +N hot-rolled coils (HRC). The results show that the produced material fully satisfies the requirements of the EN 10025 - 2 / 2004 quality standard. Furthermore, strength values in normalized conditions were lower than those in normalizing rolling condition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Experiments were {{conducted}} {{over a large}} process parameter space using a 2 kW multi-mode fiber laser, {{and the effect of}} <b>zinc-coating</b> on the keyhole geometry was investigated using a high-speed coaxial video camera. From the top and bottom coaxial surface images of erratic keyhole motions that were obtained from separately conducted experiments, time-averaged keyhole structures were calculated using a physics-based semi-statistical frame analysis. For uncoated steel, the keyhole bottom aperture is located mostly within the laser beam area. In this case, because there is no zinc evaporation, the bottom aperture tends to be closed to absorb enough laser energy for sustaining a keyhole. For zinc-coated steel, the keyhole is mostly open at the bottom, and the front keyhole wall is tilted so that the laser beam is located on the front keyhole wall. The keyhole tilting angle is more important for zinc-coated steel and the beam interaction area is more relevant to uncoated steel. &# 169; 2015 Elsevier B. V. close 0...|$|E
40|$|This JRC-Scientific and Technical Report gives {{information}} from pre-normative research for methods to prevent liquid metal assisted cracking of prefabricated structural components during <b>zinc-coating</b> in the liquid zinc melt, that may impair the structural safety of structures {{in which the}} components are built in. This information provides a platform upon which further European design and product specifications can be developed. It may in particular affect the further developments of EN 1993, EN 1090, EN ISO 1461 and EN ISO 14713. This report gives the state-of-the-art in understanding the mechanism of liquid metal assisted cracking in the zinc bath and methods and models {{that may be used}} to avoid it. It could be a basis to propose rules for the design of steel components intended to be hot-dip-zinc-coated {{in such a way that}} the design is consistent with execution rules for hot-dip-zinc-coating. The workability of the rules proposed for all metal works and steel works that are fabricated under EN 1090 and galvanized according to the rules in this report is demonstrated by worked examples.

40|$|Wetting steel {{surfaces}} {{with liquid}} aluminum {{without the use}} of flux can be enabled by the presence of a <b>zinc-coating.</b> The mechanisms behind this effect are not yet fully understood. Research results on single aluminum droplets falling on commercial galvanized steel substrates revealed the good wetting capability of zinc coatings independently from the coating type. The final wetting angle and length are apparently linked to the time where zinc is liquefied during its contact with the overheated aluminum melt. This led to the assumption that the interaction is basically a fluid dynamic effect of liquid aluminum getting locally alloyed by zinc. A numerical model was developed to describe the transient behavior of droplet movement and mixing with the liquefied zinc layer to understand the spreading dynamics. The simulations reveal a displacement of the molten zinc after the impact of the droplet, which ultimately leads to an accumulation of zinc in the outer weld toe after solidification. The simulation approach neglects the effect of evaporating zinc, resulting in a slight overestimation of the final droplet width. However, in terms of spreading initiation during the first milliseconds, the simulation is in good correlation with experimental observations and demonstrates the reason for the good wetting in the presence of zinc coatings...|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of electrolytic <b>zinc-coating</b> on mild steel in seawater was investigated. Mild steel samples were zinc electroplated at voltage varied (0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 5 V) and for plating time also varied (20, 30, 40, 50, 60 minutes). Focused ion-beam {{scanning electron microscopy}} was used to observe the surface morphology of the plated surface. The visual observation of plated samples revealed that samples plated at 0. 6 V for 20 and 60 minutes; 0. 8 V for 30 minutes and 1. 0 V for 40 minutes showed the best physical properties such as colour, brightness, fineness, streak and strong adhesion. The plated samples were then subjected to seawater environment for 30 days. The electropotentials mV (SCE) was measured daily. Weight loss was determined at intervals of five days {{for the duration of}} the exposure period. Experimental result showed little corrosion attack on the zinc-plated samples on the fifteenth and twenty-fifth day’s exposure. The severity of attack decreases with increasing weight of zinc coated on substrate. Significant increases in the {{corrosion resistance}} were achieved for the plated samples compared with that of the substrate. The pH of the seawater became more alkaline at the end of the thirty days test...|$|E
