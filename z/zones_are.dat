5|$|The {{keys are}} a {{transitional}} area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland.

Gulls and terns include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring-billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> closed during breeding season.|$|E

5|$|Overall, high {{temperature}} {{is the most}} common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted riparian zones. Approximately 53percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or deforestation, while 43percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> invasive blackberries, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.|$|E

These vehicles are often multi-purpose, and can be fitted with other equipment such as brushes, lawnmowers or cranes—as these operations are generally unable to run during heavy snowfalls, there is generally little overlap between the different uses, reducing {{the size of the}} fleet required by the agency or contractor.|$|E

30|$|The {{maximum height}} of the caving <b>zone</b> <b>was</b> 9.0  m, which was 7.5 times of the mining height. The rock blocks in the caving <b>zone</b> <b>were</b> irregularly shaped. The height of mining-induced {{fractures}} was from 8.0 to 30  m, 7.5 – 25 times of the mining height. The bed separation fractures in the lower fracture <b>zone</b> <b>were</b> obvious.

The height of the lateral fractures was 20 – 25 times of the mining height. The bending <b>zone</b> <b>was</b> above the fracture zone. The height of the bending <b>zone</b> <b>was</b> more than 25 times of the mining height. The rock strata movement in bending <b>zone</b> <b>was</b> observed to be continuous.

5|$|The Andes are {{a site of}} {{volcanic}} activity, which is usually subdivided into four separate volcanic zones: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone and the Austral Volcanic Zone.

These gaps are not static; the gap separating the Austral and the Southern Volcanic Zones has been moving northward for the past 15-20 million years.|$|E
5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when {{they are exposed to}} ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is divided}} into three {{horizontal}} sections, and architects considered the rivers and other natural characteristics of the St. Louis area when designing the park. The northern limestone wall represents the Mississippi River bluffs, while the southern snaking meander wall stands is inspired by the region's waterways. Between the two <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> the rain gardens, larger trees, and larger sculptures, an area that meant to represent a floodplain. The main paths of the park were plotted to match the locations of alleyways that park designers saw in a 1916 Sanborn map.|$|E

5|$|According to a {{study by}} Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, {{children}} in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and extra fingers and toes. In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the breast milk of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam.

5|$|Architecture in Croatia {{reflects}} {{influences of}} bordering nations.

5|$|Lanthanum-140 has a short {{half-life}} of some 41 hours, {{and is not}} {{a threat}} after a fairly short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas.

The creek is a tributary of Pantano Wash, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two washes form the Rillito River, another dry wash, an east–west tributary of the Santa Cruz River. The washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods. Smaller riparian <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> found near springs and tinajas in the RMD. The largest of the springs is at Manning Camp, high in the Rincons.|$|E

5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
5|$|Fallout 3 {{takes place}} in the year 2277, and within the region that covers most of the ruined city of Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia, and parts of Maryland.

50|$|The Landsat-MSS {{is one of}} {{the most}} common used tools.

This <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> commonly measured at a 50% snow composition value. The Final <b>zone</b> <b>is</b> snow-free (=aper). The combined reading of these three measurements creates a relatively accurate estimate for the amount of snow within the scanned region. Several detrimental variables for this technique are cloud cover, extreme sunlight and heavy vegetation.|$|R
