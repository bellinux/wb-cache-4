5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch,</b> is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch,</b> is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{generally}} {{similar to that}} of Oryzomys couesi, as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, was small and narrow. The bony palate extended beyond the third molars. The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in O.couesi. On average, the incisive foramina, which perforate the front part of the palate, were shorter than in O.couesi. The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone) appears to have been better developed in O.antillarum.|$|E

5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body of the skull, and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch)</b> is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular processâ€”a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest toward the front and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E
50|$|Rounded {{in every}} direction, with lateral sides rounded, with parietal bones and <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> well developed. The axes {{of the skull}} and muzzle are parallel, or {{slightly}} divergent towards the front.|$|R
5000|$|The genus Kamptobaatar ("bent hero") {{was named}} by Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska in 1970 {{based on a}} single species. [...] "Bent" [...] refers to the {{observable}} bend of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> in the skull.|$|R
50|$|Head: Lupine, {{wedge-shaped}} and elongated. Due to {{the heavy}} coat it sometimes looks too small. Powerful and long jaws, teeth complete, scissor bite. The back of the muzzle is straight. The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> above the eyes may be slightly noticeable. Back of skull is elongated but not narrow, straight from <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> to occiput. The top of the muzzle is straight, proportional, never pointed or excessively fleshy, lips fitted tightly to the jaws. Almond shaped eyes, eyelids close to the skull. Large ears, that are single turned downwards, set high up nearer to the vertex than in other sheepdogs breeds.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{long and}} robust. The nasal bones are short, not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic notch, an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate, is present. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. A strong jugal bone is present in the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone), so that the maxillary and squamosal bones, which form the front and back parts of the arch, respectively, do not overlap when seen from the side. The narrowest part of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) is to the front and the region's margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the rounded braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front {{part of the}} <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch,</b> is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase. The interorbital region, located between the eyes, is narrowest {{to the front and}} is flanked by {{well-developed}} beads at its margins. The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits. There is no alisphenoid strut, an extension of the alisphenoid bone that in some other oryzomyines separates two foramina in the skull. The auditory bullae are large. The condition of the arteries in the head is highly derived. In the mandible (lower jaw), the coronoid process, a process at the back, is well developed and the capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone housing the root of the lower incisor, is conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|The {{zygomatic}} {{plates are}} almost completely vertical. As Winge already noted, the front {{margin of the}} zygomatic plate hardly extends forward before the antorbital bridge, which connects the plate {{to the body of}} the skull. This feature distinguishes J.anoblepas from Wilfredomys and many oryzomyines, but the zygomatic plate of living Juliomys species closely resembles that of J.anoblepas. In addition, the connection between the zygomatic plate and the antorbital bridge is inserted higher on the rostrum in Wilfredomys. The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> (cheekbones) spread broadly. More than in other Juliomys species, the front part of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> is bended forward and the zygomatic plates are bended outward. Furthermore, the zygomatic notch, the notch between the <b>zygomatic</b> plate and <b>arch,</b> is deep, not shallow as in J.ossitenuis and J.rimofrons.|$|R
5000|$|KNM ER 406 {{is a small}} partial cranium {{discovered}} by Richard Leakey and H. Mutua in 1969, found at Koobi Fora, Kenya, which displays large <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> and a cranial capacity of 510 cmÂ³ ( [...] 1.7 mya).|$|R
50|$|A desmostylian skull has an {{elongated}} and broadened rostrum, with the nasal opening located slightly dorsally. The <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> are prominent (behind the eyes), the paroccipital processes elongated (downward-pointing processes behind the jaw-joints), and the epitympanic sinuses open into the temporal fossae (cavities above the ear holes).|$|R
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} has a large, {{flattened}} skull {{with a short}} and broad rostrum. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend back beyond {{the point where the}} lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. In P. o. planirostris, the rostrum is flatter than in mainland Florida forms, in which it is more convex, and the nasals are said to be relatively longer in P. o. argentatus. The zygomatic plate, the flattened front part of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone), is broad and develops a notch at its front end. The arches themselves are robust and contain small but distinct jugal bones. The sphenopalatine foramen, an opening {{in the side of the}} skull above the molars, is large; it is much smaller in O.couesi. The narrowest part of the region between the eyes is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The marsh rice rat has a narrow braincase lined by prominent ridges and a narrow interparietal bone. According to Goldman, Florida animals (P. o. coloratus and P. o. natator) generally have the largest and broadest skulls, and the western specimen (P. o. texensis) has a somewhat smaller and narrower skull than those from the east outside Florida (P. o. palustris). In P. o. argentatus, the skull is also relatively narrow.|$|E

"Share with Taeniolabidoidea {{the general}} {{shape of the}} skull, with {{anterior}} part of <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> directed roughly transversely and very short basicranial region, which gives the skull a square-like appearance, but differ from them in having a strongly elongated snout and different dentition," [...] (Kielan-Jaworowska & Hurum 2001, p.418).|$|R
50|$|High cheekbones are {{pronounced}} <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches,</b> {{causing the}} upper part of the cheeks to jut out and form a line cut into the sides of the face.

500|$|Despite the similarities, {{there are}} several {{features}} that distinguish Mesopropithecus skulls from those of living indriids. [...] The skull, including the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch,</b> is more robustly built. The temporal lines join together anteriorly into a sagittal crest {{and there is a}} distinct nuchal ridge that joins the rear of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch.</b> The skull has a more rounded braincase, slightly smaller and more convergent orbits, more pronounced postorbital constriction (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets), more robust postorbital bar (bone that encircles the eye socket), a steeper facial angle, more robust and cranially convex zygomatic bone, and a broader, squared snout. The upper incisors and canines are larger. The more robust mandible (lower jaw) and mandibular symphysis (point where the two halves of the lower jaw meet) suggest a more folivorous diet, which requires extra grinding. [...] The orbits are as large (in absolute size) as those in smaller living indriids, which suggests low visual acuity. [...] Mesopropithecus and its closest sloth lemur relative, Babakotia, did share a few ancestral traits with indriids, unlike the largest sloth lemurs, Palaeopropithecus and Archaeoindris. [...] These include the aforementioned four-toothed toothcomb, an inflated auditory bulla (bony structure that encloses part of the middle and inner ear), and an intrabullar ectotympanic ring (bony ring that holds the eardrum).|$|E
500|$|In 1951, Ellerman and Morrison-Scott {{listed the}} O. t. osgoodi as a {{subspecies}} of the steppe pika (Ochotona pusilla) but in 1978, Corbet, and in 1982, Weston, based on morphometric analysis, included {{it in the}} Moupin pika.

However, based on holotype analysis, O. t. sikimaria was found to have a longer skull and a wider interorbital region and <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> than the Gansu pika. The subspeciesO. n. lama,O. n. aliensis, andO. n. lhasaensiswere formerly assigned to the Moupin pika, but they are now considered to belong to the Nubra pika(Ochotona nubrica).|$|E
500|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's ancestry is typically grouped into three historical groups, Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. However, {{the use of}} these classifications is becoming much harder as the rate of interancestrial marriages increases and markers become less defined. [...] By measuring distances between landmarks on the skull as well as {{the size and shape of}} specific bones anthropologists can use a series of equations to estimate ancestry. Typically, the maxilla is used to help anthropologists determine an individual's ancestry due to the three basic shapes, hyperbolic, parabolic, and rounded, belonging to the three historical ancestries, Negroid, Caucasoid, and Mongoloid respectively. In addition to the maxilla, the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> and the nasal opening have been used to narrow down possible ancestry. A program called FORDISC has been created that will calculate the most likely ancestry using complex mathematical formulas. This program is continually updated with new information from known individuals to maintain a database of current populations and their respective measurements.|$|E

30|$|Miniscrew-assisted rapid palatal {{expansion}} (MARPE) {{has been}} adopted {{in recent years to}} expand the maxilla in late adolescence and adult patients. Maxillary Skeletal Expander (MSE) is a device that exploits the principles of skeletal anchorage to transmit the expansion force directly to the maxillary bony structures and is characterized by the miniscrewsâ€™ engagement of the palatal and nasal cortical bone layers. In the literature, {{it has been reported that}} the zygomatic buttress is a major constraint that hampers the lateral movement of maxilla, since maxilla is located medially to the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches.</b> The objective of the present study is to analyze the changes in the zygomatic bone, maxillary bone, and <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> and to localize the center of rotation for the zygomaticomaxillary complex in the horizontal plane after treatment with MSE, using high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images.|$|R
500|$|The {{face mask}} of N.kayan differs {{from those of}} other Bornean lorises in several ways. [...] First, {{the top of the}} dark ring around its eyes is either rounded or pointed (not diffuse at the edges) and the bottom {{stretches}} below the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch,</b> and sometimes extends as far down as the jaw. [...] Second, the stripe between the eyes is occasionally bulb-shaped, compared to the rectangular stripe seen in the neighboring species. [...] Also, a light band of fur in front of the ears is usually intermediate in width compared to the narrow and wide bands seen in the other Bornean species. [...] Compared to N.menagensis, the facemask of N.kayan has more contrast between its dark black and white features, and its ears are always covered in hair, whereas those of N.menagensis are generally naked. [...] Overall, its fur is generally longer and fluffier compared to N.menagensis. [...] Based on a limited number of specimens, the species is about [...] long, and weighs about [...]|$|E
500|$|Noronhomys vespuccii {{is known}} {{from a number}} of bone fragments, {{including}} five skulls, damaged to various degrees, and many isolated jaws and other bones. This material documents that, with a skull of about [...] (occipitonasal length), Noronhomys was a moderately large oryzomyine, smaller than Lundomys but well within the range of Holochilus. It shares a number of the features that characterize the group of Holochilus and related genera, including a reduction in the complexity of the chewing surface of the molars, simple posterolateral palatal pits (perforations of the palate near the third molar), and a similarly shaped interorbital region of the skull. Noronhomys is distinctive, among other characters, in its lack of a spinous process on the zygomatic plate, the flattened front portion of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone); the short palate, which does not extend behind the third molars; and the presence of an accessory crest, the mesoloph, on the upper molars.|$|E
500|$|The holotype {{is a right}} maxilla (upper jaw) {{with the}} upper first molar (M1) in it. It is broken off behind the M1, {{but much of the}} front part is preserved, {{including}} the zygomatic plate, the flattened front portion of the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arch</b> (cheekbone). The M1 is moderately worn, indicating that it is from an adult individual. With an M1 length of 3.59mm and width of 2.53mm, C.cailoi was one of the largest oryzomyines known, rivaled only by Lundomys and the extinct Antillean Megalomys and [...] "Ekbletomys". The height of the M1 is 1.37mm and it has four roots, including a large one in front, another large one on the inner (lingual) side, and two smaller ones on the outer (labial) side. The presence of a second labial root is a variable character among oryzomyines, occurring among others in Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys but not in Lundomys. The maxilla itself shows few significant characters. The back margin of the incisive foramen, which perforates the palate between the upper incisors and the molars, is not visible, suggesting that the foramen was short, as in Holochilus. The configuration of the zygomatic plate shows features that distinguish C.cailoi from some of its relatives.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, {{differences}} in geometry of <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> {{between right and}} {{left side of the}} skull may play a certain role in explaining the asymmetry of maxillary movement reported in the literature [14], possibly along with other contributing parameters such as uneven bone density and suture interdigitation, nasal septum deviation, asymmetry in occlusal forces, and others.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the braincase is high, the <b>zygomatic</b> <b>arches</b> (cheekbones) are {{broad and}} squared, and the incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the palate between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} broad. The upper incisors are orthodont, with their cutting edge nearly vertical. Morphometrically, the skull of O.peninsulae is sharply distinct from other western Mexican Oryzomys.|$|R
5|$|The front (rostral) part of {{the skull}} is shortshorter and broader than in T.hylophilusand flat and the notches in the {{zygomatic}} plates at the sides are poorly developed.
