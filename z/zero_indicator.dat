The GZI (Ground <b>Zero</b> <b>Indicator)</b> was mounted on top of the tower's battlements involving an exhausting climb of several hundred circular stone steps and 400 feet in each direction. The observers at the Windsor post were unique in the country in not having to provide their own food during exercises. Instead, they received hot meals, brought by royal footman, from the castle kitchens. Twelve months after the ROC post was closed, the Brunswick Tower was the starting point and seat of the 1992 Windsor Castle fire and was substantially damaged.|$|E

Entropy can be applied to description of language processes and detection of functioning and development features of language. Bilateral representation of entropy is caused by dichotomy of language and speech and it is feature of transference of entropy concept to linguistics area. Entropy can be representing by language entropy and speech entropy. These concepts are interdependent and interconnected, but not coinciding phenomena. Entropy existence is caused by language nature and it abilities to express all thoughts of native speakers. Entropy of natural language aspires to infinity. But language system never becomes language chaos, because negentropy counteracts entropy. Negentropy is negative entropy and it is measure of language system organization. Negentropy makes language by universal means of communication, which is cleared to all native speakers. Negentropy stabilizes system, but on the contrary entropy destabilizes system and staticizes changes in it. It process results in language development.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the impact of}} the water supply intervention on the health-related microbiological water quality of source and stored water. The study area was a rural community with limited access to safe drinking water and sanitation systems for use. Previously, participating households had to collect water from remote sources (sub-villages near the river and irrigation canals), store water in various types of containers before use and under certain conditions in the domestic environment that may impact negatively on the water quality. These sub-villages were referred to as the Intervention group. The Reference group, were households from the same village (sub-villages away from the river) and for many years have collected and used water from communal taps. The water from the tap was pumped from a groundwater source of a better microbiological quality compared to the Intervention groups’ surface water. Communal standpipes that were installed several years ago were operationalised (water supply intervention) in the Intervention group {{at the time of the}} study and provided the opportunity to compare the various water sources and their impact on the health-related microbiological water quality of container-stored water. There were significant differences in the quality of various water sources used by the Intervention and Reference groups. The level of contamination was found to be higher in the Intervention group surface waters than in the Reference group tap water (groundwater source). Counts of total coliforms and E. coli were much higher in the Intervention group water sources than the Reference group, indicating that surface water was exposed to more pollution in the environment than the protected groundwater supplying taps. There were also significant differences in the water quality of source and container-stored waters used by both Intervention and Reference groups. The numbers of indicator organisms were significantly lower in the Intervention group container-stored river water than in the river source water, suggesting bacterial die-off in stored water. For the Reference group, higher counts of total coliforms and E. coli were found once tap water was sourced and stored in containers at home. The level of these indicators in the Reference group stored water supported the statement that water of good quality at the source often becomes contaminated during storage at home but in case of the Intervention group river water, the storage process brought about improvements in water quality. Container water quality of the Intervention group was assessed “before” and “after” the water supply intervention. A significant decrease was found in the indicator organism numbers (total coliforms and E. coli) “after” the intervention, showing a strong association between the use of an improved water supply and a good water quality. The results have also shown that the Reference group container-stored tap water had lower indicator organism numbers than the Intervention group container-stored river water before the intervention. After the Intervention group tap water was operationalised, its container-stored waters were compared to that of the Reference group (both groups now on tap water), and surprisingly there were significantly higher numbers of indicators in the Reference group stored water, suggesting poor domestic hygiene practices. No significant differences were expected because the same supply was used by both groups. Twenty eight households were randomly selected to assess the sustainability of the water supply intervention after one year of using tap water by the people of Folovhodwe, especially those from the Intervention group. There was a significant increase in the indicator organism numbers in container-stored water after one year of using tap water. Higher levels of indicator organisms (one year later) were probably associated with inadequate water handling practices at home, since the borehole groundwater after one year had <b>zero</b> <b>indicator</b> organisms (total coliforms and E. coli) indicating good water quality at the source. The health-related microbiological quality (at the source and in the containers) did not comply with the proposed safety limits in various water quality guidelines. A negative outcome in both groups was that E. coli was still higher than the WHO risk limit for water intended for drinking at the source and in storage containers suggesting continued faecal pollution of the water. Judging by the overall results, it is evident that the water supply intervention played a role in reducing the numbers of indicator organisms, although still above the guideline limits. It also appears that water supply interventions alone are not sufficient to improve and maintain water quality especially at the point of consumption; therefore hygiene practices around stored water at home need to be improved in order to achieve maximum health benefits.

Mental health problems were assessed in a sample of 1, 278 schoolchildren (55 % Dutch, 32 % Moroccan and 13 % Turkish; mean age: 12. 9 +/- A 1. 8) using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire self-report and teacher report. Measures of family socioeconomic status, neighbourhood deprivation, perceived discrimination, family structure, repeating a school year, housing stability and neighbourhood urbanization were used as indicators of social disadvantage, based on which a cumulative index was created. Ethnic minority youth had more externalizing and fewer internalizing problems than majority youth. Perceived discrimination and living in an unstable social environment were associated with mental health problems, independent of ethnicity. A dose-response relationship was found between social disadvantage and mental health problems. The adjusted odds ratio for mental health problems was 4. 16 (95 % CI 2. 49 - 6. 94) for more than four compared with <b>zero</b> <b>indicators</b> of social disadvantage. Social disadvantage was more common in ethnic minority than in majority youth, explaining part of the differences in prevalence of mental health problems. Ethnic minority youth in the Netherlands have a different profile of mental health problems than majority youth. In all ethnic groups, the risk of mental health problems increases with the degree of social disadvantage. The higher prevalence of externalizing problems among ethnic minority youth is explained partly by their disadvantaged social position. The findings suggest that social factors associated with ethnicity are likely to explain mental health problems in ethnic groups...|$|R

We focus on correlation functions containing twist operators, combining these with anchored loops, boundaries with SLE processes and with double SLE processes.

In this limit the twist operator {{plays the role of}} a <b>zero</b> weight <b>indicator</b> operator, which we verify by comparison with known examples. Using the additional conditions imposed by the twist operator null-states, we derive a new explicit result for the probabilities that an SLE_{ 8 / 3 } wind in various ways about two points in the upper half plane, e. g. that the SLE passes to the left of both points. The collection of c= 0 logarithmic CFT operators that we use deriving the winding probabilities is novel, highlighting a potential incompatibility caused by the presence of two distinct logarithmic partners to the stress tensor within the theory. We provide evidence that both partners do appear in the theory, one in the bulk and one on the boundary and that the incompatibility is resolved by restrictive bulk-boundary fusion rules.

The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a mathematical model to predict Days After Anthesis (DAA) in tomato fruit from changes in the blossom end color. Around 160 tomato flowers from 40 plants of a tomato cultivar âRutgersâ and the nearly isogenic line tomato ripening mutant rin were tagged after artificial pollination and allowed to fruit set. The quantification of color was done from 5 to 85 DAA every 5 days in the tomato fruit blossom-end of both âRutgersâ and mutant rin using a a Minolta chroma meter CR- 300 set in the L*, a* and b* color space. The predictive model was developed using the stepwise procedure in forward selection with DAA as the response variable and all the possible combinations between the next group of regressor: L*, a* and b*, square L*, a* and b*, chroma and Hue angle calculated from measured a* and b* values. It was used the F statistic, mean square error, coefficient of determination, Mallows coefficient and distribution of residuals around <b>zero</b> as <b>indicators</b> of model predictionâs efficiency.

40|$|An all-fiber, micro-pulse and eye-safe high {{spectral}} resolution wind lidar (HSRWL) at 1550 nm is proposed and demonstrated {{by using a}} pair of upconversion single-photon detectors and a fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer (FFP-SI). In order to improve the optical detection efficiency, both the transmission spectrum and the reflection spectrum of the FFP-SI are used for spectral analyses of the aerosol backscatter and the reference laser pulse. The reference signal is tapped from the outgoing laser {{and served as a}} <b>zero</b> velocity <b>indicator.</b> The Doppler shift is retrieved from a frequency response function Q, which is defined as the ratio of difference of the transmitted signal and the reflected signal to their sum. Taking advantages of high signal-to-noise ratio of the detectors and high {{spectral resolution}} of the FFP-SI, the Q spectra of the aerosol backscatter are reconstructed along the line-of-sight (LOS) of the telescope. By applying a least squares fit procedure to the measured Q spectra, the center frequencies and the bandwidths are obtained simultaneously. And then the Doppler shifts are determined relative to the center frequency of the reference signal. To eliminate the influence of temperature fluctuations on the FFP-SI, the FFP-SI is cased in a chamber with temperature stability of 0. 001 during the measurement. Continuous LOS wind observations are carried out on two days at Hefei (31. 843 N, 117. 265 E), China. In the meantime, LOS wind measurements from the HSRWL show good agreement with the results from an ultrasonic wind sensor (Vaisala windcap WMT 52). Due to the computational expensive of the convolution operation of the Q function, an empirical method is adopted to evaluate the quality of the measurements. The standard deviation of the wind speed is 0. 76 m/s at the 1. 8 km. The standard deviation of the retrieved bandwidth variation is 2. 07 MHz at the 1. 8 km. Comment: 19 pages 13 figure...|$|R

The application of a double-speed mechanism provides the necessary increase of contact separation speed, without a significant increase of opening energy. Besides that, it does not requires any fixed mechanical connection between the stationary and moving contacts through the nozzle. This feature has a positive impact on the CB reliability and creates the possibility of easier assembly and dismantling of the interrupter from its insulator.

40|$|The arc {{behavior}} in the current zero region is critical {{in the case of}} very steep rising TRV, such as after clearing a short-line fault. Therefore, intensive and abundant short-line fault tests (L 90) of a 245 kV SF 6 circuit breaker were performed at the KEMA High Power Laboratory. For the purpose of a comparative analysis three different sets of data were obtained during the tests: 1) High-resolution measurements of near current-zero arc current and voltage were carried out. The current zero measurement system (CZM) works as a standalone system in addition to the standard laboratory data acquisition system. The arc conductance shortly before current zero and the arc voltage extinction peak give a clear indication of the interrupting capability of the breaker under test. 2) From the measured traces of every individual test, arc parameters (3 time constants and 3 cooling-power constants) were extracted for the composite black box arc model, which has been developed by KEMA High Power Laboratory and is based on more than 1000 high-resolution measurements during tests of commercial high-voltage circuit breakers. Its aim is to simulate interruption phenomenon in SF 6 gas, evaluate performance of HV SF 6 circuit breakers in testing and enable the prediction of the performance under conditions other than those tested. 3) After each test, using specially developed computer software, based on a simplified physical enthalpy flow arc model, the values of the arcing contact distance, gas mass flow through the nozzle throat and pressure inside the compression cylinder were calculated. The values of these characteristic quantities at the current <b>zero</b> are relevant <b>indicators</b> for successful interruption.
