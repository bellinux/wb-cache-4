40|$|This {{research}} {{concentrates on}} the thermal ageing of a full 3 -coat system with sacrificial pigment (<b>zinc</b> <b>rich)</b> <b>primer</b> on mild steel where the temperature dependence test is conducted to explore {{the correlation between the}} coating resistances with the corrosion rate underneath the coating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is introduced over a range of temperature to extract activation energies for the rate of controlling processes in the corrosion reactions. It is expected that the <b>zinc</b> <b>rich</b> <b>primer</b> does not form a barrier coating for the metal substrate rather it will be the most active component of the substrate in the electrochemistry. Full 3 -coat system with <b>zinc</b> <b>rich</b> <b>primer</b> show the extracted activation energy from coating resistance is significantly lower than the activation energy extracted from the charge transfer resistance. This suggested that the coating resistance from EIS cannot be controlling the corrosion reaction. The activation energies generated for the corrosion process here (78 – 97 kJmol- 1) are very much higher than those of ion transport through the coating (19 – 37 kJmol- 1) during early immersion. Further interesting findings come from the activation energy trends over time particularly for the corrosion process which shown that the value is decreasing where at the end of exposure, the activation energy values for coating and charge transfer resistance become quite similar. It is suggested that at this stage ion transport in the coating might be controlling the corrosion process unlike at the beginning; the activation energy is getting smaller due to coating degradation...|$|E

Before selecting a protective system, the corrosivity of the atmosphere has to be determined. A study has been made for selecting a good protective system for a soda ash chemical industry where chemicals such as soda ash, sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid are produced by using sea water as a raw material. Under these conditions, after collecting the corrosivity rate at various places of industrial areas, coated steel panels with various paint combinations were exposed in different sites {{for a period of}} 2 years.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{determine}} a suitable method for applying zinc based corrosion protection to steel fabricated in a remote area. The various methods for applying the zinc have been researched to determine their requirements and their relative advantages and limitations. The application methods identified were: *Hot-dip Galvanising *Electro-Galvanising *Metal Spray *Sherardizing *Organic <b>Zinc</b> <b>Rich</b> <b>Primers</b> *Inorganic <b>Zinc</b> <b>Rich</b> <b>Primers</b> The methods were researched to find the following information: *Application Process *Required Inspections *Known Advantages and Disadvantages *Health, Safety, and Environmental Factors *Required Infrastructure The results of the research {{were used to determine}} which of the coatings could be performed by the business. A criteria matrix was developed and used to determine this. Zinc thermal spray and both organic and inorganic <b>zinc</b> <b>rich</b> <b>primers</b> were deemed the most viable. The corrosion and abrasion resistance of these coatings were tested and compared with the performance of hot dip galvanising due to it being an industry standard. The results highlighted zinc thermal spray as the highest performer with greatest corrosion resistance and superior abrasion resistance over the painted coatings. The costs of the coatings were also compared with the cost of having an external supplier performing hot dip galvanising. It was found that the cost of transport made this uneconomical as expected. The cost of zinc thermal spray again proved to be the highest performer being 25 % less to apply than the painted <b>zinc</b> <b>rich</b> coatings. The net present value for acquiring the infrastructure to perform zinc thermal spray was calculated and proved that the project is worth pursuing. This has provided assurance that the application of zinc thermal spray would not only provide the customer with a cost effective alternative to hot dip galvanising, but also that it will provide a positive investment for the business. ...|$|R

30|$|A Missouri Department of Transportation report (Myers et al. 2010) on {{structural}} steel coatings for corrosion mitigation mentions that drainage {{of water from}} the deck onto the superstructure was the primary factor leading to service failures of the coating. It was reported that inorganic zinc primers were effective at hindering corrosion; however, organic zinc primer had higher adhesive strengths. The document also reported that overcoating provides an alternative maintenance option that reduces cost and disruption of the highway system; however, it comes with an increased level of risk of early failure of the newly applied system (as opposed to the full blast and repaint approach). Additionally, polyurea type coatings were reported to be effective at producing bond strength, but the salt-induced corrosion inhibition was not as strong as the systems with a high solid zinc primer. Organic zinc primer was reported to be more effective due to higher adhesive strengths and a lower probability of the primer peeling off. A promising review of the application of micaceous iron oxide zinc primer with aliphatic polyurea polyaspartic topcoat system was reported to have almost equal performance in terms of salt-fog resistance when compared to blast cleaning and application of a <b>zinc</b> <b>rich</b> <b>primer.</b> It also provided the added feature of superior UV resistance with good freeze–thaw stability.|$|E
40|$|The main {{driving forces}} {{concerning}} {{the use of}} pre-primed automotive sheet are corrosion protection increase and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing. In this work, the behaviour of two conductive primers, codified by 1 and 2, was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness (near 4 µm) and primer 2 is a very thin (near 2 µm) water based primer filled with graphite. These primers were applied on electrogalvanized, hot dip galvanized and galvannealed steel sheets. Formability capabilities of pre-primed galvanized steel sheets were evaluated, through cupping and stone chipping tests, according to EN ISO 1520 and ASTM D 3170, respectively. To evaluate corrosion protection, the samples were submitted to a corro-sion cyclic test according to VDA procedure 621 - 415 contained in the SEP 1160. Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) associated. Primers 1 and 2 offer cathodic protection when exposed, however by different manners, and allow previous welding works. Primer 1 acts as a <b>zinc</b> <b>rich</b> <b>primer</b> and primer 2 acts as a sealer of metallic zinc coatings, not allowing zinc depletion and delaying the appearance of iron corrosion from the steel substrate.

40|$|Soil {{consolidation}} {{and erosion}} caused by roadway runoff have exposed the upper portions of steel piles at the abutments of numerous bridges, leaving them susceptible to accelerated corrosion rates {{due to the}} abundance of moisture, oxygen, and chlorides at these locations. This problem {{is compounded by the}} relative inaccessibility of abutment piles for close-up inspection and repair. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide bridge owners with recommendations for effective methods of addressing corrosion of steel abutment piles in existing and future bridges A review of available literature on the performance and protection of steel piles exposed to a variety of environments was performed. Eight potential coating systems for use in protecting existing and/or new piles were selected and subjected to accelerated corrosion conditions in the laboratory. Two surface preparation methods were evaluated in the field and three coating systems were installed on three piles at an existing bridge where abutment piles had been exposed by erosion. In addition, a passive cathodic protection (CP) system using sacrificial zinc anodes was tested in the laboratory. Several trial flowable mortar mixes were evaluated for use in conjunction with the CP system. For existing abutment piles, application of a protective coating system is a promising method of mitigating corrosion. Based on its excellent performance in accelerated corrosion conditions in the laboratory on steel test specimens with SSPC-SP 3, -SP 6, and -SP 10 surface preparations, glass flake polyester is recommended for use on existing piles. An alternative is epoxy over organic <b>zinc</b> <b>rich</b> <b>primer.</b> Surface preparation of existing piles should include abrasive blast cleaning to SSPC-SP 6. Although additional field testing is needed, based on the results of the laboratory testing, a passive CP system could provide an effective means of protecting piles in existing bridges when combined with a pumped mortar used to fill voids between the abutment footing and soil. The addition of a corrosion inhibitor to the mortar appears to be beneficial. For new construction, shop application of thermally sprayed aluminum or glass flake polyester to the upper portion of the piles is recommended...|$|E

In high area ratio zinc specimens, red rust is observed on steel substrate at model cut-edge. The chromate inhibits corrosion of formed model cut-edge on pre-painted zinc coated steels.

EIS was also utilized to screen the amount of zinc particles required to provide efficient galvanic protection and to study the effect of purity of Zn on corrosion protection performance. Both EIS and OCP measurements indicate that coatings containing 40 % Zn (on dry film) provides very good barrier protection coming mainly from polymer whereas the one containing > 80 % Zn provides excellent galvanic protection to the steel substrate.

Based on this coated materials, three main studies; specifically on corrosion performance in corrosive agent, comparison in different concentration of corrosive agents and evaluation on protective coating using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) ...|$|R
25|$|The C1 domain - {{immediately}} downstream of the Ras binding domain - is {{a special}} <b>zinc</b> finger, <b>rich</b> in cysteines and stabilized by two zinc ions. It {{is similar to the}} diacylglycerol-binding C1 domains of protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. But unlike PKC, the C1 domains of Raf family kinases do not bind diacylglycerol. Instead, they interact with other lipids, such as ceramide or phosphatidic acid, and even aid in the recognition of activated Ras (GTP-Ras).|$|R
