50|$|<b>Zingel</b> is a genus {{of fish in}} the Percidae family. They {{are long}} and slender, {{reaching}} 12 to 48 cm in length. They are found in rivers and streams in Europe.

50|$|At {{the time}} of the Lords of Winterau, the castle’s outer girding wall {{enclosed}} an extensive area, as still witnessed today by the cadastral names Hinter den Ziunen or Hinter den Zäunen (“Behind the Fences”) and In der <b>Zingel</b> or In der Ringmauer (“In the Girding Wall”). After the Thirty Years' War, the citizens of Heidesheim began to use this wall as a quarry, tearing it down in the process. Andreas Trauttner’s 1754 map shows the Windeck already in the shape seen today. The originally open area between the tower and the inner wall is covered by a gabled roof and thus used as a stately home stretching across the north, east and southeast around the tower. In the southwest and west, the wall has been levelled, through which the tower on the building’s western edge rises. It is likely that Samuel Beck gave it this shape after 1626. The ogival-arch portal and the large-scale crossbar windows (windows divided by cross-shaped spars into groups of four windows) in Gothic Revival style stem from the time after 1860, as does the room layout inside. The outbuildings shown in the cadastral plans from 1812 and from 1841 to 1843 have disappeared.|$|E

40|$|The lower Morava and Dyje rivers belong {{among the}} large lowland rivers on the {{southeast}} of the Czech Republic flowing into the Danube 69 km downstream of their confluence. Despite their high nature value and environment protection, both rivers suffered from heavy pollution from the sixties to the eighties of the last century. Significant improvement of their water quality {{during the last two}} decades resulted in the partial recovery of former assemblages of both benthic macroinvertebrates and fish. Recently, altogether 262 and 137 taxa of macrozoobenthos were recorded at the Dyje and Morava rivers, respectively. In the River Dyje, 3 and 21 non-native and threatened (according to IUCN categories) invertebrate species, respectively, were ascertained, whilst in the River Morava their numbers were 2 and 10, respectively. The fish assemblage consisted of 23 and 24 species, respectively, plus one hybrid in each of the rivers, bleak being by far the most abundant fish. In the sections under study, several rare and/or protected species were also recorded. Two of them, ide (Leuciscus idus) and burbot (Lota lota) belong among vulnerable fish species and four others, white-eye bream (Abramis sapa), striped ruffe (Gymnocephalus schraetser), streber (<b>Zingel</b> streber) and <b>zingel</b> (<b>Zingel</b> <b>zingel),</b> are considered as critically endangered species.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}}  is to analyse the {{influence}} of environmental factors on the capture and fish communities structure from Danube, between Siret River and Prut River mouth. Fish were collected from April to December 2012 in four fishing areas. During the year, 4910 kg, respectively 7121 fish of 31 species were collected. Cyprinidae, the dominant family, 54. 84 % in term of number of species, was represented by 17 species (Cyprinus carpio, Carassius gibelio, Barbus barbus, Abramis brama, Abramis sapa, Blicca bjoerkna, Leuciscus idus, Vimba vimba, Aspius aspius, Pelecus cultratus, Chondrostoma nasus, Ctenopharingodon idella, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis, Scardinius erythrophthalmus, Rutilus rutilus, Alburnus alburnus). Other families had the following structure: Percidae (16. 13 %) with 5 species (Sander lucioperca, <b>Zingel</b> <b>zingel,</b> <b>Zingel</b> streber, Perca fluviatilis, Gymnocephalus schraetzer), Acipenseridae (12. 90 %) with 4 species (Huso huso, Acipenser stellatus, Acipenser ruthenus, Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), Clupeidae (6. 45 %) with two species (Alosa immaculata, Alosa tanaica), Siluridae (3. 23 %) with one species (Silurus glanis), Esocidae (3. 23 %) with one species (Esox lucius)  and Salmonidae (3. 23 %) with one species also (Salmo labrax). The highest capture was 2977. 93 kg (60. 65 %), during the spring season (April-May), followed by autumn season (September–November), with 992. 39 kg (20. 21 %).

40|$|The {{migration}} permeability of weirs for fishes {{is considered}} one of the strategic revitalisation measures which can significantly contribute to the restoration and stabilisation of fish biodiversity. It is inevitable to define priorities for the preparation and realisation of successive steps in this respect. In principle, the migration permeability should be renewed systematically, starting from the lowest lying migration barriers and proceeding upstream. Highest priority should be given to measures and constructions that are vital in renewing the occurrence and dispersion of native and mostly protected and rare species (<b>Zingel</b> <b>zingel,</b> Z. streber, Pelecus cultratus, Gymnocephalus schraetser, G. baloni, among others). High priority should be given to fish ladders which permit reproduction migrations (Chondrostoma nasus, Leuciscus idus, Lota lota, Vimba vimba, etc.), in which this is an important part of biology, and the condition of restoring stability of their populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of {{a considerable number}} of rare and protected lamprey and fish species in the Czech Republic is exclusive for the drainage area of the Morava River. Eudontomyzon mariae occurs only in the Račí potok Brook. Lampetra planeri occurs in a section ca 20 km long in {{the upper part of the}} Morava R. Romanogobio kessleri initially occurred only in the Bečva R. After 2000 was newly recorded in the Morava R. Romanogobio albipinnatus occurs in the lower reaches of the rivers Morava and Dyje; locally, we have observed in the upper parts of these rivers. After 1990 species Pelecus cultratus, Gymnocephalus schraetser, G. baloni, <b>Zingel</b> streber, and Z. <b>zingel</b> re-occurred in the confluence of Morava and Dyje rivers. The only actual range of Sabanejewia balcanica in the Czech Republic is in a short section of the Vlára R. (the Váh R. drainage area) near the boundary of Slovakia.

40|$|The lower {{reaches of}} the Dyje River with {{adjacent}} floodplain constitute an unique territory fragment in the Czech Republic. Its hydrological system is prominent with a high diversity of aquatic habitats including natural floodings over the floodplain part. During last 50 years, the occurrence of 49 species fish was found there in total. Of them, 41 species are assessed to be autochtonous, i. e. 75 % of the native ichthyofauna structure of the Czech Republic. As strategically significant, the direct barrier-free connection of the lower Dyje River through the Morava River with the Danube has been manifested. In such way during recent years, the occurrence has been renewed of naturally immigrating Pelecus cultratus, Gymnocephalus schraetser and <b>Zingel</b> <b>zingel,</b> which had disappeared in the past. Sporadically, also the occurrence of Acipenser ruthenus and the wild form Cyprinus carpio is renewed.
