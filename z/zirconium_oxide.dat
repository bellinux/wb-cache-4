5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxide,</b> there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E

The microstructure of the coating {{was characterized by}} XRD, SEM and TEM techniques. The wear resistance of the coating was evaluated under dry sliding wear test condition at room temperature. The corrosion resistance of the coating was tested in simulated body fluid. The {{results show that the}} coating mainly consists of Zr, <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxides</b> and Zr aluminides. The coating exhibits excellent wear resistance due to the high microhardness of the coating.

40|$|The {{structural}} stability {{of a commercial}} hydrous zirconia and a hydrous zirconia synthesized in our laboratory by the sol-gel method has been improved by a post-synthesis reflux treatment with aqueous NH 4 OH and NaOH solutions (100 degrees C for 9 h). Direct calcination of both materials at 700 degrees C for 3 h, rendered <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxides</b> {{with a mixture of}} monoclinic and tetragonal structures and specific areas of 36 and 27 m(2) /g, respectively. In contrast, if the materials were refluxed before calcination with NaOH or NH 4 OH solutions, <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxides</b> with tetragonal structure and specific areas between 90 and 200 m(2) /g were obtained after calcination at 700 degrees C. In the treatments with NaOH solution, addition of Si coming from dissolution of the flask glass walls or from an external Si source in a plastic flask is responsible for the stability of the final <b>zirconium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Nevertheless, the porous structure of these materials is determined by the treatment conditions in basic solution, thus allowing to control the physical properties of the final oxide. Short treatment times are sufficient to stabilize the hydrous zirconia. On the contrary, if the reflux is made with a NH 4 OH solution, the stabilization mechanism appears to be different since {{there is no evidence of}} Si addition in the oxides. In this case, the pore size distribution strongly depends on the reflux time, and the highest specific area is obtained for the largest treatment time (9 h).
