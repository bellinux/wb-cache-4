25|$|The E2 {{mechanism}} {{provides a}} more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a tosylate or triflate). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a dehydrohalogenation. For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see Zaitsev's rule). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols. A typical example is shown below; note that if possible, the H is anti to the leaving group, even though {{this leads to the}} less stable <b>Z-isomer.</b>|$|E

However isoroquefortine C is not a natural product and in contrast to roquefortine C does not bind iron. Both have been synthesised.|$|E
50|$|Another {{classic example}} {{is the use of}} a bulky Lewis acid to form the E-isomer of an ester over the {{preferred}} <b>Z-isomer</b> for cyclolactonization of medium rings. In one study, the addition of aluminum tris(2,6-diphenylphenoxide) (ATPH) was added to form a 7-membered lactone. The aluminum metal binds with the carbonyl oxygen forcing the bulky diphenylphenoxide groups in close proximity to the ester compound. As a result, the ester adopts the E-isomer to minimize penalizing steric interactions. Without the Lewis acid, only the 14-membered dimer ring was observed.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, Stephen F. Martin {{and others}} {{reported}} the 24-step synthesis of manzamine A with two ring-closing metathesis steps {{to access the}} polycyclic alkaloid. The natural product was isolated from marine sponges {{off the coast of}} Okinawa. Manzamine is a good target due to its potential as an antitumor compound. The first RCM step was to form the 13-member D ring as solely the <b>Z-isomer</b> in 67% yield, a unique contrast to the usual favored E-isomer of metathesis. After further transformations, the second RCM was used to form the 8-member E ring in 26% yield using stoichiometric 1st Generation Grubbs catalyst. The synthesis highlights the ability for functional group tolerance metathesis reactions as well as the ability to access complex molecules of varying ring sizes.|$|E
50|$|The ring {{strain in}} 8-11 atom rings {{has proven to}} be {{challenging}} for RCM; however, there are many cases where these cyclic systems have been synthesized. In 1997, Fürstner reported a facile synthesis to access jasmine ketolactone (E/Z) through a final RCM step. At the time, no previous 10-membered ring had been formed through RCM, and previous syntheses were often lengthy, involving a macrolactonization to form the decanolide. By adding the diene and catalyst over a 12-hour period to refluxing toluene, Fürstner was able to avoid oligomerization and obtain both E/Z isomers in 88% yield. It {{is interesting to note that}} CH2Cl2 favored the formation of the <b>Z-isomer</b> in 1:2.5 (E/Z) ratio, whereas, toluene only afforded a 1:1.4 (E/Z) mixture.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{synthesize}} α-phenylcinnamic acid. Some of the more popular methods of formation include the condensation of phenylacetyl chloride with benzaldehyde in the presence of triethylamine, the distillation of benzylmandelic acid, or by the reaction of sodium phenylacetate with benzaldehyde in acetic anhydride. There are two isomers of this compound, differing in the geometry of the alkene. The E isomer, in which the two phenyl rings are cis to each other, is the major product formed by most synthetic routes. However, this compound can be converted using heat or ultraviolet light into a mixture containing nearly 50% of the Z isomer. [...] Decarboxylation of &alpha;-phenylcinnamic acid yields stilbene, with the (E) isomer producing cis-stilbene and the (<b>Z)-isomer</b> producing trans-stilbene.|$|E
50|$|Bisdehydrodoisynolic acid (BDDA), as the (<b>Z)-isomer</b> ((Z)-BDDA), is a synthetic, nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} {{related to}} doisynolic acid {{that was never}} marketed. It {{is one of the}} most potent estrogens known, although it has more recently been characterized as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). BDDA and other doisynolic acid derivatives display relatively low affinity accompanied by disproportionately high estrogenic potency in vivo, which was eventually determined to be due to transformation into metabolites with greater estrogenic activity. The drug was discovered in 1947 as a degradation product of the reaction of equilenin or dihydroequilenin with potassium hydroxide. It is the seco analogue of equilenin, while doisynolic acid is the seco analogue of estrone. These compounds, along with diethylstilbestrol, can be considered to be open-ring analogues of estradiol. The methyl ether of BDDA, doisynoestrol, is also an estrogen, and in contrast to BDDA, has been marketed.|$|E
50|$|Ring-closing {{metathesis}} {{is important}} in total synthesis. One example is its use {{in the formation of}} the 12-membered ring in the synthesis of the naturally occurring cyclophane floresolide. Floresolide B was isolated from an ascidian of the genus Apidium and showed cytotoxicity against KB tumor cells. In 2005, K. C. Nicolaou and others completed a synthesis of both isomers through late-stage ring-closing metathesis using the 2nd Generation Grubbs catalyst to afford a mixture of E- and Z- isomers (1:3 E/Z) in 89% yield. Although one prochiral center is present the product is racemic. Floresolide is an atropisomer as the new ring forms (due to steric constraints in the transition state) passing through the front of the carbonyl group in and not the back. The carbonyl group then locks the ring permanently in place. The E/Z isomers were then separated and then the phenol nitrobenzoate protective group was removed in the final step by potassium carbonate to yield the final product and the unnatural <b>Z-isomer.</b>|$|E
50|$|In RCM reactions, two {{possible}} geometric isomers, either E- or <b>Z-isomer,</b> may be formed. Stereoselectivity {{is dependent on}} the catalyst, ring strain, and starting diene. In smaller rings, Z-isomers predominate as the more stable product reflecting ring-strain minimization. In macrocycles, the E-isomer is often obtained {{as a result of the}} thermodynamic bias in RCM reactions as E-isomers are more stable compared to Z-isomers. As a general trend, ruthenium NHC (N-heterocyclic carbene) catalysts favor E selectivity to form the trans isomer. This in part due to the steric clash between the substituents, which adopt a trans configuration as the most stable conformation in the metallacyclobutane intermediate, to form the E-isomer. The synthesis of stereopure Z- isomers were previously achieved via ring-closing alkyne metathesis. However, in 2013 Grubbs reported the use of a chelating ruthenium catalyst to afford Z macrocycles in high selectivity. The selectivity is attributed to the increased steric clash between the catalyst ligands and the metallacyclobutane intermediate that is formed. The increased steric interactions in the transition state lead to the Z olefin rather than the E olefin, because the transition state required to form the E- isomer is highly disfavored.|$|E

The E- form is {{more stable than}} the Z- form by 3. 3 kcal/mol (deltaG*). Ab initio calculations have indicated that a tetrahedral zwitterion intermediate is not formed, and the bimolecular process, forming the aminoalcohol intermediate, occurs through a four center transition state, with concerted formation of C-N bond and proton transfer. However, the predicted deltaG* ¹ is very high, indicating that the true mechanism for this step is not bimolecular. A catalyzed pathway must be actuating. The following step, unimolecular elimination of water, also presents a very high activation free energy. Similarly, a catalyzed mechanism is needed.
