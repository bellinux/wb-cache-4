25|$|Rv {{provides}} a bias current {{for both the}} <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> and the transistor. The current in the diode is minimum when the load current is maximum. The circuit designer must choose a minimum voltage that can be tolerated across Rv, bearing {{in mind that the}} higher this voltage requirement is, the higher the required input voltage, Uin, and hence the lower the efficiency of the regulator. On the other hand, lower values of Rv lead to higher power dissipation in the diode and to inferior regulator characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The {{output voltage}} of the {{stabilizer}} {{is equal to}} the <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> voltage minus the base–emitter voltage of the transistor, UZ − UBE, where UBE is usually about 0.7V for a silicon transistor, depending on the load current. If the output voltage drops for any external reason, such as an increase in the current drawn by the load (causing a decrease in the Collector-Emitter junction voltage to observe KVL), the transistor's base–emitter voltage (UBE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again.|$|E
25|$|Many simple DC power {{supplies}} regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a voltage reference using a shunt regulator {{such as a}} <b>Zener</b> <b>diode,</b> avalanche breakdown diode, or voltage regulator tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device.|$|E

25|$|These {{can be made}} {{to conduct}} in reverse bias (backward), and are {{correctly}} termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called Zener breakdown, occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode {{to be used as a}} precision voltage reference. The term <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or Transorb, a registered trademark).|$|E
25|$|In the {{electrical}} schematic to the right, a typical silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) based light dimmer dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is {{wired in series}} with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 will charge up. When C1 is able to make <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops {{at the end of}} the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle. This is an example of a Leading Edge Dimmer.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> {{is a type}} of diode {{that permits}} current in the forward {{direction}} like a normal diode, but also in the reverse direction if the voltage is larger than the breakdown voltage known as [...] "Zener knee voltage" [...] or [...] "Zener voltage". The device was named after Clarence Zener, who discovered this electrical property.|$|E
2500|$|At {{very large}} reverse bias, beyond the {{peak inverse voltage}} or PIV, a process called reverse {{breakdown}} occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., {{a large number of}} electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The avalanche diode is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the <b>Zener</b> <b>diode,</b> the concept of PIV is not applicable. A <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> contains a heavily doped p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is [...] "clamped" [...] to a known value (called the Zener voltage), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.|$|E
2500|$|While {{half-wave}} and {{full-wave rectification}} deliver unidirectional current, neither produces a constant voltage. There {{is a large}} AC ripple voltage component at the source frequency for a half-wave rectifier, and twice the source frequency for a full-wave rectifier. [...] Ripple voltage is usually specified peak-to-peak. Producing steady DC from a rectified AC supply requires a smoothing circuit or filter. In its simplest form this can be just a capacitor (also called a reservoir capacitor or smoothing capacitor), choke, resistor, <b>zener</b> <b>diode</b> & resistor, or voltage regulator placed at {{the output of the}} rectifier. [...] In practice, most smoothing filters utilize multiple components to efficiently reduce ripple voltage to a level tolerable by the circuit.|$|E

2500|$|They {{can also}} be found in power {{supplies}} for digital circuits, where they are used as a sort of [...] "enhanced circuit breaker" [...] to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components. A thyristor is used in conjunction with a <b>Zener</b> <b>diode</b> attached to its gate, and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the Zener voltage, the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground (in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse). This kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar, and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered.|$|E
