500|$|The Dreamcast {{controller}} {{includes both}} an analog stick and a digital pad, four action buttons, and two analog triggers. The system has four ports for controller inputs, {{although it was}} bundled with only one controller. The design of the Dreamcast's controller, described by the staff of Edge as [...] "an ugly evolution of Saturn's 3D controller," [...] was called [...] " [...] that great" [...] by 1UP.com's Sam Kennedy and [...] "lame" [...] by Game Informers Andy McNamara. [...] The staff of IGN wrote that [...] "unlike most controllers, Sega's pad forces the user's hands into an uncomfortable parallel position." [...] In contrast to the Sega CD and Sega Saturn, which included internal backup memory, the Dreamcast uses a 128 kbyte memory card called the VMU (or [...] "Visual Memory Unit") for data storage. The VMU features a small LCD screen, audio output from a one-channel PWM sound source, non-volatile memory, a directional pad, and four buttons. The VMU can present game information, {{be used as a}} minimal handheld gaming device, and connect to certain Sega arcade machines. [...] For example, players use the VMU to call plays in NFL 2K or raise virtual pets in Sonic Adventure. Sega officials noted that the VMU could be used [...] "as a private viewing area, the absence of which has prevented effective implementation of many types of games in the past." [...] After a VMU slot was incorporated into the controller's design, Sega's engineers found many additional uses for it, so a second slot was added. This slot was generally used for vibration packs providing force feedback like Sega's [...] "Jump Pack" [...] and Performance's [...] "Tremor Pack", although it could also be used for other peripherals including a microphone enabling voice control and player communication. Various third-party cards provide storage, and some contain the LCD screen addition. Iomega announced a Dreamcast-compatible <b>zip</b> <b>drive</b> that could store up to 100 MB of data on removable discs, but it was never released.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> {{initially}} sold {{well after}} their introduction in 1994, owing to their low price and high (for the time) capacity. The drive was initially sold for just under US$200 with one cartridge included, and additional 100 MB cartridges for US$20. At this time hard disks typically had {{a capacity of}} 500 MB and cost around US$200, and so backing up with Zip disks was very economical for home users—some computer suppliers such as Dell included Iomega internal <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> in their machines. <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> also made significant inroads in the graphic arts market, as a cheaper alternative to the Syquest cartridge hard disk system. The price of additional cartridges swiftly dropped further {{over the next few}} years, as more companies began supplying them. Eventually, the suppliers included Fujifilm, Verbatim, Toshiba and Maxell, Epson and NEC. NEC also produced a licensed 100 MB drive model with its brand name.|$|R
5000|$|Parallel port {{external}} <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> {{are actually}} SCSI drives with an integrated Parallel-to-SCSI controller, meaning a true SCSI bus implementation {{but without the}} electrical buffering circuits necessary for connecting other external devices. Early <b>Zip</b> 100 <b>drives</b> used an AIC 7110 SCSI controller and later parallel <b>drives</b> (<b>Zip</b> Plus and Zip 250) used what was known as Iomega MatchMaker.

5000|$|In 1994, Iomega {{introduced}} the <b>Zip</b> <b>drive.</b> Although neither size (the original or the later Pocket <b>Zip</b> <b>drive)</b> {{conforms to the}} 3½-inch form factor and hence is not compatible with standard 1.44 MB drives, the original physical size still became {{the most popular of}} the [...] "super floppies". The first version boasted 100 MB; later versions boasted 250 MB and then 750 MB of storage, until the PocketZip (formerly known as Clik!) was developed with 40 MB. Though Zip drives gained in popularity for several years they never reached the same market penetration as standard floppy drives, since only some new computers were sold with the drives. Eventually the falling prices of optical media and flash storage, along with notorious hardware failures (the so-called [...] "click of death"), reduced the popularity of the <b>Zip</b> <b>drive.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Sales of <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> and disks {{declined}} steadily from 1999 to 2003. [...] Zip disks had {{a relatively}} high cost per megabyte compared to the falling costs of then-new CD-R and CD-RW discs.|$|R
50|$|The 500 MHz {{version was}} reintroduced on February 16, 2000, {{accompanied}} by 400 MHz and 450 MHz models. DVD-RAM and <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> featured on these later 450 MHz and 500 MHz versions and were an option on the 400 MHz.|$|R
5000|$|Iomega started {{business}} in Roy, Utah in 1980 (the firm moved its headquarters to San Diego in 2001). For many years, {{the firm was}} a significant name in the data storage industry. Iomega's most famous product, the <b>Zip</b> <b>Drive,</b> was revolutionary as it offered relatively large amounts of storage on easily portable compact cartridges. The original Zip disk's 100MB capacity was a huge improvement over the 1.44MB limitation of floppy disks. The <b>Zip</b> <b>Drive</b> became a common internal and external peripheral for IBM-compatible computers and Macs. However, Zip disk cartridges sometimes failed after a short period, (commonly {{referred to as the}} [...] "click of death"). This problem, combined with competition from CD-RW drives, caused <b>Zip</b> <b>Drive</b> sales to decline dramatically, despite later efforts to introduce larger 250MB and 750MB disk versions. Iomega eventually launched a CD-RW drive.|$|E

50|$|Early {{external}} SCSI-based <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> {{often came}} with an included SCSI adapter known as Zip Zoom. The Zip Zoom is a rebadged ISA Adaptec SCSI host controller.

5000|$|Early-generation <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> were {{in direct}} {{competition}} with the SuperDisk or LS-120 drives, which held 20% more data and could also read standard 3.5-inch 1.44 MB diskettes, {{but they had a}} lower data-transfer rate due to lower rotational speed. [...] The rivalry was over before the dawn of the USB era.|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, the EZ 135 {{drive was}} not {{backwards}} compatible with other SyQuest drives, {{and the original}} capacity was never increased beyond 135 MB. The <b>Zip</b> <b>drive</b> became popular and SyQuest's sales declined.|$|E

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of devices were {{eventually}} designed to operate on a parallel port. Most devices were uni-directional (one-way) devices, only meant to respond to information sent from the PC. However, some devices such as <b>Zip</b> <b>drives</b> were able to operate in bi-directional mode. Printers also eventually took up the bi-directional system, allowing various status report information to be sent.|$|R
5000|$|The phrase [...] "click of death" [...] {{originated}} {{to describe}} a failure mode of the Iomega <b>ZIP</b> <b>drives,</b> appearing in print as early as January 30, 1998. In his podcast of September 18, 2008, Mac journalist Tim Robertson claimed to have coined the phrase in the early '90s. [...] The phrase was then applied to other drives exhibiting a similar unusual clicking sound usually associated with failure.|$|R
50|$|Iomega {{received}} {{thousands of}} complaints about the click of death. Iomega stated that fewer than 1 in 200 Jaz and <b>Zip</b> <b>drive</b> owners were affected by the click of death. Iomega often stated that the problems were caused {{by the use of}} (functionally identical) third-party media. A class action suit was filed against them for violation of the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act in September 1998. (Rinaldi v. Iomega Corp., 41 U.C.C. Rep. Serv. 2d 1143) The case was settled in March 2001 and <b>Zip</b> <b>drive</b> owners were given a rebate toward the future purchase of an Iomega product.|$|E

These can be supported as bootable devices by a BIOS complying with the ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification, originally developed by Compaq Computer Corporation and Phoenix Technologies. It specifies provisions in the BIOS of a personal computer to allow the computer to be bootstrapped from devices such as <b>Zip</b> <b>drives,</b> Jaz drives, SuperDisk (LS-120) drives, and similar devices.|$|R
