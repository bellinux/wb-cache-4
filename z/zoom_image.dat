50|$|For the {{creation}} of Seadragon style content and images, when one uploads a picture, it is converted {{into a number of}} Deep <b>Zoom</b> <b>Image</b> (DZI) format files. These can be combined to make up a Deep Zoom Collection (DZC). These Deep Zoom Images create a digital tiled mosaic, of small (256x256) images, with each tile representing a portion or layer or set of pixels of the image at one specific resolution. This Deep Zoom format allows for only the pixels needed for a particular view on the screen to be loaded at one particular time - this results in a more effective use of bandwidth and computer resources. This also means that the amount of data needing to be transferred at any one time is proportional to the number of pixels on the screen. This is an alternative to loading all the pixels (data) of an image all at once with standard image formats. The figurative “secret sauce” behind Seadragon is the technology that allows for the seamlessly smooth transition between the tiles and layers amongst the DeepZoom collection (DZC) files that make up an image.|$|E

40|$|To {{estimate}} the spatial resolution of microtomographs, a test object on the submicrometer scale was prepared by {{focused ion beam}} milling and subjected to microtomographic analysis. Since human tissues are composed of cells and extracellular matrices with micrometer and submicrometer structures, {{it is important to}} investigate the three-dimensional spatial resolution of microtomographs used to visualize microstructures of human tissues. The resolutions along the direction within the tomographic slice plane (in-plane resolution) and perpendicular to it (through-plane resolution) were determined from the modulation transfer function of square-wave patterns. The in-plane resolution was estimated to be 1. 2 um from the modulation transfer function of the non-zoom image. In contrast, the <b>zoom</b> <b>image</b> gave the in-plane resolution of 0. 8 um. This in-plane resolution is comparable to the through-plane resolution, which was estimated to be 0. 8 um. Although the two-dimensional radiographs were taken with the pixel width of half the x-ray optics resolution, these three-dimensional resolution analyses indicated that the zoom reconstruction should be performed to achieve the in-plane resolution comparable to the x-ray optics resolution. The submicrometer three-dimensional analysis was applied in the structural study of human cerebral tissue stained with high-Z elements and the obtained tomograms revealed that the microtomographic analysis allows visualization of the subcellular structures of the cerebral tissue.

40|$|Laser radar (LADAR) {{has many}} {{advantages}} over other methods of target detection and analysis, both in combat and commercial applications. Because {{it uses a}} shorter wavelength than microwave radar and has significantly greater angular resolution, {{it is capable of}} a greater degree of accuracy and more precise target resolution to a level that allows for high resolution image acquisition. The development of a next generation LADAR unit that is lightweight, ultra-compact, portable, and power-efficient real-time 3 D LADAR unit would be a significant advance with many potential military and civilian applications. This paper describes a novel LADAR device that would be small, compact, field practical, eye safe, and integrable into a soldier's helmet. This would be achieved by using a 2 -axis MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical System) scanner with an optical system that will extend the field of view (FOV). This next generation time-of-flight (TOF) LADAR design utilizes a novel angle amplification mechanism that uses a pre-compensating positive lens and a subsequent negative lens to overcome the small scanning range of MEMS mirrors where scan angles as small as 6 ˚ can be increased to over 40 ˚. Also, with conventional digital zoom, a portion of an image is used to create a larger but much lower resolution image, while the LADAR zoom technology discussed in this paper will have a tighter field of view for a high resolution <b>zoom</b> <b>image.</b> Other innovation is a relatively inexpensive and compact laser driver that can generate subnanosecond pulses of varying repetition frequency. Our analyses demonstrate that this portable LADAR device would work in close proximities as well as distances over 100 meters, could have a range resolution of less than a centimeter and a FOV greater than 40 º, and be able to display 320 x 240 pixel real-time images at a frame rate of 15. Such a LADAR unit could be enhanced to also record and transmit range, intensity, and GPS/vector data to a remote computer. By using the same soldier for capturing LADAR images and data fro...|$|E

Finally, the <b>zoomed</b> <b>images</b> will be synthesized into one <b>image.</b> The <b>zoomed</b> parts of the image are found by minimizing the different variational functional in the wavelet domain which use the Besov norm to measure the regularity of the parts.

40|$|Digital {{halftone}} is {{the technique}} used to convert gray-scale images into binary ones, simulating gray shades by scattering appropriately {{black and white}} pixels. Sometimes, there arises the necessity of increasing the resolution of a halftone image. Some recent works have proposed a number of learning-based techniques to <b>zoom</b> binary <b>images.</b> However, they cannot consider a large neighborhood to decide {{the colors of the}} resolution-increased pixels, because their running time skyrockets with the growth of the window and the sample images sizes.

40|$|After {{radiofrequency}} ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus, it may {{be difficult}} to determine whether complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia at the neosquamocolumnar junction (neo-SCJ) in the cardia has been achieved. It is claimed that narrow band imaging (NBI) may predict the presence of intestinal metaplasia, which would enable immediate treatment. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether inspection of the neo-SCJ with NBI after RFA results in reliable detection of intestinal metaplasia. Patients with a normal-appearing neo-SCJ who were scheduled for RFA were included in the study. Two expert endoscopists obtained images from the neo-SCJ in overview (high resolution white light and NBI mode) and from four areas using NBI zoom, followed by corresponding biopsies. Four other blinded expert endoscopists evaluated the images for the presence of intestinal metaplasia and type of mucosal pattern (round, small tubular, large tubular, villous). Endpoints were sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients and areas with intestinal metaplasia. From 21 patients overview images from 21 neo-SCJs and NBI <b>zoom</b> <b>images</b> from 83 neo-SCJ areas were obtained. Intestinal metaplasia was present in five overview images (24  %) and nine <b>zoom</b> <b>images</b> (11  %).
