40|$|This paper {{considers}} a modified constant elasticity of variance (MCEV) model. This model uses the familiar constant elasticity of variance {{form for the}} volatility of the growth optimal portfolio (GOP) in a continuous market. It leads to a GOP that follows {{the power of a}} time-transformed squared Bessel process. This paper derives analytic real-world prices for <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> instantaneous forward rates and options on the GOP that are both theoretically revealing and computationally efficient. In addition, the paper examines options on exchange prices and options on <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> under the MCEV model. The semi-analytic prices derived for options on <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> can subsequently be used to price interest rate caps and floors.

50|$|The {{ideas of}} using {{multiple}} discount rates obtained from <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> and discount a similar bonds cash flow {{to find its}} price {{is derived from the}} yield curve. The yield curve is a curve of the yields of the same bond with different maturities. This curve can be used to view trends in market expectations of how interest rates will move in the future. In arbitrage-free pricing of a bond, a yield curve of similar <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> with different maturities is created. If the curve were to be created with Treasury securities of different maturities, they would be stripped of their coupon payments through bootstrapping. This is to transform the <b>bonds</b> into <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> The yield of these <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> would then be plotted on a diagram with time on the x-axis and yield on the y-axis.|$|R

25|$|Consider a 30-year <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond</b> with a {{face value}} of $100. If the bond is priced at an annual YTM of 10%, it will cost $5.73 today (the present value of this cash flow, 100/(1.1)30 = 5.73). Over the coming 30 years, the price will advance to $100, and the annualized return will be 10%.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond</b> (also {{discount}} bond or deep {{discount bond}}) is a bond {{bought at a}} price lower than its face value, with the face value repaid {{at the time of}} maturity. Note that this definition assumes a positive time value of money. It does not make periodic interest payments, or have so-called [...] "coupons", hence the term <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond.</b> When the bond reaches maturity, its investor receives its par (or face) value. Examples of zero-coupon bonds include U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. savings bonds, long-term zero-coupon bonds, and any type of coupon bond that has been stripped of its coupons.|$|E
2500|$|As {{distinct}} from the two related approaches above, a bond may {{be thought of as}} a [...] "package of cash flows"—coupon or face—with each cash flow viewed as a zero-coupon instrument maturing on the date it will be received. [...] Thus, rather than using a single discount rate, one should use multiple discount rates, discounting each cash flow at its own rate. Here, each cash flow is separately discounted at the same rate as a <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond</b> corresponding to the coupon date, and of equivalent credit worthiness (if possible, from the same issuer as the bond being valued, or if not, with the appropriate credit spread).|$|E

The asset is then sold {{in the future for}} its cost plus a profit by an agent. On (or before) the date agreed to in the contract, the seller delivers the asset to the agent who sells the asset who passes the proceeds (minus expenses/fees) on to the SPV, which distributes the proceeds to the sukuk holders. Sukuk al-Salam are (at least usually) used to support a company's short term liquidity requirements.

40|$|This article derives {{a series}} of {{analytic}} formulae for various contingent claims under the real-world probability measure using the stylised minimal market model (SMMM). This model provides realistic dynamics for the growth optimal portfolio (GOP) as a well-diversified equity index. It captures both leptokurtic returns with correct tail properties and the leverage effect. Under the SMMM, the discounted GOP {{takes the form of}} a time-transformed squared Bessel process of dimension four. From this property, one finds that the SMMM possesses a special and interesting relationship to non-central chi-square random variables with zero degrees of freedom. The analytic formulae derived under the SMMM include options on the GOP, options on exchange prices and options on <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> For options on <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> analytic prices facilitate efficient calculation of interest rate caps and floors.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-country economy under the nonarbitrage assumption and where volatilities are stochastic. Assuming {{the existence of}} state variables, we show that, under some mild volatility assumptions, the model is actually fully specified. In particular, both term structure dynamics and the exchange rate process can be given endogeneously under the risk-neutral probability. We then derive the exact dependence of the <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> and the exchange rate on the underlying state variables. As a result, some closed-form solutions can be proposed for the derivative assets as futures and options written on foreign <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> Copyright 1995 Blackwell Publishers. ...|$|R

50|$|Consider first a $100 {{investment}} in each, which {{makes sense for}} the three bonds (the coupon bond, the annuity, the <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond</b> - {{it does not make}} sense for the interest rate swap {{for which there is no}} initial investment). Modified duration is a useful measure to compare interest rate sensitivity across the three. The <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond</b> will have the highest sensitivity, changing at a rate of 9.76% per 100bp change in yield. This means that if yields go up from 5% to 5.01% (a rise of 1bp) the price should fall by roughly 0.0976% or a change in price from $61.0271 per $100 notional to roughly $60.968. The original $100 invested will fall to roughly $99.90. The annuity has the lowest sensitivity, roughly half that of the <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond,</b> with a modified duration of 4.72%.|$|E

50|$|The price {{sensitivity}} to parallel {{changes in the}} term structure of interest rates is highest with a <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond</b> and lowest with an amortizing bond (where the payments are front-loaded). Although the amortizing bond and the <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bond</b> have different sensitivities at the same maturity, if their final maturities differ so that they have identical bond durations they will have identical sensitivities. That is, their prices will be affected equally by small, first-order, (and parallel) yield curve shifts. They will, however, start to change by different amounts with each further incremental parallel rate shift due to their differing payment dates and amounts.|$|E

40|$|Prices and {{yields of}} UK {{government}} <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> {{are used to}} test alternative yield curve estimation models. <b>Zero-coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> permit a more pure comparison, as the models are providing only the interpolation service and also not making estimation feasible. It is found that better yield curves estimates are obtained by fitting to the yield curve directly rather than fitting first to the discount function. A simple procedure to set the smoothness of the fitted curves is developed, and {{a positive relationship between}} over-smoothness and the fitting error is identified. A cubic spline function fitted directly to the yield curve provides the best overall balance of fitting error and smoothness, both along the yield curve and within local maturity regions.
