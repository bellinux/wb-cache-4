5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt <b>zone</b> <b>defense,</b> which is considered to be an unconventional <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{finished}} with an 11–3 record in 1963 {{and faced the}} Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field in Chicago, the Giants' defense played well, but the Bears newly invented <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> intercepted Tittle five times and battered him throughout the game. Sherman resisted calls from players such as linebacker Sam Huff to replace the struggling Tittle. The Giants defense held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers {{were once}} again criticized for poor {{tackling}} and conservative play-calling following a loss to a previously winless St. Louis Cardinals team. This time, complaints came from the players as the Cardinals seemed to know in advance which plays the Buccaneers would be running, and the Buccaneers waited until {{too late in the}} game to make adjustments. The Buccaneers led early, after Steve DeBerg's touchdown pass to Calvin Magee on a fake field goal. Steve Young's rushing and passing combined for 304 of the Buccaneers' 347 yards. The Cardinals unexpectedly used a soft <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> instead of their usual blitzing, which contributed to Tampa Bay's decision to avoid the passing game until the fourth quarter. The Cardinals put the game away with Stump Mitchell's 31-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, in which three Buccaneers missed tackles. Ron Holmes, Jeremiah Castille, Marvin Powell, and Gerald Carter all missed the game with injuries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zone</b> <b>defenses</b> are allowed.|$|R
5000|$|Each zone has a base {{defense of}} 8, {{which may be}} {{modified}} with cards. A <b>zone's</b> <b>defense</b> may be lowered by damaging it, usually by attacking from the Battlefield. Once a <b>zone's</b> <b>defense</b> is at or below zero, that zone is destroyed. (The player can still use it as normal, but it is marked with a [...] "burning" [...] token.) The player who succeeds at destroying {{at least two of}} their opponent's zones wins the game.|$|R
50|$|The AAFC {{played a}} 14-game {{schedule}} {{more than a}} decade before the NFL, and {{played a major role in}} popularizing <b>zone</b> <b>defenses</b> in pro football.|$|R
5|$|On the Packers' first drive, Rodgers {{failed to}} {{recognize}} the Bears' <b>zone</b> <b>defense,</b> having expected a man-to-man defense, and Shea McClellin escaped Don Barclay's block and, along with Isaiah Frey, pulled Rodgers down, who landed {{on his shoulder and}} injured his left collarbone, and was replaced by Seneca Wallace {{for the remainder of the}} game. Afterwards, Mason Crosby kicked the 30-yard field goal to give the Packers the lead. On Chicago's first drive, McCown escaped pressure from Mike Neal and threw towards Brandon Marshall for the 7–3 lead. Once the Packers got the ball back, Wallace's pass for Jordy Nelson was tipped and intercepted by Julius Peppers, and was returned 14 yards to Green Bay's 45-yard line, but after the Bears failed to convert on third down, Adam Podlesh's punt was blocked by Jamari Lattimore. Eventually, James Starks ran 32 yards for the touchdown. However, the Bears traveled 60 yards on two plays, and Forté scored on the 1-yard run. The Bears ended the first half with Robbie Gould's 24-yard field goal to expand the lead to 17–10. In the third quarter, the Packers forced the Bears to punt, and Lacy ran 56 yards to the Bears' 1, and scored on the ensuing play. On the eventual kickoff, the Packers successfully attempted a surprise onside kick, which was recovered by Lattimore. Crosby kicked a 23-yarder on the drive. On the Bears' next drive, McCown threw a six-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, whose size kept the ball from being knocked away by Davon House. After both teams exchanged punts in the fourth quarter, on the Bears' next drive, began attempting to run out the clock. On 4th and 1 at the Bears' 32 with 7:50 remaining, Forté ran three yards for the conversion and continuing the drive, which ended with Gould's 27-yard field goal. The drive lasted 18 plays and took up 8:58, leaving only 50 seconds remaining in the game. Despite a 15-yard pass by Wallace to Nelson, sacks by Corey Wootton and McClellin ended the game with a 27–20 victory for the Bears.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{defensive}} strategies: <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> and man-to-man defense. In a <b>zone</b> <b>defense,</b> each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a trap. In a man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards a specific opponent.|$|E
25|$|Raymundo had a {{tough time}} against SLR's <b>zone</b> <b>defense.</b> With Sta. Lucia {{erecting}} a double-digit lead, Purefoods managed to cut to seven but Chico Lanete's turnover in a fastbreak attempt ended the Giants' hopes of a comeback.|$|E
5000|$|Quick passing is an {{important}} element of attacking any <b>zone.</b> The <b>defense</b> will shift as the ball moves, but if the offense can move the ball faster than the defense can react, open shots can result. Quick passing against a zone often leads to open three-point shots, and <b>zone</b> <b>defenses</b> are less effective against teams with good three-point shooters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Zone</b> <b>defenses</b> {{requires}} that a defender cover an {{area on the}} court, and does not follow a check, but covers a check that comes into their area.|$|R
50|$|Sarachek {{designed}} and implemented motion offenses, trapping defenses, plays to beat <b>zone</b> <b>defenses</b> and creative in-bound plays. His schemes were admired and copied by coaches around the country.|$|R
25|$|Despite Revis' {{outstanding}} season, {{he was not}} {{an ideal}} fit for Tampa Bay's defensive system. When Lovie Smith was hired to replace Greg Schiano, he brought his Tampa 2 defense with him, a <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> that is focused on an elite middle linebacker, not a shutdown corner. Revis, being an elite man-to-man cornerback, was rumored to be on the trading block because of his large $16 million salary for the 2014 season.|$|E
25|$|After obtaining ball {{possession}} with 1:58 left, the Wildcats {{went into}} a four corners offense and held the ball until the closing seconds of the half, a tactic that was legal because a shot clock was not instituted in college basketball until the 1985–86 season. Georgetown was playing a 1–3–1 <b>zone</b> <b>defense,</b> allowing the Wildcats to execute their strategy. In one of four times during the game that Villanova maintained possession for over 45 seconds, Pressley made a shot to put his team up 29–28. A long-distance shot by Wingate missed as time ran {{out in the first}} half, and the arm of Georgetown forward Williams made contact with the face and neck of Villanova reserve Chuck Everson; no foul was called, but Villanova assistant coach Marty Marback credited the encounter with giving his team energy going into the halftime break.|$|E
25|$|In another Regional Final {{overtime}} game (and {{a preview}} of a future Big East rivalry), West Virginia opened up the game at a blistering pace, using five three-pointers to jump out to a 19-5 lead. When Joe Herber made a three, West Virginia had a 32-13 lead with 5:30 {{to play in the}} first half. West Virginia led by thirteen at halftime, but Louisville finally went to a <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> coming out of the half, and West Virginia began to go cold. Louisville cut the lead to three nine minutes into the second half, but Kevin Pittsnogle extended the West Virginia lead to ten with six minutes to play with a three. But West Virginia missed their last four field goals and Louisville tied the game with 38 seconds to play on Larry O'Bannon's layup. Louisville had grabbed the momentum and scored sixteen points in overtime to secure a berth in the Final Four.|$|E

25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Bears quarterback Jim McMahon {{increased}} the Bears lead to 14-0 with a 23-yard {{touchdown pass to}} receiver Dennis McKinnon. Later in the quarter, with Chicago facing second and 12 on their own 34, the Giants made another key error. The Giants defense {{came out of the}} huddle planning for a massive blitz, but decided to switch to a <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> after reading the Bears formation. However, half the defenders were unable to hear the new play call over the roaring crowd at Soldier Field and ended up blitzing, leaving receiver Tim Wrightman completely uncovered. McMahon threw the ball to Wrightman for a 46-yard gain, and then finished the drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to McKinnon on the next play, making the final score of the game 21-0. The Bears could have had a much larger lead, but the normally reliable rookie kicker Kevin Butler had an uncharacteristically bad day, missing three field goal attempts from distances of 26, 49 and 38 yards.|$|E
25|$|On the Jets' second possession, Namath threw deep to Maynard, who, {{despite his}} pulled hamstring, was open by a step. The ball was overthrown, {{but this one}} play helped change {{the outcome of the}} game. Fearing the speedy Maynard, the Colts decided to rotate their <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> to help cover Maynard, leaving Sauer covered {{one-on-one}} by Lenny Lyles, helping Sauer catch 8 passes for 133 yards, including a crucial third quarter 39-yard reception that kept a scoring drive alive. The Jets kept rushing Snell to their strong left, rushing off tackle with Boozer blocking the linebacker, and gained first down after first down as the Colts defense gave ground. The Colts defense was more concerned about Maynard, the passing game, and the deep threat of a Namath to Maynard touchdown. Although the Colts were unaware of Maynard's injury, the Jets were aware that Lyles had been weakened by tonsillitis all week, causing them great glee when they saw the one-on-one matchup with Sauer.|$|E
500|$|On defense, {{the team}} was known for {{employing}} Beilein's trademark trapping 1–3–1 halfcourt <b>zone</b> <b>defense,</b> which required opponents to be skilled at perimeter passing. [...] The <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> was generally employed after made baskets and dead-ball situations. After offensive misses or turnovers, the Wolverines relied on man-to-man defense. Depending on the matchups the team also used a 2–3 <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> because the team {{did not have the}} type of athletes necessary to play on the wings of his 1–3–1. It employed the 1–3–1 less later in the season, and about ten percent of opponent possessions altogether. In total, the team used some sort of <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> about 40 percent of the time. [...] The team was also among the top 35 (of over 300) in the nation in terms of three-point shot defense.|$|E
5000|$|Other <b>zone</b> <b>defenses</b> {{are more}} {{tailored}} to the offense that is being used, such as the 2-3-1 zone, in which the defensive players mirror the offensive players positioning, but when offensive players rotate, they are [...] "passed off" [...] to the next zone, rather than being followed as in a man defense system.|$|R
30|$|Several factors {{explain the}} {{relatively}} small expected annual WUI <b>defense</b> <b>zone</b> area burned (11.8 ha yr− 1). First, this analysis focused on the 2500 ha federally managed WUI <b>defense</b> <b>zone,</b> a relatively small buffer (400 m) {{on one side of}} the linear boundary between public and private land in the WUI, rather than on the much larger area of the privately owned WUI. For example, a wildfire that is 1000 m wide where it crosses the public-private boundary will burn just 40 ha of WUI <b>defense</b> <b>zone</b> (1000 m × 400 m), whereas several times that amount of private-land WUI could be burned beyond this buffer zone. Second, expected annual WUI <b>defense</b> <b>zone</b> area burned incorporates the likelihood that wildfires will reach any part of the WUI <b>defense</b> <b>zone,</b> which is relatively low (8.4 % of all fire starts; 2.5 % considering the RO rules). The conditional mean WUI <b>defense</b> <b>zone</b> area burned (of the fires that do reach the <b>defense</b> <b>zone)</b> is 465 ha, which corresponds to roughly 11.6 km of public-private boundary burned.|$|R
50|$|When a team plays a zone, the {{defenders}} must keep their {{hands up and}} in passing lanes and quickly adjust their positions as the ball and the offensive players move around. Teams that successfully play <b>zone</b> <b>defenses</b> are very vocal and effectively communicate where they, the ball, and their opponents are or will be.|$|R
500|$|Videoball {{designer}} Tim Rogers {{describes the}} game as [...] "an abstract minimalist electronic sport". Its development began as a dare from QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, Rogers's friend, to make a [...] "one-button StarCraft". Rogers compared the game's design process to Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, where Ramsay convinces failing restaurants to provide fewer menu options and to make those dishes well. Polygon Tracey Lien discussed their process as [...] "chasing a certain purity" [...] and mentioned the strong role of strategy in playing the game. Rogers noted basketball-like strategy in prototype games, with players positioned as center or forward positions or playing <b>zone</b> <b>defense.</b> He livestreams prerelease sessions of Videoball via Twitch. The game is expected for release in 2014 with cross-platform multiplayer and support {{for more than six}} simultaneous players.|$|E
500|$|From {{his first}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) college games for DePaul on, Mikan {{dominated}} his peers. He intimidated opponents with his size and strength, was unstoppable on offense with his hook shot, and soon established {{a reputation as}} one of the hardest and grittiest players in the league, often playing through injuries and punishing opposing centers with hard fouls. In addition, Mikan also surprised the basketball world with his unique ability of goaltending, i.e. jumping so high that he swatted the ball away before it could pass the hoop. In today's basketball, touching the ball after it reaches its apex is a violation, but in Mikan's time it was legal because people thought it was impossible anyone could reach that high. [...] "We would set up a <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> that had four men around the key and I guarded the basket", Mikan later recalled his DePaul days. [...] "When the other team took a shot, I'd just go up and tap it out." [...] As a consequence, the NCAA and later the NBA, outlawed goaltending. One of the few opposing centers to have any success against Mikan was Bob Kurland, a seven-footer from Oklahoma A.|$|E
500|$|The game {{began with}} a tipoff between Kansas' seven foot tall Wilt Chamberlain and North Carolina's Tommy Kearns, who was not even six feet tall. Coach Frank McGuire sent out Kearns {{after he had been}} talking down Chamberlain the night before. The rest of the North Carolina squad set up in their <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> rather than around the center circle per McGuire's request to [...] "show them the zone we were going to use." [...] The Jayhawks were unable to score on their opening {{possession}} and set up in their defense as the Tar Heels came down the court with the ball. Kansas' initial defense was a boxandone, which consisted of four players in a box around a basket while one player, Maurice King, played defense on North Carolina's Lennie Rosenbluth. Kearns received a pass along the baseline and was fouled in the act of shooting. Kearns missed the shot, but made both free throws to give Carolina the early 20 lead. Kansas missed a jump shot, and North Carolina's Joe Quigg converted a 12-foot baseline shot. Kansas scored their first points off of two free throws.|$|E
5000|$|Unless {{trapping}} is involved, <b>zone</b> <b>defenses</b> typically don't involve aggressive {{pressure on}} the ball handler and allow the offensive team to easily pass the ball around the perimeter. This can allow the offense to use more time before a shot is attempted, an advantage for teams wanting to slow the tempo of a game.|$|R

500|$|On December 20, 2009, Warren {{announced}} {{his decision to}} forgo his final season of collegiate eligibility and enter the 2010 NFL Draft. [...] Warren stated that the NFL's Draft Advisory Board advised {{him that if he}} entered the draft, he would be selected in the first three rounds. [...] When Warren signed Drew Rosenhaus as his sports agent, he was projected as a first or second round draft choice. [...] Warren was considered to be a man-to-man defense specialist who needed to develop his <b>zone</b> <b>defense</b> skills. [...] Some sources, such as Todd McShay, who felt he was just a cut below the top five cornerbacks in the draft prior to the 2010 NFL Combine, had predicted that Warren could be selected in the second round. [...] ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper, Jr. predicted Warren would be drafted in the third or fourth round of the draft, describing him as “a physical corner" [...] who [...] "likes going head to head on an island with the best receivers in the country, he’s never had an issue with that. Anticipation is good. Gambler, though. Gave up some big plays.” [...] Warren aggravated an ankle injury shortly before the NFL Combine, where he struggled in position drills and ran the 40-yard dash in 4.59 seconds. His disappointing performance was cited as damaging his draft stock.|$|E
500|$|The {{title game}} {{was held on}} March 27 in Northwestern University's Patten Gymnasium. Oregon's {{opponent}} was Ohio State, who had won the East Regional by winning against Wake Forest and Villanova. Oregon {{took advantage of the}} Buckeyes' defense, which was designed to stop Gale and Wintermute, by using Gale as [...] "a decoy", in his words. This created an opportunity for contributions from the Webfoots' other players, including Dick, who led both teams by scoring 15 points. On Ohio State's offensive possessions, the Webfoots used a match-up <b>zone</b> <b>defense,</b> as Hobson sought to force the Buckeyes into attempting long-distance shots. The defense held the Buckeyes' field goal percentage to 17 percent for the game; in addition, Oregon gained a rebounding advantage. The Webfoots held a five-point lead at halftime, having led by as much as seven. After Ohio State closed to within one point, Oregon pulled away in the second half to win the national championship, 46–33. Afterward came what Dick termed [...] "a two-handed trophy presentation"; during the game, Anet had broken a figure {{off the top of the}} championship trophy while attempting to gain possession of the ball by the sideline. On the team's way back to the University of Oregon, a crowd of 2,000–3,000 people greeted the Webfoots in The Dalles, Dick's birthplace, and presented him with what Sporting News writer Joe Gergen called [...] "the first championship watch in NCAA Tournament history." [...] The train stopped in several other cities on the way to Eugene, where a parade was held for the Webfoots.|$|E
500|$|The {{first two}} {{victories}} qualified Michigan {{to appear in}} the tournament final four at the Madison Square Garden where the unranked Wolverines team upset the #4 ranked UCLA Bruins men's basketball team for its first win over a top-five team in eleven years on November 20, 2008. The 55–52 win also ended a twelve-game losing streak against ranked opponents. [...] During the game, Michigan forced 17 UCLA turnovers with its 1–3–1 <b>zone</b> <b>defense.</b> [...] Nonetheless, Michigan fell behind by as many as 10 points {{at one point in the}} game. [...] In the first half, the Wolverines shot 31.3% from the field, and in the second half, they shot 61.9%, including 4 of 8 on three-point shots. [...] Michigan trailed by two with 4 minutes and 16 seconds left before Stu Douglass made a three-point basket and Sims scored a few possessions later after a steal. [...] In the final seconds UCLA's Nikola Dragovic hit a 3-point shot with five seconds left to reduce Michigan's four-point lead to one. Then UCLA sent Harris to the line where he made two free throws. In the final seconds Michigan defended an attack by Darren Collison who had his final shot blocked by Harris. [...] At that point in the season, Michigan used DeShawn Sims as a sixth man. He played 28 minutes off the bench and led the team in scoring with 18 while being tied for the lead with 5 rebounds. Despite losing to #10 ranked (#5 in the Coaches' Poll) Duke the following night, the Wolverines began receiving votes in the 2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings for the week of November 24.|$|E
