50|$|Ashanti region's capital Kumasi {{metropolis}} has 5 {{electric power}} transmission bulk supply points with 231 kilometers of overhead lines and 140.6 kilometers underground cables as the status of electrical grid supply from the Kumasi metropolis grid to the 10 submetros of the Kumasi metropolis is generally good. Ashanti region's electricity generation is fueled by biomass from Ashanti regions vast timber deposits and solar panels and zero-carbon housing are prevalent in Kumasi metropolis and Ashanti region as solar energy technology is a major energy source to zero-carbon housing in Kumasi metropolis and Ashanti region with solar energy being a major contributor of electricity generation in Kumasi metropolis and Ashanti region contributing to Kumasi metropolis as a zero-carbon city with a <b>zero-carbon</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ashanti {{region with}} Kumasi {{metropolis}} has 99% of {{the timber industry}} of Ghana, and the Kaasai Industrial Area in Kumasi metropolis {{plays an important role}} in the Ashanti region and Kumasi metropolis industry with the Kumasi metropolis submetro Suame's renowned Suame Magazine amiable indigenous automobile and light industrial hub where small engineering based industries are sited is recognised as an efficient mechanical and electrical and car body building workshop, and Suame Magazine contributes immensely to the engineering based industries economy of Kumasi metropolis as Suame Magazine is the largest industrial area in Kumasi metropolis. Ashanti region capital Kumasi is renowned for its local enterprise and artisan skills, particularly in the areas of furniture-making and vehicle engineering. Woodwork, leatherwork and textile production (especially the traditional 'kente' cloth) are established skills amongst the Ashanti region local population. Significant non-traditional skills are also present in Ashanti region capital Kumasi’s workforce, for example the broad range of metalworking shops within the 'Suame Magazine'. Ashanti people automobile company Kantanka cars mass-manufactures various brands of Kantanka zero-carbon electric cars contributing to Kumasi metropolis as a zero-carbon city with a <b>zero-carbon</b> <b>economy</b> at the Ashanti automobile company Kantanka major automobile assembly plant situated in Kumasi which mass-manufactures the various brands of Kantanka vehicles as well as Kantanka robots (robotics) and mass media diversified media technologies including various major appliances for Kumasi metropolis consumers and Ashanti region consumers.|$|E
50|$|Moving to a low- and <b>zero-carbon</b> {{regional}} <b>economy</b> could attract organisations {{serving the}} technical needs {{of such an}} economy.

50|$|Some {{nations are}} {{presently}} low carbon: societies {{that are not}} heavily industrialised or populated. In order to avoid climate change on a global level, all nations considered carbon intensive societies, and societies that are heavily populated might have to become <b>zero-carbon</b> societies and <b>economies.</b> Several of these countries have pledged to cut their emissions by 100% via offsetting emissions rather than ceasing all emissions (carbon neutrality); in other words, emitting will not cease but will continue and will be offset to a different geographical area. EU emission trading system allows companies to buy international carbon credits, thus the companies can channel clean technologies to promote other countries to adopt low-carbon developments.|$|R
40|$|Published in {{collaboration}} with Florence School of Regulation at the European University InstituteWhat is the road ahead for European energy policy? This yearbook covers {{the whole range of}} EU energy law and policy from the 20 - 20 - 20 strategy and new initiatives for ensuring security of supply to the application of competition rules and the organisation of an efficient technology policy. The book expresses the viewpoints of all relevant actors. The complete conference discussions are included. It covers recent developments in EU energy policy in the framework of the agenda of the new Commission. The new EU Energy Policy: - Roadmap for European industry towards a <b>zero-carbon</b> <b>economy</b> by 2050 - European Parliament expectation from the new Commission Energy Security - EU’s Strategic Energy Technology Plan - the proposed regulation on security of gas supply The 20 - 20 - 20 Goal and Beyond - the new renewables Directive - the revised European emissions trading scheme (ETS...|$|E
40|$|Non-{{renewable}} {{and renewable}} resources are imperfect substitutes due to technical and geographical constraints. What {{is the role}} of imperfect substitution on the optimal transition path to the clean technologies? We address this question by characterizing the optimal growth path and resource use of an economy. We show that the economy initially starts with using the non-renewable and renewable resources simultaneously and gradually increases the share of renewable. The outcome can be either (i) the economy switches to a backstop at a certain date or (ii) the initial regime lasts forever. The results show that the economy converges to a steady state even if the backstop is too costly and a green, <b>zero-carbon</b> <b>economy</b> is the optimal final state in any case. We also present some simulation results to illustrate the shapes of the optimal paths. This analysis allows us to discuss the policy implications and question the existence of the Green Paradox...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change is}} an {{important}} problem. It would be desirable to have legislation that would put Ireland on a low-cost and equitable trajectory to a <b>zero-carbon</b> <b>economy.</b> The draft Climate Change Response Bill 2010 will not achieve that. The exact emission reduction targets for 2020 are ambiguous, but considerably more ambitious than Ireland?s obligations under EU legislation. EU legislation severely constrains the options for domestic climate policy so that the extra emission reduction would fall almost exclusively on agriculture, households, small and medium enterprises, and transport. The target in the draft bill for 2020 would require draconian policies. It {{would be better to}} keep the EU targets for 2020. The targets for 2030 and 2050 would require a further sharpening of climate policy. It would be better to base climate policy on predictably rising carbon prices. The draft bill fails to create a framework that would ensure that policy interventions are effective, as cheap as possible, and fair. Current policy meets none of these criteria. The Regulatory Impact Analysis is a collection of qualitative assertions that shed little light on the impact of the draft bill. The proposed National Climate Change Expert Advisory Body would need to acquire the appropriate expertise and be truly independent to fulfil its envisaged role...|$|E
