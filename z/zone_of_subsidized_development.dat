40|$|Should the {{deconcentration}} {{of poverty}} be a leading objective of federal housing policy? No. Deconcentrating poverty is a smokescreen. It camouflages forced relocation of low-income house-holds. What do we mean {{when we talk}} about deconcentrating poverty? As it has been implemented to date, deconcentration has meant manipulating the spatial arrangement <b>of</b> federally <b>subsidized</b> low-income families to either disperse or dilute poverty. Dispersal is accomplished through (1) pro-viding vouchers to subsidized families who wish to move out <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> <b>developments</b> that have concentrations of poverty, or (2) forcing the movement <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> families through the demolition and redevelopment <b>of</b> their <b>subsidized</b> communities. Dilution is accomplished through redevelop-ment that reduces the number <b>of</b> low-income <b>subsidized</b> units in a given site and mixing them with units to be occupied by middle-class households induced into moving in. Thus, although deconcentra-ting poverty has the sound of a sweeping and comprehensive effort, in reality it is much less than that. In the end, it is simply the spatial rearrangement <b>of</b> federally <b>subsidized</b> low-income households. Federally sponsored poverty deconcentration initiatives have had this narrow focus, despite the fact that we can imagine a much wider range of policy options to deconcentrate poverty. For example, we might mount an assault on the restrictive and exclusionary practices of predominantly affluen...|$|R
40|$|Neighborhood walkability can {{influence}} individual health, social interactions, and environmental quality, but {{the relationships between}} subsidized households and their walkable environment have not been sufficiently examined in previous empirical studies. Focusing on two types <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing <b>developments</b> (Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and Public Housing (PH)) in Austin, Texas, this study evaluates the neighborhood walkability <b>of</b> place-based <b>subsidized</b> households, utilizing objectively measured Walk Score and walking-related built environment data. We also used U. S. Census block group data {{to account for the}} socio-demographic covariates. Based on various data, we employed bivariate and multivariate analyses to specify the relationships between subsidized households and their neighborhood walkable environment. The results of our bivariate analyses show that LIHTC households tend to be located in car-dependent neighborhoods and have more undesirable walking-related built environment conditions compared with non-LIHTC neighborhoods. Our regression results also represent that LIHTC households {{are more likely to be}} exposed to neighborhoods with low Walk Score, less sidewalk coverage, and more highways and major roads, while there are no significant associations for PH households. These findings imply that more attention and effort toward reducing the inequitable distributions of walkable neighborhood features supporting rather than hindering healthy lifestyles must be provided to subsidized households...|$|R
40|$|Compared to the {{traditional}} public housing program, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program has been regarded as a better tool {{to ensure the quality}} of housing structure for subsidized households and the mixing of incomes in neighborhoods. Previous studies related to LIHTC developments have solely focused on the relationships between subsidized households and socioeconomic environments, such as income, race, poverty, etc. Beyond the socioeconomic environments where subsidized households are located, there is a limited understanding about whether subsidized households experience healthier natural environments in their neighborhoods. This study aims to investigate whether LIHTC-subsidized housing neighborhoods provide adequate natural environments to the subsidized households in Austin, Texas, compared to the public housing households. We employ comparison t-tests and binomial logistic regression models. The results show that LIHTC households are significantly exposed to unhealthy natural environmental settings such as a lack of green vegetation and steep slopes while no statistical evidence is reported for public housing neighborhoods. Findings from this study may help policymakers and planners improve their understanding <b>of</b> whether <b>subsidized</b> housing <b>developments</b> offer better natural environments for disadvantaged populations and help them develop effective environmental intervention strategies to improve the quality <b>of</b> life <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> households...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of Mexico City's urban sprawl, this thesis investigates one specific type of territorial occupation: the urbanization <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing <b>developments</b> on the periphery, which accounts for 17 % of the city's total urban footprint, and has generated unlivable neighborhoods. Understanding urban design {{as a tool to}} critically address Mexico City's current mode of expansion, the thesis proposes strategies to revert this process. More specifically, it develops a conceptual as well as a design solution at four scales: a project for the city; a new paradigm for the existing housing developments; an urban design intervention for three of these developments; and a set of new building typologies to replace the current housing model. This approach that engages with Mexico City's urban problems through an analysis of the periphery has been previously neglected. With this study, I hope to open a broader discussion on urban design, and the role it can play in the future of Mexico City. by Gabriel Kozlowski. Thesis: S.

40|$|This review {{evaluates the}} {{perception}} that subsidized housing results in negative neighborhood impacts by considering four commonly studied putative impacts <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing location: property values, racial transition, poverty concen-tration, and crime. The authors assess theoretical and meth-odological bases for discerning impacts and determine which study results inspire confidence. Research reveals a relation-ship between the presence <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing and both property values and crime in certain circumstances, with {{both positive and negative}} impacts, and suggests that the presence <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing does not lead to racial transi-tion. Research on the impact <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing on poverty concentration is too flawed methodologically to permit con-clusions. Future research must, among other steps, control for variability of impacts across types of neighborhoods, use data that distinguish between residents <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> and nonsubsidized housing, and take into account changing atti-tudes as well as the context in which housing is proposed. Few proposed land uses raise the ire of neighbors as much as subsidized housing. 1 The pariah-like status <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing stems from American attitudes toward race, class, and poverty. These cultural percep-tions manifest themselves in concern that subsidized housing will harm property values, encourage white flight, cause poverty concentration, and increase crime rates in surrounding neighborhoods. These perceptions about the effects <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing on neighborhoods have provided raw material for some of the great planning stories of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, including the classic Myerson and Banfield (1955) study of how public housing sites were chosen in Chicago; Mario Cuomo’s (1974) grip-ping depiction of community resistance to public hous...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{parastatal}} food-distribution organizations are less effective when their agents vary the quality <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> food and retail service (henceforth "quality") {{in response to}} local market conditions. These actions make assessing need from market signals difficult, hindering the effective allocation <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> food. In theory, policies and market conditions can affect outcomes (quality, demand, rationing and pilferage) differently, depending upon how markets for subsidized rice clear. We provide tests to reveal which market clearing mechanism is relevant. Using administrative and household survey data, we …nd evidence of quality variations, pilferage and market clearing through ad-hoc rationing <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> rice in the Philippines. Poorer markets and those facing higher rice prices do not receive more subsidized rice, but do appear to receive lower quality service and smaller rations. This may explain why the nationwide incidence of hunger rose with rice prices in poorer areas during 2003 - 2007 despite costly subsidies. We recommend explicit rationing rules, increased transparency regarding rice allotments and measured reductions in the amount <b>of</b> <b>subsidized</b> rice distributed...|$|R

40|$|While it is {{currently}} uncertain {{whether or not a}} Canadian orphan drug policy will be given further consideration any time in the near future, this thesis seeks to consider the potential impact that three different orphan drug incentives could be expected to have in Canada. Specifically, market exclusivity, priority review vouchers, and a tax credit for orphan drug development are evaluated. This thesis is primarily informed by the literature about how orphan drug incentives operate in the United States. Admittedly, there is controversy about whether orphan drug policies in their current form are justifiable. This controversy is discussed, with this thesis proceeding on the basis that morality and a commitment to equality validate providing some form of orphan drug incentive(s) in Canada. That being said, it is unclear how exactly “orphan drug” should be defined and, accordingly, what criteria should govern the allocation of incentives. Market exclusivity appears to be effective at encouraging investment in orphan drugs and therefore it is recommended that the incentive be implemented in Canada in order to encourage foreign drug companies to obtain market authorisation from Health Canada for orphan drugs. Priority review voucher programs are still in their infancy and, therefore, it is difficult to make any strong assertions about the effect and impact of these programs. It is nevertheless not recommended that vouchers be introduced in Canada because it is unlikely that priority review here will be sufficiently valuable to have an impact. An orphan drug-specific tax credit offers a convenient means <b>of</b> <b>subsidizing</b> orphan drug <b>development</b> without being expected to be overly costly, given the narrow parameters within which the credit would operate. Therefore, a Canadian tax credit for orphan drug development is also recommended...|$|R
