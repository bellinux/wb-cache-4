40|$|Layered zinc {{hydroxide}} sulphate (ZHS) was prepared by microwave-assisted hydrothermal precipitation of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> with hexamethylenetetramine. Under ambient conditions, {{the structure of}} ZHS determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) {{was found to be}} a mixture of {{zinc hydroxide}} sulphate pentahydrate Zn 4 SO 4 (OH) 6 · 5 H 2 O and tetrahydrate Zn 4 SO 4 (OH) 6 · 4 H 2 O. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used for characterization of the prepared materials. Based on the interpretation of ZHS's thermal decomposition profile obtained by thermogravimetric analysis, ZnO of high purity was prepared by calcination at 900 C for 2 h. The structure of the resulting ZnO was confirmed by the XRD. The morphology examination by scanning electron microscopy revealed a porous mesh-like ZnO structure developed from the ZHS precursor at the expense of mass removal due to the release of water and sulphate during the calcination. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The grown crystals {{were subjected to}} powder X-ray diffraction study that confirms {{the change in the}} lattice parameters and quality of the crystal, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy ensures the functional groups, UV-Visible analysis which reveals the optical transmittance, lower cutoff wavelength and band gap, and Energy dispersive X-ray analysis gives chemical composition and confirms the inclusion of the dopant into the grown pure LSMH single crystal. Introduction. The investigation of NLO materials have gained predominant attention in current research owing to their applications in the technology of information transmission and processing. It is evident that the NLO crystals have exceptional technological requirements such as wide transparency range, fast response and high damage threshold. Due to such distinct optical properties, synthesis and growth of unique materials are in progress. The most widely used materials in photonic technologies are mainly inorganic crystals based on Borates and Phosphates. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> Li 2 So 4 H 2 o (LSMH) is also one such inorganic highly NLO active materials [1 - 4]. The crystal structure and space group of Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> were originally determined as monoclinic point group P 21 by G. E. Ziegler (1934) [5]. A detailed study on the redetermination, further refinement and inclusion of hydrogen's position of Li 2 So 4 H 2 o structure were reported [6 - 8]. It is explored from the literature that the Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has remarkable piezoelectric and electro-optic properties. Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> has highest pyroelectric effects among the non-ferroelectric polar crystals [9]. Earlier researches show that Lithium found to be effective NLO material on its combination with Selenate, Glycine and Bromide [10 - 12]. Since there is large demand for crystal in electronic industries, it is required to synthesize NLO material and to improve the properties of existing materials. Considering the facts, ethylene diamine tetra acetate and Cu II doped Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>Monohydrate</b> single crystals have been synthesized and shown as promising candidate for optical second harmonic generation [13 - 14]. In the present work {{attempts have been made to}} enhance the physical properties of single crystals by incorporating bivalent metal dopant. The presence of very low concentration of suitable additives enhances crystalline perfection [14]. Therefore, we present the Synthesis of grown Lithium <b>Sulphate</b> <b>monohydrate</b> single crystals containing 0. 1 mole percentage of <b>Zinc</b> <b>Sulphate</b> by slow evaporation method. The lattice parameters of doped crystals are evaluated by powder X-Ray diffraction study, Optical analysis and the presence of Zn has been determined by Energy dispersive X-ray analysis...|$|R

Oral or intraperitoneal pretreatment with <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> (20 mg/kg, expressed as zinc ion) strongly prevented ethanol-, but not indomethacin-induced gastric glandular ulceration. Indomethacin given beforehand did not influence the protective action of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> against ethanol-evoked lesions. Ethanol decreased histamine levels, whereas indomethacin reduced the prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) {{content in the}} gastric glandular mucosa.

Materials and methods: A Total of 60 patients with psoriasis vulgaris were recruited for the study during the period October 2006 to October 2007. The patients were divided in to three groups according to their systemic treatments, as follows: Patients in Group 1 (20 patients) were treated with oral <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate,</b> Group 2 (20 patients) were treated with <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> plus oral methotrexate and patients in Group 3 (20 patients) were treated with oral methotrexate alone. Results: There were 34 (56. 7 %) men and 26 (43. 3 %) women, with a male: female ratio 1. 3 : 1. Their age ranged from 15 - 70 years with a mean of 32 ± 11 years. Oral <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> produced a good response in about 60 % of the cases; with a relapse rate amounts to 58 % noticed 4 weeks after cessation of treatment. Combination of oral <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> and methotrexate induced a good response in 85 % of the patients, with a relapse rate of 59 % that was noticed 4 weeks after treatment cessation. Methotrexate alone induced a good response in 70 % of the patients with a relapse rate of 64 %. Mild adverse effects were reported in 30 % of the cases on <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> treatment. Conclusion: <b>Zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> is an effective treatment of psoriasis but the combination of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> plus methotrexate could be more effective than <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> or methotrexate alone.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{application of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> {{as an antidote}} to acetaminophen overdose was examined in ICR mice. Hepatotoxicity was induced by a single oral dose of acetaminophen (750 mg/kg). Various treatments (normal saline, 15 or 30 mg/kg <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate,</b> 150 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine, 15 mg/kg <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> + 150 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine) were given i. p. 1 h after acetaminophen overdose. Serum alanine aminotransferase, hepatic glutathione and malondialdehyde levels were measured before experiments and at various intervals after the administration of acetaminophen. Serum acetaminophen levels were also measured at different time intervals. <b>Zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> showed protection by dose-dependently reducing alanine aminotransferase and malondialdehyde levels. The drug also partially prevented the depletion of hepatic glutathione. These effects were not as good as those of N-acetylcysteine. However, the combination of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> with N-acetylcysteine produced even better protective effects. Furthermore, drug treatments did not affect serum acetaminophen levels. It is concluded that both drugs attenuate acetaminophen-induced hepatic toxicity, and the action is likely to be mediated through replenishment of hepatic glutathione levels. The use of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> alone or in combination with N-acetylcysteine could be another alternative for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose in view of possible side effects produced by N-acetylcysteine. © 1995 Elsevier Science B.

Results: In the case of P. confusa normal germination was observed in control, 120 ppm and 140 ppm and the germination of spores were failed in 160, 180 and 200 ppm of zinc supplemented cultures. In contrary, P. argyraea showed maximum percentage of spore germination in 140 ppm zinc supplemented cultures and the control and 120 ppm <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> supplemented cultures were failed to show the germination. The germination percentage and growth rate was decreased in high concentration of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Rhizoids are showed more tolerance to heavy metal than protonema of P. argyraea. Conclusion: Difference in response of spores to the heavy metal zinc may be due the difference in the hyper-accumulating capacity of the ferns...|$|R
40|$|Thallium {{poisoning}} {{is usually}} associated with typical dermatological features simulating that of zinc deficiency. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the role of oral <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> in the treatment of patients with thallium poisoning. Materials and methods: This clinical therapeutic trial study was conducted in Departments of Dermatology of Baghdad and Basrah Teaching Hospitals from February 2008 - February 2010, where a total of 37 patients with thallium poisoning were enrolled. A detailed history was taken from all patients and complete clinical examination was performed. All patients received <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> in a dose of 5 mg/kg three times a day few days before confirming the diagnosis of thallium poisoning. Thallium in urine had been measured using the colorimetric method and was positive in all patients. After confirming the diagnosis of thallium poisoning, thallium antidotes Prussian blue was given to 32 patients. Results: Age range of 37 patients was 5 - 33 (24 ± 5. 3) years. The dermatological findings were mainly: anagen hair loss affected the scalp and limbs. Also, dusky ecchymotic red dermatitis like rash was observed on the face and dorsum of hands and legs, while neurological manifestations were mainly of peripheral neuropathy, were reported in 21 (55 %) patients. All patients but two responded promptly to a trial of <b>zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> within few days. Conclusion: Oral <b>Zinc</b> <b>sulphate</b> appears to be an effective and safe treatment for thallium poisoning particularly for skin and hair features and in reducing its lethal progression and complications.
