It discusses racism in relation to <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being and <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being. Racism is discussed as a dehumanization related to the materiality of domination used by the world-system in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being (violence and dispossession) as opposed to the materiality of domination in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being (regulation and emancipation). The approach shows how intersectionality of oppressions work differently for oppressed people in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being as opposed to oppressed people in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being. While in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> being oppressions are mitigated by racial privilege, in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> non-being oppressions are aggravated by racial oppression...|$|R

40|$|Altogether sixty {{species of}} fusulinids are {{described}} from the Carboniferous Ichinotani Formation and the Permian Mizuyagadani Formation, Fukuji, Gifu Prefecture, Central Japan. Of them six species are new. They are Pseudostaffella minatoi, P. subrotunda, Fusulinella rhomboidalis, Triticites katoi, T. ichinotaniensis and T. elongatus. The following fusulind zones are established; <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Eostaffella, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pro-fusulinella, Lower <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Fusulinella-Fusulina, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Beedeina, Upper <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Fusulinella-Fusulina, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Triticites, <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pseudoschwagerina, and <b>Zone</b> <b>of</b> Pseudo-fusulina.
