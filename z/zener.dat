5|$|Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam are bipedal Pokémon {{characterized}} by their humanoid body structure and somewhat fox-like appearance. They {{look like they}} are wearing armor, as they have two pauldron-shaped pieces on their shoulders and a fauld-like piece around their chest. Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam have three fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot, with two toes in the front on either side {{and one in the}} back near the ankle. Abra and Kadabra also have thick tails the same gold color as the rest of its body, except for a brown band located near the top. Kadabra and Alakazam have relatively large mustaches, which are shorter in female species. Kadabra has a red star-shaped symbol on its forehead, and three red wavy lines on its fauld-like torso. After evolving into Alakazam, the creatures no longer have the <b>Zener</b> markings and tails, while their heads become much larger, resulting in extremely powerful mental powers. Alakazam undergoes slight changes upon Mega Evolving into Mega Alakazam, as its overall color scheme becomes slightly paler, it gains a white beard alongside its now white mustache, a considerably thinner torso, and a red gem-like organ on its forehead.|$|E
25|$|These {{can be made}} {{to conduct}} in reverse bias (backward), and are {{correctly}} termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called <b>Zener</b> breakdown, occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode {{to be used as a}} precision voltage reference. The term <b>Zener</b> diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking <b>Zener</b> diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, <b>Zener</b> and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage <b>Zener</b> diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or Transorb, a registered trademark).|$|E
25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} <b>Zener</b> diodes (and are often mistakenly called <b>Zener</b> diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the <b>Zener</b> is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E

Temperature ranges from liquid nitrogen up to values at which diffusion begins to take place. The experimental results are compared to the ones given by the <b>Zener's</b> and Taniguchi's theories. It is found that some alloys (Fe-Ni, Fe-Cr, Fe-V) follow <b>Zener's</b> law, i. e. Ku de cays with temperature according to the third power of the saturation magnetization Is, while other alloys show strong deviations from this law.

25|$|If the emitter-base {{junction}} is reverse biased into avalanche or <b>Zener</b> mode and charge flows {{for a short}} period of time, the current gain of the BJT will be permanently degraded.|$|E
25|$|At speed a dynamo can {{overpower}} the lamp, {{causing it}} to fail. Historically this was a nuisance, but modern lamps and dynamos often incorporate <b>Zener</b> diodes to prevent overvoltage, and dynamos can be designed to saturate beyond a certain voltage to protect the lamp.|$|E
25|$|These are {{actually}} JFETs with the gate shorted to the source, and function like a two-terminal current-limiting analog to the voltage-limiting <b>Zener</b> diode. They allow a current through them {{to rise to}} a certain value, and then level off at a specific value. Also called CLDs, constant-current diodes, diode-connected transistors, or current-regulating diodes.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} NPN transistor {{structure is}} often used in common bipolar processes as the antifuse. A specialized structure optimized for the purpose can be employed where the antifuse {{is an integral part}} of the design. The terminals of the antifuses are usually accessible as bonding pads and the trimming process is performed before wire-bonding and encapsulating the chip. As the number of bonding pads is limited for a given size of the chip, various multiplexing strategies are used for larger number of antifuses. In some cases a combined circuit with <b>zeners</b> and transistors can be used to form a zapping matrix; with additional <b>zeners,</b> the trimming (which uses voltages higher than the normal operational voltage of the chip) can be performed even after packaging the chip.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} exchange {{interactions in}} dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMS) based on ab initio calculations. The electronic structure of DMS is calculated {{on the basis}} of the density functional theory using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA). We show that there are two classes of DMS with very different properties. In systems with localized majority d-states deep in the valence band, the ferromagnetism is induced by <b>Zener's</b> p-d exchange interaction. This interaction is weak, but long ranged. For systems with impurity bands in the gap, the ferromagnetism is driven by <b>Zener's</b> double exchange mechanism. This interaction is very strong, but short ranged. Sophisticated Monte Carlo methods show that, for small concentrations, the percolation effect should be included to estimate the Curie temperatures of DMS. In particular, the ferromagnetism is strongly suppressed in double exchange systems due to the absence of percolation for low concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Based upon {{ab initio}} {{electronic}} structure calculations by the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) method within the local-density approximation (LDA), we propose a unified physical picture of magnetism and an accurate calculation method of Curie temperature (T-C) in dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) in II-VI and III-V compound semiconductors. We also propose the unified physical picture of magnetism in the DMS, where ferromagnetic <b>Zener's</b> double-exchange mechanism (or <b>Zener's</b> p-d exchange mechanism) {{caused by the}} partially occupied impurity band and anti-ferromagnetic super-exchange mechanism (or ferromagnetic super-exchange mechanism) is competing to determine the magnetic states in the DMS. We propose that the three-dimensional 3 D Dairiseki-phase and one-dimensional ID Konbu-phase caused by spinodal nano-decomposition are responsible for high-T-C phase in the inhomogeneous system. We propose the new methodology to go beyond LDA to describe the highly correlated electron system by {{taking into account the}} self-interaction correction (SIC) to the LDA...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} three dimensional {{finite element}} computations of thermoelastic damping ratios of arbitrary bodies using <b>Zener's</b> approach. In our small-damping formulation, unlike existing fully coupled formulations, the calculation is split into three smaller parts. Of these, the first sub-calculation involves routine undamped modal analysis using ANSYS. The second sub-calculation takes the mode shape, and solves {{on the same}} mesh a periodic heat conduction problem. Finally, the damping coefficient is a volume integral, evaluated elementwise. In the only other decoupled three dimensional computation of thermoelastic damping reported in the literature, the heat conduction problem is solved much less efficiently, using a modal expansion. We provide numerical examples using some beam-like geometries, for which <b>Zener's</b> and similar formulas are valid. Among these we examine tapered beams, including the limiting case of a sharp tip. The latter's higher-mode damping ratios dramatically exceed those of a comparable uniform beam...|$|R
25|$|During the program, another psychic {{was doing}} a sorting of 250 <b>Zener</b> cards, {{guessing}} which of the five symbols was on each one. Random guessing should have resulted in about fifty correct guesses, so it was agreed in advance that the psychic had to be right on at least eighty-two cards in order to demonstrate an ability greater than chance.

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are relatively insensitive to high and short-term transient voltages higher than surge voltage, if {{the frequency and}} the energy content of the transients are low.

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{study of}} thermoelastic damping {{can be found}} in <b>Zener’s</b> classical work, in 1937, in which he studied thermoelastic damping in beams undergoing flexural vibrations.

If the output voltage drops for any external reason, such as an increase in the current drawn by the load (causing a decrease in the Collector-Emitter junction voltage to observe KVL), the transistor's base–emitter voltage (UBE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again.|$|E

Static relays offer the advantage of higher sensitivity than purely electromechanical relays, because power to operate output contacts is derived from a separate supply, not from the signal circuits. Static relays eliminated or reduced contact bounce, and could provide fast operation, long life and low maintenance.|$|E

50|$|EL wire - {{in common}} {{with other types of}} EL devices - does have limitations: at high {{frequency}} it dissipates a lot of heat, and that can lead to breakdown and loss of brightness over time. Because the wire is unshielded and typically operates at a relatively high voltage, EL wire can produce high-frequency interference (corresponding to the frequency of the oscillator) that can be picked up by sensitive audio equipment, such as guitar pickups. There is also a voltage limit: typical EL wire breaks down at around 180V p-p, so if using an unregulated transformer back to back, <b>zeners</b> and series current limiting resistors are essential.|$|R

For the numerical resolution, we extend a mixed finite element method proposed in [8]. This method combines mass lumping with a centered explicit scheme for time discretization. For the resulting scheme, we prove a discrete energy decay result and provide a sufficient stability condition.

40|$|We propose {{materials}} {{design of}} high-T-C wide band-gap dilute magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) based on first-principles calculations {{by using the}} Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) method. First, we discuss a unified physical picture of ferromagnetism in II-VI and III-V DMSs and show that DMS family is categorized into two groups depending on the electronic structure. One is the system where <b>Zener's</b> double exchange mechanism dominates in the ferromagnetic interaction, {{and in the other}} systems <b>Zener's</b> p-d exchange mechanism dominates. Next, we develop an accurate method for T-C calculation for the DMSs and show that the mean field approximation completely fails to predict Curie temperature of DMS in particular for wide-gap DMS where the exchange interaction is short-ranged. The calculated T-C of homogeneous DMSs by using the present method agrees very well withavailable experimental values. For more realistic material design, we simulate spinodal nano-decomposition by applying the Monte Carlo method to the Ising model with ab initio chemical pair interactions between magnetic impurities in DMS. It is found that by controlling the dimensionality of the decomposition various characteristic phases occur in DMS such as 3 D Dairiseki-phase and 1 D Konbu-phase, and it is suggested that super-paramagnetic blocking phenomena should be important to understand the magnetism of wide-gap DMS. Based on the present simulations for spinodal nano-decomposition, we propose a new crystal growth method of positioning by seeding and shape controlling method in 100 Tera-bit density of nano-magnets in the semiconductor matrix with high-T-C (or high-T-B).
