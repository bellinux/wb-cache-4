40|$|Electrodeposition on {{aluminium}} alloy substrates often {{is often difficult}} in producing a coating with good adhesion {{when compared to other}} metals. This is due to the rapid formation of oxide layers on the substrate’s surface when exposed to air and water, preventing metallic bonds from forming between the nickel coating and the {{aluminium alloy}} substrate which in turn resulting in poor adhesion. Adhesion of the coating on the substrate influences the quality of the coating. To overcome this problem, a series of critical surface pre-treatment procedures are required for a successful electrodeposition process with a strong coating adhesion. The pre-treatment process consists of mechanical grinding and polishing, alkaline and acidic cleaning, <b>zincating</b> and activation process. This study focuses on the <b>zincating</b> process to obtain a strong adherence coating on the substrate. An aim {{of this study was to}} replace the complex double <b>zincating</b> process. To this end, modification has been made to a conventional single <b>zincating</b> process, as the process results in a non-homogenous deposition of zinc particles on the substrate which leads to a poor adhesion of the coating. The modified process, for which the duration of the single <b>zincating</b> process was extended from 1 to 20 minutes, was based on the electrochemistry measurements of aluminium alloy 7075 substrate in the zincatingsolution. For comparison, nickel coatings prepared using a double <b>zincating</b> process at 60 / 10, 60 / 20, 60 / 30, 60 / 40 and 60 / 50 seconds were also produced in this study. By replacing the double <b>zincating</b> with a modified single <b>zincating</b> process, two pre- treatment steps of double <b>zincating</b> process will be eliminated. Thus, the waste disposal problem in terms of the chemical used in the <b>zincating</b> solution is reduced. In addition, copper activation was applied before the single <b>zincating</b> process in order to overcome the high dissolution of the substrate in the <b>zincating</b> solution. The surface pre-treated samples were characterized after alkaline cleaning, acid cleaning, <b>zincating</b> process and copper activation at various immersion durations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The modified single zincated samples were found to contain larger zinc particles, as compared to the conventional single and double zincated samples. The modified single <b>zincating</b> process also showed an increasing trend in the nucleation density and size of zinc particles with time. A gradual decrease in the surface roughness values with the extension of the modified single <b>zincating</b> duration was also observed. Then, the influence of multiple <b>zincating</b> processes (conventional and modified single <b>zincating</b> with and without copper activation, and double <b>zincating)</b> at various durations on the coating adhesion was investigated using scratch adhesion test. Scratch failure modes were analysed using acoustic emission signals, frictional force, and microscopy observation. The conventional single <b>zincating</b> and double <b>zincating</b> processes resulted in poor adhesion of the nickel coatings to the substrate, as both the cohesive and adhesion failures occurred during the scratch test. The adhesion of the coating to the substrate was improved by extending the single <b>zincating</b> duration from 1 to 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes, with only cohesive failure found for the samples. This result was supported by the number of acoustic emission activity (NAE) events recorded during the test, which showed the highest NAE at about 130 for the sample produced from the conventional single <b>zincating</b> process. An increase in the <b>zincating</b> duration to 5 minutes resulted in a drastic reduction of the NAE to 30. The similar adhesion behaviour was also observed on modified single zincated samples with copper activation. The corrosion tests were carried out by immersing the coatings in a 3. 5 wt. % NaCl solution at room temperature. It was found that a modified single <b>zincating</b> process at a longer duration provided a significant enhancement of corrosion resistance as compared to the conventional single <b>zincating</b> process, due to the increase in corrosion potential and decrease in corrosion current density of the conventional single zincated sample. These much improved performance of coating adhesion and corrosion resistance maybe explained by homogenous distribution of zinc particles and good coverage of the zinc particles on the aluminium alloy substrate. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism {{is thought to}} proceed via a standard Pd catalyzed cross-coupling pathway, starting with a Pd(0) species, which is oxidized to Pd(II) in an oxidative addition step involving the organohalide species. This step proceeds with aryl, vinyl, alkynyl, and acyl halides, acetates, or triflates, with substrates following standard oxidative addition relative rates (I>OTf>Br>>Cl). The actual mechanism of oxidative addition is unresolved, though there are two likely pathways. One pathway is thought to proceed via an SN2 like mechanism resulting in inverted stereochemistry. The other pathway proceeds via concerted addition and retains stereochemistry. Though the additions are cis- the Pd(II) complex rapidly isomerizes to the trans- complex. Next, the transmetalation step occurs where the organozinc reagent exchanges its organic substituent with the halide in the Pd(II) complex, generating the trans- Pd(II) complex and a zinc halide salt. The organozinc substrate can be aryl, vinyl, allyl, benzyl, homoallyl, or homopropargyl. Transmetalation is usually rate limiting and a complete mechanistic understanding of this step {{has not yet been}} reached though several studies have shed light on this process. It was recently determined that alkylzinc species must go on to form a higher-order <b>zincate</b> species prior to transmetalation whereas arylzinc species do not. ZnXR and ZnR2 can both be used as reactive reagents, and Zn is known to prefer four coordinate complexes, which means solvent coordinated Zn complexes, such as ZnXR(solvent) 2 cannot be ruled out a priori.
