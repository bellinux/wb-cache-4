50|$|<b>Zuclopenthixol</b> (Cisordinol, Clopixol, Acuphase), {{also known}} as zuclopentixol, is a typical {{antipsychotic}} drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced in 1962 by Lundbeck. It is the cis-isomer of clopenthixol.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>zuclopenthixol</b> acetate (Clopixol, Acuphase, Cisordinol-Acutard), it is {{a shorter}} acting {{intramuscular}} injection {{used in the}} acute sedation of psychotic inpatients. The effect peaks at 48-72 hours providing 2-3 days of sedation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Zuclopenthixol</b> antagonises both {{dopamine}} D1 and D2 receptors, α1-adrenoceptors and 5-HT2 receptors {{with a high}} affinity, but has no {{affinity for}} cholinergic muscarine receptors. It weakly antagonises the histamine (H1) receptor but has no α2-adrenoceptor blocking activity.|$|E
50|$|As a {{long acting}} injection, <b>zuclopenthixol</b> {{decanoate}} {{comes in a}} 200 mg and 500 mg ampoule. Doses can vary from 50 mg weekly to the maximum licensed dose of 600 mg weekly. In general, the lowest effective dose to prevent relapse is preferred. The interval may be shorter as a patient starts on the medication before extending to 3 weekly intervals subsequently. The dose should be reviewed and reduced if side effects occur, though {{in the short term}} an anticholinergic medication benztropine may be helpful for tremor and stiffness, while diazepam may be helpful for akathisia. 100 mg of <b>zuclopenthixol</b> decanoate is roughly equivalent to 20 mg of flupentixol decanoate or 12.5 mg of fluphenazine decanoate.|$|E
50|$|Other {{permanent}} {{side effects}} {{are similar to}} many other typical antipsychotics, namely extrapyramidal symptoms {{as a result of}} dopamine blockade in subcortical areas of the brain. This may result in symptoms similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease and include a restlessness and inability to sit still known as akathisia, a slow tremor and stiffness of the limbs. <b>Zuclopenthixol</b> is thought to be more sedating than the related flupentixol, though possibly less likely to induce extrapyramidal symptoms than other typical depots. As with other dopamine antagonists, <b>zuclopenthixol</b> may sometimes elevate prolactin levels; this may occasionally result in amenorrhoea or galactorrhoea in severe cases. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal side effect. Any unexpected deterioration in mental state with confusion and muscle stiffness should be seen by a physician.|$|E
50|$|In acutely {{psychotic}} and agitated inpatients, 50 - 200 mg of <b>zuclopenthixol</b> acetate may {{be given}} for a calming effect over the subsequent three days, with a maximum dose of 400 mg in total to be given. As it is a long-acting medication, {{care must be taken}} not to give an excessive dose.|$|E
50|$|Clopenthixol is {{a mixture}} of cis and trans isomers. <b>Zuclopenthixol,</b> the pure cis isomer, was later {{introduced}} by Lundbeck in 1962, and has been much more widely used. Both drugs are equally effective as antipsychotics and have similar adverse effect profiles, but clopenthixol is half as active on a milligram-to-milligram basis and appears to produce more sedation in comparison.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>zuclopenthixol</b> {{decanoate}} (Clopixol), it is a {{long acting}} intramuscular injection. Its main use is as a long acting injection given every two or three weeks to people with schizophrenia who have a poor compliance with medication and suffer frequent relapses of illness.

Side effect of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the phenothiazines (such as perphenazine and chlorpromazine), thioxanthenes (such as flupenthixol and <b>zuclopenthixol)</b> and butyrophenones (such as haloperidol), piperazines (such as ziprasidone), and rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug-induced parkinsonism tends to remain at its presenting level, not progress like Parkinson's disease.|$|E
50|$|The oldest depots {{available}} were haloperidol and fluphenazine, with flupentixol and <b>zuclopenthixol</b> as {{more recent}} additions. All have a similar, predominantly extrapyramidal, side effect profile {{though there are}} some variations between patients. More recently, long acting preparations of the atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, and its metabolite paliperidone, have become available thus offering new choices. However, Risperidone tends {{to have a higher}} incidence of extrapyramidal effects when compared to the tricyclic and tetracyclic atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, clozapine, olanzapine, etc.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{administration}} of <b>zuclopenthixol</b> (30 mg/kg/day for two years) in rats resulted in small, but significant, {{increases in the}} incidence of thyroid parafollicular carcinomas and, in females, of mammary adenocarcinomas and of pancreatic islet cell adenomas and carcinomas.

40|$|Background: Substance use {{disorders}} (SUDs) {{are present}} in more than 50 % of subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, there are no controlled studies assessing the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in this subgroup of patients. The aim of the present work was to compare the efficacy of risperidone and <b>zuclopenthixol</b> {{in a sample of}} schizophrenic subjects with dual diagnosis. Method: Thirty-three male were selected for treatment with risperidone, while another 33 were treated with <b>zuclopenthixol.</b> Substances most commonly used were alcohol, cannabis (both 82 %) and cocaine (32 %). Patients were randomized and treated {{for the first six months}} with one antipsychotic and the second six months with the other antipsychotic.

Results: During the first six months risperidone group patients presented fewer positive urine tests and showed better compliance with the SAMM programme. In the second period the patients treated with risperidone significantly improved their scores on the PANSS-negative subscale. Differences between the CGIs indicated that the subjects who moved from risperidone to <b>zuclopenthixol</b> worsened, while those who moved from <b>zuclopenthixol</b> to risperidone significantly improved.

40|$|Introduction. Almost all {{individual}} antipsychotics {{are classified}} into the intermediate pregnancy risk category as no or limited data exist about human pregnancy outcomes. We presented {{the case of}} <b>zuclopenthixol</b> decanoate using in two successive pregnancies of the same woman, which had not {{been published in the}} available peer-reviewed literature. Case report. A middle-age female subject who suffered from schizophrenia received <b>zuclopenthixol</b> decanoate injection during her two consecutive pregnancies. About four and a half months before diagnosis of the first pregnancy (~ 3. 5 years after psychosis emergence), <b>zuclopenthixol</b> decanoate (400 mg every other week, im injection) was introduced to the treatment protocol (due to previous non-compliance with haloperidol and risperidone). A significant clinical improvement was achieved and the dose during pregnancy was reduced to 200 mg once monthly and maintained to date. In both pregnancies the women gave birth to healthy girls who have been developing normally until now, at their ages of 6 months and of 3. 5 years. During pregnancy and after giving birth to children the mothers’ psychiatric status and her social functioning were significantly improved and are still stable. Close monitoring of the mother’s health, a multidisciplinary approach to both her treatment and the monitoring of pregnancies as well as the complete compliance with the prescribed drug protocol were likely to be crucial for the therapeutic success. Conclusion. A favorable outcome of the present case suggests that the <b>zuclopenthixol</b> decanoate is a rational therapeutic option for pregnant women suffering from psychosis when the expected benefit exceed the potential risk, but a definitive evidence for its safety requires large, controlled studies.

40|$|Background: Needle stick {{injuries}} are a known {{risk in the}} acute hospital setting especially where the patient is agitated. The emotional burden on the staff experiencing this occupational injury is well reported, however there is insufficient data to support storing pre-filled syringes, out of the manufacturer’s pack for longer than for immediate administration. Aim: The aim {{was to investigate the}} stability and sterility of <b>zuclopenthixol</b> acetate and haloperidol in pre-filled syringes to allow their use as an alternative to drawing the dose from an ampoule or vial prior to administration. Method: Two of the commonly used products in rapid tranquilisation were aseptically drawn in suitable syringes and tested for stability and sterility to establish shelf-life. Ten invited medical and nursing staff involved in rapid tranquilisation were invited to a focus group for feedback on the product practicality of use, cost and logistics of stock management. Results: The stability and sterility tests show that <b>zuclopenthixol</b> acetate and haloperidol retained stability and sterility when stored under 25 °C in a 3 mL disposable plastic syringes, for a period of 60 days with cost of AU$ 67 and AU$ 30 per syringe respectively. Conclusion: The prefilled syringes provide ease and speed of administration, potential reduction in needle-stickinjuries and proved to maintain sterility. This study demonstrated that <b>zuclopenthixol</b> acetate 150 mg/ 3 mL and haloperidol 15 mg/ 3 mL retained stability and remained sterile when stored under 2 - 8 °C in plastic syringes for a period of 60 days.

40|$|Antipsychotics {{side-effects}} pose {{an enormous}} problem in psychiatric treatment. The choice of antipsychotics {{is a crucial}} issue in the treatment as both patients 2 ̆ 7 cooperation and compliance often depend upon it. Severe side-effects might sometimes cause the treatment interruption, to which each patient is entitled. Schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) features include social and interpersonal deficits, discomfort with close relationships, as well as cognitive and perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behaviour. Dominant symptoms often determine psycho pharmacotherapy and therefore antipsychotic treatment is possible. A 23 year-old man was treated for 4 months due to disturbances typical for SPD. Since the patient did not respond well to haloperidol, <b>zuclopenthixol</b> was advised. The latter medication produced severe, life-threatening side-effects which caused urgent hospitalisation. Althouth <b>zuclopenthixol</b> was instantly retracted from the therapy, the patient and his family rejected any further psychiatric treatment.
