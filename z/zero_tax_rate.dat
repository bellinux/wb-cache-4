Importantly, even though this specification of the capital income tax imposes a zero effective tax rate on capital, the capital income tax can collect substantial revenue. Provided that government purchases do not exceed gross capital income less gross investment, the optimal tax system will consist of a positive tax rate on capital income and a <b>zero</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> on labor income [...] just the opposite of the results of Chamley and Judd. ...|$|E

40|$|Personal {{taxation}} can be {{an important}} determinant of corporate investment and financing decisions if the marginal investor is taxed. I develop a dynamic capital budgeting model under realization-based capital gains taxation that highlights distinct cross-sectional and time-series implications. Capital gains taxation creates an embedded tax timing option that reduces investors’ uncertainty about after-tax payoffs in downstates. The inherent asymmetry in personal taxation diminishes the value of the firm’s option to delay, and ceteris paribus lowers the initial threshold for making an irreversible investment compared to the <b>zero</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate</b> case. However, the asymmetry disappears gradually and the investment threshold shifts up, if investors reset their tax basis before the firm exercises its investment option. Hence, firms that are ex-ante identical can have different investment policies ex-post depending on their stock price evolution. The lock-in effect of embedded capital gains also alters the debt-equity tradeoff. Firms employ more equity financing, the lower the basis to price ratio of their owners. As a result, capital structure is path-dependent on past firm performance. The combined effect is consistent with cross-sectional evidence on the relation between leverage and Tobin’s Q.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the response of}} a small, open dependent economy {{to a variety of}} fiscal and financial shocks as well as the influence of alternative budget balancing rules on the response of the system to such external shocks as a change in the world interest rate. The approach allows for both uncertain individual lifetimes and population growth, using a slightly generalized version of the Yaari-Blanchard model of consumer behavior. Debt neutrality does not prevail unless the sum of the population growth rate and the individual's probability of death equals zero. The government spends on traded and non-traded goods and raises tax revenue both through a lump sum tax and through a distortionary tax on the production of traded goods. Even though the tax on the production of traded goods is the only conventional distortion in the model, changes in this tax rate will have first order real income effects even when the distortion is evaluated at a <b>zero</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate,</b> as long as the individual's subjective pure rate of time preference differs from the interest rate. This can occur even in well-behaved steady states of the Yaari-Blanchard model, as long as the population growth rate plus the probability of death differ from zero. This "intrinsic" distortion effectively causes second-best arguments to apply even when there is only one conventional distortion. Even in the absence of government budget deficits, fiscal choices relating to the composition of public spending and the structure of taxation have important short-term and long-term consequences for the real exchange rate, the sectoral allocation of production, the level and composition of private consumption, the current account (in the short run) and the nation's stock of claims {{on the rest of the}} world in the long run. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with tax rates {{for the use of}} commodities in general, and energy in particular. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are used to analyze the normative question of whether the tax rate for intermediate use by firms should be the same as the tax rate for final consumption by households. To answer this question, a distinction needs to be made between fiscal taxes for the purpose of raising revenue for the government, and Pigovian taxes for the purpose of changing behaviour. Concerning fiscal taxes, firms should not pay taxes on their use of inputs if the tax rates in final consumption are at their optimal level. If the tax rate for households is above the optimal level, intermediate use in firms should be taxed in order to increase the price of other commodities and reduce the distortion of relative prices. Essay 1 ascertains what factors determine the optimal relation between the tax rate for final consumption by households and intermediate use by firms. Essay 2 analyses Swedish energy taxes from the perspective of reducing global emission of CO 2. It is found that the welfare maximizing tax rates are equal for households and firms not participating in emission trading, while firms that participate in emission trading should have a <b>zero</b> <b>tax</b> <b>rate.</b> Essays 3 and 4 deal with methodological issues. Essay 3 derives a new method for estimation of symmetric input-output tables from supply and use tables. This method solves the problem of negative coefficients, makes it possible to use both the industry and commodity technology assumptions simultaneously and enables the commodity technology assumption to be used even when the number of commodities is larger than the number of industries. Essay 4 describes the model used in the first two essays. The price structure developed here makes it possible to take into account price differences between different purchasers other than differences in tax rates. This essay also makes a comparison between the Swedish implementation of this model and other Swedish CGE-models used to analyse climate policy and energy taxation...|$|E
