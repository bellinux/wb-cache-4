5|$|Although {{antidepressants}} with anxiolytic properties {{have been}} introduced, {{and there is}} increasing awareness of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, prescriptions for short-term anxiety relief have not significantly dropped. For treatment of insomnia, benzodiazepines are now less popular than nonbenzodiazepines, which include zolpidem, <b>zaleplon</b> and eszopiclone. Nonbenzodiazepines are molecularly distinct, but nonetheless, they work on the same benzodiazepine receptors and produce similar sedative effects.|$|E
5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest in the elderly. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence in the elderly can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great in the elderly as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred in the elderly such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended in the elderly due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as <b>zaleplon</b> and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> has a {{pharmacological}} profile {{similar to}} benzodiazepines, {{characterized by an}} increase in slow wave deep sleep (SWDS) with rapid onset of hypnotic action. <b>Zaleplon</b> is a full agonist for the benzodiazepine α1 receptor located on the GABAA receptor complex in the body, with lower affinity for the α2 and α3 subsites. It selectively enhances the action of GABA similar to, but more selectively than benzodiazepines. <b>Zaleplon,</b> although not a benzodiazepine, maintains a very similar chemical structure nonetheless, known for inducing hypnotic effects by α1 subreceptor sites, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects via α2 and α3 subsites, with negligible anticonvulsant properties (via α5 subsite), as <b>zaleplon</b> action is modulated at benzodiazepine receptor sites. The elimination half-life of <b>zaleplon</b> is about 1–1.5 hours. The absorption rate of <b>zaleplon</b> is rapid and the onset of therapeutic effects is typically breached within 5–15 minutes following ingestion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> is {{slightly}} {{effective in the}} management/treatment of insomnia, primarily characterized by difficulty falling asleep. Due to its ultrashort elimination half-life, <b>zaleplon</b> may not be effective in reducing premature awakenings.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> is not {{recommended}} for chronic use in the elderly. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} adverse effects of <b>zaleplon</b> such as cognitive side effects. <b>Zaleplon</b> may increase the risk of injury among the elderly. It should not be used while in pregnancy or lactation, and in patients with a history of alcohol or drug abuse, psychotic illness or depression, clinicians should devote more attention.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> {{selectively}} binds {{with high}} efficacy to the benzodiazepine site (ω1) on the α1-containing GABA-A receptors which help produce the primary therapeutic hypnotic properties. The ultrashort half-life gives <b>zaleplon</b> a unique advantage over other hypnotics {{because of its}} lack of next-day residual effects on driving and other performance-related skills. Unlike nonselective benzodiazepine drugs and zopiclone, which distort the sleep pattern, <b>zaleplon</b> appears to induce sleep without disrupting the natural sleep architecture.|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of <b>zaleplon</b> {{are similar to the}} {{side effects of}} benzodiazepines, {{although}} with less next-day sedation, and in two studies <b>zaleplon</b> use was found not to cause an increase in traffic accidents, as compared to other hypnotics currently on the market.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, rifampicin, and {{thioridazine}} cause {{interactions with}} <b>zaleplon.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of randomized, controlled clinical trials which compared benzodiazepines against <b>zaleplon</b> or other Z-drugs such as zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone has found few clear and consistent differences between <b>zaleplon</b> and the benzodiazepines {{in terms of}} sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} {{of alcohol and}} <b>zaleplon</b> can result in fatal respiratory depression and asphyxiation from vomiting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> has the {{potential}} to be a drug of recreational use, and has been found to have an addictive potential similar to benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like hypnotics. The mind- and judgment-altering effects of <b>zaleplon</b> are similar to those of many benzodiazepines, but the fast-acting nature and short half-life of the chemical mean high doses set on much more quickly and last for short periods of time (usually from 45 to 60 minutes).|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests <b>zaleplon</b> {{is not as}} chemically reinforcing and exhibits far fewer rebound effects when compared with other nonbenzodiazepines, or Z-drugs.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine and {{grapefruit}} {{are known}} to increase blood plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by the P450 CYP3A4 liver enzyme (e.g. alprazolam) by extending the time by which the drug leaves the body, effectively extending the half-life and enhancing effects to potentially toxic levels. Thus, given the similarities between <b>zaleplon</b> and benzodiazepines, particularly in effect, and not just chemical structure, {{it is reasonable to}} take precautions (e.g. inquire at a pharmacy) before one consumes cimetidine (or grapefruit) while also taking <b>zaleplon.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Zaleplon,</b> like zolpidem, zopiclone, or eszopiclone, are all {{specific}} agonists at the benzodiazepine GABAA α1 sub-receptor site. It also modulates the GABAA sub-sites, α2 and α3, to {{a lesser}} degree. It has no statistical significance as an anticonvulsant. However, as a pyrazolopyrimidine, <b>zaleplon</b> {{has served as a}} novel chemical platform from which new anxiolytics will hopefully arise. Much like zolpidem, as an imidazopyridine and also a full agonist at the GABAA α1 sub-receptor site, has been reviewed considerably with some novel contributions. See also: alpidem.|$|E
25|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> (marketed {{under the}} brand names Sonata, Starnoc, and Andante) is a sedative-{{hypnotic}}, almost entirely {{used for the}} management/treatment of insomnia. It is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class.|$|E
25|$|Neither <b>zaleplon,</b> nor any nonbenzodiazepine {{hypnotic}} class medication {{should be}} combined with alcohol, as both modulate GABAA receptor sites, and in a synergistic manner increase the chances of fatal respiratory depression and asphyxiation from vomiting.|$|E
25|$|The FAA allows <b>zaleplon</b> with a 6-hour wait {{period and}} no more than twice a week, which makes it the sleep {{medication}} with the shortest allowed waiting period after use. The substances with the 2nd shortest period, which is of 24 hours, are zolpidem and ramelteon.|$|E
25|$|Pure <b>zaleplon</b> in its {{solid state}} is a white to off-white powder with very low {{solubility}} in water, as well as low solubility in ethanol and propylene glycol. It has a partition coefficient in octanol/water that is constant (logP = 1.23) when the pH range is between 1 and 7.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam (marketed under {{brand names}} Doral, Dormalin) is a {{relatively}} long-acting benzodiazepine derivative drug developed by the Schering Corporation in the 1970s. Quazepam is indicated {{for the treatment of}} insomnia including sleep induction and sleep maintenance. Quazepam induces impairment of motor function and has relatively (and uniquely) selective hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties with considerably less overdose potential than other benzodiazepines (due to its novel receptor-subtype selectively). Quazepam is an effective hypnotic which induces and maintains sleep without disruption of the sleep architecture. Quazepam is a trifluoroalkyl type of benzodiazepine, like fletazepam, halazepam, triflubazam and triflunordazepam. Quazepam is unique amongst benzodiazepines in that it selectively targets the GABAA α1 subunit receptors which are responsible for inducing sleep. Its mechanism of action is very similar to zolpidem and <b>zaleplon</b> in its pharmacology and can successfully substitute for zolpidem and <b>zaleplon</b> in animal studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to zopiclone or other Z {{drugs such as}} zolpidem and <b>zaleplon</b> has found few clear and consistent differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.|$|E
25|$|Sonata (US) is {{manufactured}} by King Pharmaceuticals of Bristol, TN. Gedeon Richter Plc. manufactures <b>zaleplon</b> under {{the brand name}} Andante (RU). Starnoc has been discontinued in Canada but can be manufactured if a prescription is brought to a compounding pharmacy. It is prescribed rarely in the United Kingdom, with zopiclone being the preferred Z-drug by the National Health Service (NHS).|$|E
25|$|Drugs {{that may}} prove more {{effective}} and safer than benzodiazepines for insomnia {{is an area of}} active research. Nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien), <b>zaleplon,</b> zopiclone (Imovane), and eszopiclone (Lunesta), are a class of hypnotic medications that are similar to benzodiazepines in their mechanism of action, and indicated for mild to moderate insomnia. Their effectiveness at improving time to sleeping is slight, and they have similar—though potentially less severe—side effect profiles compared to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Drugs which induce sleep, {{known as}} hypnotics, include Benzodiazepines, {{although}} these interfere with REM; Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as eszopiclone (Lunesta), <b>zaleplon</b> (Sonata), and zolpidem (Ambien); Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and doxylamine; Alcohol (ethanol), despite its rebound effect {{later in the}} night and interference with REM; barbiturates, which have the same problem; melatonin, a component of the circadian clock, and released naturally at night by the pineal gland; and cannabis, which may also interfere with REM.|$|E
25|$|The {{synthesis}} {{starts with}} the condensation of 3-acetylacetanilide (1) with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) to give the eneamide (2). The anilide nitrogen is then alkylated by means of sodium hydride and ethyl iodide to give 3. The {{first step in the}} condensation with 3-amino-4-cyanopyrazole can be visualized as involving an addition-elimination reaction sequence on the eneamide function to give a transient intermediate such as 5. Cyclization then leads to formation of the fused pyrimidine ring to afford <b>zaleplon</b> (6).|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{is often}} {{recommended}} {{due to its}} long elimination half-life and also because of its availability in low potency doses. The non-benzodiazepine Z drugs such as zolpidem, <b>zaleplon,</b> and zopiclone {{should not be used}} as a replacement for benzodiazepines, as they have a similar mechanism of action and can induce a similar dependence. The pharmacological mechanism of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence is the internalization (removal) of receptor site in the brain and changes in gene transcription codes in the brain.|$|E
25|$|In EEG studies, {{zopiclone}} significantly {{increases the}} energy of the beta frequency band and shows characteristics of high-voltage slow waves, desynchronization of hippocampal theta waves, and an increase in {{the energy of}} the delta frequency band. Zopiclone increases both stage 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS), while zolpidem, an α1-selective compound, increases only SWS and causes no effect on stage 2 sleep. Zopiclone is less selective to the α1 site and has higher affinity to the α2 site than <b>zaleplon.</b> Zopiclone is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone {{and other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs are detected frequently {{in cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs. Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range and often in combination with other alcohol, illegal, or prescription drugs of abuse, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. <b>Zaleplon</b> or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of zopiclone to reduce traffic accidents. Zopiclone as with other hypnotic drugs is sometimes abused to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults.|$|E
25|$|When {{compared}} with benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepines (including <b>zaleplon)</b> appear to offer few significant advantages in efficacy or tolerability among elderly individuals. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia {{has traditionally been}} discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, musculoskeletal impairment, and subsequently {{an increased risk of}} harm to oneself (e.g. falling) and to others (e.g. automotive accidents). Though, quite obviously as the body and brain age, these aforementioned phenomena are expected events, as they occur daily regardless of ingestion of a sedative/hypnotic. Thus, statistically significant and empirical evidence are arguably still absent as dramatic precautions and conclusions are drawn irrespective of the debilitating realities that accompany insomnia and the fact that these medicines do indeed provide assistance to millions of elderly individuals. It is important to distinguish between the extrapolation of potential side effects relative to the vast number of examples, wherein the sedative/hypnotic has proven therapeutically beneficial and appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam is {{selective}} for type I benzodiazepine receptors containing the α1 subunit, {{similar to other}} drugs such as <b>zaleplon</b> and zolpidem. As a result, quazepam {{has little or no}} muscle relaxant properties. Most other benzodiazepines are unselective and bind to type1 GABAA receptors and type2 GABAA receptors. Type1 GABAA receptors include the α1 subunit containing GABAA receptors which are responsible for hypnotic properties of the drug. Type 2 receptors include the α2, α3 and α5 subunits which are responsible for anxiolytic action, amnesia and muscle relaxant properties. Thus quazepam may have less side effects than other benzodiazepines but, it has a very long half-life of 25 hours which reduces its benefits as a hypnotic due to likely next day sedation. It also has two active metabolites with half-lives of 28 and 79 hours. Quazepam may also cause less drug tolerance than other benzodiazepines such as temazepam and triazolam perhaps due to its subtype selectivity. The longer half-life of quazepam may have the advantage however, of causing less rebound insomnia than shorter acting subtype selective nonbenzodiazepines. However, one of the major metabolites of quazepam, the N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam (aka N-desalkylflurazepam), binds unselectively to both type1 and type2 GABAA receptors. The N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam metabolite also has a very long half-life and likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of quazepam.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> {{should be}} {{understood}} as an ultrashort-acting sedative-hypnotic drug {{for the treatment of}} insomnia. <b>Zaleplon</b> increases EEG power density in the δ-frequency band and a decrease in the energy of the θ-frequency band ...|$|E
2500|$|A common {{effect of}} {{recreational}} <b>zaleplon</b> use is {{the occurrence of}} (typically short-lived) hallucinations. Fewer visual and auditory hallucinations/disruptions occur {{with the use of}} <b>zaleplon</b> than with other Z-drugs, like zolpidem. [...] Anterograde amnesia can occur and can cause one to lose track of the amount of <b>zaleplon</b> already ingested, prompting the ingesting of more than originally planned. However, continuous ingestion is extremely unlikely precisely because of zaleplon's quick onset of action.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Zaleplon</b> is {{primarily}} metabolised by aldehyde oxidase, and its half-life {{can be affected}} by substances which inhibit or induce aldehyde oxidase. Taken orally, <b>zaleplon</b> reaches full concentration in about one hour. [...] It is extensively metabolised into 5-oxozaleplon and 5-oxodesethylzaleplon (the latter via desethylzaleplon), with less than 1% of it excreted intact in urine.|$|E
2500|$|The United States Air Force uses <b>zaleplon</b> {{as one of}} the {{hypnotics}} approved as a [...] "no-go pill" [...] to help aviators and special-duty personnel {{sleep in}} support of mission readiness (with a four-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation). [...] "Ground tests" [...] are required prior to authorization being issued to use the medication in an operational situation. (The other hypnotics used as [...] "no-go pills" [...] are temazepam and zolpidem, which both have longer mandatory recovery periods.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Available data cannot {{provide a}} {{reliable}} {{estimate of the}} incidence of dependence during treatment at recommended doses of <b>zaleplon</b> (typically 5–20mg before bed). [...] Other sedative/hypnotics {{have been associated with}} various signs and symptoms of a withdrawal syndrome, following abrupt discontinuation, ranging from mild dysphoria and insomnia to more serious cases that include abdominal and muscle cramps, vomiting, sweating, tremors, and convulsions. Following abrupt cessation, the seizure threshold is further lowered, wherein coma and death are possible outcomes if untreated.|$|E

2500|$|Zopiclone {{is known}} colloquially as a [...] "Z-drug". Other Z-drugs include <b>zaleplon</b> (Sonata) and {{zolpidem}} (Ambien and AmbienCR) and were initially {{thought to be}} less addictive or habit-forming than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat {{in the last few}} years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken on a short-term basis, usually a week or less. Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with antidepressants, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system.|$|E
