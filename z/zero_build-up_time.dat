40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between the pairs of resonator output coupling and intra-cavity absorber initial transmission, and the FWHM (full width at half maximum) pulse duration of a continuously pumped passively Q-switched solidstate laser, when the output energy is pre-determined. Depending on the magnitude of the pumping power, three different rate equation models are used to evaluate the required output coupler reflectivity and absorber initial-transmission pair for the corresponding FWHM pulse duration. The energy transfer kinetics of the passively Q-switched laser decides the required pumping power; and the pair of output coupler reflectivity absorber transmission pair, determine the <b>build-up</b> <b>time</b> of Q-switching and the repetition rate of the laser system. Hence, the forms of the models are controlled by two conditions: 1) the <b>build-up</b> <b>time</b> of Q-switching; and 2) the recovery time of the absorber. When the <b>build-up</b> <b>time</b> of Q-switching is relatively short, but the recovery time of the absorber is long, Model I is based on the simplified laser rate equations. It is used to evaluate the output coupler reflectivity and absorber initialtransmission pair, which satisfies the pre-determined output energy and FWHM pulse duration. Model II is set up to study the case when both the <b>build-up</b> <b>time</b> of Q-switching and the recovery time of the absorber are long. In Model II, the laser rate equations are solved using the Runge-Kutta method. Model III simulates the case when the recovery time of the absorber is short. To validate the models, the simulation results of practical passively Q-switched laser systems are compared with experimental results reported in the literature. The agreement of the simulation results with reported experimental results demonstrates the importance of the boundary conditions for the different cases, and verifies the soundness of the models. Generalizing the simulation results, obtained from different passively Q-switched laser systems with different pumping power and different pre-determined output energy, yields general conclusions which permit a designer to select the correct parameters for a desired laser performance.

Our aim is to test and compare techniques based on high-speed videokeratoscopy (HSV), dynamic wavefront sensing (DWS), and lateral shearing interferometry (LSI). Algorithms are developed to estimate the tear film <b>build-up</b> <b>time</b> TBLD, and the average tear film surface quality in the stable phase of the interblink interval TFSQAv. Moderate but significant correlations are found between TBLD measured with LSI and DWS based on vertical coma (Pearson's r 2 = 0. 34, p< 0. 01) and higher order rms (r 2 = 0. 31, p< 0. 01), as well as between TFSQAv measured with LSI and HSV (r 2 = 0. 35, p< 0. 01), and between LSI and DWS based on the rms fit error (r 2 = 0. 40, p< 0. 01). No significant correlation is found between HSV and DWS. All three techniques estimate tear film <b>build-up</b> <b>time</b> to be below 2. 5 sec, and they achieve a remarkably close median value of 0. 7 sec.

CP 6 fluorescence kinetics are investigated by measuring in vivo fluorescence spectra and images of the mouse skin and the rat palate at different time points after injection. For the tumour-localising properties, microscopic phase-contrast and fluorescence images are recorded. The in vivo fluorescence kinetics in the mouse skin show localization of CP 6 in the tumours. However, fluorescence microscopy images show that CP 6 localises in the dermis and structures that {{are not related to}} the malignant transformation of the mouse skin. The fluorescence kinetics in the rat palate show a significant correlation between the degree of malignancy and the CP 6 fluorescence <b>build-up</b> <b>time</b> in the palate.

The OPO itself was pumped by a semiconductor diode-seeded, Yb 3 +-doped fiber Master Oscillator Power Amplifier (MOPA) operating at 1062 nm. An OPO output power as high as 11 W at an overall slope efficiency of 67 % was achieved, with nearly 2. 7 W and 8. 2 W of optical power obtained at 3. 5 µm and 1. 5 µm respectively. Due to the fast response time of the external modulator, {{it is possible to}} implement active pulse shaping on a nanosecond time-scale.
