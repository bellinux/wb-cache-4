5000|$|This {{malicious}} software, {{which usually}} {{should be a}} portable executable (and may be packed with UPX), is mostly used in order to connect a (worldwide) group of victimized PCs and form a botnet (also known as a <b>zombie</b> <b>network).</b> The software is able to spread through networks in order to infect other computers as computer worms do (see Conficker). The difference is that such backdoors do not spread automatically (as worms do), but are started through a command and control-center who is supervising them.|$|E
50|$|The {{compromised}} machine becomes {{merged into}} a botnet. While most botnets are controlled through a central server, which if found {{can be taken}} down to destroy the botnet, the Storm Worm seeds a botnet that acts {{in a similar way}} to a peer-to-peer network, with no centralized control. Each compromised machine connects to a list of a subset of the entire botnet - around 30 to 35 other compromised machines, which act as hosts. While each of the infected hosts share lists of other infected hosts, no one machine has a full list of the entire botnet - each only has a subset, making it difficult to gauge the true extent of the <b>zombie</b> <b>network.</b> On 7 September 2007, estimates {{of the size of the}} Storm botnet ranged from 1 to 10 million computers. Researchers from the University of Mannheim and the Institut Eurecom have estimated concurrent online storm nodes to be between 5,000 and 40,000.|$|E
5000|$|The botnet, or <b>zombie</b> <b>network,</b> {{comprises}} computers running Microsoft Windows {{as their}} operating system. Once infected, a computer becomes {{known as a}} bot. This bot then performs automated tasks—anything from gathering data on the user, to attacking web sites, to forwarding infected e-mail—without its owner's knowledge or permission. Estimates indicate that 5,000 to 6,000 computers are dedicated to propagating {{the spread of the}} worm through the use of e-mails with infected attachments; 1.2 billion virus messages have been sent by the botnet through September 2007, including a record 57 million on August 22, 2007 alone. Lawrence Baldwin, a computer forensics specialist, was quoted as saying, [...] "Cumulatively, Storm is sending billions of messages a day. It could be double digits in the billions, easily." [...] One of the methods used to entice victims to infection-hosting web sites are offers of free music, for artists such as Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Clarkson, Rihanna, The Eagles, Foo Fighters, R. Kelly, and Velvet Revolver. [...] Signature-based detection, the main defense of most computer systems against virus and malware infections, is hampered by the large number of Storm variants.|$|E
50|$|Increasingly, spammers use {{networks}} of malware-infected PCs (zombies) {{to send their}} spam. <b>Zombie</b> <b>networks</b> are also known as botnets (such zombifying malware {{is known as a}} bot, short for robot). In June 2006, an estimated 80 percent of email spam was sent by zombie PCs, an increase of 30 percent from the prior year. An estimated 55 billion email spam were sent each day in June 2006, an increase of 25 billion per day from June 2005.|$|R

50|$|<b>Zombie</b> <b>networks</b> are {{particularly}} active in North America where {{about half of}} the Internet users are on a broadband connection and many leave their computers on all the time. In January, 2008, 8% of all e-mail spam was sent by the Storm botnet, created by the Storm Worm, first released in January, 2007. It is estimated that as many as 1 million or more computers have been infected and their owners are unwilling and unknowing participants. In the 3rd quarter of 2008 almost one in every 400 email messages contained a dangerous attachment, designed to infect the recipient’s computer, eight times as often as in the previous quarter.|$|R
40|$|Capítulos en librosThe large {{network of}} {{compromised}} computers currently available {{can be used}} to run complex algorithms in order to solve problems considered to be beyond current computational power. A distribute algorithm for obtaining prime number is presented. The algorithm was run in a grid system to obtain all prime numbers up to 2 ^ 40, measuring execution times and storage requirements. Extrapolating the results to larger limits it was found that using <b>zombie</b> <b>networks</b> it is possible to obtain prime number up to a limit of 2 ^ 50. The main conclusion is that using this technique, low transfer rates and storage capabilities are the current limiting factors, surpassing the limited computing power. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{networks}} are {{a critical component}} of the economic and social infrastructures in which we live. In addition to voice services, these networks deliver alphanumeric text messages to the vast majority of wireless subscribers. To encourage the expansion of this new service, telecommunications companies offer connections between their networks and the Internet. The ramifications of such connections, however, have not been fully recognized. In this paper, we evaluate the security impact of the SMS interface on the availability of the cellular phone network. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability to deny voice service to cities the size of Washington D. C. and Manhattan with little more than a cable modem. Moreover, attacks targeting the entire United States are feasible with resources available to medium-sized <b>zombie</b> <b>networks.</b> This analysis begins with an exploration of the structure of cellular networks. We then characterize network behavior and explore a number of reconnaissance techniques aimed at effectively targeting attacks on these systems. We conclude by discussing countermeasures that mitigate or eliminate the threats introduced by these attacks...|$|R

40|$|<b>Zombie</b> <b>networks</b> {{have been}} used for {{spamming}} and DDoS attacks. Worms have been designed to receive commands from their creator and update themselves automatically. But the combination of malware and powerful anonymous communication techniques has not been seen – yet. There is {{a growing body of research}} work on anonymous communication schemes, which are developed legitimately to allow people to communicate without fear of identification or retribution. For example, such communication could be used by people living under oppressive regimes. Malware using anonymous communication would be as capable as current malware ‘applications’, but in a form that is extremely difficult to trace. There are other possibilities, too. An anonymous communication network established using malware could be used for exchanging illegal or copyrighted information, as well as illicit communication for organized crime or terrorist organizations. This paper discusses anonymous communication methods and shows how they can be modified for use with malware. To counter this threat, we present new methods to identify the existence of malware using anonymous communication schemes, and counterattack techniques that can be used to identify additional nodes within the anonymity network. The awareness of these threats and their countermeasures can be used to build defences before such threats are seen in the wild. 1...|$|R
50|$|Performing a {{port scan}} and OS {{identification}} (-O option in nmap) on the <b>zombie</b> candidate <b>network</b> {{rather than just}} a ping scan helps in selecting a good zombie. As long as verbose mode (-v) is enabled, OS detection will usually determine the IP ID sequence generation method and print a line such as “IP ID Sequence Generation: Incremental”. If the type is given as Incremental or Broken little-endian incremental, the machine is a good zombie candidate. That is still no guarantee that it will work, as Solaris and some other systems create a new IP ID sequence for each host they communicate with. The host could also be too busy. OS detection and the open port list can also help in identifying systems {{that are likely to}} be idle.|$|R
40|$|Since the Morris worm was {{released}} in 1988, Internet worms continue {{to be one of}} top security threats. For example, the Conficker worm infected 9 to 15 million machines in early 2009 and shut down the service of some critical government and medical networks. Moreover, it constructed a massive peer-to-peer (P 2 P) botnet. Botnets are <b>zombie</b> <b>networks</b> controlled by attackers setting out coordinated attacks. In recent years, botnets have become the number one threat to the Internet. ^ The objective of this research is to characterize spatial-temporal infection structures of Internet worms, and apply the observations to study P 2 P-based botnets formed by worm infection. ^ First, we infer temporal characteristics of the Internet worm infection structure, i. e., the host infection time and the worm infection sequence, and thus pinpoint patient zero or initially infected hosts. Specifically, we apply statistical estimation techniques on Darknet observations. We show analytically and empirically that our proposed estimators can significantly improve the inference accuracy. Second, we reveal two key spatial characteristics of the Internet worm infection structure, i. e., the number of children and the generation of the underlying tree topology formed by worm infection. Specifically, we apply probabilistic modeling methods and a sequential growth model. We show analytically and empirically that the number of children has asymptotically a geometric distribution with parameter 0. 5, and the generation follows closely a Poisson distribution. Finally, we evaluate bot detection strategies and effects of user defenses in P 2 P-based botnets formed by worm infection. Specifically, we apply the observations of the number of children and demonstrate analytically and empirically that targeted detection that focuses on the nodes with the largest number of children is an efficient way to expose bots. However, we also point out that future botnets may self-stop scanning to weaken targeted detection, without greatly slowing down the speed of worm infection. We then extend the worm spatial infection structure and show empirically that user defenses, e. g., patching or cleaning, can significantly mitigate the robustness and the effectiveness of P 2 P-based botnets. To counterattack, we evaluate a simple measure by future botnets that enhances topology robustness through worm re-infection. ...|$|R
