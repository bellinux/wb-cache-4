50|$|Although {{barium sulfate}} is almost {{completely}} inert, <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> degrades upon exposure to UV light, leading to darkening of the pigment. The severity of this UV reaction {{is dependent on}} a combination of two factors; how much <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> makes up the pigments formulation, and its total accumulated UV exposure. Depending on these factors the pigment itself can vary in shade over time, ranging from pure white all the way to grey or even black. To suppress this effect, a dopant may be used, such as a small amount of cobalt salts, which would be added to the formulation. This process creates cobalt-doped <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide.</b> The cobalt salts help to stabilize <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> so it will not have as severe a reaction to UV exposure.|$|R
50|$|The {{first use}} of {{radioluminescence}} was in luminous paint containing radium, a natural radioisotope.

Phosphors <b>containing</b> copper-doped <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> (ZnS:Cu) yield blue-green light; copper and manganese-doped <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> (ZnS:Cu,Mn), yielding yellow-orange light, are also used. Radium-based luminescent paint is no longer used due to the radiation hazard posed to those manufacturing the dials. These phosphors are not suitable for use in layers thicker than 25 mg/cm2, as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium.|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen {{is still}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} cleanest energy to date. In order to achieve a sustainable process for the hydrogen production, photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen would be a suitable approach. However, due to the low efficiency and lack of stability, the developments of active and stable photocatalysts, especially those that can work under visible light irradiation are still highly required. On the other hand, cadmium <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> has been recognized as an active visible light-driven photocatalyst for hydrogen production. Unfortunately, the cadmium <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> is usually not stable. In order to enhance not only the activity but also the stability of the cadmium <b>zinc</b> <b>sulfide</b> photocatalyst, various modifications were carried out by addition of tin, copper, or silver via hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods [1 - 3].
