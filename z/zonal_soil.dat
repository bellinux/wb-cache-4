For its achievement, there was used Romania Soil Map, 1 : 200 000 scale and field mapping, inventorying the soil cover at the level of class, type and, partially, subtype. In the mentioned area located between the Argeş and the Siret, besides the soils (chernozems, phaeozems, reddish preluvosols) the genesis of which is triggered by the bioclimatic conditions characteristic to steppe, forest steppe and nemoral zone, there also develop soils with azonal and intrazonal character. Thus, the presence of large floodplains imposed the noticeable extension of the soils developed on recent fluviatile deposits (alluviosols). At the same time, the altitude and reduced relief intensity impose an increased phreatic level, which is mineralized in many areas and, consequently, certain soils are affected by hydromorphism (Gleysols and gleyic subtypes) and salinization (solonchaks and salinic subtypes, solonetz and alkalic subtypes).

40|$|The {{formation}} and stabilization of soil aggregates {{play a key}} role in soil functions. To date, few studies have been performed on the variation of soil aggregation with increasing soil weathering degree. Here, soil aggregation and its influencing factors along the weathering gradient were investigated. Six typical <b>zonal</b> <b>soils</b> (derived from similar parent materials) were sampled from temperate to tropical regions. Grain size distribution (GSD) in aggregate fragmentation with increasing disruptive forces (air-dried, water dispersion and chemical dispersion) was determined by laser diffraction particle size analyzer. Different forms of sesquioxides were determined by selective chemical extraction and their contributions to soil aggregation were identified by multiple stepwise regression analysis. The high variability of sesquioxides in different forms appeared with increasing free oxide content (Fed and Ald) from the temperate to tropical soils. The transformation of GSD peak to small size varied with increasing disruptive forces (p< 0. 05). Although in different weathering degrees, <b>zonal</b> <b>soils</b> showed a similar fragmentation process. Aggregate water stability generally increased with increasing soil weathering (p< 0. 01), with higher stability in eluvium (A) horizon than in illuvium (B) horizon (p< 0. 01). Crystalline oxides and amorphous iron oxides (Feo), especially (Fed-Feo) contributed to the formation of air-dried macroaggregates and their stability against slaking (R 2 = 55 %, p< 0. 01), while fine particles (< 50 μm) and Feo (excluding the complex form Fep) played a positive role in the formation of water stable aggregates (R 2 = 93 %, p< 0. 01). Additionally, water stable aggregates (including stability, size distribution and specific surface area) were closely related with pH, organic matter, cation exchange capacity (CEC), bulk density (BD), and free oxides (including various forms) (p< 0. 05).

The {{functioning}} of the city, as artificially created system of {{the result of the}} anthropogenic activity, promotes degradation and, sometimes, destruction of the environment, with change it to the technogenic replacement. First of all suffers the soil, as a basic component of any ecosystem, where the circulation of materials close, because it is a powerful biogeochemical barrier to their migration, able to deposit toxicants a long time through its protective functions. The leading role of the formation of the urban soil plays an anthropogenic factor, which is able to influence directly – the destruction of the soil profile due to construction activity and indirectly – with aerogenic or hydrogenous pollution xenobiotics contained in the emissions and discharges of the industrial enterprises; and it is determined by the type of economic use and history of area developing. The variability of using the urban soil is reflected in the soil profile and contributed {{to the creation of the}} organic-mineral layer by the mixing, mound, burial and (or) contamination of the different substances on the surface. Therefore, classification of the urban soils by the anthropogenic destruction degree of the soil profile is very important scientific and practical task for the urban ecology to the achievement standards of the ecological safety of the modern city, because the restoring of their protective functions is impossible without knowledge of the morphological structure.

In this study, micromorphological features and pedogenic processes of three Latosol profiles derioedfrom different parent materials from Hainan Island are studied with soil micromorphological, clay mineralogical and chemical methods. Vermiculated red soils in South China, which were formed in the mid-Pleistocene, are called Latosols in some studies. To provide evidence for the study of palaeoenvironment and archaeology, vermiculated red soils are compared with Latosols in this study. The results indicate that Latosols mainly have two typical micromorphological features. One is the absence of unweatherable minerals and illuvial clay, and the other is the presence of nodules of iron and manganese oxides resulting from weathering and isotropic b-fabric in good drainage conditions. The typical pedogenic processes of latosols are strong weathering, rubification, homogenization, eluviation and remarkable desilication. In poor drainage conditions, some pseudogley features are formed. Resulting from strong chemical weathering under the tropical climate, Latosols are strongly developed. Compared with Latosols, vermiculated red soils are less developed.

The database of invertebrates, microorganisms and enzymatic activities of different <b>zonal</b> <b>soils</b> in the long-term field experiments has been developed and constantly is updated {{with a view to}} the operative evaluation of the degradation processes and ecological effectiveness of the land management. The current status of the biota of arable soils of the Republic of Moldova is characterized by the significant reduction in the abundance, biomass, activity and diversity in comparison with soil's standards that are in conditions of natural ecosystems. The long use of soils in agricultural production led to the imbalance between the processes of decomposition and humus formation and promoted the decrease of soil biota stability and degradation. The values of most soil biological indices decrease in the following sequence: virgin and fallow land - arable land under organic system with farming manure and incorporation of crop residues - arable unfertilized land. A soil management with the involvement of areas with natural vegetation in a crop rotation system created conditions for the improvement of the biota's vital activity in the soil which degraded {{as a result of a}} long-term arable use. The recovery rate of the population of Lumbricidae family reaches of 3. 0 - 5. 6 worms m- 2 per year. Annual increase in the content of microbial biomass in the typical chernozem can be up to 81. 3 kg C ha- 1 in the layer of the 0 - 50 cm. The organic farming system greatly improves the enzymatic and humus status of the old - arable soils, but does not restore the biodiversity of invertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{comprehensive}} terrestrial ecosystem classification for the central Rocky Mountains of the United States. A comprehensive classification of terrestrial ecosystems in a mountainous study area in northern Utah was developed incorporating direct gradient analysis, spatial hierarchy theory, the zonal concept, and concepts of diagnostic species and fidelity, together with the biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification approach used in British Columbia, Canada. 	This classification was derived from vegetation and environmental sampling of both forest and non-forest ecosystems. The SNOwpack TELemetry (SNOTEL) and The National Weather Service (NWS) Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) weather station network were used to approximate climate of 163 sample plots. Within the large environmental diversity of the study area, three levels of ecosystem organization were distinguished: (1) macroclimatic - regional climate; (2) mesoclimatic, accounting for local climate and moisture distribution; and (3) edaphic - soil fertility. These three levels represent, in order, the L+ 1, L, and L- 1 levels in a spatial hierarchy. Based on vegetation physiognomy, climatic data, and taxonomic classification of <b>zonal</b> <b>soils,</b> two vegetation geo-climatic zones were identified at the macroclimatic (L+ 1) level: (1) montane zone with Rocky Mountain juniper and Douglas-fir; and (2) subalpine zone with Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir as climatic climax species. A vegetation classification was developed by combining vegetation samples (relevés) into meaningful vegetation units. A site classification was developed, based on dominant environmental gradients within the subalpine vegetation geo-climatic zone. Site classes were specified and a site grid was constructed. This site classification was coupled with the vegetation classification. Each plant community was associated with its environmental space within the site grid. This vegetation-site overlay allowed ecosystems to be differentiated environmentally and a structure, combining zonal, vegetation, and site classifications, forms a comprehensive ecosystem classification. Based on assessment of plant communities 2 ̆ 7 environmental demands and site vegetation potential, the comprehensive classification system enables inferences about site history and successional status of ecosystems. This classification {{is consistent with the}} recent USDA, Forest Service ECOMAP and Terrestrial Ecological Unit Inventory structure and may serve as a valuable tool not only in vegetation, climatic, or soil studies but also in practical ecosystem management...|$|R
40|$|Broad-scale {{evaluation}} of wind erosion requires {{details of the}} spatial distribution of the primary factors controlling wind erosion, such as soil characteristics, vegetation cover and soil water conditions. Soil aggregates {{are one of the}} factors, and their size distributions have usually been mapped by assuming a one-to-one relationship with soil texture class. We dry-sieved 31 soil samples from arid and semi-arid regions in East Asia. Cluster analysis showed that the size distribution of aggregates varied even within a single soil texture class, mainly because of the difference in soil types, indicating that the above assumption does not hold in this region. Azonal aeolian sediments have typical well-sorted forms of size distributions, but <b>zonal</b> steppe <b>soils</b> show various patterns of size distribution. Parent material can be a good indicator to use to classify the size distributions of aggregates in steppe soils, loess materials and soils formed on newer (Quaternary and Cretaceous) igneous rock (finer soils), on sedimentary materials (coarser soils), and on ancient geological layers (complex, coarse particle size composition). Soil maps and geological maps of this region are readily available, so the mapping of soil aggregates in relation to these thematic maps should be efficient and practical...|$|R
