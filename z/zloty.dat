5|$|In 1576, the Transylvanian prince Stefan Batory became King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania after a contested {{election}} to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne with the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian II. Both Batory's fiancèe Anna Jagiellon and Maximilian II had been proclaimed elected to the same throne in December 1575, three days apart; Maximilan's death in October 1576 prevented the conflict from escalating. Batory, ambitious to expel Ivan IV from Livonia, was constrained by the opposition of Danzig (Gdansk), which resisted Batory's accession with Danish support. The ensuing Danzig War of 1577 ended when Batory conceded further autonomous rights to the city {{in return for a}} payment of 200,000 <b>zloty.</b> For a further 200,000 <b>zloty</b> payment, he appointed Hohenzollern George Frederick as administrator of Prussia and secured the latter's military support in the planned campaign against Russia.|$|E

25|$|All private {{property}} and – crucial to Jewish economic life – private businesses were nationalized; political activity was delegalized {{and thousands of people}} were jailed, many of whom were later executed. Zionism, which was designated by the Soviets as counter-revolutionary was also forbidden. In just one day all Polish and Jewish media were shut down and replaced by the new Soviet press, which conducted political propaganda attacking religion including the Jewish faith. Synagogues and churches were not yet closed but heavily taxed. The Soviet ruble of little value was immediately equalized to the much higher Polish <b>zloty</b> {{and by the end of}} 1939, <b>zloty</b> was abolished. Most economic activity became subject to central planning and the NKVD restrictions. Since the Jewish communities tended to rely more on commerce and small scale businesses, the confiscations of property affected them to a greater degree than the general populace. The Soviet rule resulted in near collapse of the local economy, characterized by insufficient wages and general shortage of goods and materials. The Jews, like other inhabitants of the region, saw a fall in their living standards.|$|E
