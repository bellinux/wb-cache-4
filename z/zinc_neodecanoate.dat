40|$|A {{wide variety}} of tunable physio-chemical {{properties}} make ZnO nanowires a promising candidate for functional device applications. Although bottom-up grown nanowires are producible in volume, their high-throughput device integration requires control over dimensions and, more importantly, of precise placement. Thus development of top-down fabrication routes with accurate device positioning is imperative and hence pursued in this thesis. ZnO thin film transistors (TFT) were fabricated using solution based precursor <b>zinc</b> <b>neodecanoate.</b> A range of ZnO thin films were prepared by varying process parameters, such as precursor concentrations and annealing temperatures, and then analysed for their optical and electrical characteristics. ZnO TFTs prepared from a 15...|$|E
40|$|Modern diesel {{passenger}} car technology continues to develop rapidly {{in response to}} demanding emissions, performance, refinement, cost and fuel efficiency requirements. This has included the implementation of high pressure common rail fuel systems employing high precision injectors with complex injection strategies, higher hydraulic efficiency injector nozzles {{and in some cases}} < 100 Âµm nozzle hole diameters. With the trend towards lower diameter diesel injector nozzle holes and reduced cleaning through cavitation with higher hydraulic efficiency nozzles, it is increasingly important to focus on understanding the mechanism of diesel injector nozzle deposit formation and growth. In this study such deposits were analysed by cross-sectioning the diesel injector {{along the length of the}} nozzle hole enabling in-depth analysis of deposit morphology and composition change from the inlet to the outlet, using state-of-the-art electron microscopy techniques. Deposits produced in the injector nozzles of the industry standard fouling test (CEC F- 98 - 08 DW 10 B bench engine) were compared with those formed in a vehicle driven on a chassis dynamometer, using a drive cycle more representative of real world vehicle conditions, to explore the effects of differing drive cycles and engine technologies. Fouling in all tests was accelerated with the addition of 1 ppm <b>zinc</b> <b>neodecanoate,</b> as specified in the CEC DW 10 B test. This in-depth characterisation revealed a complex multi-layered system of deposits inside the diesel injector nozzle. Through analysing these layers the mechanisms enabling the initial deposit formation and growth can be postulated...|$|E
