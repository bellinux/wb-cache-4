To define better the developmental and metabolic functions of this enzyme, we developed a CYP 1 A 2 -deficient mouse line by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the targeted Cyp 1 a 2 gene, designated Cyp 1 a 2 (-/-), are completely viable and fertile; histologic examination of 15 -day embryos, newborn pups, and 3 -week-old mice revealed no abnormalities. No CYP 1 A 2 mRNA was detected by Northern blot analysis. Moreover, mRNA levels of Cyp 1 a 1, the other gene in the same subfamily, appear unaffected by loss of the Cyp 1 a 2 gene.

The present study revealed that both CO and hypoxic hypoxia also prolonged the pharmacologic response to a drug of vastly different structure and site of action, i. e., hexobarbital. In this case, CO was approximately equipotent to hypoxic hypoxia in prolonging sleeping time. In spite of a number of significant effects of the two types of hypoxia on factors such as rate of peritoneal absorption, distribution into the brain and brain sensitivity to the drug, their relative potencies in prolonging sleeping time appeared to reflect adequately their relative effects on in vivo rate of metabolism.

40|$|Chronic {{administration}} of ethanol to rats {{has no effect}} on the plasma half life of pentobarbitone, which indicates that ethanol does not induce the microsomal enzyme system and that the latter is therefore not identical with the 'microsomal ethanol oxidizing system'. The microsomal oxidation of ethanol observed in vitro is probably the result of metabolism of ethanol by contaminating alcohol dehydrogenase and by catalase peroxidation. Chronic {{administration of}} ethanol to rats leads to stimulation of the activity of the hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes in vitro which is not paralleled by any corresponding increase in the concentration of cytochrome P- 450, the terminal enzyme in the microsomal mono oxygenase system. However, no changes were seen in hexobarbital sleeping time or <b>zoxazolamine</b> paralysis time, confirming that ethanol pretreatment does not lead to any significant stimulation of the hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes in vivo. The observed inhibition of barbiturate metabolism after simultaneous administration of large amounts of ethanol may be attributed to nonspecific interaction with the active site of the microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes. Ethanol has also been shown to potentiate the enzyme induction effect of phenobarbitone in vitro in respect of cytochrome P- 450 and cytochrome b 5. The effect was even more pronounced in vivo when none of the animals pretreated with both phenobarbitone and ethanol exhibited <b>zoxazolamine</b> paralysis and only one third of these animals exhibited narcosis after hexobarbitone administration. The lipophilic character of ethanol allows it to penetrate the lipid environment of the endoplasmic reticulum and to interact with cytochrome P- 450 giving a type II substrate interaction spectrum, although it is not metabolized by the microsomal mono oxygenase system. The molar concentration of ethanol required to give a type II spectrum is much higher than that required for aniline suggesting that the interaction of ethanol with cytochrome P- 450 is a non specific interaction with the lipophilic phase of the microsomal membrane adjacent to the haemoprotein. Ethanol may therefore act as an activator of the microsomal mono oxygenase enzyme system either by modification of the membrane environment, by allosteric effects, or by displacement of other endogenous or exogenous substrates already bound to the enzymic sites. The potentiation of phenobarbitone induction of this enzyme system {{may be the result of}} stabilization of the substrate enzyme complex, as it has been suggested that induction of the microsomal enzymes is a function of the stability of the enzyme substrate complex...|$|E

Exposure to methylchloroform vapor significantly decreased the sleeping time of the rat in response to hexobarbital (120 mg/kg, i. p.) and <b>zoxazolamine</b> (80 mg/kg, i. p.). Rat blood and liver methylchloroform content measured immediately following exposure suggested that the effects of methylchloroform were caused by a systemic action. Experiments with 9000 x G supernatants indicated that the metabolism of hexobarbital was significantly increased following exposure to methylchloroform. Significantly increased N-demethylation of aminopyrine, accompanied by increased amounts of microsomal CO-binding pigment (cytochrome P- 450) and microsomal NADPII-cytochrome c reductate were observed in vitro experiments using hepatic microsomal fractions from rats exposed to methylchloroform. The spectral properties of the CO-binding pigment in animals exposed to methylchloroform did not differ from controls Pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide prevented the decrease in the hexobarbital sleeping time in rats exposed to methylchloroform. Further studies demonstrated that pretreatment with cycloheximide prevented the increase in metabolism of aminopyrine by rats exposed to methylchloroform.

40|$|Cadmium is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of hepatic microsomal drug biotransformation in the rat. Male rats receiving a single intraperitoneal dose of cadmium exhibit significant decreases in hepatic microsomal metabolism {{of a variety of}} substrates. The threshold cadmium dose is 0. 84 mg Cd/kg, and the effect lasts at least 28 days. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect results from decreased cytochrome P 450 content since cadmium does not alter NADPH cytochrome c reductase activity. This effect is also observed following acute oral administration of cadmium in doses greater than 80 mg Cd/kg but is not observed following chronic administration of the metal via drinking water in concentrations of 5 - 200 ppm for periods ranging from 2 to 50 weeks. A tolerance to the inhibitory cadmium effect is observed if male rats are pretreated with subthreshold doses of the metal prior to the challenge cadmium dose. The degree of tolerance can be overcome by increasing the challenge dose of cadmium. Characterization of the tolerance phenomenon in terms of onset, duration, and intensity reveals a good correlation with the kinetics of metaliothionein production, suggesting that the underlying basis for the tolerance phenomenon is likely the induction of metallothionein.

Thiopental sleeping times and egg loads of infected animals are shown in Table 1. Although S. haematobium infected animals did not have detectable levels of parasite eggs in their livers at 8 weeks post-infection, significant numbers of eggs were detectable at 12 weeks post-infection. This is in agreement with the observed delayed maturation of S. haematobium schistosomulae in rodents as compared to S. mansoni or S. mattheei.

The superfamily of cytochromes P 450 {{are an excellent}} example of a common structural scaffold being utilized for a variety of biological functions. This functional diversity is achieved in Nature through millions of years of evolution to create new and diverse sequences. We have used site-directed recombination guided by the computation algorithm SCHEMA to create an artificial family of cytochromes P 450 in the laboratory. Members of this family possess unique properties such as altered activity profiles, increased thermostability and the ability to accept new substrates. We developed screening tools for the rapid analysis of hundreds of individual P 450 s. These high-throughput assays include the 4 -aminoantipyrine (4 -AAP) assay which is capable of detecting the hydroxylation of an aromatic ring. High-throughput carbon monoxide binding facilitates the rapid detection of P 450 s that correctly incorporate a heme cofactor and are thus properly folded and potentially functional. Finally, a substrate binding assay which measures a spectral shift that occurs when a substrate binds in a P 450 active site is described. Fourteen double-crossover chimeras created from the bacterial P 450 s CYP 102 A 1 and CYP 102 A 2 were constructed to calibrate the P 450 scaffold for SCHEMA, a computational algorithm used to minimize structural disruption in chimeric proteins. We found that only chimeras with high levels of structural disruption as measured by SCHEMA were unfolded. Among the fourteen chimeras we also observed three different activity profiles based on peroxygenase kinetic assays with the substrates p-nitrophenoxydodecanoic acid (12 -pNCA), 2 -phenoxyethanol and allyloxybenzene. We applied this calibration to create an artificial family comprising ~ 3, 000 chimeric heme P 450 proteins that correctly fold and incorporate a heme cofactor by recombining three cytochromes P 450 at seven crossover locations chosen to minimize structural disruption. Members of this protein family differ from any known sequence at an average of 72 and by as many as 109 amino acids. Most (> 73 %) of the properly folded chimeric P 450 heme proteins are catalytically active peroxygenases; some are more thermostable than the parent proteins. A multiple sequence alignment of 955 chimeras, including both folded and not, was analyzed using logistic regression analysis (LRA) to identify key structural contributions to cytochrome P 450 heme incorporation and peroxygenase activity and suggests possible structural differences between parents CYP 102 A 1 and CYP 102 A 2. Thirty-four members of this artificial family were assayed for functional diversity on a set of eight substrates. P 450 chimeras were able to exceed the parents in total activity on all eight substrates and were grouped into five different groups based on activity profiles using K-means clustering. Activity profiles on eight substrates were then performed in high throughput to produce a data set of 330 chimeras. The mean percent standard deviation of the activity assays showed the reproducibility of these high-throughput data and further analysis may reveal information about sequence-structure-function relationships. The products of the catalytic reactions of four chimeric P 450 s with substrates of human P 450 s, some of which are drug compounds, were analyzed by HPLC in order to determine their identity. Chimeras were able to produce authentic human metabolites of chlorzoxazone, <b>zoxazolamine</b> and propranolol, showed peroxidase acitivty on 4 -aminobiphenyl and produced an unknown product with tolbutamide. Finally, the peroxygenase activity of a mutant P 450 heme domain is able to be further altered and enhanced using directed evolution. After two rounds of directed evolution and screening with the 4 -AAP assay, we found mutants with altered substrate specificities and an overall enhancement of activity. The design and high-throughput methodologies described here can be used to create artificial protein families and to discover new and useful protein sequences. Like natural protein families, artificial protein families can be used to identify regions of protein sequence and structure that are important for folding and function. This is especially useful for analyzing protein families with few members or for validating tools for structure prediction and for protein sequence-structure-function analysis. Artificial protein {{families are}} also rich in sequence diversity and can provide sources of novel protein function. Using the high-throughput methodologies described here, chimeric P 450 s with enhanced activity, altered activity profiles, and the ability to hydroxylate drug-like compounds to produce authentic human metabolites were discovered in our artificial family of P 450 s. These methodologies will hopefully be extended to the study of other protein families and to the creation and discovery of increasingly valuable protein catalysts...|$|E
40|$|Nonlyphenols (NP) are {{becoming}} one of the most ubiquitous contaminants in U. S. waterways. NP was previsouly shown to increase the incidence while decreasing the latency of breast cancer in FVB/NJ MMTV neu mice. During these breast cancer studies, P 450 induction was measured. We therefore sought to determine cytochrome P 450 induction by NP in wild-type FVB/NJ mice; however, in our pilot study with male mice we saw nominal induction of P 450 s by Quantitative Real-Time PCR (Q-PCR), and downregulation of the Cyp 3 a subfamily by Western blot. Basal sexual dimorphic expression of P 450 s in mice and rats was previsouly published. The first aim {{of this study was to}} determine if FVB/NJ mice had sexual dimorphic expression of P 450 s measured in other mouse strains, and to determine the sexual dimorphic induction of P 450 s by NP. Mice treated with honey vehicle control, 25 mg/kg/day (males only), 50 mg/kg/day, or 75 mg/kg/day NP, or 100 μg/kg/day estradiol (E 2) (females only) for one week. No significant P 450 induction was measured at 25 mg/kg/day or with 100 ug/kg/day estradiol, suggesting the threshold for P 450 induction by NP in vivo is greater than 25 mg/kg, and P 450 alterations were not due to NP 2 ̆ 7 s estrogenicity. Eight of the ten P 450 s were female predominant, and sexual dimorphic induction of P 450 s by NP treatment was measured. These results were confirmed by Western blot and testosterone hydroxylation enzyme assays. Higher basal/induction of P 450 s in females, resulted in increased <b>Zoxazolamine</b> (ZOX) paralysis and decreased survival of ZOX-challenged males mice. The preferential induction of the Cyp 2 b subfamily compared to the Cyp 3 a subfamily, induction of Cyp 2 b 10 in both sexes, and v the decreased paralysis time in males and females by TCPOBOP (a known CAR-agonist), suggested activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). The second aim of this study was to determine whether NP can activate mouse and human CAR. Luciferase reporter assays utilizing HepG 2 cells, a liver cancer cell line, was used to determine NP activation of mouse CAR (mCAR) in vitro. NP activated mCAR at 1 μM, and was able to overcome androstanol inhibition of CAR’s basal activity; on the other hand human CAR (hCAR) assays were inconclusive. Wild-type (BL 6129) and CAR-null mice were treated with honey vehicle control, 50 mg/kg/day, 75 mg/kg/day NP, or 3 mg/kg TCPOBOP. Cyp 2 b 10, the biomarker for CAR activation, was induced in a CAR-dependent manner by NP measured by Q-PCR and Western blot. These results suggest NP activates mCAR in vivo. Cyp 2 b 10 induction by NP was measured by Q-PCR and Western blot in transgenic human CAR mice. Induction of CYP 2 B 6, the only CYP 2 B isoform expressed in humans, was measured in primary human hepatocytes from three donors. The induction of Cyp 2 b 10 in humanized mice and primary hepatocytes suggested NP activates hCAR in vivo. We determined NP activates mouse and human CAR, and causes sexual dimorphic induction of P 450 s. The final aim of this study was to determine CAR’s role in the maintenance of basal sexual dimorphic expression and induction of P 450 s by NP. Male and female wild-type (B 6129) and CAR-null mice were treated as previsouly described in aim two. Basal P 450 expression in this mouse strain was similar to FVB/NJ mice, though female P 450 expression was stunted in the BL 6129 strain. The BL 6129 strain mimiced human P 450 sexual dimorphic patterns, as the P 450 s measured are female predominant but not at the exaggerated levels seen in rats and FVB/NJ mice. CAR regulated the expression of Cyp 2 b 13 and Cyp 2 c 29 in male mice, while Cyp 2 b 10 and Cyp 2 c 29 were regulated in females to a lesser degree. NP induced Cyp 2 b 10, Cyp 2 c 29, and Cyp 3 a 11 in a CAR-mediated female specific vi manner; however TCPOBOP induced these P 450 s in both males and females. TCPOBOP and NP exhibited similar P 450 induction profiles in females but differed in males, suggesting a differential sensitivity of males to weak or moderate CAR activators such as NP. The ubiquitous environmental estrogen, NP, altered P 450 s in male and female mice, activated mouse and human CAR, and the sexual dimorphic sensitivity to NP is mediated in part through CAR. We hypothesize that NP exposure may have enocrine-independent effects mediated through the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and CAR in the liver. These results suggesr drug-drug interactions and decreased pharmaceutical efficacy could be more prevelant in women exposed to NP and other CAR partial agonists. Men may respond poorly to toxicant insult due to lower basal P 450 expression and P 450 induction of genes transcriptionally regulated by CAR. Two possible mechanisms for decreased sensitivity in men could be lower CAR expression, previsouly observed in male mice, and increased levels of androgens which repress CAR basal activity.
