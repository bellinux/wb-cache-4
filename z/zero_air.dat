A theoretical model is presented that explains this behavior. The proposed model takes into account both the dependence of conductivity on the potential barrier height at grain boundaries of the film and the dependence of chemisorption rate of oxygen on free-electron availability. The theoretical analysis is in good qualitative agreement with experiment. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
