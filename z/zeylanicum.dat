5|$|Various {{parts of}} trees {{are used as}} spices. These include {{cinnamon}}, made from the bark of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum <b>zeylanicum)</b> and allspice, the dried small fruits of the pimento tree (Pimenta dioica).

5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma <b>zeylanicum</b> and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E

Some of the birds found here are the great hornbill, the Malabar pied hornbill, the Ceylon frogmouth, herons, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons, quails, partridges, lapwings, sandpipers, pigeons, doves, parakeets, cuckoos, owls, nightjars, swifts, kingfishers, bee-eaters and munias.

25|$|Like {{the potato}} and S. lichtensteinii, {{but unlike the}} tomato, which then was {{generally}} put in a different genus, the eggplant was also described as S. esculentum, in this case once more {{in the course of}} Dunal's work. He also recognized the varieties aculeatum, inerme, and subinerme at that time. Similarly, H.C.F. Schuhmacher and Peter Thonning named the eggplant as S. edule, which is also a junior synonym of sticky nightshade (S. sisymbriifolium). Scopoli's S. <b>zeylanicum</b> refers to the eggplant, and that of Blanco to S. lasiocarpum.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tropical}} greenhouse {{a variety of}} tropical and subtropical plants {{from all over the}} world can be found. Some of the plants include a variety of food and medicinal plants including Coffea arabica (coffee), Camellia sinensis (tea), Vanilla planifolia (vanilla), Saccharum officinarum (sugarcane), Cinnamomum <b>zeylanicum</b> (cinnamon), Oryza sativa (rice), Theobroma cacao (cacao), Siphonochilus aethiopicus (wild ginger), Warburghia salutaris (pepper bark tree) and Piper nigrum (pepper). The tropical greenhouse also houses many other exotic plants from a variety of families most notably the Orchid family. Many indigenous epiphytic orchids such as Ansellia africana (leopard orchid) and Mystacidium capense, can be found in this greenhouse. Other interesting plants on display include Amorphophallus titanum (giant corpse flower), Hydnophytum formicarum (ant plant), Heliconia humilis (lobster plant), Nepenthes alata (pitcher plant) and Ravenala madagascariensis (travelers palm). In 2010 Victoria cruziana (giant Amazon waterlily) was also successfully grown in {{the tropical}} greenhouse which drew numerous curious visitors to the Garden. This was the first successful recorded cultivation in many decades for South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|Yala National Park has {{a variety}} of {{ecosystems}} including moist monsoon forests, dry monsoon forests, semi deciduous forests, thorn forests, grasslands, marshes, marine wetlands, and sandy beaches. The area under forest cover mainly consists of Block I and rangelands of open parkland (Pelessa grasslands) including some extensive grasslands. The forest area is restricted to around the Menik River while rangelands are found towards the sea side. Other habitat types of the Block I are tanks and water holes, lagoons and mangroves and chena lands. The mangrove vegetation in the Buthuwa lagoon is largely Rhizophora mucronata while Avicennia spp. and Aegiceras spp. are less abundant. The vegetation of Block II is similar to those of Block I, and Yalawela, once a fertile paddy field, represents Pitiya grasslands. The mangroves of Block II occur around the estuary of Menik River, which extent to [...] The common mangrove plants are Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia caseolaris, Avicennia spp., and Aegiceras corniculatum. The lagoons of Pilinnawa, Mahapothana, and Pahalapothana are also located in this block. The other common mangrove species are Sonneratia caseolaris, Acanthus ilicifolius, Excoecaria agallocha, and Lumnitzera racemosa. In the bare sand Crinum <b>zeylanicum</b> is found.|$|E
