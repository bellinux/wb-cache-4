40|$|Recently, Spicer et al. have {{reported}} their results concerning two <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> in myosin caused under a certain ionic strength and pH (3). The characters {{in respect to}} the solubility of actomyosin (AM) are the reflections of those of myosin, {{even if it is}} sharper in the ease of myosin than in AM. Therefore, the new phenomenon mentioned above in myosin is important to the AM-ATP (adenosinetriphosphate) interaction. Accordingly, the author studied the effect of various pH and ionic strength on the solubility of myosin in detail. The results are as follows: 1) Myosin is precipitated twice with increasing pH under a certain constant ionic strength (Fig. 1). In this case, alkaline precipitate is formed after relatively prolonged intervals (Fig. 3). 2) The pH value where myosin precipitation occurs decreases with increasing ionic strength. As a consequence, the above mentioned two <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> myosin <b>precipitation</b> converge (Fig. 1). On the other hand, these zones approach likewise with decreasing ionic strength below 0. 10. 3) The grade of solubility of the two precipitationi is different, namely, alkaline is more soluble than acid (Fig. 2). 4) At pH 5. 6 and ionic strength 0. 38, the turbidity that develops at 25 ℃ is largely reversed at 0 ℃. Accordingly, the formation <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> is endothermic (Fig. 3). 5) At pH 6. 6 and ionic strength 0. 16, the turbidity develops abruptly at 0 ℃, however, at pH 8. 0 and ionic strength 0. 16, the turbidity does not develop till after two hours, in spite of changing the tempera-ture (0 ℃→ 25 ℃, 25 ℃→ 0 ℃), but develops abruptly at 25 ℃ after two hours following beginning of reaction (Fig. 3) ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityVi antigen vms first {{discovered}} {{as a component}} of the typhoid bacillus in 1934. Since that time, serologically identical or very closely related Vi antigens have been found to occur in almost all freshly isolated strains of Salmonella tyohosa, in some strains of Salmonella paratyphi C and in one strain each of Paracolobactrum ballerup and Escherichia coli. The purpose of the present investigation was to immununologically characterize Vi antigens which were purified by the method of Baker (Baker, E. E., To be published). Serologic properties of Vi antigens were studied by the agar diffusion technique. It was found that zones of specific precipitate could be identified in the agar which were due to Vi antigen and its antibody. Vi antigens prepared from P. ballerup, E. coli, S. typhosa, strain Ty 2 and S. typhosa, strain 61 were serologically identical by this method. This precipitin technique presented itself as a highly sensitive method for detection of small amounts of antigens and as little as 1. 0 microgram of purified Vi antigen per milliliter of 0. 15 M sodium chloride solution formed a visible <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> In order to be certain that the properties of Vi antigen under consideration were attributed solely to Vi antigen, this sensitive agar diffusion technique was applied to determine purity of antigen preparations. It was noted that Vi antigens derived from P. ballerup and S. typhosa, strain 61 were serologically pure substances. However, Vi antigen preparations were isolated from E. coli and S. typhosa, strain Ty 2 which contained a very small amount of another substance. A serologic study of Vi antigen was made in which several concentrations of Vi antigens were reacted in agar diffusion precipitin tests with different dilutions of antisera. The antisera were prepared by immunizing rabbits with acetone killed and dried organisms containing Vi antigen. It was observed that at a certain ratio of Vi antigen to antibody, two precipitate zones were visible. Since the position of the precipitate zone in the agar was determined by the concentration of reactants when other factors remained constant, one antibody concentration was reacted with decreasing concentrations of Vi antigen. The two zones of specific precipitate became superimposed and further dilution of Vi antigen did not result in separation of the two zones. It may be that acetylated and a small amount of deacetylated Vi antigen were present in the purified preparations. Like the capsular polysaccharide of Pneumococens Type I, acetylated Vi antigen may be capable of absorbing all the specific antibody while the deacetylated antigen may have been capable of absorbing only antibody reactive with the deacetylated antigen leaving the antibody titer for the acetylated antigen unchanged. This hypothesis was strengthened by agar diffusion precipitin studies using Vi antigen which was deacetylated by hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide. Vi antigens were characterized further biologically. Acetone killed and dried Vi containing organisms were excellent immunizing agents in the rabbit. However, purified Vi antigens from these organisms were very poor immunizing agents in rabbits. Rabbits were apparently very sensitive to intoxication by the Vi containing organisms under study. Therefore, purified Vi antigens were tested for toxic effects in these animals. It was found that the pure Vi antigens were relatively non-toxic even when administered in large doses. Purified Vi antigens were employed as preparatory injections in an effort to demonstrate the Shwartzman phenomenon of local skin reactivity. It has been shovm that pure Vi antigens were incapable of preparing rabbit skin for the local Shwartzman reaction. The agar diffusion technique was employed in comparative studies of antigens from several strains of S. typhosa. Antigenic analyses of the various strains of S. typhosa are still under investigation. A technique of absorption directly in the agar diffusion plate was proposed and is presently under study...|$|E

The volcano grew during the glacials and interglacials of the Pleistocene but became practically extinct in late Middle Pleistocene 300 ka ago, due to a shift in the active front of the Southern Volcanic Zone to which it belongs. Since then, glaciations and other erosive processes shaped the mountain freely without new output of lava or tephra.

40|$|Microbialites (benthic {{microbial}} carbonate deposits) {{were discovered}} in a hypersaline alkaline lake on Eleuthera Island (Bahamas). From the edge towards {{the centre of the}} lake, four main <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> could be distinguished: (1) millimetre-sized clumps of Mg-calcite on a thin microbial mat; (2) thicker and continuous carbonate crusts with columnar morphologies; (3) isolated patches of carbonate crust separated by a dark non-calcified gelatinous mat; and (4) a dark microbial mat without precipitation. In thin section, the precipitate displayed a micropeloidal structure characterized by micritic micropeloids (strong autofluorescence) surrounded by microspar and spar cement (no fluorescence). Observations using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with a cryotransfer system indicate that micrite nucleation is initiated within a polymer biofilm that embeds microbial communities. These extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are progressively replaced with high-Mg calcite. Discontinuous EPS calcification generates a micropeloidal structure of the micrite, possibly resulting from the presence of clusters of coccoid or remnants of filamentous bacteria. At high magnification, the microstructure of the initial precipitate consists of 200 – 500 nm spheres. No precipitation is observed in or on the sheaths of cyanobacteria, and only a negligible amount <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> is directly associated with the well-organized and active filamentous cyanobacteria (in deeper layers of the mat), indicating that carbonate precipitation is not associated with CO 2 uptake during photosynthesis. Instead, the precipitation occurs at the uppermost layer of the mat, which is composed of EPS, empty filamentous bacteria and coccoids (Gloeocapsa spp.). Two-dimensional mapping of sulphate reduction shows high activity in close association with the carbonate precipitate {{at the top of the}} microbial mat. In combination, these findings suggest that net <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> calcium carbonate results from a temporal and spatial decoupling of the various microbial metabolic processes responsible for CaCO 3 precipitation and dissolution. Theoretically, partial degradation of EPS by aerobic heterotrophs or UV fuels sulphate-reducing activity, which increases alkalinity in microdomains, inducing CaCO 3 precipitation. This degradation could also be responsible for EPS decarboxylation, which eliminates Ca 2 + -binding capacity of the EPS and releases Ca 2 + ions that were originally bound by carboxyl groups. At the end of these processes, the EPS biofilm is calcified and exhibits a micritic micropeloidal structure. The EPS-free precipitate subsequently serves as a substrate for physico-chemical <b>precipitation</b> <b>of</b> spar cement from the alkaline water of the lake. The micropeloidal structure has an intimate mixture of micrite and microspar comparable to microstructures of some fossil microbialites...|$|R

The wide heated plains of the Sahara, and in a lesser degree the corresponding <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the Kalahari in the south, have an exceedingly scanty rainfall, the winds which blow over them from the ocean losing part of their moisture as they pass over the outer highlands, and becoming constantly drier owing to the heating effects of the burning soil of the interior; while the scarcity of mountain ranges in the more central parts likewise tends to prevent condensation. In the inter-tropical <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> summer <b>precipitation,</b> the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after. It is therefore greatest of all near the equator, where the sun is twice vertical, and less in the direction of both tropics.The rainfall zones are, however, somewhat deflected from a due west-to-east direction, the drier northern conditions extending southwards along the east coast, and those of the south northwards along the west. Within the equatorial zone certain areas, especially on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea and in the upper Nile basin, have an intensified rainfall, but this rarely approaches that of the rainiest regions of the world. The rainiest district in all Africa is a strip of coastland west of Mount Cameroon, where there is a mean annual rainfall of about 10000 mm as compared with a mean of 11600 mm at Cherrapunji, in Meghalaya, India.|$|R
30|$|The North Coast Range {{is in the}} {{vicinity}} <b>of</b> the pivot <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> the ENSO-PDO <b>precipitation</b> dipole that is located at approximately 40 ° to 45 ° N and that shifts north or south on inter-annual and decadal time scales (Dettinger et al. 1998). Thus, inter-annual and inter-decadal fire-climate associations in this area may vary at different periods of time from being {{similar to those in}} the Pacific northwest to being similar to those in the southwest (Westerling and Swetnam 2003, Taylor and Beaty 2005), and to being totally lacking in other periods (Fry and Stephens 2006, Taylor et al. 2008). No significant fire-SST associations have been found in the Klamath Mountains immediately north of the study area, thus none have been reported in previous studies such as Taylor and Skinner (2003) and Fry and Stephens (2006).|$|R
40|$|Modern {{microbial}}ites are carbonate-precipitating microbial {{mats and}} represent the closest living analogues to ancient stromatolites. These ancient carbonate formations are the oldest fossil evidence of life on Earth; however, our comprehension of their relationship to early earth ecosystems relies heavily on understanding the formation of modern microbialites. Research regarding these formation processes has suggested that chemical constraints <b>of</b> CaCO 3 <b>precipitation</b> vary on sub-millimeter spatial scales within the living microbial community. In an attempt {{to shed light on}} the importance of these chemical microenvironments, this study focused on understanding the spatial distribution of the organisms and processes involved in the formation of modern microbialites. This was accomplished by isolating five visually distinct layers from the upper 2 – 3 cm of an actively forming microbialite found in the freshwater system of Cuatro Ciénegas, Mexico. Each layer was analyzed using genomic, molecular organic, and stable isotopic techniques. Bacterial diversity was determined by 16 S rRNA gene analyses, lipid biomarker content was detected by GC-MS, and carbon isotope composition of organic matter and CaCO 3 were used as indicators of specific microbial processes. Results of the 16 S rRNA gene analysis showed that there is little overlap in the community composition of individual layers. Approximately 90 % of the ribotypes identified in the microbialite were unique to a single layer. Furthermore, the relative accretion of CaCO 3 at each layer was used to connect the distribution of organisms and processes with two specific <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> CaCO 3 <b>precipitation.</b> The first <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> CaCO 3 accretion, which accounted for approximately 55 % of total CaCO 3 accumulation, is found in the surface two layers of the microbialites and dominated by photoautotrophic cyanobacteria and algae. The second <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> CaCO 3 <b>precipitation,</b> found at the interior (layers 4 and 5), is composed primarily of heterotrophic proteobacteria and dominated by sulfate-reducing !-proteobacteria. The lipid content of the microbialite reflected the community structure as determined by genomics. Numerous photosynthetic biomarkers were detected and decreased in abundance with depth, indicating the important function of heterotrophic degradation. Additionally, the detection of sulfurized phytol compounds in layer 5 highlighted an important mechanism for the preservation of biogenic signatures, and reflected both the abundance of phototrophic organisms and sulfatereducing bacteria. In combination, these interdisciplinary analyses provided an understanding of microbial community composition and metabolism while indicating the spatial relationship to CaCO 3 formation and the preservation of distinct biochemical signatures. ...|$|R

Movements are clearly related to the amount <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> {{and the presence of}} springs, and secondarily to run-off following seasonal melts. Five topographic maps published between 1948 and 1980 are compared and they reveal the effects <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> and <b>of</b> human intervention...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{permafrost}} influence {{water balance}} exchanges in watersheds of cryosphere. Water storage change (WSC) {{is an important}} factor in water cycle. We used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to retrieve WSC in the Three-River Source Region and subregions. WSC in four types of permafrost (continuous, seasonal, island, and patchy permafrost) was analyzed during 2003 – 2010. The result showed that WSC had significant change; it increased by 9. 06 ± 0. 01 [*]mm/a (21. 89 ± 0. 02 × 109 [*]m 3) over the Three-River Source Region during the study period. The most significant changes of WSC were in continuous permafrost zone, with a total amount of about 13. 94 ± 0. 48 × 109 [*]m 3. The spatial distribution of WSC was in state of gain in the continuous permafrost zone, whereas it was in a state of loss in the other permafrost <b>zones.</b> Little changes <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> and runoff occurred in study area, but the WSC increased significantly, according to water balance equation, the changes of runoff and water storage were subtracted from changes <b>of</b> <b>precipitation,</b> and the result showed that changes of evaporation is minus which means the evaporation decreased in the Three-River Source Region during 2003 – 2010...|$|R
