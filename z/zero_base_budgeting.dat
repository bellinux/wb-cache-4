40|$|Previous applied {{empirical}} research is limited. This research builds {{a bridge between}} management accounting 'normative theory' and current practice, {{through the development of}} 'positive budgetary theory'. In order to achieve this a series of objectives were set, relating to: developing a statement of textbook 'normative' theory; identifying industry practice; analysing practice in relation to theory; critically reviewing the rationale for practice; and developing a model of 'positive' budgetary theory appropriate for UK hotel organizations. The methodological stance was interpretive and corpus based. Individual corpus (body of knowledge) were developed related to 'normative' theory and hospitality industry practice. An interpretative approach was used to interrogate the corpus in order to ascertain 'positive' theory, concerning budgeting in the hospitality industry. The methodological approach adopted required a multi-method approach, which allowed triangulation of results. Methods used were content analysis, postal census survey, semi-structured interviews and a qualitative questionnaire. The content analysis results identified aspects of budgeting that were 'normative', 'probably normative', 'probably not normative', and 'not normative' in textbooks. Of the sixteen aspects of budgeting reviewed ten were considered normative (at the primary coded level) but others such as <b>zero</b> <b>base</b> <b>budgeting</b> was probably not normative. Findings from industry research established aspects of practice in line with 'normative' theory. Positive theory developed was informed by practice, normative theory and the rationale for industry practice. No general 'theory/practice' gap was identified for budgeting. For many aspects such as the need for participation in the budgeting process, or the marginal reporting of <b>zero</b> <b>base</b> <b>budgeting,</b> there was agreement. However flexible budgeting was viewed has having little use in the industry, whilst it was normative in textbooks. The results also identify aspects that need to be reconsidered by industry, particularly participation at lower levels in the organization and the financial training needs of non-financial managers...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} discover {{why and how}} presidents choose their administrative strategies. The hypothesis advanced argues the political beliefs of a president make some administrative strategies more appealing than others. ^ Chapter One offers a critique of current explanations of presidential behavior, including the 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 models of the 2 ̆ 2 rational decider 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 personality 2 ̆ 2 models of decision making. A third model, that of 2 ̆ 2 political belief, 2 ̆ 2 is described and discussed. The chapter concludes by arguing this belief model can escape the methodological problems plaguing the other 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 approaches to explaining behavior. ^ Chapters Two, Three and Four test this model by examining the reorganizational and budget decisions of the Nixon, Carter and Reagan administrations. Chapter Two demonstrates that Richard Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s belief in the individual 2 ̆ 7 s power to control one 2 ̆ 7 s life best explains his decisions to decentralize government through reorganization and revenue sharing. Chapter Three concludes that Jimmy Carter 2 ̆ 7 s belief in a progressive agenda to democratize government best explains his decision to reorganize government from the 2 ̆ 2 bottom-up 2 ̆ 2 and {{through the use of}} <b>zero</b> <b>base</b> <b>budgeting.</b> Chapter Four finds that Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s decisions to reorganize the executive branch from 2 ̆ 2 within 2 ̆ 2 and to alter the budget process are best explained by his belief in government as an agent for social change, but only in specific areas of activity. ^ Chapter Five concludes the research by briefly examining the Bush presidency, and concludes that Bush, like Jimmy Carter, is a president more concerned with 2 ̆ 2 process 2 ̆ 2 than 2 ̆ 2 policy. 2 ̆ 2 Each 2 ̆ 2 classic 2 ̆ 2 methodology is demonstrated to be flawed, and the 2 ̆ 2 belief 2 ̆ 2 model is shown to best explain the behavior of each president. For that reason, the project closes, political science under-appreciates the role of political belief in decision making. ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{sought to}} analyze the impact of {{budgeting}} and budgetary control systems being incorporated at Great Zimbabwe University. Great Zimbabwe University is a state-owned institution which has been defied with adverse variances {{for the past three}} years up to date. The study revealed that these adverse variances was as a result of the nature of a poor budgeting system currently employed by the organization. The researcher used a descriptive research design and GZU as a case study in this research. A sample of twenty respondents was selected using a judgmental sampling approach. Gathering of data with the aim of confirming the existence of a problem was done through the use of questionnaires and interviews. Twenty out of twenty respondents filled and returned the questionnaires and three respondents were interviewed. The gathered data was presented and analysed in the form of graphs, tables and pie charts. Moreover, the gathered information was interpreted and compared to the existing literature in an attempt to confirm the existence of the problem. The results showed that there is inflexible budget structure, lack of lower level participation in budget process, poor supervision from management and ineffective implementation of budgets. The research recommends that the organization should adopt a flexibility budget structure, allow participation of low level managers in budget processes and effective implementation of budgets.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on a {{combination}} of existing theoretical knowledge and recently conducted empirical research. The analysis of knowledge that has come from the academic world has resulted in an extensive review of budgeting. The review starts at the inception of budgets in the nineteenth century, where it was just a tool to manage cost and cash flows. The study follows the trajectory of the evolution of budgeting from Traditional Budgeting practices that lasted for decades to, what is known today as, Better Budgeting. The evolution of budgeting has been driven by the desire of organisations to mitigate business challenges which result from the economic volatilities of the day as well as to remain competitive. This desire to mitigate business challenges remains relevant today and demands that organisations be equipped with best practice management tools, systems and business processes. In order to manage organisations effectively and efficiently, Management Accounting as a discipline {{is in a state of}} constant development. Over the years, a number of new innovations have been introduced in the field of Management Accounting. These include (but are not limited to) concepts such as Activity Based Costing (ABC), Activity Based Management (ABM), Activity <b>Based</b> <b>Budgeting</b> (ABB), Target Costing, Strategic Cost Management and Economic Value Added (<b>Budgeting)</b> (EVA™), <b>Zero</b> <b>Based</b> <b>Budgeting</b> (ZBB), Rolling Budgets and Forecasting (RBF), Balanced-Score Card (BSC) and Beyond Budgeting. These innovations aim to provide business managers with practical value adding solutions for a better understanding of the organisation’s product or service costing and planning strategies. The focus of this study is on innovations relating to the planning strategies of the organisation. Innovations that relate to planning include: Activity <b>Based</b> <b>Budgeting,</b> <b>Zero</b> <b>Based</b> <b>Budgeting</b> and Rolling Budgeting and Forecasting. The budget evolution is not short of academic value; researchers have conducted empirical surveys and have provided a theoretical perspective on the subject matter with fruitful findings. There appears to be a consensus regarding a total overhaul of Traditional Budgeting with the clear intention to move towards Better Budgeting. In the midst of this continued research work, there has been an emergence of a radical view about budgeting. This radical view concerns pursuing an agenda that suggests that organisations must stop preparing budgets. The gist of this radical development can be summed up as the limitations presented by budgeting in organisations. This recent concept has been coined as Beyond Budgeting. To remain globally competitive, South African organisations must keep abreast with the latest developments in management practices. This study therefore provides a good platform for South African organisations to obtain knowledge in what other countries are already doing around the subject of budgeting. The study has a two-pronged problem statement. Firstly, do organisations still budget? Secondly, what do organisations feel is the future for budgeting? Are they keeping with Traditional Budgeting, moving towards Better Budgeting or rather going further and looking Beyond Budgeting? The South African business community is no exception to this global budget debate about Traditional Budgeting, Better Budgeting and Beyond Budgeting. To gather evidence, the study made use of an online survey questionnaire that is attached as Appendix 2. An email invite containing an Internet hyperlink was sent to respondents. Respondents were expected to click on the hyperlink to gain access the pre-designed online survey questionnaire. Upon the analysis of the results, it was concluded that the South African business community still relies on budgeting, with 90 % of the respondents saying that budgeting is indispensable, as their organisations will not manage without budgeting. Furthermore, there was a clear-cut move from Traditional Budgeting towards Better Budgeting. The study also concluded that the move towards Better Budgeting is supported by the inability of Traditional Budgeting to keep up with the rapid changes in macro and micro-economic factors. Also interesting to note is the revelation that 0 % of the respondents indicated that they had adopted and implemented Beyond Budgeting. This resistance by the South African business community to the adoption of Beyond Budgeting and the resulting slower pace of this new practice's implementation is actually similar to the pace at which global organisations have received this radical budgeting practice.
