Using systematically obtained keyhole data, how the keyhole dynamically responds to an incident laser beam was studied by defining several key factors, such as keyhole expansion factor, keyhole motion range factor, average aperture diameters, mass loss fraction and melt pool volume size. The relative configuration of the keyhole and the laser beam {{was found to be}} the most influential factor for obtaining good welds, and when the beam was located away from the front keyhole wall a good weld was obtained. When the beam irradiates on the front keyhole wall, the zinc evaporation region between the two sheets can be directly heated by the beam, and the zinc vapor pressure can become extremely large, and therefore the melt pool is severely disturbed. The keyhole bottom aperture diameter and the keyhole expansion factor for the bottom aperture were both largely proportional to the mass loss for both <b>zinc-coated</b> and uncoated <b>steels.</b> Zero-gap laser welding of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steels</b> can be indeed successful and a theoretical basis is presented. close...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Galvannealed steels are {{produced}} by reheating of <b>Zinc-coated</b> <b>steels,</b> in which the iron and the zinc are interdiffused to form Zn-Fe intermatallic compound. In recent years, application of galvannealed steel has increased due to its excellent corrosion resistance, good weldability and paintability. Galvannealed production requires strict control of processing conditions to obtain an optimal alloying degree in the coatings. The analysis of the alloying degree is very important since they {{are closely related to}} the corrosion and mechanical properties. This study is measurement of alloying degree of the galvannealed steel by using the XRD. Partial least squares (PLS) model is a powerful multivariate tool that has been successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of data in XRD.

40|$|International audienceHigh {{strength}} <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steels</b> {{are used}} for automotive applications when high corrosion resistance and weight reduction are required. Resistance spot welding is the main method to assembly auto body.

Developing a comprehensive thermo-electrical-metallurgical-mechanical model that describes the sequential deterioration is thus lacking.

40|$|The {{production}} of consistent, high-quality laser welds on <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steels</b> for {{the automotive industry}} remains a challenge. A simple overlap joint geometry is desirable in these applications but {{has been shown to}} be extremely detrimental to laser welding because the zinc vapour formed at the interface between the two sheets expands into the keyhole and disrupts fluid flow in the melt pool, which often leads to metal ejection. In this work, laser welding on sheets with various coating thicknesses has been performed and it is observed that the sheets with thick coatings (? 20 ?m) show surprisingly good weldability. High speed video camera visualizations of the keyhole provide insight into the keyhole dynamics during the process. It appears that the dynamic pressure of zinc vapour can effectively elongate the keyhole and the process can reach a stable state when an elongated keyhole is continuously present.

The test strengths of the columns are compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures.

40|$|Department of Mechanical EngineeringIn the {{automotive}} industry, <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> {{is widely used}} because of its high corrosion resistance. Many automotive industry companies have tried to employ laser welding because of its many benefits, such as low heat input, high-intensity heat source, minimal distortion in heat affected zones, and high productivity. In lap joint laser welding of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets, a proper gap needs to be maintained to avoid weld defects in weldment because the zinc vaporization temperature (1180 K) {{is lower than the}} steel melting temperature (1809 K). However, in this case, additional processes are required for application to actual industrial production lines, {{and it is difficult to}} precisely control the gap. Furthermore, although many researchers have investigated ways to mitigate the influence of high zinc vaporization pressure, it remains an issue because of erratic and unstable keyhole motion and melt pool behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the keyhole behavior and weldability of zero-gap laser welding of zinc-coated and uncoated steel sheets at atmospheric and subatmospheric pressures according to process parameters to develop the gap insensitive lap joint laser welding of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel.</b> In this dissertation, firstly, a scaling law for predicting penetration depth was proposed, because the determination of penetration depth is the first consideration before the welding process. Moreover, then precisely observation method and analysis method were developed to observe clearly keyhole behavior, and effect of relative configuration of the laser beam and keyhole geometry on weldability for zero-gap lap laser welding of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets. Also, the influence of ambient pressure on keyhole behavior and weldability were investigated to find solutions and possibilities for obtaining good welds for zero-gap lap laser welding of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets by adjusting processing parameters (i. e. laser intensity and welding speed and ambient pressures). These studies can be summarized as follows. Firstly, a scaling law for predicting penetration depth was proposed that can be applied to both conduction mode and keyhole mode laser welding. The proposed scaling law was formulated based on a simple one-dimensional heat conduction model, and the effect of multiple reflections was accounted for. Because the scaling law was obtained from a laser heating problem, its physical meaning and why it needs to be formulated that way can be clearly explained. Experiments were conducted, and the obtained results were found to be in good agreement with the proposed scaling law. Secondly, in order to observe the keyhole behavior and reconstruct the keyhole geometry, a coaxial observation method was developed using a high-speed camera. A coaxial observation is a more useful and precise method to observe keyhole behavior than other lateral observation methods, and it was possible to study how the keyhole shape changes as the process parameters are varied. This chapter investigated the overall differences in the keyhole geometry between the zinc-coated and uncoated steels over a large process parameter space. Thirdly, using the obtained keyhole geometry data, the effect of keyhole geometry and dynamics on weldability was investigated by defining several key factors. It was found that the relative configuration of the keyhole and the laser beam is the most influential factor for obtaining good welds. For the <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel,</b> good welds were obtained at low welding speeds even zero-gap lap joint laser welding of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets. Finally, based on the observation and analysis method from previous chapters, we investigated the laser welding of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> at subatmospheric pressures in order to compare between laser welding at atmospheric pressure and subatmospheric pressure. The purpose of this work is because the pressures inside the keyhole play a major role in weldability during zero-gap lap joint laser welding of the <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets. In this chapter, the main focus was to reconstruct time-averaged 3 -D keyhole shapes and studying the influence of ambient pressures on keyhole behavior and weldability. ope...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{zinc layer}} of <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> {{is known to}} be a crucial factor for the {{spreading}} of liquid aluminium on the coated surface. For industrial brazing and welding processes these zinc-coatings enable a fluxless joining between aluminium and steel in many cases.

Fundamental investigations on the wetting behaviour of single aluminium droplets on different <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> surfaces have revealed a distinct difference between coated surfaces at room temperature and at elevated temperature regarding the influence of different coating thicknesses. In this paper the case of continuous laser brazing and welding processes of aluminium and commercial galvanized <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets are presented.

Skin pass rolling was performed on a laboratory mill equipped with a device designed to reproduce the effects of sheet tension and with load cells aimed at measuring the main working parameters. Analysis on tensile properties of skin pass rolled samples showed for an ultralow C grade and a low C grade a decreasing trend of the yield strength down to a minimum, followed by progressive rising values with increasing rolling elongation. This trend was related to changes of the tensile curve shape, leading to a transition from discontinuous to continuous yielding. A <b>zinc-coated</b> mild <b>steel</b> grade featured a tensile curve with a knee at transition from elastic to plastic regime. Accordingly, the change in yield strength with increasing skin pass elongation followed a linear trend. Microstructural and crystallographic information supplied by EBSD analyses suggested that the plastic strain induced by skin pass rolling originated a fairly homogeneous deformation field even on grains directly exposed on the strip surface.

40|$|Engineering & Systems DesignThe use {{of laser}} welding has become quite {{widespread}} {{because it can}} achieve higher productivity than spot welding. This is due to its desirable features, which include high power density, faster welding speed, highly accurate welding, and excellent repeatability. In addition, laser welding can minimize the distortion in heat-affected zones (HAZs), {{and there is no}} tooling that wears out or must be changed over. In spite of these advantages, laser welding still causes many problems when used on compositions such as galvanized steel and aluminum alloy. Galvanized steel, for example, is composed of a zinc layer whose physical parameters differ from those of steel as a base material. Zinc vaporizes at a temperature of 907 K, whereas steel begins to melt at 1510 K. This phenomenon causes serious defects in welds because the pressure of zinc is more powerful than that of steel. As a result, a certain manipulable control is needed in order for the zinc coating to be able to evaporate. To prevent this circumstance, the following solutions have been proposed: (i) a de-gassing method that induces the zinc fumes to escape from the part-to-part gap between two materials; (ii) the removal of zinc layers that will be joined together; (iii) a pulsed laser method that minimizes zinc vaporization using a high energy per pulse and a short pulse duration; (iv) a laser hybrid method; and (v) the addition of additional elements to the surface, which form a compound with the vaporizing zinc. Despite these suggestions, applications involving <b>zinc-coated</b> <b>steels</b> are rarely used in the automotive industry because the shapes of the materials to be welded are not always uniform. 	In this study, we ascertain the effects of the part-to-part gap and the direction of welding on the quality of laser welding. Using a 2 kW fiber laser and galvanized steel sheets (with thicknesses of 1. 4 mm and 1. 8 mm), our experiments employed lap welding, which has been applied to side members in the automotive industry. The experimental design was used with a 33 factorial design with 3 replications. The three types of welding direction used are ascendance, descendance, and a uniform gap. Based on the experiments, using analysis of variance (ANOVA) it was determined that the direction of welding is an important factor that can affect the weld quality. In addition, the differences between the shear tensile strengths in the ascendance and descendance directions were determined using a t-Test. The maximum shear tensile strength in the ascendance direction was achieved with a laser power of 2000 W and a welding speed of 2100 mm/min, followed by a part-to-part gap of 0. 32 mm/min as the steepest ascent method. Moreover, we analyzed cross-sections of sampling specimens, varying the gap differences in order to verify the differences in shear tensile strength based on two different directions of welding. ope...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the nineties, {{the first}} {{generation}} of organic thin film coatings for corrosion protection of <b>zinc-coated</b> thin sheet <b>steel</b> have been introduced. The coating typically consists of a suspension of small zinc particles, embedded in a polymer matrix. In the scope of quality control, the characterisation of the resulting layer structure is of great interest, comprising not only a constant layer thickness and a local homogeneity of the coating, but also the depth distribution of the particles within the layer. Especially the latter parameter does have a direct influence on the spot weldability of the steel sheets. The present work shows, how photothermal methods like modulated infrared radiometry and photoacoustics can be used for a successful depth profiling of the thin film coatings. The sample surface is periodically heated using an intensitymodulated laser beam, and a thermal wave is induced in the layer system. By variation of the modulation frequency of the laser beam, the thermal diffusion length and, as a consequence, the penetration depth of the thermal wave can be adjusted. By a suitable evaluation of the amplitude and phase lag signals {{as a function of the}} modulation frequency, accurate depth profiling has been realized which can be used for a very reliable prediction of the welding properties of the product. In the first investigations, artificial samples with well defined extreme distributions of the particles have been analyzed, and in a second step, an evaluation strategy has been developed for real production samples. 1...|$|R

Without lubricants, the direct contact between tool and workpiece leads to intensive interaction in terms of increasing friction and wear. Especially, when forming aluminum alloys, adhesion is detected as main wear mechanism propagating already at the initial contact between tool steel and sheet material. Thus, surface modifications {{need to be developed}} to substitute the functions of conventional lubricants. Former studies revealed that amorphous carbon based coatings improved the tribological conditions. Depending on the specific coating type adhesion and friction could be significantly reduced. Besides achieving a lower level of friction, a control of material flow is necessary to improve the forming results in deep drawing processes. Thus, {{there is a need for}} contact zones with higher and lower friction to locally accelerate or restrict the flow of the sheet material. In order to achieve these tailored tribological conditions a broad range of surface modifications needs to be developed and evaluated in a process-like environment. The tribological behavior is affected by coating properties and structure. By varying gas flow and ratio for a-C:H coatings the relationship between deposition parameters and coating properties are investigated. A further approach to realize a broader range of friction coefficients is the laser based texturing of coated tools. Additionally, a laser based heat treatment is investigated to control the sp 2 /sp 3 ratio of ta-C coatings to affect friction and wear mechanisms. The tribological behavior of the investigated surface modifications is analyzed in ring-on-disc and flat strip drawing tests. A surface characterization is performed to identify about the wear mechanisms. Based on the modifications of a-C:H and ta-C coatings a correlation between chemical and mechanical properties and the tribological behavior in contact with <b>zinc-coated</b> deep drawing <b>steel</b> and aluminum alloys is found...|$|R
