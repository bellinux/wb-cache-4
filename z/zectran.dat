5|$|Shulgin's {{professional}} activities {{continued to}} lean {{in the direction}} of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of <b>Zectran,</b> the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book PIHKAL, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as Nature and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACI’ Wiiwz, LARRY AND ALLEN STROTHER In vitro {{metabolism}} of the N-methylcarbamates, <b>Zectran</b> and Mesurol, by liver, {{kidney and}} blood of dogs and rats. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 178 : 371 - 382, 1971. A comparative in vitro {{study of the}} rat and dog utilizing 15, 000 X g liver and kidney homogenates and various blood fractions was done to determine the hydro-lytic and metabolic activity toward the pesticides 4 -dimethylamino- 3, 5 -xylyl methylcar-bamate (<b>Zectran)</b> and 4 -methylthio- 3, 5 -xylyl methylcarbamate (Mesurol). Data obtained from the liver, kidney and blood indicate that the rat and dog utilize the same major path-ways of metabolism for <b>Zectran</b> and Mesurol. In the liver, the major route of metabolism for <b>Zectran</b> is N-dealkylation of the para-N-methyl groups. Sulfoxidation of the para-S-methyl group is the main metabolic pathway with Mesurol. Other significant routes with both <b>Zectran</b> and Mesurol are hydroxylation of the N-methyl moiety of the carbamate. Whole blood from both species possesses N-dealkylating properties but not sulfoxidation properties. Little CO is given off in vitro by the blood or the kidney. The kidney homoge-nate possesses less metabolic activity towards <b>Zectran</b> and Mesurol than whole blood an...|$|E
40|$|The phenyl N-methylcarbamates. <b>Zectran</b> and Mesurol. are anticholinesterase insecticides. The {{in vitro}} {{metabolism}} of these carbamates by fetal and material tissues of Sprague-Dawley rats was investigated. The major ether-extractable metabolite resulting from <b>Zectran</b> metabolism in fetal and maternal brain in vitro was the N-demethylated compound 4 -methylamino- 3. 5 -xylyl methylcarbamate (MA). Fetal brain and maternal brain converted 12. 2 % and 11. 7 %. respectively. of the ‘ 4 C-Zectran added in vitro to MA. Fetal liver and placenta possessed no metabolic activity toward <b>Zectran.</b> Maternal liver {{had the highest}} metabolic activity {{of any of the}} tissues examined. N-Demethylation (15. 8 %) and N-methyl hydroxylation (13. 6 %) were the quantitatively important routes of metabolism identified. Sulfoxidation and hydroxylation to ether-soluble metabolites were the major routes of metabolism identified in studies with Mesurol. Both of these routes occurred in maternal liver (12. 3 % and 7. 9 %. respectively). Fetal liver possessed significant sulfoxidation activity (23. 1 %). The proportion of ‘ 4 C-contairting compounds that became water-soluble upon incubation with fetal liver was 36. 0 %. compared to 3. 8 % in controls, which contained boiled tissue. Placental tissue produced a small amount of the sulfoxide. 4 -methylsulfi...|$|E

Inclusion of piperonyl butoxide as a synergist with Sevin (1 -naphthyl methylcarbamate), <b>Zectran</b> (4 -dimethylamino- 3, 5 -xylyl methylcarbamate), or m-isopropylphenyl methylcarbamate also produced evidence of monofactorial inheritance...|$|E
40|$|Methylcarbamate {{insecticides}} undergo hydrolysis, oxidation, dealkylation, and conjugation in animals, plants, {{and insects}} to form similar or identical products. Carbaryl is hydroxylated in biological systems to form hydroxy, dihydro-dihydroxy, and N-hydroxymethyl carbaryl and is hydrolysed to form 1 -naphthol. The products are conjugated, stored, or excreted. Carbofuran is hydroxylated at the 3 position and propoxur at the 5 position to form hydroxylated derivatives. N-hydroxymethyl derivatives {{of these two}} carbamates may also be formed. Hydrolysis {{appears to be the}} major metabolic pathway of carbofuran in the animal. Aldicarb is oxidized to its sulfoxide and then hydrolysed to the oxime sulfoxide in animals and plants. Plants hydrolyse the oxime sulfoxide to form the corresponding aldehyde, which is an intermediate in the formation of 2 -methyl- 2 -(methyl-sulfinyl) propanol. Methomyl, which is structurally similar to aldicarb, is metabolized in plants to acetonitrile, carbon dioxide, and methylamine. Bux and Meobal undergo hydrolysis and hydroxylation to form N-hydroxy methylcarbamates, as well as hydroxybutylphenyl and hydroxymethylphenyl methylcarbamates. <b>Zectran,</b> which contains a dimethylamino group, is converted to the methylamino, amino, and methylformamido derivatives by insects and plants. In soil and water, methylcarbamate insecticides are hydrolysed to their respective phenols or oximes...|$|E
