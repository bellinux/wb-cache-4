Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in 25 -day-old rats by aortic stenosis. In the normal heart, double immunolabelling of ultrathin frozen sections of papillary muscle using gold-labelled probes for tubulin and desmin showed that microtubules ran primarily in a longitudinal direction through the intermyofibrillar spaces, perpendicularly to the desmin filaments. Microtubules were present near nuclei, mitochondria, and plasma membranes, while desmin filaments formed transverse connections between adjacent <b>Z</b> <b>disks.</b> No tubulin was observed near the intercalated disks, which were rich in desmin filaments.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs) are morphologically {{distinct}} but genetically heterogeneous muscular dystrophies {{in which}} disintegration of <b>Z</b> <b>disks</b> {{and then of}} myofibrils is followed by ectopic accumulation of multiple proteins. Cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and dominant inheritance are frequent associated features. Mutations in alphaB-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, Zasp, or filamin-C can cause MFMs and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the Mayo MFM cohort. Bag 3, another Z-disk-associated protein, has antiapoptotic properties, and its targeted deletion in mice causes fulminant myopathy with early lethality. We therefore searched for mutations in BAG 3 in 53 unrelated MFM patients. METHODS: We searched for mutations in BAG 3 by direct sequencing. We analyzed structural changes in muscle by histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy, examined mobility of the mutant Bag 3 by nondenaturing electrophoresis, and searched for abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein in COS- 7 (SV- 40 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast- 7) cells. RESULTS: We identified a heterozygous p. Pro 209 Leu mutation in three patients. All presented in childhood, had progressive limb and axial muscle weakness, and experienced development of cardiomyopathy and severe respiratory insufficiency in their teens; two had rigid spines, and one a peripheral neuropathy. Electron microscopy showed disintegration of <b>Z</b> <b>disks,</b> extensive accumulation of granular debris and larger inclusions, and apoptosis of 8 % of the nuclei. On nondenaturing electrophoresis of muscle extracts, the Bag 3 complex migrated faster in patient than control extracts, and expression of FLAG-labeled mutant and wild-type Bag 3 in COS cells showed abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein.

Myoblast filamin is highly homologous to fibroblast and purified chicken gizzard filamins. Mature myotube and adult myofibril filamins are highly homologous but exhibit extensive peptide differences with respect to the other three classes of filamin.

We have recently shown that inactivation of ILK or -parvin activity leads to heart failure in zebrafish via reduced protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) activation. Here, we show that PINCH proteins localize at sarcomeric <b>Z</b> <b>disks</b> and costameres in the zebrafish heart and skeletal muscle. To investigate the in vivo role of PINCH proteins for IPP complex stability and PKB signaling within the vertebrate heart, we inactivated PINCH 1 and PINCH 2 in zebrafish. Inactivation of either PINCH isoform independently leads to instability of ILK, loss of stretch-responsive anf and vegf expression, and progressive heart failure. The predominant cause of heart failure in PINCH morphants seems to be loss of PKB activity, since PKB phosphorylation at serine 473 is significantly reduced in PINCH-deficient hearts and overexpression of constitutively active PKB reconstitutes cardiac function in PINCH morphants. These findings highlight the essential function of PINCH proteins in controlling cardiac contractility by granting IPP/PKB-mediated signaling.

The distribution of myofibnl sizes in muscles of all ages studied was bimodal A high incidence of longitudinal splitting of myofibrils was observed with the electron micro-scope in differentiating muscle fibres and in some medium and large muscle fibres.

A possible explanation for the splitting is that the peripheral I filaments are pulled at an angle slightly oblique to the myofibnl axis, because of the discrepancy in the A and I-filament lattice spacings. When the myofibnl reaches a certain size the oblique pull of the peripheral I filaments is strong enough to cause the <b>Z</b> <b>disks</b> to rip.

In this paper, we report that in mice deficient for obscurin, ankB was displaced from its localization at the M band, whereas localization of ankG at the <b>Z</b> <b>disk</b> was not affected. In obscurin KO mice, localization at costameres of dystrophin, but not of -dystroglycan, was altered, and the subsarcolemma microtubule cytoskeleton was disrupted. In addition, these mutant mice displayed marked sarcolemmal fragility and reduced muscle exercise tolerance. Altogether, the results support a model in which obscurin, by targeting ankB at the M band, contributes to the organization of subsarcolemma microtubules, localization of dystrophin at costameres, and maintenance of sarcolemmal integrity...|$|E
40|$|Nebulin {{is a giant}} 600 - to 900 -kDa {{filamentous}} {{protein that}} is an integral component of the skeletal muscle thin filament. Its functions have remained largely nebulous because of its large size and the difficulty in extracting nebulin in a native state from muscle. Recent improvements in the field, especially the development of knockout mouse models deficient in nebulin (NEB-KO mice), indicate now that nebulin performs a surprisingly wide range of functions. In addition to {{a major role in}} thin-filament length specification, nebulin also functions in the regulation of muscle contraction, as indicated by the findings that muscle fibers deficient in nebulin have a higher tension cost, and develop less force due to reduced myofilament calcium sensitivity and altered crossbridge cycling kinetics. In addition, the function of nebulin extends to a role in calcium homeostasis. These novel functions indicate that nebulin might have evolved in vertebrate skeletal muscles to develop high levels of muscle force efficiently. Finally, the NEB-KO mouse models also highlight the role of nebulin in the assembly and alignment of the <b>Z</b> <b>disks.</b> Notably, rapid progress in understanding the roles of nebulin in vivo provides clinically important insights into how nebulin deficiency in patients with nemaline myopathy contributes to debilitating muscle weakness. —Labeit, S., Ottenheijm, C.

30|$|Anyway, the {{dependency}} on γ of the flaring index f, and the height <b>zs</b> of the <b>disk,</b> is very weak. Furthermore, the temperature {{does not depend}} on the radial mass distribution of the disk. This is also true for the other cases of t*/ β, as long as we are concerned with cases where t*/ β is greater than 1 × 108 yr.|$|R
40|$|Coupling efficiency, {{the ratio}} of the capsule absorbed energy to the driver energy, is a key {{parameter}} in ignition targets. The hohlraum originally proposed for NIF coupled {approx} 11 % of the absorbed laser energy to the capsule as x-rays. We describe here a second generation of hohlraum target which has higher coupling efficiency, {approx} 16 %. Because the ignition capsule's ability to withstand 3 D effects increases rapidly with absorbed energy, the additional energy can significantly increase the likelihood of ignition. The new target includes laser entrance hole (LEH) shields as a principal method for increasing coupling efficiency while controlling symmetry in indirect-drive ICF. The LEH shields are high <b>Z</b> <b>disks</b> placed inside the hohlraum to block the capsule's view of the cold LEHs. The LEH shields can reduce the amount of laser energy required to drive a target to a given temperature via two mechanisms: (1) keeping the temperature high near the capsule pole by putting a barrier between the capsule and the pole, (2) because the capsule pole does not have a view of the cold LEHs, good symmetry requires a shorter hohlraum with less wall area. Current integrated simulations of this class of target couple 140 kJ of x-rays to a capsule out of 865 kJ of absorbed laser energy and produce {approx} 10 MJ of yield. In the current designs, which are not completely optimized, the addition of the LEH shields saves {approx} 95 kJ of energy (about 10 %) over hohlraums without LEH shields...|$|R
