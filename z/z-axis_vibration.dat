40|$|Abstract: Exposure to whole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) is {{an occupational}} hazard for operators of industrial vehicles, such as earth-moving machines. Quantification of WBV exposure {{in terms of}} impact on health forms {{one aspect of the}} Standard ISO 2631 - 1 (1997). Regarding assessment of risk to health, ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) states that if WBV components below 1 Hz are not ‘relevant nor important ’ then they can be excluded from the assessment. In this paper the influence of sub- 1 Hz components in WBV acquired from a sample of 46 earth moving machines is evaluated in terms of their contribution to ISO 2631 - 1 WBV exposure dose metrics: frequency weighted r. m. s. and the vibration dose value (VDV). For the majority of machines, a high proportion of the horizontal (x- and y-axis) WBV r. m. s. and VDV values was generated by sub- 1 Hz vibration components; there was a much lower proportion of the vertical (<b>z-axis)</b> <b>vibration</b> generated by such components...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} tractor driver Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) induced {{by some of}} the agricultural operations, the ISO 2631 standard was utilized. Detailed methodology of the calculation of the WBV evaluating indices using the time-domain acceleration data analysis was presented. According to the results of the study, typical weighted root mean square (WRMS) value of the <b>Z-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> was more than the WRMS value of the X and Y axes vibrations. Furthermore all of the severity categories (SV) obtained from driving the tractor on asphalt road, plowing and power tilling based on the equivalent daily stress index (Sed), were graded in the class of 3 or 4; which means that the health hazard associated with these operations is marginal. Finally among the examined machines; the locally built, tractor front mounted, hydraulic power aided loader caused vibrations that were slightly higher than the exposure limit value (ELV), with regard to the parameter of WRMS over an eight hour period (A(8)) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} contains {{review of}} literature {{on the effects of}} vibration on human performance. It is intended to address the issues relevant to reported difficulties {{in the use of the}} XM 4 Command and Control Vehicle while the vehicle is in motion. The focus of this review is on the effects of vibration on visual task, with additional consideration given to manual tasks, as well as motion sickness. Below are listed some of the main findings from the literature reviewed. • Vertical (z-axis) sinusoidal translation induced by a vibration simulator is the most common way of testing the effects of vibration, and it is often used as an approximation for other forms of vibration. • The research base for establishing the generalizability of single-frequency, <b>Z-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> to multiple frequency, multiple-axis vibration is very sparse. • Seating and posture, as well as individual differences between operators, influence strongly the effects of vibration on human performance. • Small increases in display size, resolution, and vertical spacing can yield large payoffs in legibility for text viewed during vibration...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel tri-axial rate gyroscope design. It reviews {{the physics of}} the gyroscope and specifies the application domain for the gyro. The design is then presented. It features a unique method of operation; CMOS metal layers are used for sensing and activation for all three axes. This method was previously thought of for sensing <b>z-axis</b> <b>vibrations</b> but not activation of <b>z-axis</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The paper continues with coverage of the electronics necessary to support the activation and sensing of the gyro. The electronics are unique because of the direct inclusion of the sensing capacitance in a switch capacitor amplifier. They are also unique because each activation and sensing mode is time multiplexed. A further original idea is to apply a braking stage between each sensing and activation stage to allow for faster axial measurement transitions. A suggested foundry to implement the proposed design is given last. ...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{magnitude}} {{and frequency of}} the z-axis vehicle seat are time-variant, which are influenced by not only vehicle vibration characteristics themselves but also road surfaces, speeds and the human body. There is little in the current reporting about evaluating and analyzing automobile seat vibration {{that focuses on the}} time-variant. Yaguchi et al. 1 has proposed a method to evaluate automobile seat vibration that is based on judgments using a subjective mental state. Their method focuses on the time-variant magnitude of the peak frequency on a power spectrum density. However, their method has no consideration of all the frequency contents of the discomfort, nor comparison between different peak frequency vibrations. Suzuki 2 has emphasized that the vehicle vibration should be judged by a series of vibration stimuli to evaluate, because the vehicle vibration is time-variant, which isn 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 t a matter of the relationship between a single vibration stimulus and a subjective response. He clarified that the human sensation to the vehicle vibration discomfort changes every moment showing the relationship between the frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration calculated every 5 seconds and the category judgment to vehicle vibration discomfort every 5 seconds. However, his study doesn 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 t show what parameter connects to the subjective final judgment to vehicle vibration. Therefore, we applied the method similar to ISO 100563 considering the time-variant to the vehicle seat <b>z-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> evaluation. The new method for the vehicle seat vibration considering the time-variant was examined on the hypothesis that the final subjective evaluation must be conducted from the judgment summarizing a series of vibration stimuli. Methods The vibration bench system, which reproduces the movement of a vehicle floor, was used for the experiment with the single-axis (vertical direction) four-post road simulator system, which is usually used for a car, as shown in Fig. 1. The experiment was done {{on the right side of}} the vibration bench using the floor vibration which was 5. 5 minutes, 0. 822 m/sec 2 (Wk) over the range 0. 5 - 20 Hz with 4 male subjects (age ave 21. 5, SD 0. 5, weight ave 75 kg, SD 7. 91 kg, height ave 166. 8 cm, SD 5. 2 cm) and 4 suspension seats.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the subjective equivalence of railway noise and railway-induced building vibration, and hence {{the relative importance of}} the two stimuli. Six magnitudes of whole-body, vertical (<b>z-axis)</b> <b>vibration</b> and six levels of noise were presented simultaneously to each of 30 subjects in all 36 possible paired combinations. The stimuli were reproductions of the noise and vibration recorded inside a house during the passage of a train. The subjects were asked to indicate, after each presentation, which of the two stimuli (noise and vibration) they would prefer to be reduced. A seven-point scale was employed to indicate the total annoyance produced by the two stimuli. A subjective equivalence contour was determined from the levels at which 50 % of the subjects preferred the reduction of noise and 50 % preferred the reduction of vibration. The contour may be described by the relation L AE = 20 · 3 log 10 VDV + 89 · 2, where s L AE is the sound exposure level and VDV is the vibration dose value. This relation may be used to determine whether a reduction of noise or a reduction of vibration would be more beneficial to residents near railways. The total annoyance due to simultaneous noise and vibration was shown to depend on the magnitude of both stimuli. © 1990. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} how backrest inclination and {{the frequency}} of vibration influence the perception and discomfort of vibration applied parallel to the back (vertical vibration when sitting upright, horizontal vibration when recumbent). Subjects experienced backrest vibration at frequencies in the range 2. 5 to 25 Hz at vibration magnitudes up to 24 dB above threshold. Absolute thresholds, equivalent comfort contours, and the principal locations for feeling vibration were determined with four backrest inclinations: 0 ° (upright), 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° (recumbent). With all backrest inclinations, acceleration thresholds and equivalent comfort contours were similar and increased with increasing frequency at 6 dB per octave (i. e. velocity constant). It is concluded that backrest inclination has little effect on the frequency dependence of thresholds and equivalent comfort contours for vibration applied along the back, and that the W d frequency weighting in current standards is appropriate for evaluating <b>z-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> of the back at all backrest inclinations. Statement of Relevance: To minimise the vibration discomfort of seated people, it is necessary to understand how discomfort varies with backrest inclination. It is concluded that the vibration on backrests can be measured using a pad between the backrest and the back, so that it reclines with the backrest, and the measured vibration evaluated without correcting for the backrest inclination...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments {{to determine the effects}} of vibration frequency, viewing distance and multiple frequency motions on the reading of numeric characters. Contours of vertical (<b>z-axis)</b> whole-body <b>vibration</b> levels resulting in equal degradation of the reading task were determined over the frequency range 2 · 8 Hz to 63 Hz. With the seating condition employed, the task was found to be most sensitive to vibration acceleration at a frequency of 11 · 2 Hz. A marked correlation was observed between reading error and reading speed. The effects of vibration on reading performance were found to be dependent on viewing distance for distance of less than 1 · 5 m, with the effect increasing as the viewing distance was decreased. The effect of 3 · 15 Hz vibration was found to increase more rapidly with reductions in viewing distance than that of 16 Hz vibration. The effects of 3 · 15 and 16 Hz vibration were independent of viewing distance greater than 1 · 5 m, indicating that the effects of rotational eye motion are dominant at these distances. Four methods were compared for predicting the effects of multiple frequency motion on reading performance given a knowledge of the effect of each component alone. The best predictions of reading error were obtained from the most severe weighted spectral component alone. Inspection of individual subject's data suggests that in many cases the effect of multiple frequency vibration on reading is even less than the effect of the largest sinusoidal component alone. © 1980. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{is described in}} which two independent groups of seated subjects performed a pursuit tracking task for 202 · 5 min on two separate occasions. For one group, the total duration included 180 min exposure to vertical <b>z-axis,</b> whole-body random <b>vibration</b> with a bandwidth of 1 octave centred on 4 Hz. The weighted acceleration magnitude was 1 · 4 ms − 2 r. m. s., with a crest factor of 4 · 13. Using the procedures denned in British Standard 6841 (BSI 1987), the motion had a vibration dose value of 20 ms − 1 · 75. The other group received no vibration exposure. Results showed that performance declined as function of duration, but that vibration exposure did not impair performance or interact with the effect of duration. Performance in the second sessions showed less effect of duration than in the first session. The effect of duration was associated with change in both linear and non-linear tracking behaviour. Closed loop system transfer functions showed both reduced moduli and increased phase lags with increasing exposure duration. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Ltd. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{subjects}} {{performed a}} numeral reading task under five levels of sinusoidal whole-body vibralion at various frequencies {{in each of}} the three translational axes. In the z-axis the vibration frequencies were spaced at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 63 Hz, and in the x and y-axes at half octaves between 2 - 8 and 32 Hz. All of the vibration conditions were presented with two sealing conditions: hard flat seat with fixed footrcst and a simulated helicopter seat with moving footrest. With both seats the effect of vibration level on reading accuracy was found to be significant at all but the highest frequencies of <b>z-axis</b> <b>vibration.</b> It was also significant for x-axis vibration with the simulated helicopter seat, but not for x-axis vibralion with the flat seat or for y-axis vibration with either seat. Results are presented in the form of equal performance contours. Measures of translational and rotational head motion were also made for each vibration axis and seat. Very little vibration was found to be transmitted to the head during x-axis vibration with the flat seat or y-axis vibration with either seat, in agreement with the small effect of vibration on reading performance in these cases. These results were combined with performance data to investigate the feasibilily of predicting performance decrements directly from head motions. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a miniature magnetic-force-based, three-axis, AC magnetic sensor with piezoelectric/vibrational energy-harvesting functions. For magnetic sensing, the sensor employs a magnetic–mechanical–piezoelectric configuration (which uses magnetic force and torque, a compact, single, mechanical mechanism, and the piezoelectric effect) to convert x-axis and y-axis in-plane and z-axis magnetic fields into piezoelectric voltage outputs. Under the x-axis magnetic field (sine-wave, 100 Hz, 0. 2 – 3. 2 gauss) and the z-axis magnetic field (sine-wave, 142 Hz, 0. 2 – 3. 2 gauss), the voltage output with {{the sensitivity of}} the sensor are 1. 13 – 26. 15 mV with 8. 79 mV/gauss and 1. 31 – 8. 92 mV with 2. 63 mV/gauss, respectively. In addition, through this configuration, the sensor can harness ambient vibrational energy, i. e., possessing piezoelectric/vibrational energy-harvesting functions. Under x-axis vibration (sine-wave, 100 Hz, 3. 5 g) and <b>z-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> (sine-wave, 142 Hz, 3. 8 g), the root-mean-square voltage output with power output of the sensor is 439 mV with 0. 333 μW and 138 mV with 0. 051 μW, respectively. These results show that the sensor, using this configuration, successfully achieves three-axis magnetic field sensing and three-axis vibration energy-harvesting. Due to these features, the three-axis AC magnetic sensor could be an important design reference in order to develop future three-axis AC magnetic sensors, which possess energy-harvesting functions, for practical industrial applications, such as intelligent vehicle/traffic monitoring, processes monitoring, security systems, and so on...|$|E
40|$|Reclined {{seats in}} {{transport}} suggest luxury and comfort, but {{a review of}} the literature revealed little study of how backrest inclination influences the discomfort caused by vibration of a seat or a backrest. This thesis seeks to advance understanding of the influence of backrest inclination on vibration discomfort and provides a model for evaluating vibration discomfort and metrics for optimising seats with different backrest inclinations. Vibration discomfort depends on the direction and location of vibration input to the body. Subjects used magnitude estimation to judge vibration magnitudes from thresholds of perception up to 2 ms- 2 r. m. s. at the 11 preferred 1 / 3 -octave centre frequencies from 2. 5 to 25 Hz. The first two experiments determined absolute thresholds and discomfort with x-axis backrest vibration (Experiment 1) and z-axis backrest vibration (Experiment 2) with four backrest inclinations (0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° from vertical). The third experiment investigated discomfort with vertical seat pan vibration and five backrest conditions (no backrest and backrest inclined to 0 °, 30 °, 60 °, and 90 °). With x-axis vibration of the back, inclining the backrest had similar effects on thresholds and equivalent comfort contours. Thresholds increased at frequencies from 4 to 8 Hz with increasing inclination of the backrest. With inclined backrests, 40 % greater magnitudes of vibration were required from 4 to 8 Hz, to cause discomfort equivalent to that with the upright backrest. Frequency weighting Wc in current standards predicted discomfort and perception of x-axis vibration of the upright backrest (0 °) but weighting Wb was more appropriate for inclined backrests. Frequency weighting Wd was appropriate for both discomfort and perception of <b>z-axis</b> <b>vibration</b> of the back at all backrest inclinations. With vertical seat acceleration, the frequency of greatest sensitivity decreased with increasing vibration magnitude. Compared to an upright backrest, around the main resonance of the body the vibration magnitudes required to cause similar discomfort were 100 % greater with 60 ° and 90 ° backrest inclinations and 50 % greater with a 30 ° backrest inclination. The fourth experiment investigated whole-body vertical vibration on a rigid seat with no backrest and with four backrest inclinations. With an inclined backrest, discomfort caused by high frequency vibration increased at the head or neck but discomfort at the head or neck caused by low frequencies (5 and 6. 3 Hz) reduced. With inclined backrests, the procedures in current standards overestimate overall discomfort at frequencies around 5 and 6. 3 Hz but underestimate discomfort caused by frequencies greater than about 8 Hz. The final experiment investigated a model for predicting vibration discomfort with three compliant reclined seats. At each frequency, the measured seat dynamic discomfort, MSDD (the ratio of the vibration acceleration required to cause similar discomfort with a compliant seat and a rigid reference seat), was compared with seat effective amplitude transmissibility, SEAT value (the ratio of overall ride values with a compliant seat and a rigid reference seat using the weightings in current standards). The compliant seats increased vibration discomfort at frequencies around the 4 -Hz resonance but reduced vibration discomfort at frequencies greater than about 6. 3 Hz. The SEAT values provided appropriate indications of how the foam increased vibration discomfort at some frequencies but decreased vibration discomfort at other frequencies. Differences between the SEAT values and the measured seat dynamic discomfort are consistent with the need for different frequency weightings when the body is supported by an inclined backrest. An empirical model was evolved from the experiments for predicting vibration discomfort with reclined seats. It is concluded that reclining a backrest will tend to be detrimental at frequencies greater than about 10 Hz with greater discomfort in the head or neck induced by vibration of the backrest. At frequencies around 5 and 6. 3 Hz, reclining a backrest can reduce discomfort. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Human {{exposure}} to mechanical vibration {{may represent a}} significant risk factor for exposed workers in the agricultural sector. Also, noise in agriculture {{is one of the}} risk factors {{to be taken into account}} in the evaluation of workers’ health and safety. One of the major sources of discomfort for the workers operating a tractors is the noise to which they are exposed during work. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of {{exposure to}} whole-body vibration for the operator driving track-laying tractors in vineyard orchard and the noise level. The experimental tests were performed with six different track-laying tractors coupled with the same rototilling machine. The results showed that the vibration values of track-laying tractors coupled to rototilling machine, referred to the 8 -hour working day, were always higher than 0. 5 m s- 2, the daily exposure action value established by Directive 2002 / 44 /EC of the European Parliament. The daily noise exposure levels always exceeded the exposure limit value of 87 dB(A) established by Directive 2003 / 10 /EC of the European Parliament. The ANOVA repeated measures model showed that the factor ‘site’, namely, the soil characteristics, did not influence the vibration level on the X and Y-axes of the tractors measured, regardless of their age. In the <b>Z-axis,</b> the <b>vibration</b> level was enhanced as the soil structure increased. As tractor age increased, the influence of soil characteristics was less important. In term of the age of the tractor and the number of hours worked, it was possible to identify three risk classes, which were up to 3, 000 hours worked and offered a low risk; from 3, 000 – 6, 000 hours worked with a medium risk, and over 6, 000 hours with a high risk level...|$|R
40|$|Although many rail {{travellers}} use {{portable computers}} while travelling, the train environment {{has not been}} influenced by the desire to operate computers. Some trains provide power points and tables for portable computers, but an optimal design also requires understanding of how typing is disturbed by train motion. There are numerous studies of typing in static conditions and many studies of the interference of activities by vibration, but there have been few studies of the effects of vibration on typing. In the few studies previously conducted, the differing methods of measuring performance make it difficult to compare results. An experimental study has been performed to understand the effects of vibration magnitude, vibration frequency and vibration direction on typing performance. With 12 seated subjects in each condition, the effects on typing performance of five vibration magnitudes (0. 63, 0. 80, 1. 00, 1. 25 and 1. 6 ms- 2 r. m. s.) of 30 -s periods of sinusoidal vibration at each of twelve frequencies (0. 50, 1. 00, 1. 25, 1. 60, 2. 00, 2. 50, 3. 15, 4. 00, 5. 00, 6. 30, 8. 00, 10. 00 Hz) were determined {{for each of the three}} translational axes (x-, y-, and <b>z-axis)</b> of whole-body <b>vibration.</b> Performance was evaluated by three measures: (a) the total number of data entries in 30 s, (b) the number of typing errors, and (c) a subjective estimate of typing difficulty. The results are presented in tabular and graphical form. Subjective estimates of typing difficulty varied with the magnitude, frequency, and direction of the vibration. Lateral vibration, especially in the range 1. 6 to 6. 3 Hz, created the greatest difficulty. Vertical vibration caused least difficulty. There were no statistically significant effects of vibration on typing speed or typing accuracy, probably because extra effort was used to counteract the vibration disturbance...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{continous}} {{manual control}} performance during exposure to <b>z-axis</b> whole-body <b>vibration</b> at frequencies between 0. 5 and 10. 0 Hz. The task involved first-order pursuit tracking with a simultaneous discrete target acquisition task. A major {{aim of the}} work {{was to determine the}} mechanisms underlying any vibration-induced impairment which occurred. The iterature is first reviewed (Chapter 2) and a model is presented summarising the mechanisms by which vibration has been suggested to disrupt performance (Chapter 3). Six experiments are then reported. Experiment 1 (Chapter 5) measured vibration-induced activity at the head, hand and the output of the system dynamics. The results are discussed with reference to the mechanisms which could disrupt performance. Experiment 2 (Chapter 6) investigated performance during exposure to vibration at frequencies from 0. 5 to 5. 0 Hz. The magnitude of performance disruption was approximately constant at vibration frequencies below 2 Hz, and increased with the frequency of vibration to 5. 0 Hz. Experiments 3 (Chapter 7) and 4 (Chapter 8) showed that the disruption at frequencies above 2. 0 Hz could be attributed to visual impairment arising from relative translational movement between subjects' eyes and the display: collimating the display removed the impairment. Linear spectral analysis techniques were used to separate root-mean-square (rms) tracking error into components linearly and not linearly correlated with movements of the target. Changes in total rms error were mainly accompanied by changes in the linear components: closed-loop system transfer functions showed increased phase lags between movements of the target and the response of the controlled element. In experiment 5 (Chapter 9), three simple tasks were used to isolate non-visual mechanisms of disruption. The results suggested that whole-body vibration at 0. 5 and 4. 0 Hz could interfere with neuro-muscular processes. The results of experiment 5, and the increased phase lag observed in experiment 4, indicate changes in the way the task was performed during vibration: these are described as secondary vibration effects. Experiment 6 investigated whether the effect of vibration on the system studied would be time-dependent. One-octave-band random vibration centred on 4 Hz was presented at a magnitude considerably above the ISO 2631 (1985) `fatigue-decreased-proficiency' limit for 180 minute vibration exposures. Performance declined with time, but vibration did not alter the time-dependence. The effect of duration was reduced when the task was performed over the entire duration on a second occasion. It is concluded that impairments in continuous tracking performance during whole-body vibration exposure were mainly caused by interference with visual and neuro-muscular processes. The results also show secondary effects which may represent adaptive change in performance during vibration. The behavioural model developed in Chapter 3 is used to summarise the mechanisms which were shown to be important, and to indicate other effects which could occur. Some suggstions for further research are offered...|$|R
