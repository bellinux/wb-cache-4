2500|$|The speech upgrade {{also added}} two empty sockets {{next to the}} {{keyboard}} intended to take 16KB serial ROM cartridges containing either extra speech phoneme data (in addition to the default speech ROM fitted to the motherboard), or general software accessed through the ROM Filing System. The original plan was that some games would be released on cartridges, but due to the limited sales of the speech upgrade, little or no software was ever produced for these sockets. The cut-out space next to the keyboard (nicknamed the [...] "ashtray") was more commonly used to install other upgrades, such as a <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket</b> for conventional paged ROMs.|$|E
2500|$|BASIC, other {{languages}} and utility ROM chips resided {{in any of}} four 16KB paged ROM sockets, with OS support for sixteen sockets via expansion hardware. The five (total) sockets were located partially obscured under the keyboard, with the leftmost socket hard-wired for the OS. [...] While the original usage for the perforated panel on {{the left of the}} keyboard was for a Serial ROM or Speech ROM, a <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket</b> or edgecard connector could be installed in that location instead. [...] The socket could be connected to one of the empty Sideways/PagedROM sockets via a header cable. The paged ROM system was essentially modular. [...] A language-independent system of star commands, prefixed with an asterisk, provided the ability to select a language (for example *BASIC, *PASCAL), a filing system (*TAPE, *DISC), change settings (*FX, *OPT) or carry out ROM-supplied tasks (*COPY, *BACKUP) from the command line. The MOS recognised a handful of built-in commands, and polled the paged ROMs in descending order for service otherwise; if none of them claimed the command then the OS returned a Bad command error. Connecting an external EPROM programmer, one could write extensive programs, copy to programmable ROM (PROM) or EPROM, then invoke them without taxing user memory.|$|E

50|$|The target boards have <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> for DIP, SOIC, QFN, or QFP packages, {{depending}} on the board.|$|R
5000|$|Smaller <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> are {{commonly}} used in chip-testing and programming equipment, e.g., programming and testing on EEPROMs, Microcontrollers, etc.|$|R
50|$|While {{packaged}} as a wafer, {{automatic test}} equipment (ATE) can connect to the individual units using a set of microscopic needles. Once the chips are sawn apart and packaged, test equipment can connect to the chips using <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> (sometimes called contactors).|$|R

50|$|The less {{reliable}} type is a <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket,</b> with spring pinchers that grab the balls. This {{does not work}} well, especially if the balls are small.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a higher}} cost {{development}} board with a 100-pin LQFP <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket</b> used by initial MSP432 chips, and a JTAG and Spy Bi-Wire debug interfaces.|$|E
5000|$|<b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> can be {{used for}} ball grid array chips, {{particularly}} during development. These sockets tend to be unreliable, failing to grab all the solder balls. Another type of BGA socket, also free of insertion force but not a [...] "ZIF socket" [...] in the traditional sense, does a better job by using spring pins to push up underneath the balls.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the LIF {{connectors}} {{were designed}} as a cheaper alternative compared to zero insertion force (ZIF) connectors, to facilitate programming and testing of equipment. Compared with standard IC sockets, they have a lower friction force between the contacts of the device and the socket, making insertion and removal of the device easier, {{while at the same}} time eliminating the need for the complex mechanism that is used in <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} use as embedded systems, the on-board ROM {{was either}} mask programmed at the chip factory or one-time programmed (OTP) by the developer as a PROM. PROMs often {{used the same}} UV EPROM technology for the chip, but in a cheaper package without the transparent erasure window. During program development, it was still necessary to burn EPROMs. In this case, the entire controller IC, and therefore the <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets,</b> would be provided.|$|R
50|$|Socket 7 {{typically}} uses a 321-pin (arranged as 19 by 19 pins) SPGA <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket</b> or {{the very}} rare 296-pin (arranged as 37 by 37 pins) SPGA LIF socket.|$|E
50|$|The signal routing board sits {{between the}} base {{board and the}} target board, and routes the signals to the proper pin on the device board. There are many {{different}} signal routing boards {{that could be used}} with a single target board, depending on what device is in the <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The FC-PGA was {{introduced}} by Intel with the Coppermine core Pentium III and Celeron processors based on Socket 370, and was later used for Socket 478-based Pentium 4 and Celeron processors. FC-PGA processors fit into zero insertion force (<b>ZIF)</b> <b>Socket</b> 370 and Socket 478-based motherboard sockets; similar packages have also been used by AMD. It is still used today for mobile Intel processors.|$|E
50|$|Large <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> {{are only}} {{commonly}} found mounted on PC motherboards, being used from about the mid 1990s forward. These CPU sockets {{are designed to}} support a particular range of CPUs, allowing computer retailers and consumers to assemble motherboard/CPU combinations based on individual budget and requirements. The rest of the electronics industry has largely abandoned sockets (of any kind) and instead moved {{to the use of}} surface mount components soldered directly to the board.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{peripheral}} cartridge-holders {{by companies}} such as P.R.E.S. (via their ARA/ARA2/ASR products) allowed 'Sideways ROM' capability, that allowed the standard Acorn ROM space to be programmatically mapped out for alternative EPROMs, either physically via <b>ZIF</b> <b>Sockets,</b> or 'virtually' via ROM-images loaded into (battery-backed) RAM in the same ROM memory space. This enabled the Electron {{to achieve the same}} functionality as that provided by the Expansion-ROM slots under the keyboard and on the bottom-left of the BBC Micro B keyboard.|$|R
50|$|Common sockets have {{retention}} clips {{that apply}} a constant force, {{which must be}} overcome when a device is inserted. For chips {{with a large number}} of pins, either zero insertion force (<b>ZIF)</b> <b>sockets</b> or land grid array (LGA) sockets are used instead. These designs apply a compression force once either a handle (for ZIF type) or a surface plate (LGA type) is put into place. This provides superior mechanical retention while avoiding the risk of bending pins when inserting the chip into the socket.|$|R
50|$|Programmers for EPROMs like 2716 - 27256 using common {{programming}} voltages (Vpp) of 12.5, 21, and 25 V {{were available}} by connecting {{a device to}} the user port of the C64. These devices could cost 100 USD in 1985. The device often included a zero insertion force (<b>ZIF)</b> <b>socket</b> and a LED indicating when the EPROM chip was being programmed. The cartridge port was also used by some programmer devices.|$|E
50|$|Second-generation NESes {{also used}} a card edge {{connector}} and featured no 10NES lock-out chip; however, unlike the top-loading NES 2, the FC Twin is completely {{compatible with the}} Galoob Game Genie {{without the use of}} an adapter. Both the official NES 2 and the FC Twin capitalize on the card slot reader's greater reliability; games rarely suffer from bad connections as they did with the original <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first model}} in this line, the Unisite-40, {{featured}} a removable module {{with a single}} 40-pin DIP <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket,</b> called the SITE-40 and space to install optional programming adapters {{to the right of}} this DIP module. Such modules included the 'SetSite,' a module containing eight 40-pin ZIF sockets to allow gang programming of up to eight identical memory devices, and the 'ChipSite,' an early multi-socket module accommodating several sizes of PLCC and SOIC DIP packages with 'clamshell' ZIF sockets.|$|E
50|$|Pin {{grid array}} (PGA) {{packages}} {{may be considered}} to have evolved from the DIP. PGAs with the same 0.1 inch pin centers as most DIPs were popular for microprocessors from the early to mid-1980s through the 1990s. Owners of personal computers containing Intel 80286 through P5 Pentium processors may be most familiar with these PGA packages, which were often inserted into <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> on motherboards. The similarity is such that a PGA socket may be physically compatible with some DIP devices, though the converse is rarely true.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the System 29 series emerged. The first model, the 29A, added user RAM, and {{eliminated}} {{the need for}} configuration cards by offering keypad-programmable 'Family' and 'Pinout' codes to configure the programmer. Introduced along with the 29A was the 'Unipak,' a large plug-in adapter that featured multiple sizes of <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> to {{reduce the need for}} changing socket modules. Since the Unipak was limited to dealing with memory devices, an additional accessory series, called the 'LogicPak,' was introduced to handle programmable logic devices (PALs, GALs, etc.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} SIMM sockets were conventional push-type sockets. These {{were soon}} replaced by <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> {{in which the}} SIMM was inserted at an angle, then tilted into an upright position. To remove one, the two metal or plastic clips at each end must be pulled to the side, then the SIMM must be tilted back and pulled out (low-profile sockets reversed this convention somewhat, like SODIMMs - the modules are inserted at a [...] "high" [...] angle, then pushed down to become more flush with the motherboard). The earlier sockets used plastic retainer clips which were found to break, so steel clips replaced them.|$|R
5000|$|The Alpha {{microprocessor}} is socketed in a {{zero insertion}} force (<b>ZIF)</b> <b>socket</b> and can be upgraded. These workstations use Digital's 21174 chipset, {{also known as the}} [...] "Pyxis" [...] chipset. To increase flexibility and to reduce cost, the L3 cache is optional in these models. If the L3 cache is required, a cache module that contained the SRAMs which implemented the cache can be installed into a cache slot. The cache module has two capacities: 2 or 4 MB.|$|E
50|$|Intel did not {{market the}} Intellec as a {{general-purpose}} microcomputer, {{but rather as}} a development system. As the first microprocessors were intended to run embedded systems such as in calculators, computer terminals and digital watches, the Intellec was used for programming programmable memory chips used by embedded systems, e.g. the 2048-bit (256-byte) Intel 1602A programmable read-only memory (PROM) or erasable 1702A EPROM chips which were plugged into a <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket</b> on the Intellec-8's front panel. The chip-programming socket is the green device in the lower right corner of the Intellec's front panel.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{microcontrollers}} {{relied on}} erasable {{programmable read-only memory}} (EPROM) devices to hold the application program. The object code from a host system would be [...] "burned" [...] onto an EPROM with an EPROM programmer. [...] This EPROM was then physically plugged into the board. As the EPROM would be removed and replaced many times during program development, it was common to provide a <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket</b> to avoid wear or damage. Erasing an EPROM with a UV eraser takes a considerable time, {{and so it was}} also common for a developer to have several EPROMs in circulation at any one time.|$|E
50|$|Socket S1 is a 638 pin, low profile, <b>ZIF,</b> 1.27mm pitch <b>socket.</b> It {{replaces the}} {{existing}} Socket 754 in the mobile computing segment (e.g. laptops).|$|R
5000|$|The 1200-XL405A (designated with {{model number}} [...] "12XL405A") is another model using an Intel processor. It {{is similar in}} layout to the XL325 above. The {{motherboard}} {{is equipped with a}} Socket-370 <b>ZIF</b> CPU <b>socket</b> and uses a VIA PLE133 chipset (comprising the VT8601 North Bridge and VT82C686A South Bridge) with graphics provided via the Trident Cyberblade-i1 controller integrated into the VT8601 circuitry.|$|R
5000|$|The early 400 MHz (later 350 MHz) PCI-based version used a {{motherboard}} {{identical to}} the one used in Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White) computers including the use of Zero Insertion Force (<b>ZIF)</b> processors <b>sockets</b> (minus the ADB port), in a [...] "graphite" [...] colored case and with the new Motorola PowerPC 7400 (G4) CPU. The higher-speed models, code name [...] "Sawtooth", used a greatly modified motherboard design with AGP 2x graphics (replacing the 66 MHz PCI slot). In December 1999, the entire Power Mac G4 line was updated to the AGP motherboard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{disadvantages}} of LIF connectors {{are that the}} grip force between the contacts is lower, and the contacts can oxidize faster and decrease the lifespan of the connector. With the advent of frequent changes in PC processors, a need arose for these systems. Intel introduced the LIF socket system, in which the processor is inserted into the socket, rather than fixed by a lever. This type of socket was used for some types of 386s and early 486s. This type of socket {{has been replaced by}} the <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket,</b> although LIF sockets are now used in modern 1.8" [...] hard disks.|$|E
5000|$|The speech upgrade {{also added}} two empty sockets {{next to the}} {{keyboard}} intended to take 16 KB serial ROM cartridges containing either extra speech phoneme data (in addition to the default speech ROM fitted to the motherboard), or general software accessed through the ROM Filing System. The original plan was that some games would be released on cartridges, but due to the limited sales of the speech upgrade, little or no software was ever produced for these sockets. The cut-out space next to the keyboard (nicknamed the [...] "ashtray") was more commonly used to install other upgrades, such as a <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket</b> for conventional paged ROMs.|$|E
50|$|Zero {{insertion}} force (ZIF) {{is a type}} of IC socket or electrical connector that requires very little force for insertion. With a <b>ZIF</b> <b>socket,</b> before the IC is inserted, a lever or slider {{on the side of the}} socket is moved, pushing all the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little force - generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient and no external downward force is required. The lever is then moved back, allowing the contacts to close and grip the pins of the IC. ZIF sockets are much more expensive than standard IC sockets and also tend to take up a larger board area due to the space taken up by the lever mechanism. Therefore they are only used when there is a good reason to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Clones are {{computers}} that imitate C64 functions. In {{the middle of}} 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer Tulip Computers BV (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the C64 Direct-to-TV (C64DTV), a joystick-based TV game based on the C64 with 30 video games built into ROM. Designed by Jeri Ellsworth, a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern C-One C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the Atari 2600 and Intellivision which had gained modest success earlier in the decade. The product was advertised on QVC in the United States for the 2004 holiday season. By [...] "hacking" [...] the circuit board, {{it is possible to}} attach C1541 floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks, and PS/2-keyboards to these units, which gives the DTV devices nearly all the capabilities of a full Commodore 64. The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console Hummer, sold at RadioShack in mid-2005. In 2015, a Commodore 64 compatible motherboard was produced by Individual Computers. [...] Dubbed the [...] "C64 Reloaded", it is a modern redesign of the Commodore 64 motherboard revision 250466 with a few new features. The motherboard itself is designed to be placed in an empty C64 or C64C case already owned by the user. Produced in limited quantities, models of this Commodore 64 [...] "clone" [...] sports either machined or <b>ZIF</b> <b>sockets</b> in which the custom C64 chips would be placed. [...] The board also contains jumpers to accept different revisions of the VIC-II and SID chips, as well as the ability to jumper between the analogue video system modes PAL and NTSC. [...] The motherboard contains several innovations, including selection via the RESTORE key of multiple KERNAL and character ROMs, built-in reset toggle on the power switch, and an S-video socket to replace the original TV modulator. [...] The motherboard is powered by DC-to-DC converter that uses a single power input of [...] from a mains adapter to power the unit rather than the original and failure prone Commodore 64 power supply brick.|$|R
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (<b>ZIF)</b> cartridge <b>socket,</b> designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|R
