40|$|<b>Zabofloxacin</b> {{is a novel}} {{fluoroquinolone}} {{agent that}} has potent activity against gram-positive pathogens. In this study, we confirmed that <b>zabofloxacin</b> showed the most potent in vitro and in vivo activities against drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Among the fluoroquinolone compounds, <b>zabofloxacin</b> showed the most potent in vitro activity against clinical isolates of penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC 90 : 0. 03 mg/L) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC 90 : 0. 03 mg/L). Against quinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae, <b>zabofloxacin</b> (MIC 90 : 1 mg/L) was more active than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and moxifloxacin; however, its activity {{was the same as}} that of gemifloxacin.

This was a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, Phase III, non-inferiority clinical trial designed to compare oral <b>zabofloxacin</b> (367 mg once daily for 5 days) with moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily for 7 days) for the treatment of patients with COPD exacerbation. In all, 345 COPD patients with a moderate COPD exacerbation were enrolled in the study via the outpatient clinics at 31 university hospitals. Clinical per protocol analysis revealed that the clinical cure rate for <b>zabofloxacin</b> was 86. 7 % and that for moxifloxacin was 86. 3 % (the rate difference, 0. 4 %; 95 % confidence interval, – 7. 7 %– 8. 6 %). Intention-to-treat analysis revealed clinical cure rates of 77. 1 % and 77. 3 % (difference, – 0. 2 %; 95 % confidence interval, – 9. 0 %– 8. 8 %), respectively. These results confirm that <b>zabofloxacin</b> is not inferior to moxifloxacin. The favorable microbiological response rate for <b>zabofloxacin</b> was 67. 4 % and that for moxifloxacin was 79. 5 % (P= 0. 22). Patients in the <b>zabofloxacin</b> group showed better patient-oriented outcomes, as measured by EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool-Patient-Reported Outcome and the COPD assessment test scores, than patients in the moxifloxacin group. Adverse drug reactions related to <b>zabofloxacin</b> occurred in 9. 7 % of cases and those related to moxifloxacin occurred in 9. 6 % of cases (P= 0. 97). The dropout rate due to adverse events was 0 % (0 / 175) in the <b>zabofloxacin</b> group and 1. 8 % (3 / 167) in the moxifloxacin group (P= 0. 12). Oral <b>zabofloxacin</b> (367 mg once daily for 5 days) was not inferior to oral moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily for 7 days) for the treatment of patients with COPD exacerbation.

40|$|Lipoglycopeptide, ketolide, and {{quinolone}} antibiotics {{are currently}} in clinical development, with specific advantages over available molecules within their respective classes. The lipoglycopeptide oritavancin is bactericidal against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and multiresistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and proved effective and safe {{for the treatment of}} acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) upon administration of a single 1200 mg dose (two completed phase III trials). The ketolide solithromycin (two phase III studies recruiting for community-acquired pneumonia) shows a profile of activity similar to that of telithromycin, but in vitro data suggest a lower risk of hepatotoxicity, visual disturbance, and aggravation of myasthenia gravis due to reduced affinity for nicotinic receptors. Among quinolones, finafloxacin and delafloxacin share the unique property of an improved activity in acidic environments (found in many infection sites). Finafloxacin (phase II completed; activity profile similar to that of ciprofloxacin) is evaluated for complicated urinary tract and Helicobacter pylori infections. The other quinolones (directed towards Gram-positive pathogens) show improved activity on MRSA and multiresistant S. pneumoniae compared to current molecules. They are in clinical evaluation for ABSSSI (avarofloxacin (phase II completed), nemonoxacin and delafloxacin (ongoing phase III)), respiratory tract infections (<b>zabofloxacin</b> and nemonoxacin (ongoing phase III)), or gonorrhea (delafloxacin) ...|$|E
