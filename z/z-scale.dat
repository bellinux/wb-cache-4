On the other hand, the z-directional variation is mainly driven by the MHD fast wave, where the Alfven and MHD slow waves cannot almost propagate in the z-direction because there is no B_z component at T= 0 and, even after the reconnection process grew up, the B_z component still remains small all over the simulation box. Particularly, the MHD fast wave around x-line is degenerated to the sound wave because of no magnetic field. Therefore, the z-directional development of the 3 D fast reconnection process will be dominated by the local sound speed C_s, where C_s is initially set to be 0.98 (=(γ P/ 2 ρ [...])^ 1 / 2, where γ = 5 / 3 is the specific heat ratio) {{in the center of the}} current sheet and almost does not vary through the simulation run. Considering simply in usual fluid dynamics, since the z-directional sound wave may cancel the z-directional inhomogeneity produced by the z-directional fluctuations in Eq. (3) and may prevent the 3 D instability of the fast reconnection process. This will be true when the <b>z-scale</b> size of the inhomogeneity is sufficiently short. In other words, if the <b>z-scale</b> size of the 3 D reconnection process is sufficiently small, the z-directional inhomogeneity will be effectively canceled and then the 3 D instability does not occur or is weakened. Inversely, if the <b>z-scale</b> size is large, the pressure gradient generated by the fast reconnection process will survive and may be enhanced, leading to the enhancement of the 3 D instability. In fact, this simulation run reveals that such enhancement of the pressure gradient driven by the fast reconnection process overcomes the cancelation driven by the sound wave. In other words, the x-directional Alfven wave overcomes the z-directional sound wave, leading to the 3 D instability of the 2 D fast reconnection process.|$|E

40|$|The scaling {{properties}} of direct photon production in pp, barpp and pA collisions at high energies is reviewed. The experimental {{data on the}} cross sections obtained at ISR, SpS and Tevatron {{are used in the}} analysis. The {{properties of}} data z-presentation, the energy and angular independencies, the power law, and A-dependence are discussed. The use of <b>z-scaling</b> to search for new physics phenomena in hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions is suggested. The violation of <b>z-scaling</b> characterized by the change of the fractal dimension is considered as a new and complimentary signature of a nuclear phase transition. The cross sections of direct photon, pi 0 - and eta 0 -meson production in pp and pPb collisions at RHIC and LHC energies are predicted.

40|$|Assuming fractality of hadronic constituents, we {{introduce}} {{elements of}} special {{realization of the}} relativity principle applied to physical quantities expressed with respect to various fractal structures. The construction is inspired by the premisses of the <b>z-scaling</b> observed in the inclusive reactions at high energies. The scheme concerns parton structure of hadrons and nuclei at small scales.
