Quasi-steady aerodynamic loads are considered {{and the effects}} of reversed flow are included. By using Galerkin's method the spatial dependence of the problem is eliminated and the equations are linearized about a time dependent equilibrium position determined from the trimmed equilibrium position of the rotor in forward flight. In the first trim procedure the rotor is maintained at a fixed value of thrust coefficient with forward flight and horizontal and vertical force equilibrium is satisfied in addition to maintaining <b>zero</b> <b>pitch</b> and roll moments.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} pitch angle regulation of floating wind turbines {{with the presence of}} dynamic uncertainty and unknown disturbances usually encountered in offshore wind turbines, where two control laws are derived for two different cases to continuously achieve <b>zero</b> <b>pitch</b> angle for the floating turbine. In the first case, the time-varying unknown coefficients that characterize the turbine's dynamics are assumed reasonably bounded by known functions, where robust controller is designed in terms of these known functions to achieve <b>zero</b> <b>pitch</b> angle for the turbine with exponential rate of convergence. While in the second case, the turbine's dynamics are considered to be characterized by unknown coefficients of unknown bounds. In this case, a sliding-mode adaptive controller is constructed in terms of estimated values for the unknown coefficients, where these values are continuously updated by adaptive laws associated with the proposed controller to ensure asymptotic convergence to zero for the turbine's pitch angle. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed controllers to achieve the required regulation objective. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we offer a {{general theory of}} {{rotorcraft}} trim. The theory {{is set in the}} context of control theory. It allows for completely arbitrary trim controls and trim settings for multi-rotor aircraft with tests to ensure that a system is trimmable.

The theory shows that sequential trim cannot work for free flight. The theory is not tied to any particular trim algorithm; but, in this paper, it is exercised with periodic shooting to show how free-flying rotorcraft can be trimmed {{in a variety of ways}} (<b>zero</b> yaw, <b>zero</b> <b>pitch,</b> <b>zero</b> roll, minimum power, etc.) by use of the general theory.

The waves, being strongly damped by collisionless cyclotron damping in the ambient thermal plasma, produce reduced scattering and longer MFPs.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{of mixed}} construction. The fuselage {{is made from}} a sandwich of balsa and fiberglass, while the wing is of wood and Kevlar, built on an aluminium spar. Its 61 ft span wing employs an unusual Wortmann FX 05-H-126 airfoil, which was originally designed for helicopter use. This airfoil section was chosen because it has <b>zero</b> <b>pitching</b> moment, which thus allows moderate torsional loads despite the resulting glider's relatively large wing area of 230 sq ft. The LSG-1 has no glidepath control devices, such as dive brakes, making it a challenge to land.

5000|$|Instead {{of using}} a moving {{electromagnet}} (voice coil) placed {{within the field of}} a stationary permanent magnet to drive a cone, like a conventional subwoofer, on a rotary woofer, the voice coil's motion is used to change the angle of a fixed rotation speed set of fan blades in order to generate sound pressure waves. The pitch of the blades change according to the signal the amplifier supplies, producing a modulated sound wave due to the air moved by the spinning blades. If there is no signal applied, the blades simply rotate [...] "flat" [...] at <b>zero</b> <b>pitch,</b> producing no sound. Since the audio amplifier only changes the pitch of the blades, it takes much less power to drive a rotary woofer, although a secondary power source is required to drive the fan motor.|$|R

In this paper, the non-thermal {{emission}} of Lyα,Lyβ and Hα lines generated through charge exchange by protons accelerated {{in the low}} chromosphere and moving with a small pitch angle around an horizontal magnetic field has been computed.

In such conditions, the photons emitted through charge exchange are Doppler shifted symmetrically in both wings of the lines.

Very little literature has been made available on the aerodynamic characterisitics of oval shaped balls, under non-spinning conditions.

40|$|Tri-helical, gravure roll coating, {{operated}} in reverse mode, is investigated via a combined experimental, theoretical and computational approach. New experiments {{were conducted on}} a pilot coating rig, designed to simulate the industrial process. Flow visualisations reveal the underlying flow structure within the roll-to-web transfer region and highlight when loss of coating stability (streaking) occurs. The latter {{is found to be}} influenced by the depth of the tri-helical grooves and the capillary number. Experiments show that as the web-to-roll speed ratio is increased, so too is fluid pickout from the grooves, although the coated film thickness may decrease. A key feature of the present investigation is the formulation of a novel complementary mathematical model. By starting with a simplified form of the coating process and progressively adding complexity a set of models are developed, first for simple <b>zero</b> <b>pitch</b> angled rectangular grooves then for grooves of arbitrary shape and groove pitch. A further extension to the model is the inclusion of a non-Newtonian model for the fluid (specifically a shear thinning power law formulation). Analysis of the application of shear thinning fluids to the moving substrate is also conducted. The base model developed is that for rectangular grooves of <b>zero</b> <b>pitch,</b> which takes the form of an analytical solution of the flow equation (a Poisson equation) along a groove. An extension to this model is made by solving the Poisson equation for non-rectangular grooves using the finite element method. Simple meniscus models were applied to make the problem tractable. Agreement between experimental data and predictions from the model is seen to be good for the range of operating conditions considered up to the onset of streaking. A final extension to the model considers grooves at non-zero pitch angles, representative of the industrial coating process. The limitations of this model, when compared to experimental data are examined and a physical explanation is postulated for the breakdown of the model at steep pitch angles. Under conditions of breakdown, the high pressures within the groove are consistent with the idea that elastohydrodynamics is an important mechanism in the transfer of fluid within the coating bead for discrete cell gravure coating.
