5|$|The lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> {{carotenoids}} {{characteristic of}} carrots are studied for their potential roles in vision and eye health.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and <b>zeaxanthin.</b> α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots {{are also a}} good source of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E
25|$|Two meta-analyses {{confirm a}} {{correlation}} between high diet content or high serum concentrations of lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> {{and a decrease in}} the risk of cataract. There is only one published clinical intervention trial testing for an effect of lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> supplementation on cataracts. The AREDS2 trial enrolled subjects at risk for progression to advanced age-related macular degeneration. Overall, the group getting lutein (10 mg) and <b>zeaxanthin</b> (2 mg) were NOT less likely to progress to needing cataract surgery. The authors speculated {{that there may be a}} cataract prevention benefit for people with low dietary intake of lutein and <b>zeaxanthin,</b> but recommended more research.|$|E
25|$|In AREDS2, {{participants}} {{took one}} of four AREDS formulations: the original AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they {{took one of}} four additional supplement or combinations including lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> (10mg and 2mg), omega-3 fatty acids (1,000mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo. The study reported {{that there was no}} overall additional benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids or lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had little lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> in their diets. Removing beta-carotene did not curb the formulation's protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which was important given that high doses of beta-carotene had been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. It was recommended to replace beta-carotene with lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> in future formulations for these reasons.|$|E
25|$|Broccoli also {{contains}} the carotenoid compounds lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> in amounts about 6 times {{lower than in}} kale.|$|E
25|$|Kiwifruit {{seed oil}} {{contains}} on average 62% alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid. Kiwifruit pulp contains carotenoids, such as provitamin A beta-carotene, lutein, and <b>zeaxanthin.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2016 {{clinical}} trial presented evidence for improvement in visual performance and decrease in light sensitivity (glare) in subjects taking 10mg lutein and 2mg <b>zeaxanthin</b> {{per day for}} 12 months.|$|E
25|$|This xanthophyll, {{like its}} sister {{compound}} <b>zeaxanthin,</b> has primarily {{been used in}} food and supplement manufacturing as a colorant due to its yellow-red color. Lutein absorbs blue light and therefore appears yellow at low concentrations and orange-red at high concentrations.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{serving of}} avocado (100 g) is {{moderate}} to rich in several B vitamins and vitamin K, with good content of vitamin C, vitamin E and potassium (right table, USDA nutrient data). Avocados also contain phytosterols and carotenoids, such as lutein and <b>zeaxanthin.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{preliminary}} epidemiological {{evidence that}} increasing lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> intake lowers {{the risk of}} cataract development. Consumption of more than 2.4mg of lutein/zeaxanthin daily from foods and supplements was significantly correlated with reduced incidence of nuclear lens opacities, as revealed from data collected during a 13- to 15-year period in one study.|$|E
25|$|Lutein is {{a natural}} part of human diet when orange-yellow fruits and leafy green {{vegetables}} are consumed. According to the NHANES 2013-2014 survey, adults in the United States average 1.7 mg/day of lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> combined. No recommended dietary allowance currently exists for lutein. Some positive health effects have been seen at dietary intake levels of 6–10mg/day. The only definitive side effect of excess lutein consumption is bronzing of the skin (carotenodermia).|$|E
25|$|Lutein is {{obtained}} by animals by ingesting plants. In the human retina, lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> are absorbed from blood specifically into the macula lutea {{where they have}} presumed roles as an antioxidant and for protection against blue light. Lutein {{is also found in}} egg yolks and animal fats. In addition to coloring yolks, lutein causes the yellow color of chicken skin and fat, and is used in chicken feed for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to chlorophylls, {{another group of}} yellow–orange pigments called carotenoids are {{also found in the}} photosystems. There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids. They help transfer and dissipate excess energy, and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green, like during the fall, when the leaves of some land plants change color. β-carotene is a bright red-orange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts, like chlorophyll a. Xanthophylls, especially the orange-red <b>zeaxanthin,</b> are also common. Many other forms of carotenoids exist that are only found in certain groups of chloroplasts.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors such}} as UVB {{exposure}} and smoking can be addressed. Although no means of preventing cataracts has been scientifically proven, wearing sunglasses that counteract ultraviolet light may slow their development. While adequate intake of antioxidants (such as vitamins A, C, and E) has been thought {{to protect against the}} risk of cataracts, clinical trials have shown no benefit from supplements; though evidence is mixed, but weakly positive, for a potential protective effect of the nutrients lutein and <b>zeaxanthin.</b> Statin use is somewhat associated with a lower risk of nuclear sclerotic cataracts.|$|E
25|$|While yellow maizes {{derive their}} color from lutein and <b>zeaxanthin,</b> in red-colored maizes, the kernel {{coloration}} {{is due to}} anthocyanins and phlobaphenes. These latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway from polymerisation of flavan-4-ols by the expression of maize pericarp color1 (p1) gene which encodes an R2R3 myb-like transcriptional activator of the A1 gene encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols) while another gene (Suppressor of Pericarp Pigmentation 1 or SPP1) acts as a suppressor. The p1 gene encodes an Myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments, while the P1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs, and unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1) modifies P1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp, as well as vegetative tissues, which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments. The maize P gene encodes a Myb homolog that recognizes the sequence CCT/AACC, in sharp contrast with the C/TAACGG bound by vertebrate Myb proteins.|$|E
25|$|Saffron {{contains}} more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many nonvolatile active components, {{many of which are}} carotenoids, including <b>zeaxanthin,</b> lycopene, and various α- and β-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of α-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant α-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make α-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, {{findings}} of the Age-Related Eye Disease Study showed that a dietary supplement formulation containing lutein reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by 25 percent. However, lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> had no overall effect on preventing AMD, but rather [...] "the participants with low dietary intake of lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> {{at the start of}} the study, but who took an AREDS formulation with lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> during the study, were about 25 percent less likely to develop advanced AMD compared with participants with similar dietary intake who did not take lutein and zeaxanthin." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} study {{investigated}} the effects of lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> on macular pigment and visual function in patients with early AMD. Daily intake of either 20 mg lutein alone or 10 mg lutein and 10 mg <b>zeaxanthin</b> was found to significantly increase the macular pigment content {{in comparison with the}} placebo group; the authors also reported a significant improvement in contrast sensitivity and a trend toward improvement in best-corrected visual acuity after 48 weeks of carotenoid supplementation. Furthermore, they found a significant correlation between these two parameters of visual function and the macular pigment content, suggesting that the increase in the latter underlies the improvement of visual function ...|$|E
2500|$|The bitter {{glucoside}} picrocrocin {{is responsible}} for saffron's flavour. Picrocrocin (chemical formula: systematic name: 4-(β-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an aldehyde sub-molecule known as safranal (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid <b>zeaxanthin</b> that is produced via oxidative cleavage, and is the glycoside of the terpene aldehyde safranal.|$|E
2500|$|Lutein is {{isomeric}} with <b>zeaxanthin,</b> differing only in {{the placement}} of one double bond. The principal natural stereoisomer of lutein is -beta,epsilon-carotene-3,3-diol. Lutein is a lipophilic molecule and is generally insoluble in water. The presence of the long chromophore of conjugated double bonds (polyene chain) provides the distinctive light-absorbing properties. [...] The polyene chain is susceptible to oxidative degradation by light or heat and is chemically unstable in acids.|$|E
2500|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised that the {{nutrients}} in Juice Plus+ capsules may not be bioavailable or effectively absorbed by the human body, {{and that some of}} the nutrients claimed to be in the products may not be present in significant amounts. Studies on nutrient absorption showed that subjects taking Juice Plus had elevated blood levels of folate and β-carotene, but the effects on blood levels of vitamin E and vitamin C were inconsistent. Some studies have shown significant increases in vitamin E and C levels, while other studies have shown much weaker effects on vitamin E and C levels, and that the levels of vitamin E and vitamin C are not significantly increased. Juice Plus was found to increase blood lycopene levels in several studies, while other studies have indicated that Juice Plus does not raise blood levels of lycopene or other phytochemicals in fresh fruits and vegetables such as lutein, <b>zeaxanthin,</b> [...] and β-cryptoxanthin.|$|E

50|$|Animals derive <b>zeaxanthin</b> from a plant diet. <b>Zeaxanthin</b> {{is one of}} the {{two primary}} {{xanthophyll}} carotenoids contained within the retina of the eye.

50|$|<b>Zeaxanthin</b> {{supplements}} {{are typically}} {{taken on the}} supposition of supporting eye health. Although there are no reported side effects from taking <b>zeaxanthin</b> supplements, this possible benefit remains scientifically unproven, despite extensive ongoing research to define dietary or supplemental effects of <b>zeaxanthin</b> and lutein.|$|E
50|$|Lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> have {{identical}} chemical formulas and are isomers, {{but they}} are not stereoisomers. The only difference between them is in the location of the double bond in one of the end rings. This difference gives lutein three chiral centers whereas <b>zeaxanthin</b> has two. Because of symmetry, the (3R,3'S) and (3S,3'R) stereoisomers of <b>zeaxanthin</b> are identical. Therefore, <b>zeaxanthin</b> has only three stereoisomeric forms. The (3R,3'S) stereoisomer is called meso-zeaxanthin.|$|E

50|$|The {{xanthophyll}} cycle {{involves the}} enzymatic removal of epoxy groups from xanthophylls (e.g. violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, diadinoxanthin) to create so-called de-epoxidised xanthophylls (e.g. diatoxanthin, <b>zeaxanthin).</b> These enzymatic cycles {{were found to}} {{play a key role}} in stimulating energy dissipation within light-harvesting antenna proteins by non-photochemical quenching- a mechanism to reduce the amount of energy that reaches the photosynthetic reaction centers. Non-photochemical quenching is one of the main ways of protecting against photoinhibition. In higher plants, there are three carotenoid pigments that are active in the xanthophyll cycle: violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, and <b>zeaxanthin.</b> During light stress, violaxanthin is converted to <b>zeaxanthin</b> via the intermediate antheraxanthin, which plays a direct photoprotective role acting as a lipid-protective anti-oxidant and by stimulating non-photochemical quenching within light-harvesting proteins. This conversion of violaxanthin to <b>zeaxanthin</b> is done by the enzyme violaxanthin de-epoxidase, while the reverse reaction is performed by <b>zeaxanthin</b> epoxidase.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{commercial}} value of carotenoids, their biosynthesis has been studied extensively in both natural products and non-natural (heterologous) systems such as the bacteria Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>Zeaxanthin</b> biosynthesis proceeds from beta-carotene via the action of a single protein, known as a beta-carotene hydroxylase, that is able to add a hydroxyl group (-OH) to carbon 3 and 3' of the beta-carotene molecule. <b>Zeaxanthin</b> biosynthesis therefore proceeds from beta-carotene to <b>zeaxanthin</b> (a di-hydroxylated product) via beta-cryptoxanthin (the mono hydroxylated intermediate). Although functionally identical, several distinct beta-carotene hydroxylase proteins are known.Due {{to the nature of}} <b>zeaxanthin,</b> relative to astaxanthin (a carotenoid of significant commercial value) beta-carotene hydroxylase proteins have been studied extensively.|$|E
50|$|Broiler {{chickens}} are yellow {{when they}} are fed with carotenoid-containing feed, as these carotenoids are accumulated in skin and subcutaneous fat of the animal. Carotenoid deposition is also {{the cause of the}} yellow colour of egg yolk. For this reason, poultry producers add carotenoids (typically lutein, <b>zeaxanthin,</b> canthaxanthin and β-apo-8´-apocarotenal) to the feed to increase the attractiveness of the final product for the consumer, but also to support animal health. It is believed that lutein and <b>zeaxanthin</b> act synergistically to increase the yellow hue, whereas <b>zeaxanthin</b> is more powerful than lutein due to its larger chromophore. Therefore, a number of companies use marigold extract where a percentage of lutein has been converted into <b>zeaxanthin</b> (the meso form, meso-zeaxanthin) in order to supplement broilers and hens with both carotenoids. The isomer of <b>zeaxanthin</b> obtained from lutein is meso-zeaxanthin {{due to the nature of}} the technique used (see below).
