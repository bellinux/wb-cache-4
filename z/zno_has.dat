40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of dietary supplementation with low dose of porous and nano zinc oxide (ZnO) on weaning piglets, and to {{evaluate}} the possibility of using them as an alternative to high dose of regular ZnO. Piglets were randomly allocated into four treatment groups fed with four diets: (1) basal diet (NC), (2) NC+ 3000 mg/kg ZnO (PC), (3) NC + 500 mg/kg porous ZnO (HiZ) and (4) NC + 500 mg/kg nano ZnO (ZNP). The result showed that piglets in HiZ group had less diarrhea than ZNP group (P 0. 05). Analysis of trace metal elements revealed that piglets fed with high dose of regular <b>ZnO</b> <b>had</b> the highest Zn level in kidney (P < 0. 05), which may induce kidney stone formation. Additionally, a decrease in ileal crypt depth was observed in PC, HiZ and ZNP group, suggesting an effective protection against intestinal injury.

In conclusion, dietary supplementation with low dose of porous and nano <b>ZnO</b> <b>had</b> similar (even better) effect on improving growth performance and intestinal morphology, reducing diarrhea and intestinal inflammatory as high dose of regular ZnO in weaning piglets.
