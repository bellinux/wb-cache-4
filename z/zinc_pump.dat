Identifying a {{limiting}} factor in the molecular mechanism of zinc loading into seeds is an important step towards determining the genetic basis for variation of grain micronutrient content and developing breeding strategies to improve this trait 3. Nutrients are translocated to developing seeds at a rate that is regulated by transport processes in source leaves, in the phloem vascular pathway, and at seed sinks. Nutrients are released from a symplasmic maternal seed domain into the seed apoplasm surrounding the endosperm and embryo by poorly understood membrane transport processes 4,​ 5,​ 6. Plants are unique among eukaryotes in having specific P 1 B-ATPase pumps for the cellular export of zinc 7. In Arabidopsis, we show that two zinc transporting P 1 B-ATPases actively export zinc from the mother plant to the filial tissues. Mutant plants that lack both zinc pumps accumulate zinc in the seed coat and consequently have vastly reduced amounts of zinc inside the seed. Blockage of zinc transport was observed at both high and low external zinc supplies. The phenotype was determined by the mother plant and is thus {{due to a lack of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>pump</b> activity in the seed coat and not in the filial tissues. The finding that P 1 B-ATPases are one of the limiting factors controlling the amount of zinc inside a seed is an important step towards combating nutritional zinc deficiency worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} {{movement disorder}} that affects approximately 1 % of people {{over the age of}} 60. Majority of PD cases are sporadic or have no known cause while the underlying basis of neurodegeneration is unclear. Common forms of treatment only reduce motor symptoms and there is no cure. Insight can be gained towards understanding the cause of neurodegeneration in PD by studying the function of PARK genes. SNCA (PARK 1 / 4) encodes for alpha-synuclein which is a major component of Lewy bodies, a hallmark of PD. While mutations in or overproduction of alpha-synuclein may cause PD. Importantly, alpha-synuclein causes dosage dependent toxicity in model organisms while the toxic mechanisms are unknown. A second gene is PARK 9, mutations are associated with the earliest onset of PD. PARK 9 was found to be overexpressed greater than tenfold in surviving dopaminergic neurons of sporadic PD patients, separately, the yeast orthologue of PARK 9 was found to significantly reduce alpha-synuclein toxicity in a yeast PD model, suggesting a neuroprotective role for PARK 9. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the function of PARK 9 and how PARK 9 can reduce alpha-synuclein toxicity. PARK 9 is a P-ATPase, a family of inorganic cation pumps. Data from yeast, rat primary foetal cortical neurons, human SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma models and PARK patients indicate PARK 9 is a <b>zinc</b> <b>pump.</b> PARK 9 closely associates with the autophagic marker LC 3 and zinc is crucial for autophagy. These data suggest that PARK 9 aids in autophagy regulation and defective PARK 9 may result in defective autophagy. Importantly, it is shown for the first time, that alpha-synuclein disrupts zinc homeostasis, thus alpha-synuclein may inhibit autophagy partly through perturbing zinc homeostasis. Separately, PARK 9 overexpression reduced alpha-synuclein levels in SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma suggesting that the neuroprotective properties of PARK 9 may be achieved through restoring autophagy impairment due to alpha-synuclein. Hence, defective autophagy due to a PARK 9 deficiency provides a mechanistic explanation for accelerated neurodegeneration in PARK 9 mutation PD patients. While data from this thesis suggests that restoring neuronal zinc balance may be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce alpha-synuclein associated neurodegeneration...|$|E

40|$|Background. Zinc {{plays an}} {{important}} role in human immunity, and it is known that zinc deficiency in the host is linked to increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. In this study, we investigate the role of zinc efflux in the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]), a human pathogen responsible for superficial infections, such as pharyngitis and impetigo, and severe invasive infections. Methods. The clinically important M 1 T 1 wild-type strain was used in this study, and isogenic mutants were constructed with deletions in the czcD gene (Spy 0653; which encodes a putative <b>zinc</b> efflux <b>pump)</b> and adjacent gczA gene (Spy 0654; which encodes a putative zinc-dependent activator of czcD). Wild-type, isogenic mutants and complemented strains were tested for resistance against zinc stress, intracellular zinc accumulation, and viru-lence. Results. Both czcD and gczA mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to zinc. Transcriptional analyses indicate that GczA upregulates czcD in response to zinc. Both mutants displayed increased susceptibility to human neutrophil killing and reduced virulence in a murine infection model. Furthermore, we showed that neutrophils mobilize zinc in response to GAS. Conclusions. These data indicate that the innate immune system may use zinc as an antimicrobial agent and that zinc efflux is an important contributor to GAS pathogenesis...|$|R

ABSTRACT Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus [GAS]) is an obligate human {{pathogen}} {{responsible for a}} spectrum of human disease states. Metallobiology of human pathogens is revealing the fundamental role of metals in both nutritional immu-nity leading to pathogen starvation andmetal poisoning of pathogens by innate immune cells. Spy 0980 (MntE) is a paralog of the GAS <b>zinc</b> efflux <b>pump</b> CzcD. Through use of an isogenicmntE deletion mutant in the GAS serotypeM 1 T 1 strain 5448, we have elucidated that MntE is a manganese-specific efflux pump required for GAS virulence. The 5448 mntEmutant had significantly lower survival following infection of human neutrophils than did the 5448 wild type and the complemented mutant (5448 mntE::mntE). Manganese homeostasis may provide protection against oxidative stress, explaining the observed ex vivo reduction in virulence. In the presence of manganese and hydrogen peroxide, 5448 mntEmutant exhibits significantly lower survival than wild-type 5448 and the complemented mutant. We hypothesize that MntE, by maintaining homeostatic control of cytoplasmic manganese, ensures that the peroxide response repressor PerR is optimally poised to respond to hydrogen peroxide stress. Creation of a 5448 mntE-perR double mutant rescued the oxidative stress resistance of the double mutant to wild-type levels {{in the presence of}} manganese and hydrogen peroxide. This work elucidates the mechanism for manganese toxicity within GAS and the crucial role of manganese homeostasis in maintaining GAS virulence.

40|$|Corresponding authors Zinc, a {{metal ion}} that {{functions}} {{in a wide}} variety of catalytic and structural sites in metalloproteins, is shown here to adopt a novel coordination environment in the Escherichia coli transport protein ZntA. The ZntA protein is a P-type ATPase that <b>pumps</b> <b>zinc</b> out of the cytoplasm and into the periplasm. It is physiologically selective for Zn(II) and functions with metalloregulatory proteins in the cell to keep the zinc quota within strict limits. Yet, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain contains a region that is highly homologous to the yeast Cu(I) metallochaperone Atx 1. To investigate how the structure of this region may influence its function, this fragment, containing residues 46 – 118, has been cloned out of the gene and overexpressed. We report here the solution structure of this fragment as determined by NMR. Both the apo and Zn(II) -ZntA(46 – 118) structures have been determined. It contains a previously unknown protein coordination site for zinc that includes two cysteine residues, Cys 59 and Cys 62, and a carboxylate residue, Asp 58. The solvent accessibility of this site is also remarkably high, a feature that increasingly appears to be a characteristic of domains of heavy metal ion transport proteins. The participation of Asp 58 in this ZntA metal ion binding site may play an important role in modulating the relative affinities and metal exchange rates for Zn(II) /Pb(II) /Cd(II) as compared with other P-type ATPases, which are selective for Cu(I) or Ag(I) ...|$|R
