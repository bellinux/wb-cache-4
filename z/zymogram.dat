In this study pectic zymograms were used to identify species and form species of Fusarium isolates. Fusarium isolates (318) were obtained from different areas and hosts in Isfahan Province, Iran. Isolates were identified to species based on morphological characters. A pectic enzyme solution was prepared for each isolate using liquid media containing citrus pectin as the sole carbon source. Electrophoresis was performed using acrylamide gel containing 0. 2 % citrus pectin as the enzyme substrate. The gels were incubated in 0. 1 M malic acid before staining overnight in 0. 02 % ruthenium red, to visualize enzyme electrophoretic patterns. Several <b>zymogram</b> phenotypes were obtained for polygalacturonase and pectin esterase. In total, 12 <b>zymogram</b> patterns were determined for the 318 isolates tested.

The pectic <b>zymogram</b> data were compared with those obtained for isolates collected from central Iran. Analyses of bands corresponding to pectin esterase and polygalacturonase revealed three <b>zymogram</b> subgroups (ZG) in AG 3. In addition to the previously reported ZG 7 (here renamed ZG 7 - 1), two new <b>zymogram</b> subgroups, ZG 7 - 2 and ZG 7 - 3, were identified. Of the 446 isolates tested, 50 % of the South Australian and 46 % of the Iranian isolates were ZG 7 - 1. The majority of the isolates originating from stem and root cankers were ZG 7 - 1, whereas most of the isolates designated ZG 7 - 2 and ZG 7 - 3 originated from tuber-borne sclerotia. Pathogenicity tests revealed that ZG 7 - 1 generally produced fewer sclerotia and more severe cankers of underground parts of the potato plants than the other two ZGs. Two random DNA clones, one originating from an AG 3 isolate and the other from an AG 4 isolate, were used as probes for RFLP analyses of Australian isolates. The AG 3 probe, previously identified to be specific to this group, detected a high level of genetic diversity, with 11 genotypes identified amongst 50 isolates analysed. The low-copy AG 4 probe resolved three genotypes amongst 24 isolates. For 23 isolates analysed with both markers, the combined data distinguished a total of six genotypes and similarity analysis resolved the isolates into two main groups with 50 % homology.
