5|$|From the mid-1870s Busch's {{illustrations}} {{were printed}} using zincography. With this technique {{there was no}} longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings. The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive <b>zinc</b> <b>plate.</b> This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with Mr. and Mrs. Knopp.|$|E
25|$|Wollaston made {{improvements}} to the galvanic battery (named after Galvani) in the 1810s. In Wollaston's battery, the wooden box was replaced with an earthenware vessel, and a copper plate was bent into a U-shape, with a single plate of zinc placed {{in the center of}} the bent copper. The <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> was prevented from making contact with the copper by dowels (pieces) of cork or wood. In his single cell design, the U-shaped copper plate was welded to a horizontal handle for lifting the copper and zinc plates out of the electrolyte when the battery was not in use.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{provided}} 1.9 volts. It proved {{popular with}} experimenters {{for many years}} due to its relatively high voltage; greater ability to produce a consistent current and lack of any fumes, but the relative fragility of its thin glass enclosure {{and the necessity of}} having to raise the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> when the cell was not in use eventually saw it fall out of favour. The cell was also known as the 'chromic acid cell', but principally as the 'bichromate cell'. This latter name came from the practice of producing the chromic acid by adding sulphuric acid to potassium dichromate, even though the cell itself contained no dichromate.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} and innovation {{of this process}} over lithography {{was the use of}} <b>zinc</b> <b>plates</b> rather than stone ones. <b>Zinc</b> <b>plates</b> were lighter and easier to transport, could produce more prints, and were far less brittle than the stone plates originally used. The use of <b>zinc</b> <b>plates</b> was also the origin of the name photozincography, which Sir Henry James claims to have invented.|$|R

Granville Fell, an artist and art editor. The Leicester Galleries offered Blampied a contract and three prints were shown to the general public in February 1915 in the first of a series of exhibitions of prints called Modern Masters of Etching. Blampied's most famous print, called Driving home in the rain, which had been designed in 1913 and transferred to a <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> in 1914, was not shown at the Leicester Galleries until November 1916 where, according to a Jersey newspaper of that time, it received a great deal of attention and admiration.|$|E
500|$|The {{healing of}} the blister under the silver {{electrode}} {{was of no}} importance for a counter-irritation procedure, but it suggested to Bird that the electric moxa might be used for treating obstinate leg ulcers. [...] This was a common complaint among the working classes in Bird's time, and hospitals could not admit {{the majority of cases}} for treatment. [...] The moxa improved the situation by enabling sufferers to be treated as outpatients. The silver electrode of the moxa was applied to the ulcer to be healed, while the zinc electrode was applied a few inches away to a place where the upper layer of skin had been cut away. [...] The whole apparatus was then bandaged in place as before. [...] The technique was successfully applied by others on Bird's recommendation. [...] Thomas Wells later discovered that it was unnecessary to damage the skin under the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate.</b> [...] He merely moistened the skin with vinegar before applying the zinc electrode.|$|E
2500|$|... (2) In the {{etching process}} an {{enlarged}} {{image of the}} design is cast upon a <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> {{by means of an}} enlarging camera and prisms or reflectors. On this plate it is then painted in colours roughly approximating to those in the original, and the outlines of each colour are carefully engraved in duplicate by hand. The necessity for this is that in subsequent operations the design has to be again reduced to its original size and, if the outlines on the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> were too small at first, they would be impracticable either to etch or print. The reduction of the design and its transfer to a varnished copper roller are both effected at one and the same operation in the pantograph machine. This machine is capable of reducing a pattern on the <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> from one-half to one-tenth of its size, and is so arranged that when its pointer or stylus is moved along the engraved lines of the plate a series of diamond points cut a reduced facsimile of them through the varnish with which the roller is covered. These diamond points vary in number according to the number of times the pattern is required to repeat {{along the length of the}} roller. Each colour of a design is transferred in this way to a separate roller. The roller is then placed in a shallow trough containing nitric acid, which acts only on those parts of it from which the varnish has been scraped. To ensure evenness the roller is revolved during the whole time of its immersion in the acid. When the etching is sufficiently deep the roller is washed, the varnish dissolved off, any parts not quite perfect being retouched by hand.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{scientist}} Johann Christian Poggendorff {{overcame the}} problems with separating the electrolyte and the depolariser using a porous earthenware pot in 1842. [...] In the Poggendorff cell, sometimes called Grenet Cell due to the works of Eugene Grenet around 1859, the electrolyte was dilute sulphuric acid and the depolariser was chromic acid. The two acids were physically mixed together eliminating the porous pot. The positive electrode (cathode) was two carbon plates, with a <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> (negative or anode) positioned between them. Because of the tendency of the acid mixture to react with the zinc, a mechanism was provided to raise the zinc electrode clear of the acids.|$|E
2500|$|Chester Carlson, the {{inventor}} of photocopying, was originally a patent attorney and part-time researcher and inventor. His job at the patent office in New York City required {{him to make a}} large number of copies of important papers. Carlson, who was arthritic, found this a painful and tedious process. This prompted him to conduct experiments with photoconductivity. Carlson experimented with [...] "electrophotography" [...] in his kitchen and in 1938, applied for a patent for the process. He made the first [...] "photocopy" [...] using a <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> covered with sulfur. The words [...] "10-22-38 Astoria" [...] were written on a microscope slide, which was placed on top of more sulfur and under a bright light. After the slide was removed, a mirror image of the words remained. Carlson tried to sell his invention to some companies, but because the process was still underdeveloped he failed. At the time multiple copies were made using carbon paper or duplicating machines and people did not feel the need for an electronic machine. Between 1939 and 1944, Carlson was turned down by over 20 companies, including IBM and GE, neither of which believed there was a significant market for copiers.|$|E

Hydrogen gas rose from the platina, and was collected in the jar, but no hydrogen or other gas rose from either <b>zinc</b> <b>plate.</b> In about ten or twelve minutes, sufficient hydrogen having been collected, the experiment was stopped; during its progress a few small bubbles had appeared upon plate B, but none upon plate A. The plates were washed in distilled water, dried, and reweighed. Plate B weighed 148.3 grains, as before, having lost nothing by the direct chemical action of the acid.

When an amalgamated <b>zinc</b> <b>plate</b> is dipped into dilute sulphuric acid, the force of chemical affinity exerted between the metal and the fluid is not sufficiently powerful to cause sensible action at the surfaces of contact, and occasion the decomposition of water by the oxidation of the metal, although it is sufficient to produce such a condition of the electricity (or the power upon which chemical affinity depends) as would produce a current if there were a path open for it (916. 956.); and that current would complete the conditions necessary, under the circumstances, for the decomposition of the water.|$|E

They were about five inches long, and 0.4 of an inch wide. An earthenware pneumatic trough was filled with dilute sulphuric acid, of the strength just described (863.), and a gas jar, also filled with the acid, inverted in it[A].

On completing the circuit, all the pairs acted and evolved gas at the surfaces of the platina.
