5|$|Other sources include {{fortified}} food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, {{one of the}} most common supplements in the United States, and <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonate</b> are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonate</b> than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms.

50|$|Hot-dip {{galvanized}} {{surfaces are}} not generally {{tested in a}} salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). Hot-dip galvanizing produces <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonates</b> when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate. The <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonates</b> are not produced when a hot-dip galvanized specimen is exposed to a salt spray fog, therefore this testing method does not give an accurate measurement of corrosion protection. ISO 9223 gives the guidelines for proper measurement of corrosion resistance for hot-dip galvanized specimens.|$|R

5|$|Cadmium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cd and atomic number 48. This soft, bluish-white metal is chemically {{similar to the}} two other stable metals in group 12, zinc and mercury. Like zinc, it demonstrates oxidation state +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the transition metals in groups 3 through 11. Cadmium and its congeners in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in {{that they do not}} have partly filled d or f electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states.

Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonate</b> and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E

He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reducing the sulfide. The potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, {{but the lack of}} cadmium limited this application.|$|E

2500|$|The sodium {{carbonate}} test (not {{to be confused}} with {{sodium carbonate}} extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. [...] The compounds formed are, respectively, copper(II) carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonate,</b> and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the mass transfers taking place in a unit operation of a recently developed hydrometallurgical process. This process is a purification treatment of zinc rich electric arc furnace dusts to generate high purity zinc oxide. In this operation, gaseous CO 2 generated in a furnace is injected in a reactor containing an aqueous solution of ammonia and ammonium carbonate, which is the leaching solution of these dusts, to precipitate <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonates.</b> During the operation, the gas-liquid CO 2 absorption is coupled with a simultaneous liquid-gas NH 3 desorption and with several reactions in the leaching solution. This paper aims to propose a mathematical model of the coupling between the mass transports and the reactions and to present a simulation tool for the computation of the CO 2 absorption, the NH 3 desorption rates and their evolutions with the solution composition. The ability of the presented simulation tool to predict the time evolution of the liquid composition during a gas injection is evaluated by comparing simulation results to experimental results. The pH time evolution is used as the comparison criterion and the experiments are carried out at a bench-scale stirred tank reactor. In addition, simulations results showing the influence of the solution composition in conditions representative of the operating conditions on the CO 2 absorption and NH 3 desorption rates are presented and discussed.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the sulphidic mine tailings from Frongoch and Grogwynion, two abandoned lead zinc mines in mid-Wales, UK. Despite falling within the same ore field the mine waste characterisation has identified differences in the tailings from the two sites. Bulk concentrations range from 10 to 52 g kg− 1 for Pb, 1. 1 to 2. 9 g kg− 1 for Zn in Grogwynion and from 1. 0 to 130 g kg− 1 for Pb, 11 to 110 g kg− 1 for Zn in Frongoch. An experimental (European standard leaching tests TS 14429 and TS 14405) and geochemical modelling approach was used to study the leaching composition {{as a function of}} pH and liquid/solid ratio. There was little correlation between the tailings bulk metal concentrations and the leachate composition, but variations in Pb and Zn concentrations were found to be consistent with control of dissolved Pb and Zn by secondary minerals and the mechanisms of dissolution/precipitation/sorption involving them. Specifically, the Grogwynion mine tailings with near-neutral pH have predominantly lead and <b>zinc</b> <b>carbonates</b> controlling Pb and Zn solubility in the leachates, whereas the Pb and Zn concentrations in Frongoch leachates are best modelled with a surface complexation model for metal sorption to oxyhydroxides. The different speciation results in a greater sensitivity of Grogwynion tailings to acidification with a potential release of Pb in solution up to 10 times higher than in Frongoch, despite similar bulk Pb concentrations. At acid pH, Zn is similarly dissolved to a greater extent in Grogwynion than in Frongoch tailings. There was no evidence of sulphide oxidation during the batch and column leaching tests and the suitability of using these European leaching standards for the characterisation of sulphidic mine waste materials for waste management purposes has been considered. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} precursors of {{zinc oxide}} were prepared via the ammoniacal ammonium carbonate leaching {{of the black}} mass obtained during the recycling of alkaline batteries.
