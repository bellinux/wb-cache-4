40|$|Abstract Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{characterized}} by degeneration of articular cartilage. Animal models of OA induced are a widely used tool {{in the study of}} the pathogenesis of disease. Several proteomic techniques for selective extraction of proteins have provided protein profiles of chondrocytes and secretory patterns in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage, including the discovery of new and promising biomarkers. In this proteomic analysis to study several proteins from rat normal articular cartilage, two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS) were used. Interestingly, latexin (LXN) was found. Using an immunohistochemical technique, it was possible to determine its localization within the chondrocytes from normal and osteoarthritic articular cartilage. Results In this study, 147 proteins were visualized, and 47 proteins were identified by MS. A significant proportion of proteins are involved in metabolic processes and energy (32 %), as well as participating in different biological functions including structural organization (19 %), signal transduction and molecular signaling (11 %), redox homeostasis (9 %), transcription and protein synthesis (6 %), and transport (6 %). The identified proteins were assigned to one or more subcellular compartments. Among the identified proteins, we found some proteins already recognized in other studies such as OA-associated proteins. Interestingly, we identified LXN, an inhibitor of mammalian carboxypeptidases, which had not been described in articular cartilage. Immunolabeling assays for LXN showed a granular distribution pattern in the cytoplasm of most chondrocytes of the middle, deep and calcified <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> articular cartilage as well as in subchondral bone. In osteoarthritic cartilage, LXN was observed in superficial and deep zones. Conclusions This study provides the first proteomic analysis <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> articular cartilage <b>of</b> rat. We identified LXN, whose location was demonstrated by immunolabeling in the chondrocytes from the middle, deep and calcified <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> articular cartilage, and superficial and deep <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> osteoarthritic cartilage. </p...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sections <b>of</b> the different <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> histologically <b>normal</b> prostates from 35 year-old men were obtained and autoradiographically studied with 125 I ET- 1 with and without the ETA antagonist BQ- 123, the ETB agonists sarafotoxin 6 C, and excess cold ET- 1. Specimens from PZ and CZ and DU 145 and PC 3 human prostate cancer cell lines were also investigated by reverse transcription (RT) -PCR. RESULTS: The mRNAs of all genes were detected in all specimens examined. No ETB expression was found in either cell lines. Specific intense 125 I ET- 1 binding with clear-cut differences among zones was found. In the CZ the main subtype in the glandular stroma and epithelium was the ETA and ETB, respectively, in the PZ the opposite was true. In PZ, the ETA receptors were detected on the glandular epithelium; in the TZ both receptor subtypes were only in the stroma.

40|$|Although low-grade {{cartilage}} neoplasms typically {{consist of}} hyaline-like cartilage, {{most of them}} also contain some fibrocartilaginous regions. CD 44, a cell surface receptor for hyaluronan, has been identified in cartilage. A family of alternatively spliced mRNA containing the variant 6 (v 6) exon sequence of CD 44 {{has been linked to}} several types of neoplasms. We hypothesized that expressions of v 6 -containing CD 44 species are associated with fibrocartilaginous regions of low-grade cartilageneoplasms. To test this hypothesis we performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analysis on eight samples: four from normal articular cartilage, one from a synovial chondromatosis, and three chondrosarcomas which were graded as I and I/II. The standard CD 44 s and a unique v 6 -containing CD 44 species (CD 44 v 6 - 10) were identified in all tissue samples by RT-PCR analysis. Immunohistochemically, using an antibody that cross-reacted with all CD 44 species, CD 44 was localized to the cell surface, lacuna wall and intracellular compartment of the chondrocytes in the middle and deep <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> cartilage, as well as with cells throughout the neoplastic masses. Utilizing an antibody specific for v 6 -containing CD 44 species, the variant species was identified throughout cells of the middle and deep <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> cartilage, and localized selectively to intracellular positions. In neoplastic masses, v 6 -containing CD 44 species were found associated only with cells in the hyaline-like cartilage, but not in the fibrocartilaginous regions. Thus a differential expression of the v 6 -containing CD 44 species in the neoplastic masses containing both hyaline-like cartilage and fibrocartilaginous regions was observed when compared to its homogenous expression in normal hyaline cartilage.

Op-tical coherence tomographic imaging showed distinct <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal,</b> altered, and ablated tissue microstructures for each pathologic process studied. Abnormal findings were directly compared with regions <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> tissue or conventional histopathologic features when tissue for analysis was available. This study provides a composite series of in vivo OCT images of the oral cavity and oropharynx in a variety <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> regions and pathologic {{states as well as}} outline future applica-tionsofOCTtechnology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{examine the}} {{distribution}} of insulin like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) receptors and the biological response to IGF- 1 stimulation in articular cartilage <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> mouse knee joints and arthritic joints taken at various stages of experimentally induced arthritis. METHODS [...] In situ IGF- 1 receptor expression and responsiveness to IGF- 1 stimulation were examined in murine articular cartilage at different phases in two models of experimentally induced arthritis. IGF- 1 receptor expression was visualised in joint sections {{with the use of}} anti-IGF- 1 receptor antibodies and quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Chondrocyte proteoglycan (PG) synthesis was measured by incorporation of 35 S-sulphate. RESULTS [...] In control cartilage, the majority of IGF- 1 receptors were found on chondrocytes localised in the middle and deeper <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> the cartilage, whereas receptor expression in surface zone chondrocytes was very low. During culture <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> articular cartilage, IGF- 1 was able to maintain chondrocyte PG synthesis at the in vivo level. Concurrently with the development of arthritis, cartilage lost its capacity to react to IGF- 1, but IGF- 1 stimulation recovered when the inflammatory response waned. Shortly after induction of arthritis, IGF- 1 receptor expression initially declined, but it had returned to normal levels by day 1 and remained increased thereafter. CONCLUSION [...] The distribution of IGF- 1 receptor expression in the different <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> <b>normal</b> articular cartilage reflects IGF- 1 stimulation and metabolic activity of chondrocytes in these layers. This correlation is disturbed in arthritic cartilage, suggesting inadequate or overruled signalling...|$|R
