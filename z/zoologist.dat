5|$|Lamarck {{was largely}} {{ignored by the}} major French <b>zoologist</b> Cuvier, but he {{attracted}} much more interest abroad. The book was read carefully, but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important <b>zoologist,</b> and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} royal antelope is Neotragus pygmaeus. It {{is placed in the}} genus Neotragus and the family Bovidae. It was first described by Swedish <b>zoologist</b> Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758). German <b>zoologist</b> Peter Simon Pallas recognised two species – Tragulus pygmaeus and Antilope pygmaea. However, both of them were found to have the same type, the royal antelope. Hence these were treated as synonyms for N. pygmaeus.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Zoologists</b> and {{wildlife}} biologists study animals {{and wildlife}}—their origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. <b>Zoologists</b> and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data {{to determine the}} environmental effects of current and potential uses of land and water areas. <b>Zoologists</b> usually are identified by the animal group they study. For example, ornithologists study birds, mammalogists study mammals, herpetologists study reptiles and amphibians, ichthyologists study fish, cnidariologists study jellyfishes and entomologists study insects.|$|R

5|$|Based on {{studies of}} morphology, the bluebuck has {{historically}} been classified as either a distinct species or as a subspecies of the roan antelope. After its extinction, some 19th-century naturalists began to doubt its validity as a species, with some believing the museum specimens to be small or immature roan antelopes, and both species were lumped together under the name A.leucophaeus by the English <b>zoologist</b> George Robert Gray in 1821. The Austrian <b>zoologist</b> Franz Friedrich Kohl pointed out the distinct features of the bluebuck in 1866, followed by Sclater and Thomas, who rejected the synonymy in 1899.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its highly}} {{variable}} color pattern, the leopard catshark {{has historically been}} known under a multitude of names. In an 1837 issue of Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, Scottish physician and <b>zoologist</b> Andrew Smith listed without descriptions the new genus Poroderma, containing the species P.africanum (the pyjama shark), P.pantherinum, P.submaculatum, and P.variegatum. German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle assigned these sharks to the genus Scyllium, and in their 18381841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen furnished descriptions for S.pantherinum and S.variegatum, and listed two more names without description, S.leopardinum and S.maeandrinum. In 1934, American <b>zoologist</b> Henry Weed Fowler described P.marleyi, characterized by large black spots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Zoologists</b> {{working in}} the 19th century, {{including}} Georges Cuvier, Johannes Peter Müller, and Louis Agassiz admired Aristotle's biology and investigated some of his observations.

5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English <b>zoologist</b> Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, <b>zoologist</b> William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 the German <b>zoologist</b> Peter Simon Pallas {{formally}} {{described the}} bluebuck as Antilope leucophaeus. In 1853, the Dutch <b>zoologist</b> Coenraad Jacob Temminck {{stated that the}} type specimen was an adult male skin now in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (formerly Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie), collected in Swellendam and present in Haarlem before 1776. It has been questioned whether this was actually the type specimen, but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis selected it as the lectotype of a syntype series, as Pallas may have based his description on multiple specimens.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, the British <b>zoologist</b> John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This {{classification}} was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French <b>zoologist</b> Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E
