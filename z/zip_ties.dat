5000|$|Manipulations to {{currently}} used walking aidsSimple manipulations to walking aids {{that are already}} {{being used by the}} individual {{have been shown to be}} extremely effective, but do not result in tripping incidents as the obstacles described above. Three examples include inverting a walking cane, adding <b>zip</b> <b>ties</b> to a walker, having a tennis ball swing from a cane. Inverting a walking cane creates a simple u-shaped curve on the ground that the individual can focus on stepping over. The <b>zip</b> <b>ties</b> have the same effect. Brightly colored <b>zip</b> <b>ties</b> create the most contrast and act as a guide when an individual is walking. With <b>zip</b> <b>ties,</b> they are large enough to be effective, but not strong enough to trip an individual; if they cannot step over tem completely, the <b>zip</b> <b>ties</b> are able to easily bend with their walking. The final method is having a tennis ball swing from a cane. The individual can focus on kicking the ball with each step and overcome many cases of FOG.|$|E

50|$|A {{cable tie}} (also {{known as a}} hose tie, steggel tie, zap strap or <b>zip</b> <b>tie,</b> and by the brand names Ty-Rap and Panduit strap) {{is a type of}} fastener, for holding items together, {{primarily}} electrical cables or wires.

25|$|A cable tie, {{also known}} as a <b>zip</b> <b>tie</b> or tie-wrap, is a type of fastener, {{especially}} for binding several electronic cables or wires together and to organize cables and wires. They have also been commonly used as makeshift handcuffs, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and in Panama. The cable tie, originally known as the Ty-Rap, was invented in 1958 by Maurus C. Logan, who worked for many years at Thomas & Betts. Logan filed U.S. patent #3,022,557 on June 24, 1958 which was issued to him on February 27, 1962.|$|R

5000|$|The event's [...] "weapons policy" [...] {{may offer}} {{objective}} criteria {{to determine what}} looks like a weapon. For example, a weapons policy may require a peace-bond for anything that a reasonable person might recognize as a weapon from a short distance in dim light. Real weapons, if allowed, are disabled, secured, and marked. For example, bright orange <b>zip</b> <b>ties</b> may be used to hold a sword in a scabbard or to hold a pistol in a holster. Simulated or costume props may require conspicuous marks, such as bright ribbons or <b>zip</b> <b>ties,</b> to show that security has deemed them safe to be carried.

50|$|For safety, it {{is common}} to mouse a {{threaded}} shackle to keep the pin from coming loose. This is done by looping mousing wire or a nylon <b>zip</b> <b>tie</b> {{through the hole in the}} pin and around the shackle body. For pins that have a cross-hole in the threaded end a cotter pin can be used. One disadvantage of wire is that mousing can introduce galvanic corrosion because of material differences; it is especially bad when used in places where the shackle is exposed to air and water. Nylon is not recommended for use where significant movement of the shackle is expected.|$|R

50|$|Flexible duct is very {{convenient}} for attaching supply air outlets to the rigid ductwork. It is commonly attached with long <b>zip</b> <b>ties</b> or metal band claps.

Some flexible duct markets prefer to avoid using flexible duct on the return air portions of HVAC systems, however flexible duct can tolerate moderate s.

5000|$|Failure is 'LIKE' Success...: An ongoing theme {{within the}} show is the continual failure and {{subsequent}} challenges of the episode's project, a vehicle often modified on a tight budget and frequently 'enhanced' with second-hand or re-purposed parts.

50|$|Mousing (pronounced mouzing) is the {{application}} of a molly or safety wire, called mousing wire in this use, to secure a threaded clevis pin to a shackle. This is done by passing a couple of turns of mousing wire through the reach-hole provided for this purpose in the unthreaded end of the clevis pin and around the body of the shackle's hoop. Alternatively, some threaded shackles are provided with a hole through the threaded end of the pin beyond where it emerges from the threaded hole. A cotter pin or a couple of loops of mousing wire through this hole serves the same purpose and secures the shackle in a closed position. Nylon <b>zip</b> <b>ties</b> are also commonly used in applications where the shackle must be secured, but easy removal is required.|$|E
