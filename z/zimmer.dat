5|$|On July 20, 2013, Webb {{announced}} that Hans <b>Zimmer</b> would be composing {{the music for}} the film, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. On October 25, 2013, Pharrell Williams revealed to Billboard that he would co-compose the score with <b>Zimmer.</b> Webb and <b>Zimmer</b> formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and former Eurythmic, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart {{did not participate in}} the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (a reference to the Sinister Six) was composed of Williams, Marr, Einziger, Junkie XL, Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski assisting <b>Zimmer.</b> The soundtrack for the film was released on April 22, 2014 by Columbia Records and Madison Gate Records. Hans <b>Zimmer</b> described his work for this film as different from previous works by him, thus revealing one of the themes for the film, which was first heard on the website.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their appearance in the film, Green Day recorded {{its own version of}} the Simpsons theme, and released it as a single. <b>Zimmer</b> turned the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which was a joke he never intended to be put into the film. <b>Zimmer</b> also had to write foreign-language lyrics for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. He found translating the song into Spanish the hardest to write. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs.|$|E

Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia <b>Zimmer</b> (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison.

5000|$|Gregory Ellwood of HitFix {{called it}} [...] "one of Hans <b>Zimmer’s</b> more moving scores in some time" [...] Brad Brevet of Rope of Silicon also praised the score in stating, [...] "The best score {{in a movie}} I have heard {{this year has been}} Hans <b>Zimmer's</b> for 12 Years a Slave."

[...] Mark Hughes of Forbes hails the piece as [...] "some of <b>Zimmer's</b> best work to date, which says quite a lot" [...] and further expands by expressing [...] "I love the way he uses nontraditional effects and sounds, sometimes going bare-bones and simple with a single instrument, so often understated to perfection." ...|$|R

5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times {{that he did not}} take the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl <b>Zimmer</b> found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans.

However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E

As in the Iliad, Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a sufferer of insanity.|$|E
