5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a <b>zebra</b> <b>crossing,</b> was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a step-ladder and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Howard Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted, and {{produced}} the trilogy's music. He {{was hired in}} August 2000 and visited the set, and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures, and places - the largest catalogue of leitmotives {{in the history of}} cinema, surpassing - for comparison - that of the entire Star Wars saga. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve. As a Beatles fan, Jackson had a photo tribute done there on the <b>zebra</b> <b>crossing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later did, as he had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road <b>zebra</b> <b>crossing</b> shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The type of {{pedestrians}} {{crossing facility}} provided for employees {{along the street}} Ungaran - Bawen hasn’t been same and its use isnot efficient since there are still any cases appeared either for the pedestrians crossing the street or traffic flow generally. The aim {{of the study is}} to evaluate the work of pedestrians crossing facility, that is <b>zebra</b> <b>cross</b> from the side of analysis on critical gap for finding out the opportunity in cossing the street safety and donot disturb the passing vehicles. This analisys method of critical gap is used for searching the minimum gap among vehicle passing through location in order that the pedestrian crossing the street may cross safety. Primary data taking is carried out throung field survey using handycam for watching the conflict point and time gap between vehicles passing throung the street and pefestrian who cross the street to the conflict point. From the data analisys result, the writer obtains that critical gap in study location is 2, 62 second and the opportunity degree for crossing the street safety is only 11 persons on 6. 30 to 7. 30 WIB and 7. 30 to 8. 30 as much as 29 persons. Thus, we may conclude that pedestrian <b>crossing</b> facility, namely <b>zebra</b> <b>cross</b> is not effective and for the further is that pedestrian crossing should not be in the same field.

50|$|J-Rocks {{made their}} mark {{as the first}} Indonesian band to have {{recorded}} at the world-famous Abbey Road studios in the United Kingdom. The recording and mixing process were performed during the five days from 12-16 October 2008. At Abbey Road studios, they were helped by Chris Butler, a renowned sound engineer. The result was their EP album, Road to Abbey, which contained 5 songs, released in 2009. The album cover's image portrayed band members <b>crossing</b> Abbey Road's <b>zebra</b> <b>cross,</b> imitating the style of The Beatles in the 1969 album, Abbey Road.|$|R

To the left of the picture, parked next to the <b>zebra</b> <b>crossing,</b> is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right of the picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E

It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a <b>zebra</b> <b>crossing.</b> A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form, sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London's City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.|$|E
5|$|With rain {{shortly before}} the race, the start was taken behind the safety car, forcing all drivers to start the race on the full wet tyres. As Ricciardo led the field behind the safety car, Daniil Kvyat had {{to come into the}} pit lane on lap two, {{complaining}} of technical issues. He rejoined with a new steering wheel, being a lap down {{on the rest of the}} pack already. The race started in earnest on lap seven, with Ricciardo defending his lead at the restart. Kevin Magnussen made a pit stop for intermediate tyres at the end of the lap, but his teammate Jolyon Palmer proved just how slippery it still was when he crashed out just a lap later, being caught out by a wet <b>zebra</b> <b>crossing</b> and causing a virtual safety car period. More cars came into the pitlane for intermediate tyres over the following laps. On lap twelve, Kimi Räikkönen damaged his front wing on the guardrail at the Loews hairpin, resulting in his front wing getting caught under his front tyres, blocking Grosjean's way in the process. Räikkönen retired some corners later. Meanwhile, Ricciardo built a gap at the front, being ten seconds clear of Rosberg on lap 13. One lap later, Sebastian Vettel was the first of the front runners to change to intermediate tyres. Mercedes issued team orders demanding Rosberg let Hamilton past on lap 16, but the gap had by then grown to 13 seconds.|$|E

From some discussion can be summarized that according to the study analyzes the volume of pedestrian andvehicle volumes obtained by the recommended pedestrian facilities according to standard determination of thecrossing facility is the type of pelican crossing with a separator. Based on the analysis of waiting time to crossthe street, 93 % require pedestrian waiting time, with the average waiting time to cross and the total time tocross at that location, which is 56. 61 seconds and 79. 25 seconds. The condition is very far from the pedestrianshould not waiting more than 30 seconds. Results of analysis of critical gaps, both based on the critical gap only in the morning or combined critical gapin the morning and afternoon shows very little chance of crossing the road owned by the defector, on themorning of 7 times for critical gap in only the morning and 11 times for a combination of critical gap Total 125 waders for 06. 30 until 7 : 30 pm, and 20 times based on a critical gap only in the morning a and 29 times forcritical gap combination of pedestrian total of 66 people over at 07. 30 until 08 : 30 pm.

All three animals belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. However, recent phylogenetic evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras.
