5|$|The former {{popularity}} of the Barbary lion as a <b>zoo</b> <b>animal</b> has meant that scattered lions in captivity {{are likely to be}} descended from Barbary lion stock. This includes lions at Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Kent, England that are descended from animals owned by the King of Morocco. Another eleven animals believed to be Barbary lions were found in Addis Ababa zoo, descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International, in collaboration with Oxford University, launched their ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the prevalence of pathogenic zoonotic agents (flaviviruses, avian influenza viruses (AIVs), Salmonella spp. and Toxoplasma gondii) in feral pigeons and sympatric <b>zoo</b> <b>animals</b> from Cordoba (Southern Spain) between 2013 and 2014. Antibodies against flaviviruses were detected in 7. 8 % out of 142 (CI 95 %: 3. 7 - 11. 8) pigeons, and 8. 2 % of 49 (CI 95 %: 0. 9 - 15. 4) of <b>zoo</b> <b>animals</b> tested. Antibodies with specificity against West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) were confirmed both in pigeons and in zoo birds. Even though seropositivity to AIVs was not detected {{in any of the}} analyzed pigeons, 17. 9 % of 28 (CI 95 %: 3. 7 - 32. 0) zoo birds tested showed positive results. Salmonella spp. was not isolated in any of 152 fecal samples collected from pigeons, while 6. 8 % of 44 <b>zoo</b> <b>animals</b> were positive. Antibodies against T. gondii were found in 9. 2 % of 142 (CI 95 %: 4. 8 - 13. 6) feral pigeons and 26. 9 % of 108 (CI 95 %: 19. 6 - 34. 1) <b>zoo</b> <b>animals.</b> This is the first study on flaviviruses and T. gondii in feral pigeons and captive zoo species in Spain. Antibodies against WNV and USUV detected in non-migratory pigeons and captive <b>zoo</b> <b>animals</b> indicate local circulation of these emerging pathogens in the study area. T. gondii was widespread in species analyzed. This finding could be of importance for Public Health and Conservation of endangered species present in zoo parks.
