The Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations {{are part of the}} continuing effort to establish a global radio reference frame of about 400 compact, flat spectrum sources, which are evenly distributed across the sky. The observations were made using Mark III data format in four separate sessions in 1988 - 89 with radio telescopes at Tidbinbilla, Australia, Kauai, USA, and Kashima, Japan. We observed a total of 54 sources, including ten calibrators and three which were undetected. The 32 new source positions bring the total number in the radio reference frame catalog to 319 (172 northern and 147 southern) and fill in the zone - 25 deg greater than delta greater than - 45 deg which, prior to this list, had the lowest source density. The VLBI positions have an average formal precision of less than 1 mas, although unknown radio structure effects of about 1 - 2 mas may be present. The six new optical postion measurements are part of the program to obtain positions of the optical counterparts of the radio reference frame source and to map accurately the optical on to the radio reference frames.

A preliminary map of the sky derived from DIRBE data is presented. Initial cosmological implications include: a limit on the comptonization parameter of 0. 001, on the chemical potential parameter of 0. 01, a strong limit {{on the existence of}} a hot smooth intergalactic medium, and a confirmation that the dipole anisotropy has the spectrum expected from a Doppler shift of a blackbody. There are no significant anisotropies in the microwave sky detected, other than from our own galaxy and a cos theta dipole anisotropy whose amplitude and direction agree with previous data. At shorter wavelengths, the sky spectrum and anisotropies are dominated by emission from local sources of emission within our Galaxy and Solar System.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{spectroscopy}} based Stellar Color Regression (SCR) method to perform accurate color calibration for modern imaging surveys, {{taking advantage of}} millions of stellar spectra now available. The method is straightforward, insensitive to systematic errors in the spectroscopically determined stellar atmospheric parameters, applicable to regions that are effectively covered by spectroscopic surveys, and capable of delivering an accuracy of a few millimagnitudes for color calibration. As an illustration, we have applied the method to the SDSS Stripe 82 data (Ivezic et al; I 07 hereafter). With a total number of 23, 759 spectroscopically targeted stars, we have mapped out the small but strongly correlated color <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> <b>errors</b> present in the photometric catalog of Stripe 82, and improve the color calibration {{by a factor of}} 2 [...] 3.

Our results are compared with those from a completely independent test based on the intrinsic colors of red galaxies presented by I 07. The comparison as well as other tests shows that the SCR method has achieved a color calibration internally consistent at a level of about 5 mmag in u-g, 3 mmag in g-r, and 2 mmag in r-i and i-z, respectively. Given the power of the SCR method, we discuss briefly the potential benefits by applying the method to existing, on-going, and up-coming imaging surveys.

However, correlation line does not intercept <b>zero</b> <b>point,</b> which does not have realistic explanation. Slope of the correlation line is 0.068  F/g which {{is less than the}} calculated Cs of any presented samples at that discharge current density (see Table  4). However, taking into account textural features of the carbons, samples can be divided into two groups in compliance with their pore structure. Such separation gives more reasonable results. Inside each group, correlation line intercepts <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> within experimental <b>error</b> and slope corresponds to the average values of the surface capacitance (see Table  4; Fig.  6 b). Such observation is correct through the all examined current density range.

Higher surface capacitance of the samples in the sequence C 540 –C 1400 can be explained by wider pore size distribution resulting in more surface accessibility. Changes in the pore structure and porosity increase for samples C 2230, C 2700 and C 3060 lead to restriction of surface availability for electrolyte ions and consequently to decrease in value of the surface capacitance.|$|R

50|$|More recently, {{compensatory}} tracking tasks {{has been}} used to gauge alertness. This is done using a computer monitor and a simulation controlled by a mouse or trackball. Participants use the mouse to keep the indicator within a target which acts as the <b>zero</b> <b>point.</b> Time within the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> and distance from the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> are once again measured. Notable versions of the compensatory tracking task are COMPTRACK, and the PEBL compensatory tracking task.|$|R
50|$|Because virtual {{particles}} are physical {{representations of the}} <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> energy of physical vacuum, the Casimir pressure is {{the difference in the}} density of the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> energy of empty space inside and outside of cavity made by conductive plates.|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> electromagnetic field in the dark is a trivial property of classical electromagnetism. Splitting the total, genuine electromagnetic field into the sum of a conventional field and a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field is physically meaningless. If a receiver attenuates the genuine field down to a zero conventional field, it remains a <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field having the coherence and the phase of the conventional field, and vice-versa for the amplification of the <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field by a source. Nonlinear optical effects must be written using the genuine field, so that at low light levels they become linear {{in relation to the}} conventional field. The result of the interpretation of all observations, even at low light levels, is exactly the same in quantum electrodynamics and in the semi-classical theory. The <b>zero</b> <b>point</b> field is stochastic only far from the sources and the receivers; elsewhere, it is shaped by matter, it may be studied throug...|$|R
