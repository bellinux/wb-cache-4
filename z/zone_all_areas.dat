The input data is the coordinate and depth and the output data is the soil classification and soil parameters.

50|$|Because of {{the various}} time zones in Canada, only viewers in the provinces and territories east of Manitoba see the show live (in the Newfoundland, Atlantic and Eastern time <b>zones).</b> <b>All</b> other <b>areas</b> in Canada are taped {{and even though the}} show does mention the show is live, it is not. All Citytv {{stations}} air the show at 8:00 pm (in each time zone where there is a CityTV station) with the Toronto station being the first CityTV station to reach 8:00 pm. So viewers in Newfoundland see the show live at 9:30 pm and viewers in the Atlantic at 9:00 pm because there is no CityTV station in these provinces to broadcast the show at local time. The same process occurs with the results show. Also, the semi-finals are filmed at Showline Studios in Toronto.|$|R

5000|$|Berra was {{excellent}} at hitting pitches {{outside of the}} strike <b>zone,</b> covering <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> of the strike zone (as well as beyond) with great extension. In addition to this wide plate coverage, he also had great bat control. He was able both to swing the bat like a golf club to hit low pitches for deep home runs and to chop at high pitches for line drives. Whether changing speeds or location, pitcher Early Wynn soon discovered that [...] "Berra moves right with you." [...] Five times, Berra had more home runs than strikeouts in a season, striking out just twelve times in 597 at-bats in 1950. The combination of bat control and plate coverage made Berra a feared [...] "clutch hitter", proclaimed by rival manager Paul Richards [...] "the toughest man {{in the league in}} the last three innings". Contrasting him with teammate Mickey Mantle, Wynn declared Berra [...] "the real toughest clutch hitter", grouping him with Cleveland slugger Al Rosen as [...] "the two best clutch hitters in the game".|$|R

40|$|The {{island of}} Bonaire is an {{isolated}} carbonate platform that is formed of Miocene to modern carbonate successions overlying a Cretaceous igneous basement. We {{show that the}} igneous basement of the island of Bonaire, Netherland Antilles controls the seafloor topography and subsequently governs the location {{of most of the}} carbonate deposits especially the Holocene coral reef and the downslope transport of sediment. Our analysis from this combined sedimentary study focuses on: 1) identifying the source of the islands main sediment supply, where sediment is derived from and quantifying the sediment budget; 2) evaluating the main sediment transport mechanisms throughout the system and indicating the most influential factor; 3) assessing sediment transport from the coast to the basin by identifying sediment pathways and their morphology; and 4) locating sediment accumulation <b>zones</b> in <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> of the offshore environment. To archive our objectives, we acquired ~ 172 km of 2 D multichannel seismic reflection profiles on the western side of Bonaire to evaluate the marine environment off the coast of this isolated carbonate platform. By the integration of previous studies, both geological and geophysical, in addition to an assessment of Quaternary marine sedimentary processes within the system, we focus on the slope processes including sediment production and distribution. Production from both terrigenous and marine sources as well as transport mechanisms including mass transport and gravity driven downslope movement are studied. This study highlights the importance of understanding the morphology of the antecedent substrate on which a carbonate environment is produced and how the climate and environment of Bonaire play a large role in sediment transport throughout our local system. The sediment processes observed in our study reveal contributing factors to the persistent carbonate production offshore Bonaire throughout the Quaternary and provide a modern analogue for other isolated carbonate platforms...|$|R
30|$|The {{calculated}} {{electrical conductivity}} profiles for any h are almost identical between the four different representative ages, because the thermal structure is almost identical {{in the range}} of ages compared here. However, the results for different values of h showed significantly different conductivity profiles. The inversion profile for Area A falls between the simulated profiles for h of 80 and 100  km. For Area B, the inversion profile is in between the profiles for h of 100 and 125  km. For Area D, it mostly corresponds to the simulated profiles for h of 200 and 300  km, which are almost the same. The resistive layer for Area C is much thicker than the simulated profile for h of 300  km, which suggests that it is more consistent with a cooling half space rather than a cooling plate, as discussed in previous studies (Baba et al. 2010, 2013 a). This result suggests that the transition from the resistive to high-conductivity zones is mainly controlled by h. It is impossible to represent the 1 -D profiles for <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> by a thermal model with a single value of h. In other words, {{it is likely that the}} thickness of the cool thermal lithosphere differs between these areas. If the appropriate values of h are chosen, the simulated profiles with the same value of potential temperature fit the high-conductivity <b>zone</b> well for <b>all</b> <b>areas,</b> although the inversion profile for Area B is slightly higher than the simulated profile at depths between 150 and 200  km. This observation suggests that the asthenospheric mantle in this region is rather homogeneous in potential temperature and chemical composition, except for Area B.|$|R

30|$|Because our {{methodology}} {{is focused}} on structurally controlled geothermal systems, we assume that <b>all</b> fault <b>zones</b> in the 3 D geologic map {{have the potential to}} act as fluid upwelling <b>zones</b> and that <b>all</b> <b>areas</b> outside of fault zones have no potential to act as fluid upwelling zones. Both of these assumptions are inherently flawed. Many geologic formations can have abundant matrix or fracture permeability and may serve as stratigraphic reservoirs. Additionally, fluid upwelling in geothermal fields is generally spatially discrete (e.g., Caine et al. 1996, 2010; Caine and Forster 1999; Fairley et al. 2003; Fairley and Hinds 2004; Mitchell and Faulkner 2012; Meller and Kohl 2014), which means that most segments along faults are impermeable to upflow. This may be a function of the generation of clay gouge during faulting or hydrothermal mineralization, both of which can seal faults. However, in the structurally controlled geothermal systems evaluated here, the most prominent geothermal upwellings occur along fault zones (e.g., Richards and Blackwell 2002). By assuming that only faults conduct fluid upwelling and that the whole fault system has the potential to host upflow, we can evaluate which geologic factors are most highly coincident with known upwelling zones. The calculated potential for upwelling within each fault segment can be enhanced relative to other fault segments by any or all of the three following proxies for permeability: (1) the stress state of the fault, (2) location of that fault relative to structural discontinuities, and (3) host rock lithology.|$|R
