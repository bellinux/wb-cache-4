25|$|In {{the case}} of {{acceleration}} in a fixed direction, and starting from <b>zero</b> <b>speed,</b> {{and in the absence}} of other forces, this is 54.4% more than just the final kinetic energy of the payload. In this optimal case the initial mass is 4.92 times the final mass.|$|E
25|$|Motor speed can {{be changed}} because the torque curve of the motor is {{effectively}} modified {{by the amount of}} resistance connected to the rotor circuit. Increasing the value of resistance will move the speed of maximum torque down. If the resistance connected to the rotor is increased beyond the point where the maximum torque occurs at <b>zero</b> <b>speed,</b> the torque will be further reduced.|$|E

25|$|The WRIM is used {{primarily}} {{to start a}} high inertia load or a load that requires a very high starting torque across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from <b>zero</b> <b>speed</b> to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.|$|E
25|$|This {{corresponds}} to the kinetic energy the expelled reaction mass would have at a speed equal to the exhaust speed. If the reaction mass had to be accelerated from <b>zero</b> <b>speed</b> to the exhaust speed, all energy produced {{would go into the}} reaction mass and nothing would be left for kinetic energy gain by the rocket and payload. However, if the rocket already moves and accelerates (the reaction mass is expelled in the direction opposite to the direction in which the rocket moves) less kinetic energy is added to the reaction mass. To see this, if, for example, =10km/s and the speed of the rocket is 3km/s, then the speed of a small amount of expended reaction mass changes from 3km/s forwards to 7km/s rearwards. Thus, although the energy required is 50 MJ per kg reaction mass, only 20 MJ is used for the increase in speed of the reaction mass. The remaining 30 MJ is the increase of the kinetic energy of the rocket and payload.|$|E
25|$|To attain such speeds, Lockheed Martin {{has been}} collaborating with Aerojet Rocketdyne since 2006 on an {{appropriate}} engine. The company is developing the system from the scramjet-powered HTV-3X, which was canceled in 2008. The SR-72 is envisioned with an air-breathing hypersonic propulsion system that {{has the ability to}} accelerate from standstill to Mach6.0 using the same engine, making it about twice as fast as the SR-71. The challenge is to design an engine to encompass the flight regimes of subsonic, supersonic and hypersonic speeds. Using turbine compression, turbojet engines can work at <b>zero</b> <b>speed</b> and usually perform best up to Mach 2.2. Ramjets, using aerodynamic compression with subsonic combustion, perform poorly under Mach 0.5 and are most efficient around Mach 3, being able to go up to around Mach 6. The SR-71's specially designed engines converted to low-speed ramjets by redirecting the airflow around the core and into the afterburner for speeds greater than Mach 2.5. Finally, scramjets with supersonic combustion cover the range of high supersonic to hypersonic speeds. The SR-72 is to use a turbine-based combined cycle (TBCC) system to use a turbine engine at low speeds and a scramjet engine at high speeds. The turbine and ramjet engines share common inlet and nozzle, with different airflow paths in between.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel hybrid sensorless control {{strategy}} for Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) drives applied to Electric Vehicles (EV) is presented. This sensorless strategy covers the EV full speed range {{and also has}} speed reversal capability. It combines a High Frequency Injection (HFI) technique for low and <b>zero</b> <b>speeds,</b> and a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for the medium and high speed regions. A solution to achieve smooth transitions between the PLL and the HFI strategies is also proposed, allowing to correctly detect the rotor position polarity when HFI takes part. Wide speed and torque four-quadrant simulation results are provided, which validate the proposed sensorless strategy for being further implemented in EV.
