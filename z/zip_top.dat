Lilbourne Lad got the best of a five-way blanket finish for second place ahead of Reply, Balty Boys, Caspar Netscher and Saigon.

[...] Aidan O'Brien said [...] "He ran a lovely race here the last day when he didn't get home over seven furlongs, but he won his maiden very easy at the Curragh. We weren't sure if it was the trip or if he got a little bit tired last time but he took a step forward today." ...|$|E
