40|$|At the LHC, {{a generic}} supersymmetric cascade {{can be a}} source of top quark. Specifically third {{generation}} squarks and gluino are the major sources of top quark which could also be boosted. In this article, we have shown that jet substructure algorithm can be very useful in identifying such boosted top quarks in the cascade. We take inclusive three jets <b>plus</b> <b>zero</b> lepton <b>plus</b> missing energy final state and try to reconstruct at least one hadronically decaying top quark by using top tagging techniques which has good prospect at the LHC.
