Both micro-suction cups removed most microorganisms by filtration, though the PES cups were more effective in this respect. This filtering by the suction cups allowed for relatively accurate analysis of citrate in solutions containing microorganisms.

Cancer {{metabolism}} has emerged as a contemporary topic of great interest for improved mechanistic understanding of tumorigenesis. Prostate cancer is a disease model of great interest from a metabolic perspective. Prostatic tissue exhibits unique metabolic activity under baseline conditions. Benign prostate cells accumulate zinc, and this excess <b>zinc</b> inhibits <b>citrate</b> oxidation and metabolism within the citric acid cycle, effectively resulting in citrate production. Malignant cells, however, actively oxidize citrate and resume more typical citric acid cycle function. Of further interest, prostate cancer does not exhibit the Warburg effect, an increase in glucose uptake, seen in many other cancers. These cellular metabolic differences and others are of clinical interest as they present a variety of potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, understanding of the metabolic profile differences between benign prostate versus low- and high-grade prostate cancers also represents an avenue to better understand cancer progression and potentially develop new diagnostic testing.

40|$|Purpose - To {{develop a}} new {{corrosion}} inhibitor formulation for carbon steel in low chloride environments. Designlmethodology/approach - Corrosion inhibition efficiencies were evaluated by the weight loss method and by impedance measurement studies. The nature of the inhibition process was evaluated using potentiostatic polarization studies. The nature of the protective film was investigated using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The concept of synergistic effect {{was used in the}} development of the new synergistic inhibitor formulation. Findings - A new corrosion inhibitor formulation, containing tertiary butyl phosphonate (TBP), <b>zinc</b> ions and <b>citrate,</b> has been developed to control the corrosion of carbon steel in low chloride environments. This inhibitor formulation was found to offer a maximum inhibition efficiency of 96 per cent in a neutral pH test environment. It was interesting to observe that the binary system, consisting of higher concentrations of the TBP and zinc ions, offered only 79 per cent inhibition efficiency. The ternary system, consisting of relatively lower concentrations of the phosphonate, <b>zinc</b> ions and <b>citrate</b> offered a higher (96 per cent) efficiency. This ternary inhibitor system also was found to be efficient in acidic as well as basic environments in the pH range 5 - 8. The inhibitor combination was determined to function as a "mixed 8 '-type inhibitor, though being predominantly cathodic. A plausible explanation of the mechanism of corrosion inhibition is proposed. Practical implications - The ternary inhibitor formulations based on phosphonate, zinc ions and another environmentally friendly synergists like citrate will be quite useful for corrosion inhibition of carbon steel in cooling water systems as they contain relatively less concentrations of phosphonate and zinc ions.

Iron, copper, cysteine, ascorbic acid, and versene counteracted the lethal effects of alpha toxin in mice, while magnesium, manganese, <b>zinc,</b> and <b>citrate</b> did not. Iron also counteracted the lethal effects of diphtheria toxin in guinea pigs. After incubation of endotoxin with iron, its lethal effects and tissue-necrotizing actions in rabbits were counteracted. However, the pyrogenic properties of the toxin were not affected. The solubilities of perfringens alpha toxin and diphtheria toxin were markedly reduced after incubation with detoxifying metals, and resolubilization of these toxins with chelators resulted in partial restoration of toxicity. Addition of versene to detoxified endotoxin also resulted in partial recovery of lethal effectiveness. The inactivation of bacterial toxins by iron under in vitro conditions is not specific to this metal, is a reversible process, and {{may be due to}} desolubilization, reduction, or to competition by the metal for sites on the toxin normally bound by other cations in vivo.

After remineralization, all lesions were demineralized for 1 day under identical conditions. Changes in mineral distribution characteristics of caries lesions after remineralization and secondary demineralization were studied using transverse microradiography. At 1. 1 µmol/l fluoride, zinc exhibited detrimental effects on remineralization in a dose-response manner and mainly by preventing remineralization near the lesion surface. At 52. 6 µmol/l fluoride, zinc retarded remineralization only at the highest concentration tested. Zinc enhanced overall remineralization at 3. 8 – 15. 3 µmol/l. At 76. 5 and less so at 153 µmol/l, zinc showed extensive remineralization of deeper parts within the lesions at the expense of remineralization near the surface. Citrate did not interfere with remineralization at 1. 1 µmol/l fluoride, but enhanced remineralization at 52. 6 µmol/l fluoride. Lesions exhibiting preferential remineralization in deeper parts showed higher mineral loss after secondary demineralization, suggesting the formation of more soluble mineral phases during remineralization.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an investigation, by computer simulation, {{into the nature}} of the metal ion binding to low molecular weight ligands in blood plasma. A successful attempt is made to accommodate the effects of metal protein binding on the computed distribution that is obtained. An evaluation of the results is undertaken. The value and some applications of the knowledge arising from this kind of study are examined. The collection, assembly and processing of the data is described. A computer program is written to cope with the very large equilibrium systems that are simulated. The experimentally determined values for the formation constants of the metal ion ligand complexing reactions in the biofluid are found in the literature. These are corrected whenever they are not applicable to physiological conditions of temperature and ionic strength. Where no experimental values were available, formation constants for complexes that seemed likely to be important were estimated using certain types of chemical trend. The results of the blood plasma model may be summarized as follows. Copper and ferric iron are found to exist exclusively as ternary complexes except that the copper dihistidinato complex is important. With copper, these ternary complexes always involve histidine whilst citrate plays an analogous role in the ferric complex formation. Calcium, magnesium and manganese do not appear to exist as ternary complexes. With these three cations the bicarbonate species predominate although the binding is weak; {{as a consequence of the}} relatively high ligand concentration in plasma. Zinc and lead form both binary and ternary complexes. The ternary <b>zinc</b> cysteinate <b>citrate</b> complex is found to account for a significant percentage of the low molecular weight complex fraction of this metal.

40|$|Human semen has the {{potential}} to modulate the epithelial mucosal tissues it contacts, as seminal plasma (SP) is recognized to contain both pro- and anti-barrier components, yet its effects on epithelial barrier function are largely unknown. We addressed the role of human SP when exposed to the basal-lateral epithelial surface, a situation that would occur clinically with prior mechanical or disease-related injury of the human epithelial mucosal cell layers in contact with semen. The action of SP on claudins- 2, - 4, - 5, and - 7 expression, as well as on a target epithelium whose basolateral surface has been made accessible to SP, showed upregulation of claudins- 4 and - 5 in CACO- 2 human epithelial cell layers, despite broad variance in SP-induced modulation of transepithelial electrical resistance and mannitol permeability. Upregulation of claudin- 2 by SP also exhibited such variance by SP sample. We characterize individual effects on CACO- 2 barrier function of nine factors known to be present abundantly in seminal plasma (<b>zinc,</b> EGF, <b>citrate,</b> spermine, fructose, urea, TGF, histone, inflammatory cytokines) to establish that zinc, spermine and fructose had significant potential to raise CACO- 2 transepithelial resistance, whereas inflammatory cytokines and EGF decreased this measure of barrier function. The role of zinc as a dominant factor in determining higher levels of transepithelial resistance and lower levels of paracellular leak were confirmed by zinc chelation and exogenous zinc addition. As expected, SP presentation to the basolateral cell surface also caused a very dramatic yet transient elevation of pErk levels. Results suggest that increased zinc content in SP can compete against the barrier-compromising effect of negative modulators in SP when SP gains access to that epithelium's basolateral surface. Prophylactic elevation of zinc in an epithelial cell layer prior to contact by SP may help to protect an epithelial barrier from invasion by SP-containing STD microbial pathogens such as HPV or HIV...|$|R

The effect of addition of citrate to the binary system, BPMG-Zn 2 +, is quite significant and is well explored through various studies. The surface protective nature is maintained in the pH range 5 - 9. Potentiodynamic polarization studies inferred that the ternary inhibitor {{is a mixed}} inhibitor. Impedance studies of the metal/solution interface indi cated that the surface film is highly protective against the corrosion of carbon steel in the chosen environment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis of the surface film showed {{the presence of the}} elements namely iron, phos phorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen and zinc. Deconvolution spectra of these elements in the surface film inferred the presence of oxides/hydroxides of iron(III), Zn(OH) 2 and [Fe(III), Zn(II) -BPMG-citrate] heteropolynuclear multiligand complex. This inference is further supported by the reflection absorption Fourier transform infrared spectrum of the surface film. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is presented for both the corroded and protected metal surfaces. Based on all these results, a plausible mechanism of corrosion inhibition is proposed. </span...|$|R
40|$|Adduct of {{mononuclear}} and dinuclear <b>citrate</b> <b>zinc</b> complex [Zn(Hcit) (phen) (H 2 O) ][Zn- 2 (Hcit) (phen) (2) (H 2 O) (3) }center dot 13. 5 H(2) O (1) and its aggregate [Zn- 3 (Hcit) (2) (phen) (4) ](n) center dot 14 nH(2) O (2) (H(4) Cit = citric acid, phen = 1, 10 -phenanthroline) were synthesized in weak acidic solutions. The former {{was obtained}} from the reaction of zinc nitrate, citric acid and phenanthroline in a molar ratio of 3 : 23, while a slightly excess of phenanthroline results {{in the formation of the}} polymeric product 2 in a molar ratio of 3 : 2 : 4 Transformation of 1 to 2 was finished by the reaction of 1 with an equimolar of phenanthroline in 72 % yield. Reverse conversion of 2 to I is obtained in 77 % yield, showing an equilibrium between 1 and 2. Neutral compound I consists of one monomeric anionic unit [Zn(Hcit) (phen) (H 2 O) ](-) and one dimeric cationic unit [Zn- 2 (Hcit) (phen) (2) (H 2 O) (3) ](+) that connect each other by strong hydrogen bonds [O 6 center dot center dot center dot O 4 w 2. 636 (2); O 7 center dot center dot center dot O 3 w 2. 630 (3) angstrom]. In 2. the citrate ligand links each trinuclear unit [Zn- 3 (Hcit) (2) (phen) (4) ] to generate an infinite I D chain that extents into a 3 D supramolecular structure by intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds. Moreover, 1 and 2 exhibit strong fluorescence at room temperature. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Trough serum samples were obtained before the final dose {{on the morning of}} the ninth day followed by sampling at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 [*]hrs. Total serum genistein, after β-glucuronidase/sulfatase digestion, was measured by time-resolved fluorometric assay. Maximal time (Tmax), concentration (Cmax), half-life (T 1 / 2), and area under the curve (AUC) were determined for genistein in each formulation. Fosteum and the Squadrito study formulation were equivalent for genistein Tmax (2 [*]hrs), Cmax (0. 7 [*]μM), T 1 / 2 (18 ± 6. 9 [*]versus[*] 21 ± 4. 9 [*]hrs), and AUC (9221 ± 413 [*]versus[*] 9818 ± 1370 [*]ng·hr/mL). The OTC supplement’s synthetically derived genistein, however, showed altered Tmax (6 [*]hrs), Cmax (0. 57 [*]μM), T 1 / 2 (8. 3 ± 1. 9 [*]hrs), and AUC (6474 ± 287 [*]ng·hr/mL). Differences in uptake may be due to multiple ingredients in the OTC supplement which interfere with genistein absorption...|$|R
