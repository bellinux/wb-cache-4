40|$|This article {{develops}} a multi-factor econometric {{model of the}} term structure of interest-rate swap yields. The model accommodates the possibility of counterparty default, and any differences in the liquidities of the Treasury and Swap markets. By parameterizing a model of swap rates directly, the authors are able to compute model-based estimates of the defaultable zero-coupon bond rates implicit in the swap market without having to specify a priori the dependence of these rates on default hazard or recovery rates. The time series analysis of spreads between <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>swap</b> and treasury yields reveals that both credit and liquidity factors were important sources of variation in swap spreads over the past decade.

40|$|International audienceDue to {{the lack}} of {{reliable}} market information, building financial term-structures may be associated with a significant degree of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new term-structure interpolation method that extends classical spline techniques by additionally allowing for quantification of uncertainty. The proposed method is based on a generalization of kriging models with linear equality constraints (market-fit conditions) and shape-preserving conditions such as monotonicity or positivity (no-arbitrage conditions). We define the most likely curve and show how to build confidence bands. The Gaussian process covariance hyper-parameters under the construction constraints are estimated using cross-validation techniques. Based on observed market quotes at different dates, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method by building curves together with confidence intervals for term-structures of OIS discount rates, of <b>zero-coupon</b> <b>swaps</b> rates and of CDS implied default probabilities. We also show how to construct interest-rate surfaces or default probability surfaces by considering time (quotation dates) as an additional dimension...|$|R
40|$|In this chapter, {{we define}} the "inflation forward rates" based on {{arbitrage}} arguments {{and develop a}} dynamic model for the term structure of inflation forward rates. This new model {{can serve as a}} framework for specific noarbitrage models, including the popular practitioners' market model and all models based on "foreign currency analogy. " With our rebuilt market model, we can price inflation caplets, floorlets, and swaptions with the Black formula for displaced-diffusion processes, and thus can quote these derivatives using "implied Black's volatilities. " The rebuilt market model also serves as a proper platform for developing models to manage volatility smile risks. Through this chapter, we hope to correct two major flaws in existing models or with the current practices. First, a consumer price index has no volatility, so models based on the diffusion of the index are essentially wrong. Second, the differentiation of models based on <b>zero-coupon</b> inflation-indexed <b>swaps</b> and models based on year-on-year inflationindexed swaps is unnecessary, and the use of "convexity adjustment," a common practice to bridge models that are based on the two kinds of swaps, is redundant.

40|$|The <b>Zero-Coupon</b> Inflation Indexed <b>Swap</b> (ZCIIS) is a {{derivative}} contract through which inflation expectations on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are actively traded in the US. In this thesis we consider {{different ways to}} use {{the information from the}} ZCIIS market for modeling forward inflation in a risk-neutral framework. We choose to implement a model using a Monte Carlo methodology that simulates the evolution of the forward CPI ratio. We prefer this approach for its flexibility, ease of implementation, instant calibration to the ZCIIS market and intrinsic convexity adjustment on the inflation-linked payoff. Subsequently, we present a series of results we obtain when modeling a chain of consecutive CPI ratios for simulating the evolution of spot inflation. Furthermore, we use this for pricing inflation caplets and floorlets. Finally, we use the intuition gained from this exercise to analyse our results for pricing inflation caps...|$|R
