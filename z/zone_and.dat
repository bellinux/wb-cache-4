5|$|The {{radiative}} <b>zone</b> <b>and</b> the {{convective zone}} {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative <b>zone</b> <b>and</b> the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar dynamo) that a magnetic dynamo within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|A major {{geological}} {{structure in}} the region is the Northern Patagonian Batholith.

5|$|As a {{response}} to the poor reception and claims that the system could not handle the original game, Simon Thomley, who later assisted with the development of the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system.

5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly shallows towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic <b>Zone</b> <b>and</b> the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E

Due to the variation of these factors, not all wells {{could be a good}} choice for separate layer fracturing. Hence, it is necessary to study the fracture configuration under different geological circumstances so that the simulation results can provide theoretical guidance for selecting candidate wells.|$|R

The models {{are based on}} images of Jupiter in three methane bands and nearby continuum; radiative transfer calculations include multiple scattering and absorption from three aerosol layers. The model results include the transition in the upper-cloud altitude to 3 km lower altitude from the tropical zones to temperate <b>zones</b> <b>and</b> polar regions, a N/S asymmetry in cloud thickness in the tropical <b>and</b> temperature <b>zones,</b> <b>and</b> the presence of aerosols up to about 0. 3 bar in the Great Red Spot <b>and</b> Equatorial <b>Zone.</b> It is concluded that polarization data are sensitive to aerosols in and above the upper cloud layer but insensitive to deeper cloud structure...|$|R
