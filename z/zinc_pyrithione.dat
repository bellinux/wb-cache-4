5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E

40|$|Dandruff is {{a chronic}} {{condition}} of the scalp requiring vigilant treatment to ameliorate the symptoms of scaling and itching. Frequent shampooing is key to controlling these symptoms while contributing to the cosmetic appearance of the hair. The success of the treatment depends {{not only on the}} ability of the shampoo to control the dandruff but also on patient compliance engendered by the cosmetic attributes of the shampoo. This double-blind cross-over study enrolled 40 women with mild to moderate dandruff. Following a 1 -wk washout with an unmedicated basic cleansing shampoo, all subjects used each of the two study shampoos for 1 wk. Subjects preferred the 1 % <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc</b> conditioning shampoo over the 2 % ketoconazole shampoo by 75 % in terms of overall performance. The dermatologist investigator confirmed the subject preference by noting that hair-combing ease, hair smoothness, and hair frizz/flyaway were statistically significantly better in subjects who used the 1 % <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc</b> conditioning shampoo for 1 wk.

40|$|AbstractProtein kinase C was {{measured}} in the cytoskeletal fraction of lymphocytes, platelets and HL 60 cells, by specific binding of [3 H]phorbol dibutyrate and by immunoblotting with antibody to a consensus sequence in the regulatory domain of α-, β- and γ-isozymes of protein kinase C. Treatment of cells for 40 min {{with a combination of}} zinc (2 – 50 μM), <b>zinc</b> ionophore <b>pyrithione</b> and unlabelled phorbol dibutyrate (200 nM) caused up to a ten-fold increase in cytoskeletal protein kinase C and a corresponding decrease in other cellular compartments. Omission of any of the reagents resulted in much less or no translocation. These effects were inhibited by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, which chelates zinc, and were not seen with calcium. Increase in cytoskeletal protein kinase C persisted for several hours and appeared to involve attachment of the enzyme to actin microfilaments. We propose that zinc, like calcium, regulates the distribution of PKC in cells. However, unlike calcium which controls the binding of PKC to the lipid component on cell membranes, zinc controls the distribution of PKC to membrane cytoskeleton, possibly actin...|$|R
40|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} trace element {{with a variety of}} cellular functions in all organ systems. Disturbance of the cellular zinc availability by zinc deficiency leads to multiple disorders. Predominantly the cell-mediated immune response is influenced by zinc deprivation, and here in particular T-cell mediated functions. For example, the Th 1 /Th 2 balance is disturbed leading to a reduced production of Th 1 cytokines such as IFN-gamma and IL- 2. Zinc supplementation in vivo causes reconstitution of Th 1 -mediated responses. To achieve a broad picture about the role of zinc in T-cell signal transduction, phosphorylation of several effector kinases in primary human T-cells and in the human T-cell line Jurkat was investigated. CD 3 -mediated activation and stimulation by zinc and the ionophore pyrithione led to differential activation of kinase Lck, MAPK p 38, JNK 1 / 2 and ERK 1 / 2. Experiments showed that CD 3 -stimulated T-cells release intracellular zinc which has no effect on signal transduction itself. However, if cells were stimulated with <b>zinc</b> and <b>pyrithione,</b> the kinases Lck and p 38 were activated, while CD 3 -induced ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation was reduced. To elucidate this differential zinc effect, several known zinc-mediated signalling mechanisms were investigated for their validity in T-cells. Lck is influenced by zinc in its activity at different levels. Experiments with Lck-negative cells showed that activation after stimulation with <b>zinc</b> and <b>pyrithione</b> additionally depends on protein tyrosine phosphatase CD 45. Furthermore the observed zinc effect is independent from CD 3 signalling and represents an intracellular event. MAPK phosphatase inhibition by zinc could be excluded as one possible explanation for p 38 activation. Zinc induced phosphorylation of p 38 by alternative activation mediated by Lck and ZAP 70 could be also eliminated by inhibitor studies and the use of Lck and ZAP 70 deficient cell lines. Further on, the involvement of the PKA signalling pathway was no explanation for the observed differential zinc effect, confirmed by the use of different inhibitors and activators. After verification of several signalling pathways, the molecular pathway of the observed zinc effect in T-cells seems to differ from established pathways in other cells. Although the mechanism could not be elucidated, it could be demonstrated that there is a connection between the induction of Th 1 answers and the activation of p 38 /CREB cascade. For the first time the impact of zinc on Th 1 cells could be linked to p 38 activation. Further work on the molecular mechanism could have an influence on the treatment of T-cell mediated diseases and could open up new therapy perspectives...|$|R
50|$|The {{infection}} cannot {{easily be}} removed mechanically, although further proliferation of infection {{can be achieved}} by avoidance of moisture. Removal generally involves cutting or shaving of the hair, but chemical treatments may be similarly useful. For women some individuals use a fine comb to remove as much of the infection as possible and then they cut or shave their hair. This is then followed by the application of a sublimate solution in 60% alcohol solution to the scalp. Historical treatments have used alcoholic tinctures of heavy metals, such as mercury bichloride. The application of antifungal shampoos such as <b>pyrithione</b> <b>zinc,</b> formaldehyde and salicylic acid is effective against black piedra. Oral therapy with itraconazole or terbinafine also causes nodules to break down over time. Removal of affected hair and treatment with topical agents is also effective and results in very low recurrences rates.

25|$|Due to its low {{solubility}} in water (8ppm at neutral pH), <b>zinc</b> <b>pyrithione</b> is suitable for use in outdoor paints and other products that provide protection against mildew and algae. It is an effective algaecide. It is chemically incompatible with paints relying on metal carboxylate curing agents. When used in latex paints with water containing high amount of iron, a sequestering agent that will preferentially bind the iron ions is needed. Its decomposition by ultraviolet light is slow, providing years of protection even against direct sunlight.|$|E

Zinc (Zn 2 +) is a ubiquitous respiratory toxicant that {{has been associated with}} PM health effects. However, the molecular mechanism of Zn 2 + toxicity is not fully understood. H 2 O 2 and Zn 2 + have been shown to mediate signaling leading to adverse cellular responses in the lung and we have previously demonstrated Zn 2 + to cause cellular H 2 O 2 production. To determine the role of Zn 2 +-induced H 2 O 2 production in the human airway epithelial cell response to Zn 2 + exposure. BEAS- 2 B cells expressing the redox-sensitive fluorogenic sensors HyPer (H 2 O 2) or roGFP 2 (EGSH) in the cytosol or mitochondria were exposed to 50 µM Zn 2 + for 5 min in the presence of 1 µM of the <b>zinc</b> ionophore <b>pyrithione.</b> Intracellular H 2 O 2 levels were modulated using catalase expression either targeted to the cytosol or ectopically to the mitochondria. HO- 1 mRNA expression was measured as a downstream marker of response to oxidative stress induced by Zn 2 + exposure. Both cytosolic catalase overexpression and ectopic catalase expression in mitochondria were effective in ablating Zn 2 +-induced elevations in H 2 O 2. Compartment-directed catalase expression blunted Zn 2 +-induced elevations in cytosolic EGSH and the increased expression of HO- 1 mRNA levels.

40|$|Our {{previous}} study demonstrated that zinc prevents cardiac reperfusion injury by targeting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) via Akt and glycogen synthetase kinase 3 β (GSK- 3 β). We aimed {{to address the}} mechanism by which zinc activates Akt. Treatment of H 9 c 2 cells with ZnCl 2 (10 μM) {{in the presence of}} the <b>zinc</b> ionophore <b>pyrithione</b> (4 μM) for 20 min enhanced Akt phosphorylation (Ser 473), indicating that zinc can rapidly activate Akt. Zinc did not alter either phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) phosphorylation and total PTEN protein levels or PTEN oxidation, implying that PTEN may not play a role in the action of zinc. However, zinc-induced Akt phosphorylation was blocked by both the nonselective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor genistein and the selective insulin-like growth factor- 1 RTK (IGF- 1 RTK) inhibitor AG 1024, indicating that zinc activates Akt via IGF- 1 RTK. Zinc-induced phosphorylation of protein tyrosine and Ser/Thr was also abolished by AG 1024. In addition, zinc markedly enhanced phosphorylation of IGF- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R), which was again reversed by genistein and AG 1024. A confocal imaging study revealed that AG 1024 abolished the preventive effect of zinc on oxidant-induced mPTP opening, confirming that IGF- 1 RTK plays a role in zinc-induced cardioprotection. Furthermore, zinc decreased the activity of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A), a major protein Ser/Thr phosphatase, implying that protein Ser/Thr phosphatases may also play a role in the action of zinc on Akt activity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that exogenous zinc activates Akt via IGF- 1 RTK and prevents the mPTP opening in cardiac cells. Inactivation of Ser/Thr protein phosphatases may also contribute to zinc-induced Akt activation...|$|R
40|$|Application of new {{molecular}} and biochemical tools {{has greatly}} increased {{our understanding of}} the organisms, mechanisms, and treatments of dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. Dandruff results from at least three etiologic factors: Malassezia fungi, sebaceous secretions, and individual sensitivity. While Malassezia (formerly P. ovale) has long been a suspected cause, implicated by its presence on skin and lipophylic nature, lack of correlation between Malassezia number and the presence and severity of dandruff has remained perplexing. We have previously identified the Malassezia species correlating to dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis. In this report, we show that dandruff is mediated by Malassezia metabolites, specifically irritating free fatty acids released from sebaceous triglycerides. Investigation of the toxic Malassezia free fatty acid metabolites (represented by oleic acid) reveals the component of individual susceptibility. Malassezia metabolism results in increased levels of scalp free fatty acids. Of the three etiologic factors implicated in dandruff, Malassezia, sebaceous triglycerides, and individual susceptibility, Malassezia are the easiest to control. <b>Pyrithione</b> <b>zinc</b> kills Malassezia and all other fungi, and is highly effective against the Malassezia species actually found on scalp.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether exogenous zinc prevents cardiac reperfusion injury by targeting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) via glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β (GSK- 3 β). The treatment of cardiac H 9 c 2 cells with ZnCl 2 (10 μM) in the presence of <b>zinc</b> ionophore <b>pyrithione</b> for 20 min significantly enhanced GSK- 3 β phosphorylation at Ser 9, indicating that exogenous zinc can inactivate GSK- 3 β in H 9 c 2 cells. The effect of zinc on GSK- 3 β activity was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) inhibitor LY- 294002 but not by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin or the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, implying that PI 3 K but not mTOR or PKC accounts for the action of zinc. In support of this interpretation, zinc induced a significant increase in Akt but not mTOR phosphorylation. Further experiments found that zinc also increased mitochondrial GSK- 3 β phosphorylation. This may indicate an involvement of the mitochondria in the action of zinc. The effect of zinc on mitochondrial GSK- 3 β phosphorylation was not altered by the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker 5 -hydroxydecanoic acid. Zinc applied at reperfusion reduced cell death in cells subjected to simulated ischemia/reperfusion, indicating that zinc can prevent reperfusion injury. However, zinc was not able to exert protection in cells transfected with the constitutively active GSK- 3 β (GSK- 3 β-S 9 A-HA) mutant, suggesting that zinc prevents reperfusion injury by inactivating GSK- 3 β. Cells transfected with the catalytically inactive GSK- 3 β (GSK- 3 β-KM-HA) also revealed a significant decrease in cell death, strongly supporting the essential role of GSK- 3 β inactivation in cardioprotection. Moreover, zinc prevented oxidant-induced mPTP opening through the inhibition of GSK- 3 β. Taken together, these data suggest that zinc prevents reperfusion injury by modulating the mPTP opening through the inactivation of GSK- 3 β. The PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway is responsible for the inactivation of GSK- 3 β by zinc...|$|R
40|$|Pyrithione (PT) {{is used as}} {{an active}} agent in some {{shampoos}} and other household products, and consequently may enter freshwaters following use. Dissolved metal (copper, <b>zinc)</b> salts of <b>pyrithione</b> are toxic to freshwater organisms, with toxicity dependent upon the metal. For this reason, the chemical speciation of pyrithione may be important in controlling its environmental toxicity. The objective of this work was to gather and assess data on the binding equilibria of pyrithione {{that could be used}} to assess its environmental speciation. Binding constants for the proton and a small number of metals were found in the literature. They were supplemented by binding constants for other metals estimated from constants for a ligand with an analogous structure to pyrithione. Using these tentative binding constants demonstration calculations of pyrithione speciation in a circumneutral freshwater were done. Pyrithione speciation was dominated by the binding of iron(III) with smaller contributions from aluminium, copper and zinc. Speciation was highly dependent upon water pH and the concentration of natural organic matter. These calculations demonstrate the feasibility of modelling to elucidate the speciation of pyrithione in freshwaters; for more robust calculations, experimental determination of more binding constants is needed. Knowledge of pyrithione speciation may be useful in other aspects of its risk assessment, specifically in understanding and predicting the rate at which it degrades in the natural environment...|$|R
