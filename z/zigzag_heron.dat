50|$|The <b>zigzag</b> <b>heron</b> (Zebrilus undulatus) is {{a species}} of heron in the family Ardeidae, also {{including}} egrets and bitterns. It is in the monotypic genus Zebrilus. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical swamps.The <b>zigzag</b> <b>heron</b> is {{a species of}} the entire Amazon Basin, east of the Andes cordillera, and the five bordering countries on the basin's western periphery, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The range does not extend beyond the Orinoco River basin of Venezuela in the northwest, and in the east-northeast encompasses the Guianas; in the southeast Amazon Basin the range does not extend east of the Tapaj√≥s River drainage.|$|E
5000|$|The herons are the long-legged {{freshwater}} {{and coastal}} {{birds in the}} family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, {{some of which are}} referred to as [...] "egrets" [...] or [...] "bitterns" [...] rather than herons. Members of the genera Botaurus and Ixobrychus are referred to as [...] "bitterns", and, together with the <b>zigzag</b> <b>heron</b> or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus Zebrilus, form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller. Herons, by evolutionary adaptation, have long beaks.|$|E
50|$|The herons are medium- to large-sized {{birds with}} long legs and necks. They exhibit very little sexual {{dimorphism}} in size. The smallest species is usually considered the little bittern, which can measure under 30 cm in length, although all the {{species in the}} Ixobrychus genus are small and many broadly overlap in size. The largest species of heron is the goliath heron, which stands up to 152 cm tall. The necks are able to kink in an S-shape, due to the modified shape of the cervical vertebrae, of which they have 20-21. The neck is able to retract and extend, and is retracted during flight, unlike most other long-necked birds. The neck is longer in the day herons than the night herons and bitterns. The legs are long and strong and in almost every species are unfeathered from {{the lower part of}} the tibia (the exception is the <b>zigzag</b> <b>heron).</b> In flight, the legs and feet are held backward. The feet of herons have long, thin toes, with three forward-pointing ones and one pointing backward.|$|E
