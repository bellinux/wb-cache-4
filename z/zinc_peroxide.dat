50|$|In the 1980s the {{discovery}} of zinc peroxide’s ability to complement pyrotechnical mixtures was discovered. It was noted that ZnO2 was preferable to the usage of barium compounds, as it was deemed to be less toxic. The zinc compound proves an effective component in explosives because of its oxidizing properties. Many chemical explosives rely on rapid oxidation reactions, for this reason ZnO2 is an ideal candidate for use in pyrotechnics.

In one modality it is necessary for <b>zinc</b> <b>peroxide</b> to act in conjunction with a reducer like calcium silicide, to create the necessary red/ox reaction. In another modality, a ‘secondary’ explosive is mixed with <b>zinc</b> <b>peroxide.</b> Secondary explosives include nitrocellulose, pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), as well as a variety of compounds, like trinitrobenzene, which provide powerful negative charge balance.These secondary explosives are relatively insensitive to stimuli such as physical impact, heat or charge.

Chemical effects in the heterogeneous system were evaluated and relationships between formed and consumed species during the sonication process were established statistically, employing factor analysis. Chemical species, such as hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, nitrite and zinc species were generated in a single heterogeneous zinc-water system under ultrasonic irradiation and their concentrations were determined. Different times of irradiation exposure were employed and {{the composition of the}} irradiated solution was monitored by ion chromatography (IC), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) techniques. Variations of the hydrogen ion and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured by potentiometric and spectrophotometric methods, respectively. The global covariance matrix of the variables was built from experimental data, including irradiation time, nitrite, nitrate, <b>zinc</b> and hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> concentrations, and pH variation. Based on the monitoring of species formed in sonicated solutions and the multi-parametric evaluation obtained from the covariance matrix, some correlation related to the formed and consumed species is shown. Nitrate, nitrite, <b>zinc</b> and hydrogen <b>peroxide</b> formation in aqueous solution is strongly dependent upon the irradiation exposure time. Furthermore, the pH increases slightly as the amount of nitrate and nitrite ions becomes constant. This later observation confirms the concept that hydrogen ions are consumed when nitrate and nitrite ions are formed. The pH increase during sonication of the zinc/water system reveals a rather different behavior when compared to the sonicated single pure water system. At the same sonication stage that nitrate and nitrite concentrations become practically constant, zinc concentration increases as hydrogen peroxide concentration increases. According to these observations, some chemical processes can be proposed. Hydrogen ions generated in sonicated solution are consumed by nitrate and nitrite ions formation. Hydrogen ions and hydrogen peroxide formed during sonication might react with metallic fragments originated eventually from corrosive action of the ultrasound. Zinc hydroxo-complexes are formed predominantly by hydroxyl ions generated during hydrogen peroxide reduction. On a smaller proportion, zinc hydroxo-complexes may be also formed due to the alkaline medium generated during hydrolysis of zinc ions...|$|R

50|$|The {{treatment}} of burrowing ulcers in the abdominal wall with <b>zinc</b> <b>peroxide</b> was first recorded in 1933 {{and throughout the}} 1940s ZnO2 {{was used as a}} disinfectant in surgical infections.Zinc peroxide was, however, deemed ineffective against certain bacterial strains, such as Streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, B. proteus, and B. pyocyoneus. One aspect of the compound’s microorganism toxicity is the resultant stagnation of microbial populations upon administration. This effect was hypothesized to depend upon the compound’s penchant for oxygen donation. It has been suggested that the increase in oxygen concentration associated with the presence of ZnO2 interferes with the replicative processes of anaerobic and micro-aerophillic organisms, both of which require low oxygen environments for their survival.While this mechanism was sufficient to explain the stagnation of microbe populations, it did not account for the active reduction in colony size. As to the microbicidal function, the Zinc ion itself has been postulated to have antibacterial properties, facilitated by the binding of the Zn ion to the bacterial cell wall, which allows for the exertion of cytotoxic effects. Zinc has been observed to be more effective in the elimination of gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. This difference has been attributed to a difference in the protein composition of the respective cell walls, with the gram-positive wall providing a composition more conducive to binding.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{synthesis}} of <b>zinc</b> <b>peroxide</b> nanoparticles via a high pressure impinging-jet reactor and via classical flask reaction. The nanoparticles were in situ stabilized and functionalized with six different stabilizer molecules: BMEP, o-PEA, citrate, glucose- 1 -phospahte, UDP-glucose and AOT. These molecules interacted with the particle surface via phosphate, carboxylate and sulfonate functions causing nanoparticle stabilization, while their other functional groups (methacrylates, amines, corboxylates, glucose functions) introduced new accessible functionalities. All synthesis approaches resulted in small and uniform nanoparticles with varying diameter between 2. 1 ± 0. 6 and 14. 4 ± 5. 2 nm depending on parameter like reaction time, stabilizer type and concentration. Further the investigations revealed that the nanoparticles were capable of releasing oxygen. This release could be triggered through elevated temperatures (T> 190. 0 °C) or through acidic aqueous environment (pH< 7. 4). Thereby the amount of released oxygen was dependent on the nanoparticle sizes, the sample compositions and the pH values of the corresponding dispersions. This special property made the nanoparticles suitable for the bleaching or recycled PET or as antibacterial agent against anaerobe bacteria. PET becomes grayer during the recycling process caused through the reduction of catalyst remnants inside the polymer. The oxygen released from <b>zinc</b> <b>peroxide</b> nanoparticles (temperature induced) present during the recycling process can oxidize these catalyst remnants leading to a color change from black to white. Additionally the <b>zinc</b> <b>peroxide</b> nanoparticles were converted to zinc oxide during oxygen release which can act as white pigments increasing the white grade enhancement even further. It could be shown that the color enhancement was dependent {{on the type of}} nanoparticle stabilizer, the particle size and the amount of used nanoparticles.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{definitions}} for nanotechnology and nanomaterials {{due to their}} multidisciplinary nature. The general definition of nanomaterials is that the structures {{have at least one}} dimension in the range of 100 nm or smaller. The definition for nanotechnology {{is that it is a}} discipline to investigate the production, manipulation, design, and engineering of nanomaterials. The use of nanomaterials has been spread in a large palette of applications such as energy, optics, electronic and medicine. Nowadays the state of the art nanoscience is capable of producing many multifunctional materials, however they have shortcomings such as using hazardous chemicals, methods being complicated and cost intensive and lack of scalability. In order to eliminate this shortcomings green synthesis techniques have been evolved recently. Green syntheses are environmental friendly alternatives to conventional synthesis techniques. They aim to reduce toxic elements used or produced in conventional methods. Moreover, they benefit from sustainable sources and can reduce production cost, in practical and up-scalable manner. In this thesis we focus on two different green synthesis techniques. In our first technique, silver/gold plasmonic bionanocomposites (BNCs) as well as 3 D bio-shells decorated with BNCs are produced using natural products in a biogenic fashion. In such techniques biomolecules such as enzymes, proteins, bacteria, fungus, yeast, and plant biomasses, are used to produce nanoparticles. The produced particles are highly promising for biological applications due to their biocompatible nature. Our second technique is based on Leidenfrost phenomenon where Leidenfrost dynamic chemistry occurring in an underwater overheated confined zone is used as a smart, versatile and a quick way of <b>zinc</b> <b>peroxide</b> nanoparticle production. The produced particles are then investigated in terms of cytotoxicity effect on cancer and healthy cells to prove their applicability as cancer nanotherapeutics...|$|E
40|$|The use of microemulsions as {{confined}} {{reaction media}} for nanoparticle synthesis presents various advantages {{compared to other}} methods. They offer a high control of nanoparticle size and often nanoparticles with crystalline structure and a high specific area are obtained directly during the synthesis, {{eliminating the need for}} calcination. Also, due to their thermodynamic stability, no energy input is needed for microemulsion formation; only a gentle agitation is sufficient to obtain microemulsions. In addition, simple equipment and mild conditions of temperature and pressure are employed. The traditional W/O microemulsion reaction method has been intensively studied. However, the use of W/O microemulsions has some drawbacks preventing their use in industrial applications. The most important drawback is the organic solvents used as the continuous phase, which are environmentally unfriendly. Also, they are cost ineffective. In order to overcome these drawbacks, our group has recently introduced the novel oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsion reaction method for inorganic nanoparticle synthesis. The advantage of using an aqueous continuous phase, the use of the organometallic precursors that can be loaded at comparable or higher concentration than the metallic salts in the traditional W/O microemulsions (promoting a higher nanoparticle yield), and the use of only one microemulsion (instead of two as in the traditional W/O method), indicate the promise of this novel method. This novel method consists in the use of organometallic precursors, dissolved in nanometer scale oil droplets of O/W microemulsions, and stabilized by a monolayer of hydrophilic surfactant. The precipitating agents, usually water-soluble, can be added directly or as aqueous solutions, without compromising microemulsion stability and droplet size; alternatively, if oil-soluble precipitating agents are available, then a two-microemulsions approach can be used. The main motivation for this development was that, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there was a lack of methods in the literature employing O/W microemulsions in which the metallic precursors were dissolved (and confined) in the oil droplets. In addition, another strong motivation was that, from a practical and environmental point of view, the possibility of preparing inorganic nanoparticles using o/w microemulsions (as opposed to w/o microemulsions) could be highly advantageous, since the major (continuous) phase is water. Metal 2 -ethylhexanoates have been used in the Oil-in-Water microemulsion reaction method as precursors of inorganic nanoparticles, mainly because these precursors were very soluble in hydrocarbons such as hexane or isooctane, which can be conveniently used as the oil phase in this approach. In addition, these type of precursors are available for a wide number of elements, they are inexpensive, air-stable (unlike alkoxide sol-gel precursors), and generally non-toxic. This type of precusors is often used for the synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles like metallic or metal oxides by thermal decomposition at temperatures as high as 200 - 300 ºC, in polar organic solvents and generally under an inert atmosphere, or by pyrolysis at much higher temperatures. The various types of inorganic nanoparticles prepared in O/W microemulsion reaction method were selected on the basis of their specific characteristics for several potential applications. Oxide nanoparticles containing Cerium, Copper and Zinc were prepared for their interest in catalysis. In addition, CuO and CeO 2 nanoparticles were also prepared as reference materials in order to compare properly the characteristics of the obtained materials. Semi-conductors such as Zinc oxide, <b>Zinc</b> <b>peroxide</b> and Zinc Selenide were synthesized and their specific characteristics such as fluorescent, electrical and photocatalytic properties were assessed. Finally, magnetic Mn-Zn ferrites nanoparticles with potential applications in fields such as biomedicine and thermoelectrics were prepared and their magnetic properties were assessed. Formation and stability of nanoparticle dispersions were also studied in order to assess their potential application in the biomedicine field. Se ha introducido recientemente un nuevo método de reacción en microemulsiones aceite-en-agua para la síntesis de nanopartículas inorgánicas por parte de nuestro grupo de investigación (Sánchez-Domínguez et al. 2009). Es principalemente destacable el hecho de que con éste método se reduce el uso de solventes orgánicos ya que la fase continua es acuosa. Este método consiste en el uso de precursores organometálicos, disueltos en gotas nanómetricas de solvente orgánico (generalmente hidrocarburo) estabilizadas por una monocapa de tensioactivo hidrófilo, dispersas en la fase continua acuosa. Los agentes precipitantes por lo general solubles en agua se pueden añadir directamente o en forma de soluciones acuosas sin comprometer la estabilidad de la microemulsión, y el tamaño de gota. En el presente estudio, se ha estudiado la formación de microemulsiones en sistemas ternarios (o pseudoternarios) compuestos de agua, Synperonic® 10 / 6 (tensioactivo no-iónico) y hexano a varias temperaturas entre 25 ºC y 35 ºC. Además, se ha estudiado el efecto de la incorporación de precursor organometálico (Ce- 2 EH) en la formación de microemulsiones a varias temperaturas también. Después de definir las zonas de micromemulsión, se han elegido algunas composiciones para utilizarlas como medio de reacción para preparar nanopartículas inorgánicas. Además, se han sintetizado varios tipos de nanopartículas inorgánicas en microemulsiones aceite-en-agua; el tipo específico de nanopartículas ha sido seleccionado en base a sus propiedades específicas y diferentes aplicaciones potenciales. Se han preparado nanopartículas de óxidos mixtos de cerio, cobre y zinc por su alto interes en catálisis. También se han preparado nanopartículas de óxido de cobre y óxido de cerio para usarlos como materiales de referencia al comparar las características de las nanopartículas de los óxidos mixtos obtenidos. Asimismo, se han preparado semiconductores como óxido de zinc, peróxido de zinc y seleniuro de zinc y se han evaluado sus características específicas por ejemplo sus propiedades fluorescentes, eléctricas y fotocatalíticas. Por otra parte, se han sintetizado nanopartículas magnéticas tipo ferritas de zinc y manganeso con aplicaciones potenciales en biomedicina y materiales termoeléctricos. Se han estudiado sus propiedades magnéticas y se ha estudiado la formación y la estabilidad de varias dispersiones de dichas nanopartículas en diversos solventes, con el fin de ampliar el rango de aplicaciones potenciales...|$|E
