25|$|<b>Zone</b> <b>B</b> in the {{photograph}} of the stratigraphic zones contains specimens from the Morrow Mountain Phase of the Middle Archaic period. The excavation of this intermediate layer yielded three sets of human remains as well as projectile points, bone awls, and other tools. The youngest stratigraphic zone (Zone A, not shown in {{the photograph}}) contained specimens from the Archaic through Mississippian periods.|$|E
30|$|As it is {{apparent}} in Fig.  3, the Shurijeh formation geologically can be divided in five zones namely <b>zones</b> A, <b>B,</b> C, D and E. Lithologically <b>zones</b> <b>B</b> and D are sandstone and have capability of being a reservoir other zones are mainly consists of very tight layers of lime. Therefore in Shurijeh formation there are two reservoir <b>zones</b> (<b>zones</b> <b>B</b> and D) and other zones do not have capability of being reservoirs (very low porosity and permeability). These facts can be readily shown in Fig.  4 which shows well log porosity of three wells (well no. 3, 5, 6). Here in this figure <b>zones</b> <b>B</b> and D have relatively good porosities but in other zones the amount of porosity is near to zero. Location map of the wells in the Khangiran gas field shown in Fig.  5. In this study, the Shurijeh B reservoir has been investigated.|$|R

Values outside <b>zones</b> A and <b>B</b> of the R-EGA corresponding to values in <b>zones</b> A and <b>B</b> of the Clarke error grid were considered benign errors. On the other hand, values outside <b>zones</b> A and <b>B</b> of the R-EGA corresponding to values outside <b>zones</b> A and <b>B</b> of the Clarke error grid were considered erroneous readings [12].|$|R

25|$|Published {{studies on}} the {{survival}} of SS patients are limited in varied respects, perhaps owing to the relatively small sample sizes, and secondary SS is associated with other autoimmune diseases. However, results {{from a number of}} studies indicated, compared to other autoimmune diseases, SS is associated with a notably high incidence of malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHL is the cancer derived from white blood cells. About 5% of patients with SS will develop some form of lymphoid malignancy. Patients with severe cases {{are much more likely to}} develop lymphomas than patients with mild or moderate cases.
