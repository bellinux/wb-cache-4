Enhanced surface integrity properties include smoother and more precise surfaces, grain refinement, and increase in surface hardness. This paper reports {{on the effect of}} liquid nitrogen (LN) {{cryogenic cooling}} and cutting parameters on surface hardness of drilled holes in magnesium alloy AZ 31 B. Drilling experiments of in-process cryogenic cooling were conducted while measuring thrust force and torque. Surface microhardness (HV) values and grain structure at drilled hole surfaces were measured. Finite element analysis (FEM) and model for simulating this cryogenically cooled drilling operation was developed. Numerical output of the state variables strain, strain rate, and temperature were used to predict Zener–Hollomon parameter (<b>Z-parameter)</b> values at the surfaces of the holes. Using an expression that relates <b>Z-parameter</b> to grain size, average values of the latter were estimated. Surface hardness values were also estimated from a Hall–Petch-like relation. Cryogenic cooling was found to have a pronounced effect in increasing surface hardness. Experimental measurements of grain size and hardness values compare favorably with the numerical results of the FEM model. In-process application of cryogenic cooling resulted in improved surface hardness of drilled holes as compared with those drilled while dry. PublishedN/...|$|R

The resulting grain size values were experimentally measured for the observed microstructure of all processed samples. Dynamic recrystallization was identified to be the main mechanism involved in the grain refinement. A linear relation of the form ln d = a × ln Z + b was determined relating the average grain size (d) to the <b>Z-parameter</b> with a and b being equal to − 0. 23 and 8. 79, respectively.
