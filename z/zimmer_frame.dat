2500|$|Magneto {{appears in}} The Super Hero Squad Show voiced by Maurice LaMarche. Besides being {{depicted}} {{as an ally}} of Doctor Doom, this version is shown trying to train his children Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to follow his legacy. In [...] "Hexed, Vexed, and Perplexed", he arrived in Super Hero City with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch in a plot to steal the Infinity Fractals from the Vault for Doctor Doom. He ends up fighting Captain America, Hawkeye, and the Super Hero Squad. When Falcon makes an attack on Magneto, Quicksilver uses his super speed to deflect the attack back at Falcon. Magneto sends his children to infiltrate the Helicarrier to steal the security codes in order to infiltrate the Vault. When the Super Hero Squad attacks, Magneto grabs an Infinity Fractal which gives him {{the ability to control}} matter which he uses to stop Falcon in mid-air. Scarlet Witch objects to Magneto hurting him more. Magneto releases them from his control only to take Falcon and Redwing captive as Quicksilver grabs the Infinity Fractals. Magneto then traps the Super Hero Squad in metal. Quicksilver discovers that Magneto had stole the Infinity Fractals all along. Doctor Doom later attacks Magneto blaming him for stealing the Infinity Fractals until Falcon makes off with them. Doctor Doom holds Magneto responsible for his children helping Falcon and knocks him out. In [...] "Lo, How the Mighty Hath Abdicated!", Magneto and Quicksilver attack the Helicarrier thinking that Scarlet Witch was kidnapped and brainwashed by the Super Hero Squad. Their fight ends up crashing the Helicarrier into Asgard. When Odin is freed from Enchantress' love lutefisk, he convinces Magneto to let Scarlet Witch stay with the Super Hero Squad. When Scarlet Witch states that she will come to Magneto when he needs her, Magneto states that if they meet as hero and villain, it will be different. Due to his transportation being wrecked, Magneto and Quicksilver ask the Super Hero Squad for a ride back to Super Hero City. A vastly older version appears in the alternate universe episode [...] "Days, Nights, and Weekends of Futures Past", where he helps Falcon, HERBIE, and Reptil (known as [...] "The Man") reform Scarlet Witch. Here, he is seen using a <b>zimmer</b> <b>frame,</b> complete with a bicycle horn, but later uses a scooter composed of Sentinel pieces.|$|E

40|$|T(e) Huis is {{a project}} which began in October 2014 in which a design team are {{embedded}} in a care facility dementia ward for two years. Over the course of these two years, the role of designer (usually associated with a defined role of making) and researcher (often restricted to observational bystander) meld into that of layman carer and friend. T(e) Huis follows {{in the wake of}} previous dementia-related projects which each lead to a refining of their participatory methodology to suit not the disease, but the individual; his/her context, their network of caregivers and, central {{to the way in which}} they work, the person with dementia themselves. Instead of designing for generic symptoms or user groups, they work with individuals, designing without a predetermined technological restraint or aim. The resulting innovations range from colouring books to way-finding jewellery to baskets for <b>zimmer</b> <b>frames.</b> For T(e) Huis, the goal is to create bespoke designs together with people with dementia that support their feeling of ‘home’. This project asks several questions relevant to both design and health. For design practice it asks about the importance of individuals; how a designer can embed empathy into their practice and continually adjust their way of working so that it is open for participation. For the healthcare sector, it asks what this sort of initiative provides as return in relationship to their core purpose of care. This paper will present how this work is carried out, initial reflections as well as how this way of working is shared in design education. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The Zimmers are an English band {{formed in}} 2007 and {{are thought to}} have the oldest members of any group in the world. The oldest member, Buster Martin, claimed to have been born in 1906, {{although}} some sources indicate he was born in 1913. Martin died in 2011. Former lead singer Alf Carretta died on 29 June 2010, aged 93. The group takes its name from the <b>Zimmer</b> <b>frame,</b> the UK term for a mobility aid known in other countries as a walker.|$|E
50|$|A walker (also {{known as}} a <b>Zimmer</b> <b>frame)</b> is the most stable walking aid and {{consists}} of a freestanding metal framework with three or more points of contact which the user places {{in front of them}} and then grips during movement. The points of contact may be either fixed rubber ferrules as with crutches and canes, or wheels, or a combination of both. Wheeled walkers are also known as rollators. Many of these walkers also come with an inbuilt seat so that the user may rest during use and with metal pouches to carry personal belongings.|$|E
5000|$|Jamil, {{nickname}} [...] "Jam-Jam", {{was born}} in Hampstead to an Indian father and an English mother. [...] At school, Jamil says she was [...] "bookish and shy ... Back then {{it was all about}} comfort. I literally didn't care what I wore". Her interests include art and biology. At the age of 17, Jamil was struck by a car, breaking several bones and damaging her spine. She was confined to bed for a year; she weighed 126 lb (9 st) before the accident and gained 77 lb (5 st 7 lb) while convalescing. She was told that she might never walk again, but after steroid treatment and physiotherapy she slowly recovered, using a <b>Zimmer</b> <b>frame</b> to start walking. She rapidly lost weight, returning to her original weight.|$|E
50|$|Seconds later, as the Doctor and Emma {{start to}} leave, the Master bursts in. Having taken him 312 years to crawl out, he emerges {{as an old}} man covered in sewage. Using his TARDIS {{to return to the}} present, he has brought allies - the Daleks (who, lacking noses, are the only race that will have {{anything}} to do with him). Additionally, he has been enhanced by superior Dalek technology, a Dalek SuctionCup Hand. To the Master's dismay he can not answer when Emma asks him what the suction cup is for. The Master throws himself at the Doctor but falls into the sewers again, and immediately bursts in again, another 312 years older. The Daleks give chase to the Doctor, knocking the Master once more into the sewers. Having spent a total of 936 years in the sewers, he returns using a <b>zimmer</b> <b>frame</b> (walker) and is easily outpaced by the slow moving Daleks.|$|E
50|$|A mysterious {{stranger}} visits Ben, {{sitting by}} his bedside {{and talking to}} him. The stranger is Geoff Burke (Andrew McKaige), Ben's biological father who read about the incident in the newspaper. Geoff admits his identity to a comatose Ben. After waking up, Ben has no memory of this and Ruth wants it kept that way. Ben is irate when finds out that Geoff was in fact his father, and not a hospital worker as he had believed and he rejects him. However, he realises how lucky he is to be alive and {{have the chance to}} get to know both of his natural parents. When Ben is discharged from hospital, He agrees to stay with his family next door after he realizes he would be too much of a burden for his housemates. Geoff decides to stay on and help take care of his son, while getting to know him. Ben finds life challenging when he has to adjust to using a <b>zimmer</b> <b>frame.</b> One day, he falls when getting out of the bath and is forced to wait for Anne to come home to assist him. However, he manages to maintain a positive attitude. Ben's recovery takes a setback when Geoff shows him a video of the crash. When Ben begins to make progress, Geoff decides to return to his family in Sydney and tells Ben he is welcome there any time.|$|E
5000|$|Diego is in {{hospital}} {{and there seems}} to be no progress in his condition. Truth is that he's putting on an Oscar-winning act because he wants to live with Madonna instead of with Mel; wheelchair-bound he continues his farce for a while after coming home. Jeffrey knows too, and he threatens to cease all financial benefits if Mel doesn't let go of Diego. More bad news; her estranged father Dirk, recovering from a brain haemorrhage, gave up his French hideaway to live with his daughter. Mel passes on the responsibility to Madonna and insists that her son avoids his grandad. Diego wants answers after discovering eight years' worth of unreceived postcards; it transpires that he was spanked as a four-year-old for being disobedient and escaping from the cellar where he was told to stay. Dirk confesses, but he also regrets that Mel socialised with the wrong people and that she settled for an empty life of shopping sprees and drinking sessions; why didn't she use her potential like Madonna did ? [...] "Because you always kept me inside". An apology only emerges when Dirk nearly falls into the water with his <b>zimmer</b> <b>frame.</b> Father and daughter seem to make amends till Dirk collapses while fishing; he dies on the spot. To make matters worse, Diego has moved in with Madonna after all because Mel failed to pick him up. Then Madonna shows her true colours; she keeps Mel at arms length and wants Diego all for herself. Mel consequently misses Dirk's final farewell but she finds comfort in South African player Kofi Akua who lives with her.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Patients {{suffering}} a distal femoral fracture {{are at a}} high risk of morbidity and mortality. Currently this cohort is not afforded the same resources as those with hip fractures. This study aims to compare their mortality rates and assess whether surgical intervention improves either outcome or mortality following distal femoral fractures. Methods. Patients over sixty-five admitted with a distal femoral fracture between June 2007 and 2012 were retrospectively identified. Patients mobility was categorised as unaided, walking aid, <b>zimmer</b> <b>frame,</b> or immobile. The 30 -day, six-month, and one-year mortality rates were recorded for this group as well as for hip fractures during the same period. Results. 68 patients were included in the study. The mortality rate for all patients with distal femoral fractures was 7 % at 30 days, 26 % at six months, and 38 % at one year, higher than hip fractures during the same period by 8 %, 13 %, and 18 %, respectively. Patients managed surgically had lower mortality rates and higher mobility levels. Conclusion. Patients {{suffering a}} distal femoral fracture have a high mortality rate and surgical intervention seems to improve both mobility and mortality...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of empathy within new product {{development}} {{from the perspective of}} human-centred design. The authors have developed a range of empathic design tools and strategies that help to identify authentic human needs. For products and services to be effective, they need to satisfy both functional and emotional needs of individuals. In addition, the individual user needs to feel that the product and/or service has been designed ‘just for them’, otherwise they may misuse, underuse or abandon the product/service. This becomes critical with a product such as a <b>Zimmer</b> <b>frame</b> (walker), when it fails to resonate with the patient due to any stigma the patient may perceive, and thus remains unused. When training young designers to consider the wider community (people unlike themselves) during the design process, it has proven extremely valuable to take them outside their comfort zones, by seeking to develop empathy with the end user for whom they are designing. Empathic modelling offers designers the opportunity to develop greater insight and understanding, in order to support more effective design outcomes. Sensitising designers to the different ways that individuals complete daily tasks has helped to diminish the gap between themselves and others (e. g. people with disabilities). The authors intend for this paper to resonate with health care providers. Human-centred design can help to refocus the designer, by placing the individual end user’s needs at the heart of their decision-making...|$|E
