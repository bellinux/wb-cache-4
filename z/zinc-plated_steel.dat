40|$|Tetrahedral bonded {{amorphous}} carbon films (ta-C) have a promising tribol. potential {{due to their}} unique combination of very high hardness and low adhesion. Barriers, hindering the wider industrial use of these films, have been successfully overcome by development of advanced film systems (with markedly increased adherence) and {{by the development of}} industrial deposition technique (based on pulsed vacuum arc discharges). An esp. promising field is the machining of light and non-ferrous metals and of non-metal materials. For forming tools a redn. of the film roughness, which is an inherent result of the deposition process, is necessary for full use of the high performance, which has been proved in special applications as the forming of <b>zinc-plated</b> sheet <b>steel...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Modern staples {{for paper}} staplers {{are made from}} <b>zinc-plated</b> <b>steel</b> wires glued {{together}} and bent to form a long strip of staples. Staple strips are commonly available as [...] "full strips" [...] with 210 staples per strip. Both copper plated and more expensive stainless steel staples which do not rust are also available.|$|E
50|$|The Expal C-3-A and C-3-B are round Spanish rubber {{modified}} polystyrene cased anti-tank blast mines. The mines differ only in minor detail. The mine {{is classified}} as a minimum metal mine, the only metal it contains being a 4.5 millimetre diameter <b>zinc-plated</b> <b>steel</b> spring. The mine is found in Angola, the Falkland Islands, and the Western Sahara. The mines are vulnerable to the plastic cases deteriorating in bright sunlight, resulting in a reduction in activation pressure.|$|E
50|$|Iron {{and steel}} are girding China's {{economic}} development, and Jiangsu Shagang is {{big part of}} that process. The company processes some 18 million tons of iron annually in order to roll out about 23 million tons of steel each year, {{making it one of}} China's top-five steel producers. Jiangsu Shagang's product line includes rebar, wire rods, slabs, and hot-rolled coils. In addition to iron and steel, Jiangsu Shagang produces stainless steel and <b>zinc-plated</b> <b>steel</b> sheets. Since 2006, the company has acquired four smaller, rival steel companies, and it now ranks as China's largest private steel producer.|$|E
5000|$|Fender also markets guitar strings {{under the}} Bullet brand. Introduced {{in the early}} 1970s, these strings differ by having {{cylindrical}} bullet-shaped ends instead of the [...] "ball ends" [...] common to other manufacturers. Fender states the bullet ends create a tighter fit in the tremolo block on Stratocaster guitars, leading to greater tuning stability when the tremolo is used. [...] In the early 1990s Fender switched from using <b>zinc-plated</b> <b>steel</b> for the bullet ends to brass, improving sustain. Today nickel is also used. Stainless steel strings with bullet ends are also offered since the late '90s.|$|E
50|$|Wartime <b>zinc-plated</b> <b>steel,</b> 1943. The {{composition}} of the Lincoln cent was changed in 1943.Production of the war-time cent was provided for in an Act of Congress approved on December 18, 1942, which also set as the expiration date of the authority December 31, 1946. Low-grade carbon steel formed the base of these coins, to which a zinc coating 0.0005 in thick was deposited on each side electrolytically as a rust preventive. This coating {{was applied to the}} steel before the blanks were made, leaving the rims of these coins extremely susceptible to rust. The same size was maintained, but the weight was reduced from the standard 48 gr g to 42 gr g, by using a lighter alloy. Production commenced on February 27, 1943, and by December 31 of that year, the three Mint facilities had produced 1,093,838,670 of the one-cent coins. The copper released for the war effort was enough to meet the combined needs of two cruisers, two destroyers, 1,243 Flying Fortresses, 120 field guns and 120 howitzers, or enough for 1,250,000 shells for large field guns.|$|E
