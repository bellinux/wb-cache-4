Some can survive the intense UV and cosmic radiation encountered during space travel. Most grow in terrestrial environments, though several species live partly or solely in aquatic habitats, such as the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a parasite that has been responsible for {{a worldwide}} decline in amphibian populations. This organism spends part of its life cycle as a motile <b>zoospore,</b> enabling it to propel itself through water and enter its amphibian host. Other examples of aquatic fungi include those living in hydrothermal areas of the ocean.|$|E
25|$|It has a diploid {{life cycle}} which {{includes}} both sexual and asexual reproduction. In the asexual phase, a spore of Saprolegnia releases zoospores. Within a few minutes, this <b>zoospore</b> will encyst, germinate and release another <b>zoospore.</b> This second <b>zoospore</b> has a longer cycle during which most dispersal happens; {{it will continue}} to encyst and release a new spore in a process called polyplanetism until it finds a suitable substrate. When a suitable medium is located, the hairs surrounding the spore will lock onto the substrate so that the sexual reproduction phase can start. It is also during this stage of polyplanetism that the Saprolegnia are capable of causing infection; the most pathogenic species have tiny hooks {{at the end of their}} hairs to enhance their infectious ability.|$|E
6000|$|But I {{have further}} {{to assume that}} the gemmules in their undeveloped state are capable of largely {{multiplying}} themselves by self-division, like independent organisms. Delpino insists that to [...] "admit of multiplication by fissiparity in corpuscles, analogous to seeds or buds...is repugnant to all analogy." [...] But this seems a strange objection, as Thuret (27/44. 'Annales des Sc. Nat.' 3rd series Bot. tome 14 1850 page 244.) has seen the <b>zoospore</b> of an alga divide itself, and each half germinated. Haeckel divided the segmented ovum of a siphonophora into many pieces, and these were developed. Nor does the extreme minuteness of the gemmules, which can hardly differ much in nature from the lowest and simplest organisms, render it improbable that they should grow and multiply. A great authority, Dr. Beale (27/45. 'Disease Germs' page 20.), says [...] "that minute yeast cells are capable of throwing off buds or gemmules, much less than the 1/100000 of an inch in diameter;" [...] and these he thinks are [...] "capable of subdivision practically ad infinitum." ...|$|E
50|$|Flagellated {{lifecycle}} stages {{are found}} in many groups, e.g., many green algae (<b>zoospores</b> and male gametes), bryophytes (male gametes), pteridophytes (male gametes), some gymnosperms (cycads and Ginkgo, as male gametes), centric diatoms (male gametes), brown algae (<b>zoospores</b> and gametes), oomycetes (assexual <b>zoospores</b> and gametes), hyphochytrids (<b>zoospores),</b> labyrinthulomycetes (<b>zoospores),</b> some apicomplexans (gametes), some radiolarians (probably gametes), foraminiferans (gametes), plasmodiophoromycetes (<b>zoospores</b> and gametes), myxogastrids (<b>zoospores),</b> metazoans (male gametes), and chytrid fungi (<b>zoospores</b> and gametes).|$|R

60|$|After {{swarming}} {{about in}} this way in the moisture {{on the surface of}} a leaf or stem (which, film though it may be, is an ocean to such a fish) for half an hour, more or less, the movement of the <b>zoospore</b> becomes slower, and is limited to a slow turning upon its axis, without change of place. It then becomes quite quiet, the cilia disappear, it assumes a spherical form, and surrounds itself with a distinct, though delicate, membranous coat. A protuberance then grows out {{from one side of the}} sphere, and rapidly increasing in length, assumes the character of a hypha. The latter penetrates into the substance of the potato plant, either by entering a stomate, or by boring through the wall of an epidermic cell, and ramifies, as a mycelium, in the substance of the plant, destroying the tissues with which it comes in contact. As these processes of multiplication take place very rapidly, millions of spores are soon set free from a single infested plant; and, from their minuteness, they are readily transported by the gentlest breeze. Since, again, the zoospores set free from each spore, in virtue of their powers of locomotion, swiftly disperse themselves over the surface, it is no wonder that the infection, once started, soon spreads from field to field, and extends its ravages over a whole country.|$|E
50|$|Whiplash flagella are straight, {{to power}} the <b>zoospore</b> through its medium. There is also the 'default' <b>zoospore,</b> which only has the propelling, 'whiplash' flagella.|$|E
50|$|Most species {{share the}} same initial {{developmental}} stages. The released zoospores swim until they find a suitable host and will occasionally use amoeboid movement to better orient themselves to a host plant cell. After the <b>zoospore</b> attaches to a host cell, a narrow germ tube forms and penetrates the host cell, which is usually an epidermal cell. An exception to this is S. minutum; it uses the stomata to enter the host plant and penetrate a sub-epidermal cell. After penetration, the <b>zoospore</b> cytoplasm flows into the host cell. The Synchytrium nucleus travels toward the host cell nucleus and becomes enveloped in host cyctoplasm. After this point, differences arise among Synchytrium species. Species {{fall into one of}} two broad categories: short cycled and long cycled. Short cycled species follow one of two lines of development: sori, sporangia, <b>zoospore</b> or resting spore, sori, <b>zoospore.</b> Long cycled species follow a general pathway of prosori/sori, sporangia, <b>zoospore,</b> resting spore, prosori/sori, sporangia, <b>zoospore.</b> The nuances in life cycles are used to delineate the subgenera.|$|E
40|$|AbstractImpact of UV-radiation in entomopathogens in aquatic environments remains little investigated.

Whereas the virulence of free <b>zoospores</b> in A. aegypti larvae was affected by a UV-A exposure time longer than 10 min, production of <b>zoospores</b> in larvae and their virulence were not hampered at a maximal 8 h exposure of dead larvae to UV-A.

Our results indicate that M. ectocarpii produces two types of plasmodia, and suggest that is a species with a complete life cycle, as it is known for all the Plasmodiophormycota that have been studied. Sporogenic and sporangial plasmodia produce, respectively, primary <b>zoospores</b> with parallel flagella within thick walled resting sporangia, and secondary <b>zoospores</b> with opposite flagella within thin walled sporangia...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of phosphite {{to control the}} production of <b>zoospores</b> of Phytophthora cinnamomi on infected trees grown in a glasshouse and in a revegetated mined area was examined. Banksia grandis and Eucalyptus marginata seedlings in the glasshouse and E. marginata seedlings in the minepit were sprayed with 0, 5 and 10 g phosphite L− 1. In both trials, <b>zoospores</b> were produced from infected tissue of plants treated with all concentrations of phosphite. In the glasshouse, spray application of 5 and 10 g phosphite L− 1 significantly reduced the production of <b>zoospores</b> from both B. grandis and E. marginata seedlings. In the mined area there was a similar, though nonsignificant, {{reduction in the number}} of <b>zoospores</b> produced from phosphite-treated and nontreated E. marginata seedlings. However, the average number of <b>zoospores</b> produced was greater in plants not treated with phosphite (1 · 75 <b>zoospores</b> mL− 1) than from plants treated with 5 or 10 g phosphite L− 1 (0 · 04 and 0 · 09 <b>zoospores</b> mL− 1, respectively). Pimelea ferruginea leaves were used to bait the water surrounding the plants in the mined area to determine if <b>zoospores</b> produced from phosphite-treated plants were able to infect plant material. Significantly more baits were infected by <b>zoospores</b> from plants not treated with phosphite compared with plants treated with 5 or 10 g phosphite L− 1. These results suggest that phosphite reduces, but does not prevent, the production of viable <b>zoospores</b> on infected trees. Thus phosphite application may not remove the risk of P. cinnamomi spreading from infested, sprayed areas...|$|R

50|$|Much of how B. dendrobatidis is {{successfully}} {{transmitted from}} one {{host to the}} next is largely unknown. Once released into the aquatic environment, <b>zoospores</b> travel less than 2 cm within 24 hours before they encyst. The limited range of B. dendrobatidis <b>zoospores</b> suggest some unknown mechanism exists by which they transmit from one host to the next. Abiotic factors such as temperature, pH level, and nutrient levels affect the success of B. dendrobatidis <b>zoospores.</b> The fungus <b>zoospores</b> can survive within a temperature range of 4-25 °C and a pH range of 6-7.|$|R
50|$|In spring, {{at higher}} {{temperature}} and moisture, overwintering sporangia germinate to release mobile <b>zoospores</b> which infect suitable host epidermal cells.

40|$|Abstract: Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) {{has been}} implicated in {{hundreds}} of amphibian declines and {{is the focus of}} a vast amount of research. Despite this, there is no reported efficient way to assess Bd viability. Discriminating between live and dead Bd would help determine the dose of live Bd <b>zoospores</b> and whether factors have lethal or sublethal effects on Bd. We tested whether trypan blue, a common stain to discriminate live and dead cells, could be used to assess Bd viability. We show that the proportion of live <b>zoospores</b> (<b>zoospores</b> that excluded the trypan blue dye) matched the proportion of known live <b>zoospores</b> added to cultures. In contrast, all of the zoosporangia stages of Bd stained blue. These results demonstrate that trypan blue can be used to determine the viability of Bd <b>zoospores</b> but not zoosporangia. We recommend using trypan blue to report the number of live <b>zoospores</b> to which hosts are exposed...|$|R

50|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in Phytophthora palmivora {{requires the}} presence of opposite mating types known as A1 and A2. Both A1 and A2 isolates can produce zoospores by selfing when stimulated by sex hormones produced by A2 and A1, respectively. Light is inhibitory to <b>zoospore</b> formation but stimulatory to <b>zoospore</b> germination. Mature zoospores can be induced to germinate by treatment with 0.25% KMnO4 for 20 min and incubation under light during germination.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{species of}} brown algae can also perform asexual {{reproduction}} through {{the production of}} motile diploid <b>zoospores.</b> These <b>zoospores</b> form in plurilocular sporangium, and can mature into the sporophyte phase immediately.|$|R
50|$|Growth {{continues}} {{until a new}} {{batch of}} <b>zoospores</b> are ready for release. Chytrids have a diverse set of release mechanisms that can be grouped into the broad categories of operculate or inoperculate. Operculate discharge involves the complete or incomplete detachment of a lid-like structure, called an operculum, allowing the <b>zoospores</b> out of the sporangium. Inoperculate chytrids release their <b>zoospores</b> through pores, slits, or papillae.|$|R
50|$|During sexual reproduction, {{which takes}} place by iso-gametes (gametes of the same size) even smaller than the <b>zoospores,</b> the iso-gametes escape {{through a hole in}} the cell wall of the mother cell. Two gametes then fuse, forming a zygote, which then {{develops}} a thick cell wall and becomes angular in shape. After a rest period, 2-5 <b>zoospores,</b> which are bigger than the ones formed by asexual reproduction, are produced. The <b>zoospores</b> then enlarge into polygonal cells. The cytoplasm of the cells then divide into new <b>zoospores</b> which lose their flagella and form a new net by lying against each other.|$|R
5000|$|Species of Chytridiomycota have {{traditionally}} been delineated and classified based on development, morphology, substrate, and method of <b>zoospore</b> discharge. [...] However, single spore isolates (or isogenic lines) display {{a great amount of}} variation in many of these features; thus, these features cannot be used to reliably classify or identify a species. Currently, taxonomy in Chytridiomycota is based on molecular data, <b>zoospore</b> ultrastructure and some aspects of thallus morphology and development.|$|E

5000|$|Chytrids {{have several}} {{different}} growth patterns. Some are holocarpic, {{which means they}} only produce a zoosporangium and zoospores. Others are eucarpic, meaning they produce other structures, such as rhizoids, {{in addition to the}} zoosporangium and zoospores. Some chytrids are monocentric, meaning a single <b>zoospore</b> gives rise to a single zoosporangium. Others are polycentric, meaning one <b>zoospore</b> gives rise to many zoosporangium connected by a rhizomycelium. Rhizoids do not have nuclei while a rhizomycelium can.|$|E
50|$|Chytridiomycota are unusual {{among the}} Fungi {{in that they}} {{reproduce}} with <b>zoospores.</b> For most members of Chytridiomycetes, sexual reproduction is not known. Asexual reproduction occurs through the release of <b>zoospores</b> (presumably) derived through mitosis.|$|R
