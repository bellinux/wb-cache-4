[...] In the non-mutant mouse, FANCG protein is expressed in spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes and spermatocytes in the leptotene, <b>zygotene</b> and early pachytene stages of meiosis.|$|E
5000|$|In eukaryotes, the Rad51 and Dmc1 {{proteins}} have {{a central}} role in meiosis. Teresawa et al. using immunofluorescence microscopy found that in Lilium longiflorum, Rad51 and Lim15 (an ortholog of Dmc1) co-localize on meiotic prophase I chromosomes where they form discrete foci. Using electron microscopic immunogold labeling localization, Anderson et al. found Rad51 and/or Lim15 proteins to be components of early meiotic nodules that are involved in recombination related events. The stages of meiosis in which the co-localization of the Rad51 and Lim15 proteins occurs are the leptotene and <b>zygotene</b> stages of meiosis, suggesting that meiotic recombination begins at the leptotene stage with the cooperation of these proteins and continues into <b>zygotene.</b> [...] These proteins catalyze pairing of homologous chromosomes, DNA strand exchange, and recombinational repair of DNA damages.|$|E
5000|$|The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) {{stage of}} meiosis {{actively}} repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair was not {{detected in the}} pre-dictyate (leptotene, <b>zygotene</b> and pachytene) stages of meiosis. [...] The long period of meiotic arrest at the four chromatid dictyate stage of meiosis may facilitate recombinational repair of DNA damages.|$|E
5000|$|During this stage, the {{chromosomes}} attach {{themselves by}} their ends (telomeres) {{to the inner}} membrane of the nuclear envelope. At {{the transition to the}} <b>zygotene</b> stage the telomeres usually aggregate at a nuclear envelope sector, thereby forming a meiotic bouquet. Lateral (axial) elements of the synaptonemal complex are also formed. It is the first stage of Prophase 1 in Meosis 1.|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "tripartite structure" [...] is seen {{during the}} {{pachytene}} {{stage of the}} first meiotic prophase, both in males and in females during gametogenesis. Previous to the pachytene stage, during leptonema, the lateral elements begin to form and they initiate and complete their pairing during the <b>zygotene</b> stage. After pachynema ends, the SC usually becomes disassembled and {{can no longer be}} identified.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unknown}} when chromomeres first {{appear on the}} chromosome. Chromomeres can be {{observed}} best when chromosomes are highly condensed. The chromomeres are present during leptotene phase of prophase I during meiosis. During <b>zygotene</b> phase of prophase I, the chromomeres of homologs align {{with each other to}} form homologous rough pairing (homology searching). These chromomeres helps provide a unique identity for each homologous pairs.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, {{infertility}} {{is one of}} {{the characteristics}} of individuals with mutational defects in the FANC genes. [...] In mice, spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, and spermatocytes in the meiotic stages of leptotene, <b>zygotene</b> and early pachytene are enriched for FANC proteins. [...] This finding suggests that recombinational repair processes mediated by the FANC proteins are active during germ cell development, particularly during meiosis, and that defects in this activity can lead to infertility.|$|E
5000|$|In the non-mutant mouse, FANCD2 is {{expressed}} in spermatogonia, pre-leptotene spermatocytes, and in spermatocytes in the leptotene, <b>zygotene</b> and early pachytene stages of meiosis. [...] In synaptonemal complexes of meiotic chromosomes, activated FANCD2 protein co-localizes with BRCA1 (breast cancer susceptibility protein). [...] FANCD2 mutant mice exhibit chromosome mis-pairing during the pachytene stage of meiosis and germ cell loss. [...] Activated FANCD2 protein may normally function prior to the initiation of meiotic recombination, perhaps to prepare chromosomes for synapsis, or to regulate subsequent recombination events.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leptotene}} stage, {{also known}} as the leptonema, is the first of five substages of prophase I in meiosis. The term leptonema derives from Greek words meaning [...] "thin threads". A cell destined to become a gamete enters the leptotene stage after its chromosomes are duplicated during interphase. During the leptotene stage those duplicated chromosomes—each consisting of two sister chromatids—condense from diffuse chromatin into long, thin strands that are more visible within the nucleoplasm. The next stage of prophase I in meiosis is the <b>zygotene</b> stage.|$|E
50|$|Meiosis I of ootidogenesis begins during {{embryonic}} development, but halts in the {{diplotene stage}} of prophase I until puberty. The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate (leptotene, <b>zygotene</b> and pachytene) stages of meiosis. For those primary oocytes {{that continue to}} develop in each menstrual cycle, however, synapsis occurs and tetrads form, enabling chromosomal crossover to occur. As a result of meiosis I, the primary oocyte has now developed into the secondary oocyte and the first polar body.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>zygotene</b> stage, {{also known}} as zygonema, from Greek words meaning [...] "paired threads", occurs as the {{chromosomes}} approximately line up with each other into homologous chromosome pairs. In some organisms, {{this is called the}} bouquet stage {{because of the way the}} telomeres cluster at one end of the nucleus. At this stage, the synapsis (pairing/coming together) of homologous chromosomes takes place, facilitated by assembly of central element of the synaptonemal complex. Pairing is brought about in a zipper-like fashion and may start at the centromere (procentric), at the chromosome ends (proterminal), or at any other portion (intermediate). Individuals of a pair are equal in length and in position of the centromere. Thus pairing is highly specific and exact. The paired chromosomes are called bivalent or tetrad chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the <b>zygotene</b> stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths. Structures called chiasmata are {{the site of the}} exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.|$|E

40|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between {{two kinds of}} tetraploids derived from the hybrid Lolium temulentum x L. perenne. One hybrid behaves like an {{autotetraploid}} with multivalents at first metaphase of meiosis in pollen mother cells. The other behaves like an allotetraploid, in which pairing at first metaphase is restricted to bivalents comprised of strictly homologous chromosomes. The ?diploidisation? of the latter form is controlled by determinants located on both the normal, A chromosomes and on supernumary B chromosomes. Reconstruction of synaptonemal complexes and their elements, from serial sections through pollen mother cell nuclei examined under the electron microscope, reveals that at <b>zygotene</b> pairing in both forms results in multivalent formation involving non-homologous as well as homologous chromosomes. The mechanism responsible for the diploidisation is, therefore, not based on a restriction of pairing at early meiosis to homologous chromosomes but on a ?correction? or transformation of the multivalent chromosome associations to bivalents subsequent to <b>zygotene.</b> The transformation is not completed until late pachytene. In the multivalent-forming tetraploid a maximum of four chromosomes are associated at first metaphase. Yet configurations of a higher valency are found at <b>zygotene.</b> There is, therefore, a partial transformation of multivalents even in this autotetraploid form which restricts configurations at metaphase I to homologous and homoeologous chromosomes only. In both hybrids some homologous bivalents are not the product of resolution of multivalents but result from two-by-two pairing {{from the beginning of}} <b>zygotene.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Autosomcs and sex {{chromosomes}} of mouse spermatocytes {{were examined}} during <b>zygotene,</b> pachytene, and diplotene by a whole-mount electron-microscope technique after cell dispersion in a detergent solution (Nonidet-P 4 o). <b>Zygotene,</b> pachytene, and diplotene stages can be adequately {{identified in the}} preparations. Thus, asynchronous side-by-side pairing of homologous autosomes, some of them displaying attached nucleoli, defines <b>zygotene.</b> Pachytene is identified by complete pairing of homologues. Diplotene is characterized by disjunction of bivalents (autosomes and sex chromosomes), lack of autosomal-attached nucleoli, divergent expansions observed at lateral element endings of disassembled synaptonemal complexes, end-to-end association of the XY pair and well defined outward deformations (' bulges') along sex chromosomal axial cores. X and Y chromosomes display at pachytene an extensive side-by-side pairing segment which decreases in length as meiotic prophase advances. Each sex chromosomal axial core appears double and is formed by close apposition of 2 nearly parallel elements displayed separately along {{the entire length of}} the chromosomal core. This double structural feature suggests that each sex chromosomal axial core is presumably composed of 2 chromatid axial cores, each of which, in turn, constitutes the respective lateral elements of short synaptonemal complexes observed at the unpaired segment...|$|E
40|$|Replication protein A (RPA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a component of early recombination nodules. It is thought to stimulate homo-logous pairing and strand exchange reactions. The expression pattern of RPA in human spermatocytes has been analysed using immunocytogenetic techniques on testicular biopsies from adult male patients.

Finally, it was determined that RPA is absent from non-centromeric heterochromatin in chromo-some 9. The observed bridge-like structure could be the visualization of a proposed pre-synaptic RPA role in the strand invasion that precedes the formation of a Holliday Junction.

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} homolog pairing is well characterised in meiosis of male mammals, but much less {{information}} is available from female meiosis. We have therefore studied telomere dynamics by FISH and synapsis formation by immunostaining of synaptonemal complex proteins (SCP 3, SCP 1) on ovarian sections from 15 bovine fetuses, which covered the entire female prophase I. Telomeres displayed a dispersed intranuclear distribution in oogonia and relocated to the nuclear periphery during the preleptotene stage. Tight telomere clustering (bouquet formation) coincided with synapsis initiation at the leptotene/zygotene transition. Clustering of telomeres persisted during <b>zygotene</b> and even into the pachytene stage in a subset of nuclei, while it was absent in diplotene/dictyotene stage nuclei. Thus, the bouquet stage in the bovine female lasts significantly longer than in the male. Further, we observed that synapsis in the female initiated both terminally and interstitially in earliest <b>zygotene</b> stage oocytes, which contrasts with the predominantly terminal synapsis initiation in early <b>zygotene</b> spermatocytes of the bovine male. Altogether, our data disclose a sex-specific difference in telomere dynamics and synapsis initiation patterns in male and female bovine germ cells that {{may be related to}} the sex-specific differences in recombination rates observed in this and other mammalian species...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We studied meiosis {{in three}} {{infertile}} patients presenting complete AZFc microdeletion and three controls. METHODS: Primary spermatocytes were immunolabeled with SCP 3, BRCA 1 and gH 2 AX. We quantified the leptotene, <b>zygotene</b> and pachytene stages, and pachytene abnormalities: asynapsis and fragmented and dotted synaptonemal complexes (SCs). RESULTS: SCP 3 level {{was significantly higher}} in leptotene and <b>zygotene</b> (bouquet) stages in patients, suggesting AZFc may have a direct effect on early prophase. SCs were abnormal in 77. 3 % of pachy-tene nuclei of patients versus 30. 8 % of controls. The two groups differed significantly (P < 0. 001) in asynapsed nuclei, fragmented SC and dotted SCs. In patients, asynapsis were short and limited to a few bivalents. Staging of pachytene nuclei based on the morphology of the XY pair with BRCA 1 revealed a prevalence of early pachytene substages (70. 7 %) in patients. H 2 AX was normally phosphorylated. CONCLUSIONS: In {{the absence of the}} AZFc region, the transient <b>zygotene</b> stage is extended, and chromosome condensation is reduced. The low level of limited asynapsis, the normal H 2 AX staining and the incomplete loss of germ cells at the pachytene checkpoint indicate that the AZFc region is not critical for meiotic recombination. We suggest that the pachytene phenotype develops secondarily to a primary defect that influences meiosis...|$|E
40|$|Early {{recombination}} nodules (ENs) are protein complexes approximately 100 nm {{in diameter}} {{that are associated}} with forming synaptonemal complexes (SCs) during leptotene and <b>zygotene</b> of meiosis. Although their functions are not yet clear, ENs may have roles in synapsis and recombination. Here we report on the frequency and distribution of ENs in <b>zygotene</b> SC spreads from six plant species that include one lower vascular plant, two dicots, and three monocots. For each species, the number of ENs per unit length is higher for SC segments than for (asynapsed) axial elements (AEs). In addition, EN number is strongly correlated with SC segment length. There are statistically significant differences in EN frequencies on SCs between species, but these differences are not related to genome size, number of chromosomes, or phylogenetic class. There is no difference in the frequency of ENs per unit length of SC from early to late <b>zygotene.</b> The distribution of distances between adjacent ENs on SC segments is random for all six species, but ENs are found at synaptic forks more often than expected for a random distribution of ENs on SCs. From these observations, we conclude that in plants: (1) some ENs bind to AEs prior to synapsis, (2) most ENs bind to forming SCs at synaptic forks, and (3) ENs do not bind to already formed SCs...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the behaviour of centromeres and distal telomeres {{during the initial}} phases of female meiosis in mice. In particular, we wished to determine whether clustering of centromeres and telomeres (bouquet formation) played the same crucial role in homologous chromosome pairing in female meiosis {{as it does in}} the male. We found that synapsis (intimate homologous chromosome pairing) is most frequently initiated in the interstitial regions of homologous chromosomes, apparently ahead of the distal regions. The proximal ends of the chromosomes appear to be disfavoured for synaptic initiation. Moreover, initiation of synapsis occurred in oocytes that showed little or no evidence of bouquet formation. A bouquet was present in a substantial proportion of cells at mid to late <b>zygotene,</b> and was still present in some pachytene oocytes. This pattern of bouquet formation and pairing initiation is in stark contrast to that previously described in the male mouse. We propose that although dynamic movements of centromeres and telomeres to form clusters may facilitate alignment of homologues or homologous chromosome segments during <b>zygotene,</b> in the female mouse positional control of synaptic initiation is dependent on some other mechanism.

40|$|Chromosome {{movements}} are a general feature of mid-prophase of meiosis. In budding yeast, meiotic chromosomes exhibit dynamic movements, led by nuclear envelope (NE) -associated telomeres, throughout the <b>zygotene</b> and pachytene stages. <b>Zygotene</b> motion underlies the global tendency for colocalization of NE-associated chromosome {{ends in a}} "bouquet. " In this study, we identify Csm 4 as a new molecular participant in these processes and show that, unlike the two previously identified components, Ndj 1 and Mps 3, Csm 4 is not required for meiosis-specific telomere/NE association. Instead, it acts to couple telomere/NE ensembles to a force generation mechanism. Mutants lacking Csm 4 and/or Ndj 1 display the following closely related phenotypes: (i) elevated crossover (CO) frequencies and decreased CO interference without abrogation of normal pathways; (ii) delayed progression of recombination, and recombination-coupled chromosome morphogenesis, with resulting delays in the MI division; and (iii) nondisjunction of homologs at the MI division for some reason other than absence of (the obligatory) CO(s). The recombination effects {{are discussed in the}} context of a model where the underlying defect is chromosome movement, the absence of which results in persistence of inappropriate chromosome relationships that, in turn, results in the observed mutant phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|In vitro, {{the human}} Rad 51 protein (hRad 51) {{promotes}} homologous pairing and strand exchange reactions suggestive {{of a key}} role in genetic recombination. To analyse its role in this process, polyclonal antibodies raised against hRad 51 were used to study the distribution of Rad 51 in human and mouse spermatocytes during meiosis I. In human spermatocytes, hRad 51 was found to form discrete nuclear foci from early <b>zygotene</b> to late pachytene. The foci always co-localized with lateral element proteins, components of the synaptonemal complex (SC). During <b>zygotene,</b> the largest foci were present in regions undergoing synapsis, suggesting that Rad 51 is a component of early recombination nodules. Pachytene nuclei showed a greatly reduced level of Rad 51 labelling, with the exceptions of any asynapsed autosomes and XY segments, which were intensely labelled. The distribution of Rad 51 in mouse spermatocytes was similar to that found in human spermatocytes, except that in this case Rad 51 was detectable at leptotene. From these results, we conclude that the Rad 51 protein has a role in the interhomologue interactions that occur during meiotic recombination. These interactions are spatially and temporally associated with synapsis during meiotic prophase I...|$|E

A low level of synthesis was observed before and after this period, in <b>zygotene</b> and late pachytene-early diplotene, extending the total time for extrachromosomal DNA synthesis during meiosis to about 18 days. These data allowed the calculation to be made that one round of replication of the amplified DNA takes between 1. 2 and 3. 0 days. It was also found that in both oogonial and premeiotic interphases, the nucleolus-associated DNA shows asynchronous (probably late) labeling with respect to the chromosomes...|$|E
