40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{phenomenon known as}} Zinc Whiskers, their potential and historic impact in modern computer data centers and the appropriate methods for reducing exposure to this fault vector. Experiential data is described (but not presented) and Compaq’s position with respect to incidents involving Zinc Whiskers is stated. Phenomenon Zinc Whiskers were first discovered in 1948 by Bell Labs in which a whisker on a zinc-plated bracket caused increased losses in quartz filters used in a telephone transmission system (1). The whiskers constitute a very serious anomaly that is causing problems ranging from inconvenience to complete havoc in today’s computer rooms. Zinc Whiskers originate from zinc electroplated products commonly used in computer rooms. Zinc (Zn) is an element used to prevent rusting or oxidation of steel. Steel pieces are coated (passivated) with zinc. This coating can either be zinc Hot Dipped Galvanized (HDG) or electroplated. The HDG coating is not associated with the <b>Zinc</b> <b>Whisker</b> contaminate and can be easily recognized by the irregular triangular (spangled...|$|E
50|$|Airborne <b>zinc</b> <b>whiskers</b> {{have been}} {{responsible}} for increased system failure rates in computer server rooms. <b>Zinc</b> <b>whiskers</b> grow from galvanized (electroplated) metal surfaces at a rate of up to 1 mm per year with a diameter of a few micrometres. Whiskers can form on the underside of zinc electroplated floor tiles on raised floors due to stresses applied when walking over them; and these whiskers can then become airborne within the floor plenum when the tiles are disturbed, usually during maintenance. Whiskers can be small enough to pass through air filters and can settle inside equipment, resulting in short circuits and system failure.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} several decades {{electrical}} short circuits induced by "Zinc Whiskers" have been cited as the root cause of failure for various electronic systems (e. g., apnea monitors, telecom switches). These tiny filaments of zinc that may grow from some zinc-coated items (especially those coated by electroplating processes) have the potential to induce electrical shorts in exposed circuitry. Through this article, the authors describe a particular failure scenario attributed to <b>zinc</b> <b>whiskers</b> that has affected many facilities (including some NASA facilities) that utilized zinc-coated raised "access" floor tiles and support structures. <b>Zinc</b> <b>whiskers</b> that may be growing beneath your raised floor have the potential to wreak havoc on electronic systems operating above the floor...|$|R
50|$|Raised {{floors and}} other metal {{structures}} such as cable trays and ventilation ducts have caused many problems with <b>zinc</b> <b>whiskers</b> in the past, and likely are still present in many data centers. This happens when microscopic metallic filaments form on metals such as zinc or tin that protect many metal structures and electronic components from corrosion. Maintenance on a raised floor or installing of cable etc. can dislodge the whiskers, which enter the airflow and may short circuit server components or power supplies, sometimes through a high current metal vapor plasma arc. This phenomenon {{is not unique to}} data centers, and has also caused catastrophic failures of satellites and military hardware.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Electroplated zinc finishes {{have been widely used}} in the packaging of electronic products for many years {{as a result of their}} excellent corrosion resistance and relatively low cost. However, the spontaneous formation of whiskers on zinc electroplated components, which are capable of resulting in electrical shorting or other damaging effects, can be highly problematic for the reliability of long life electrical and electronic equipment. To date, most research has focused on tin whiskers and much less attention has been paid to <b>zinc</b> <b>whisker</b> research. A number of mechanisms to explain <b>zinc</b> <b>whisker</b> growth have been proposed, but none of them are widely accepted and some are in conflict with each other. This study has investigated the mechanism for whisker growth from three commercial zinc electroplated coatings on mild steel substrates. Firstly, whisker growth from an alkaline cyanide-free zinc electrodeposit was studied. A reduction in deposition current density (from 50 to 5 mA/cm 2) and an increase in deposit thickness (from 2 to 15 μm) both contributed to reduced whisker growth. In terms of the mechanisms of whisker growth, it was observed that the presence of spherical raised surface features (nodules) with cavities beneath, promoted whisker growth by markedly shortening the incubation time from 5 months to 4 weeks. More importantly, the time dependent recrystallisation of the as-deposited columnar structure is closely associated with whisker growth from both nodules and planar regions of the deposit. The formation of Fe-Zn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) was not observed at either the Fe/Zn interface or within the electroplated coatings and does not appear to be associated with Zn whisker growth. Whisker growth from an acid chloride zinc electroplated coating and a Zn-Ni alloy electroplated coating were also investigated. These two coatings were immune to whisker growth after 18 months of storage at room temperature, regardless of deposition current density, deposit thickness and substrate surface modification. Finally, the effect of potential mitigation strategies on whisker growth was evaluated. Exposure to elevated temperatures (50 to 150 °C) for 24 hours promoted whisker growth by reducing the incubation time for whiskers to first appear from less than 4 weeks to less than 10 days, whilst whisker growth was significantly retarded when samples were subjected to a short period of thermal treatment (50 to 150 °C) for 0. 5 hour. More importantly, for a short period of thermal treatment, whisker mitigation became increasingly effective as the treatment temperature was raised. In addition, the formation of a trivalent chromium passive coating on the alkaline cyanide-free zinc electrodeposits immediately after deposition was not an effective mitigation method to retard whisker growth...|$|E
40|$|Zinc {{whiskers}} {{are tiny}} conductive filaments of zinc typically {{less than a}} few millimeters (mm) long {{and only a few}} thousandths of a millimeter in diameter. They grow from metal surfaces (e. g., steel) that have been electroplated (galvanized) with zinc for corrosion protection. The growth process consists of an unpredictable incubation period (months or perhaps even years) followed by a period of growth at rates as high as 1 mm/year. Zinc whiskers are conductive and therefore they will cause electrical shorts if they manage to bridge tightly-spaced electrical conductors. Now that zinc whisker-induced shorts have been so convincingly demonstrated, some former “seemingly inexplicable ” shorts are now regarded as explainable as having been caused by zinc whiskers. In recent years many computer equipment failures (servers, routers, switches, etc.) ranging from nuisance glitches to catastrophic system failures have been attributed to zinc whiskers. A search of the web shows that the most often reported source for zinc whiskers is the bottom surface of zinc-plated raised (“access”) floor tiles commonly used in computer room construction. Other sources of zinc whiskers include zinc-plated floor supports/rails, computer equipment racks and hardware such as screws, nuts, washers and bus rails. <b>Zinc</b> <b>whisker</b> sources on the underside of floor tiles are a long distance from electronic equipment in floor racks. However, experience demonstrates that whiskers are broken free during floor-bumping activities including construction and maintenance, and become entrained in the air flow used for cooling, and then deposit into the distant electronic equipment, as well as into people's lungs. Sometimes Zinc Whiskers find their way INSIDE equipment cabinets...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Transactions of the Institute of Metal Finishing [© W. S. Maney & Son Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] zinc finishes have been associated with the electronics industry for many years {{as a result of their}} excellent corrosion resistance and relatively low cost. They are normally applied onto ferrous products to provide corrosion protection in a range of different environments. However, the formation of spontaneously grown whiskers on zinc-electroplated components, which are capable of resulting in electrical shorting or other damaging effects, can be highly problematic for the reliability of long life electrical and electronic equipment. The growth of zinc whiskers has been identified as the cause of some electrical and electronic failures in telecommunications and aerospace-based applications, with consequences ranging from mild inconvenience to complete system failures. Investigators have been striving to address the problems induced by whisker growth since 1940 s. However, most research effort has been focused on tin whiskers, especially following European Union environmental legislation that restricted the use of lead (Pb), which when alloyed with tin (3 – 10 % by weight) provided effective tin whisker mitigation. Compared with tin whisker research, much less attention has been paid to zinc whiskers. A number of mechanisms to explain <b>zinc</b> <b>whisker</b> growth have been proposed, but none of them are widely accepted and some are in conflict with each other. The aim of this paper is to review the available literature in regard to zinc whiskers, to discuss the reported growth mechanisms, to evaluate the effect of deposition parameters and to explore potential mitigation methods. This paper presents a chronologically ordered review of zinc whisker-related studies from 1946 to 2013.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Physical, chemical and corrosion properties of a hexavalent chromium conversion coating (CCC) and that of a commercial third generation trivalent chromium system; Tripass LT 1500, on zinc electrodeposited steel has been studied. Moreover, the role of additives has been studied to elucidate film formation and corrosion resistance mechanisms. Micro-cracking and self-repair corrosion protection behaviour commonly associated with hexavalent CCCs has also been investigated. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) studies showed that for both hexavalent and trivalent CCCs were in general, flat with a spherical-like structure {{and in the case}} of the former microcracked beyond 122 nm conversion coating thickness. In general, the micro-crack pattern observed e. g. a dense crack network, depended upon the underlying zinc substrate morphology. The study has also demonstrated the effect of SEM imaging and prior specimen preparation conditions on hexavalent CCC micro-cracking and blistering. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and Infrared (IR) data has indicated that the hexavalent CCC film formation appears to be a electrochemical / sol-gel mechanism given the lack of zinc content at surface and subsurface regions within the conversion coating, presence of H 2 O and in particular the contribution of Cr(OH) 3 as opposed to Cr 2 O 3. An alternative film formation mechanism may exist for trivalent CCC given a higher proportion of zinc at surface and sub-surface regions, IR data analysis indicating that chromium is possibly deposited from a chromium (III) complex ion such as [CrC 2 O 4 (H 2 O) 4] +, moreover as Cr(OH) 3 and Cr 2 O 3 compounds as indicated by XPS data analysis. The role of cobalt nitrate during film formation is unclear given that cobalt was not detected within the trivalent CCC from XPS and AES data. Electrochemical LPR measurements, polarisation curves and XPS data has shown in general, self-repair corrosion protection properties for hexavalent CCC to be lacking. Instead, it is proposed that the corrosion protection behaviour for hexavalent and trivalent CCC to be barrier. Polarisation curves and LPR data showed that the corrosion resistance performance for trivalent CCC was higher than hexavalent CCC, in general. LPR data showed that the omission of cobalt nitrate and increased addition of sodium molybdate content within the Tripass LT 1500 treatment solution formulation was found to overall decrease corrosion resistance within the trivalent CCC. In addition, silica based topcoat and black trivalent CCCs was also investigated and characterised using AES, SEM and LPR. Zinc whiskers was also observed from zinc electrodeposits following exposure to thermal treatment (150 °C for 1 h). Elemental analysis and grain pattern investigations failed to help determine the cause of <b>zinc</b> <b>whisker</b> initiation.

In addition, the AuAgNPs were synthesized on a ZnO whisker-containing paper with a fiber-network microstructure, which was prepared via a papermaking technique. The paper-structured AuAgNPs composite possessed both a paper-like practical utility and a good catalytic performance.

40|$|For years, {{the alloy}} {{of choice for}} {{electroplating}} electronic components has been tin-lead (Sn-Pb) alloy. However, the legislation established in Europe on July 1, 2006, required significant lead (Pb) content reductions from electronic hardware due to its toxic nature. A popular alternative for coating electronic components is pure tin (Sn). However, pure tin has the tendency to spontaneously grow electrically conductive Sn whisker during storage. Sn whisker is usually a pure single crystal tin with filament or hair-like structures grown directly from the electroplated surfaces. Sn whisker is highly conductive, and can cause short circuits in electronic components, {{which is a very}} significant reliability problem. The damages caused by Sn whisker growth are reported in very critical applications such as aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and military weapons systems. They are also naturally very strong and are believed to grow from compressive stresses developed in the Sn coating during deposition or over time. The new directive, even though environmentally friendly, has placed all lead-free electronic devices at risk because of whisker growth in pure tin. Additionally, interest has occurred about studying the nature of other metal <b>whiskers</b> such as <b>zinc</b> (Zn) <b>whiskers</b> and comparing their behavior to that of Sn whiskers. Zn whiskers can be found in flooring of data centers which can get inside electronic systems during equipment reorganization and movement and can also cause systems failure. Even though the topic of metal whiskers as reliability failure has been around for several decades to date, there is no successful method that can eliminate their growth. This thesis will give further insights towards the nature and behavior of Sn and Zn whiskers growth, and recommend a novel manufacturing technique that has potential to mitigate metal whiskers growth and extend life of many electronic devices...|$|R
