40|$|The {{application}} of modern ceramics, uch as cordierite or partially stabilized <b>zircona</b> (PSZ), {{calls for more}} detailed data than those provided by conventional investigation of strength or crack-resistance harac-teristics. To provide data on deformational behaviour (including possible inelasticity), a parameter is proposed {{in the form of}} a 'brittleness measure', Z. A t X=I, a ceramic obeys Hooke's law and in its mechanical behaviour is similar to glass. At the same time, its behaviour under loading is like that of concrete and it does not correspond to the elastic-solid model. It has been found that aluminium oxide toughened by zirconium dioxide and zirconium dioxide stabilize...|$|E

The maximum SiO 2 content in desilicated {{zirconia}} is 91. 54 mass% ZrO 2, < 5. 39 mass% MgO) were produced successfully from zircon using a 150 kW plasma rotating furnace. The effects of time and carbon content on the desilication degree were investigated. The mixture treated in the plasma furnace included condensed phases Zr, ZrC, ZrN, ZrO 2, C, Si, SiC, SiO 2 and gaseous phases SiO, O- 2, N- 2, CO. The established phase equilibrium diagrams of the Si-C-N-O and Zr-C-N-O systems suggest that the formation Of Si 3 N 4 is thermodynamically impossible, and the formation of ZrC and ZrN is thermodynamically possible in the central high-temperature region of the plasma furnace. Experimental results supported the analyses. Desilicated <b>zircona</b> {{has a great}} variety of applications.

40|$|Material {{response}} was investigated {{with respect to}} normal grinding forces, surface roughness, and removal mechanisms in grinding of alumina, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, and <b>zircona</b> with a resin-bond 160 mum grit diamond wheel at the grinding speeds of up to 160 m/s. The results reveal that the normal grinding forces decreased significantly {{with an increase in}} grinding speed; they also increased substantially with an increase in a complex relation of the ceramic hardness and toughness. High speed grinding produced a reduction in surface roughness for silicon carbide and alumina but gave no improvement for zirconia and silicon nitride. Also the surface roughness in high speed grinding was found to be material-dependent that the ground silicon nitride exhibited much smoother than the other ground ceramics. The influence of grinding speed on material removal mechanisms was analyzed in terms of grinding geometry and ceramic material properties...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} the cyclic {{oxidation}} behaviour of thermal barrier coating systems. The systems consist of an yttria-stabilised <b>zircona</b> ceramic top coat deposited by EB-PVD, a β-(Ni, Pt) Al bond coat and a Ni-based superalloy. Two different superalloys are studied: a first-generation one and a fourth-generation one containing Re, Ru and Hf. The aim of this work is to characterise the microstructural evolution of those systems and to correlate it to their resistance to spallation. Thermal cycling is carried out at 1100 ° C in laboratory air, {{with the number of}} cycles ranging between 10 and 1000. Each cycle consists of a 1 h dwell followed by forced-air cooling for 15 min down to room temperature. Among the main results of this work, it is shown that the MCNG-based system is significantly more resistant to spallation than the AM 1 -based one. Up to 50 cycles, both systems exhibit similar oxidation rate and phase transformations but major differences are observed after long-term ageing. In particular, a Ru-rich β-phase is formed in the bond coat of the MCNG-based system while the AM 1 -based one undergoes strong rumpling of the TGO/bond coat interface due to the loss of the thermal barrier coating...|$|E
40|$|An anode-supported solid {{oxide fuel}} cell of 45 cm 2 area was {{operated}} during 9000 h as electrolyser cell at about 780 ◦C and − 1 Acm− 2 current density. The cell consisted of yttria-stabilised <b>zircona</b> (YSZ) as electrolyte, the hydrogen electrode of a nickel-YSZ cermet, and the oxygen electrode of strontium-substituted lanthanum ferrite/cobaltite (LSCF). The voltage loss under constant current operation {{over the entire}} experiment was 3. 8 % (40 mV) / 1000 h. This value also accounts for experimental incidents, e. g. contact deterioration due to mechanical shocks or a supply failure of feed gas. Degradation during the initial 5600 h was 2. 5 % / 1000 h. It was even lower during the incident-free period of the experiment, i. e. 1. 7 % / 1000 h from 2000 to 5600 h, close to the technical target for an electrolyser system. The low cell voltage (initial Ucell = 1. 06 V) together with the known nearly ideal faradaic efficiency mean an (electrical-to-chemical) energy-conversion efficiency ηel above the one achieved with electrolysis at low temperature, with ηel> 100 % up to 7600 h (with heat supply). Impedance spectroscopic results indicate that degradation results from an increase in ohmic electrolyte resistance {{as well as in}} the reaction overpotential of at least one electrode...|$|E
