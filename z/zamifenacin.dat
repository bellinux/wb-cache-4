40|$|The {{effects of}} muscarinic antagonists on {{cationic}} current evoked by activating muscarinic receptors with the stable agonist carbachol were studied {{by use of}} patch-clamp recording techniques in guinea-pig single ileal smooth muscle cells. Ascending concentrations of carbachol (3 – 300 [*]μM) activated the cationic conductance in a concentration-dependent manner with conductance at a maximally effective carbachol concentration (Gmax) of 27. 4 ± 1. 4 [*]nS and a mean −log EC 50 of 5. 12 ± 0. 03 (mean±s. e. mean) (n= 114). Muscarinic antagonists with higher affinity for the M 2 receptor, methoctramine, himbacine and tripitramine, produced a parallel shift of the carbachol concentration-effect curve to the right in a concentration-dependent manner with pA 2 values of 8. 1, 8. 0 and 9. 1, respectively. All M 3 selective muscarinic antagonists tested, 4 -DAMP, p-F-HHSiD and <b>zamifenacin,</b> reduced the maximal response in a concentration-dependent and non-competitive manner. This effect could be observed even at concentrations which did not produce any increase in the EC 50 for carbachol. At higher concentrations M 3 antagonists shifted the agonist curve to the right, increasing the EC 50, and depressed the maximum conductance response. Atropine, a non-selective antagonist, produced both reduction in Gmax (M 3 effect) and {{significant increase in the}} EC 50 (M 2 effect) in the same concentration range. The depression of the conductance by 4 -DAMP, <b>zamifenacin</b> and atropine could not be explained by channel block as cationic current evoked by adding GTPγS to the pipette (without application of carbachol) was unaffected. The results support the hypothesis that carbachol activates M 2 muscarinic receptors so initiating the opening of cationic channels which cause depolarization; this effect is potentiated by an unknown mechanism when carbachol activates M 3 receptors. As an increasing fraction of M 3 receptors are blocked by an antagonist, the effects on cationic current of an increasing proportion of activated M 2 receptors are disabled...|$|E
40|$|Cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) {{possess a}} {{standing}} outward potassium current (IK(SO)) which shares many similarities with current through the two-pore domain potassium channel TASK- 1 {{and which is}} inhibited following activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The action of muscarine on IK(SO) was unaffected by the M 2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (100 nm) but was blocked by the M 3 antagonist <b>zamifenacin,</b> which, at a concentration of 100 nm, shifted the muscarine concentration-response curve to the right by around 50 -fold. Surprisingly, M 3 receptor activation rarely produced a detectable increase in [Ca 2 +]i unless preceded by depolarization of the cells with 25 mm K+. Experiments with thapsigargin and ionomycin suggested that the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + stores in CGNs were depleted at rest. In contrast, cerebellar glial cells in the same fields of cells possessed substantial endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + stores at rest. Pretreatment of the cells with BAPTA AM, thapsigargin or the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U- 73122 all blocked the muscarine-induced Ca 2 + signal but {{had little or no}} effect on muscarinic inhibition of IK(SO). Raising [Ca 2 +]i directly with ionomycin caused a small but significant inhibition of IK(SO). It is concluded that muscarine acts on M 3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors both to inhibit IK(SO) and to mobilize Ca 2 + from intracellular stores in CGNs. While the mobilization of Ca 2 + occurs through activation of PLC, this {{does not seem to be}} the primary mechanism underlying muscarinic inhibition of IK(SO) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{characteristics of}} muscarinic receptors in rat isolated uterus were studied in ovariectomized (ov.) and sham operated (sh.) animals. Competition radioligand binding studies, using uterine membranes and [3 H]-NMS, were undertaken with several muscarinic receptor antagonists. Most of the antagonists indicated a one-site fit with apparent affinity estimates (pKi) unchanged by ovariectomy. The selective M 2 antagonist, tripitramine revealed high (representing 33 ± 8 and 38 ± 2 %) and low (67 ± 8 and 62 ± 2 %) affinity binding sites in both sh. and ov. rat uterus, respectively. These sites likely represented muscarinic M 2 and M 3 receptors and the proportions {{were not significantly}} different in the two conditions. Carbachol induced concentration-dependent contractions which were surmountably antagonized by several muscarinic receptor antagonists (pKB, sh.; ov.) : <b>zamifenacin</b> (9. 19; 9. 18), p-F-HHSiD (8. 50; 9. 06), tripitramine (7. 23; 7. 54), himbacine (7. 21; 7. 41), methoctramine (6. 79; 7. 49), pirenzepine (6. 48; 7. 21), AF DX 116 (6. 26; 6. 61), MTx 3 (< 7. 00; < 7. 00) and PD 102807 (< 7. 00; < 7. 00). The apparent affinity values obtained in functional studies using the uteri from both sh. and ov. animals correlated most closely with values reported at human recombinant muscarinic M 3 receptors. This suggests that the muscarinic M 3 receptor mediates contraction under both conditions. Radioligand binding experiments indicate the presence of M 2 receptors, in addition to M 3 receptors, which probably explains the discrepancies between functional and binding affinities. These data further suggest that the pharmacological profile and proportions of the two populations of muscarinic receptors are unaffected by ovariectomy...|$|E

(+) -Cis-dioxolane, oxotremorine-M, acetylcholine, carbachol and pilocarpine induced concentration-dependent contractions of the urinary bladder smooth muscle (pEC 50 = 6. 6 ± 0. 1, 6. 9 ± 0. 1, 6. 7 ± 0. 1, 5. 8 ± 0. 1 and 5. 8 ± 0. 1, EMax= 3. 2 ± 0. 8 [*]g, 2. 7 ± 0. 4 [*]g, 1. 0 ± 0. 1 [*]g, 2. 7 ± 0. 3 and 0. 9 ± 0. 2 [*]g, respectively, n= 4). These contractions were competitively antagonized by a range of muscarinic receptor antagonists (pKB values) : atropine (9. 22 ± 0. 09), pirenzepine (6. 85 ± 0. 08), 4 -DAMP (8. 42 ± 0. 14), methoctramine (5. 96 ± 0. 05), p-F-HHSiD (7. 48 ± 0. 09), tolterodine (8. 89 ± 0. 13), AQ-RA 741 (7. 04 ± 0. 12), s-secoverine (8. 21 ± 0. 09), <b>zamifenacin</b> (8. 30 ± 0. 17) and darifenacin (8. 70 ± 0. 09). In this tissue, the pKB values correlated most favourably with pKi values for these compounds at human recombinant muscarinic M 3 receptors. A significant correlation was also noted at human recombinant muscarinic m 5 receptors given the poor discriminative ability of ligands between M 3 and m 5 receptors. In recontraction studies, in which the muscarinic M 3 receptor population was decreased, and conditions optimized to study M 2 receptor activation, methoctramine exhibited an affinity estimate consistent with muscarinic M 3 receptors (pKB= 6. 23 ± 0. 14; pA 2 = 6. 16 ± 0. 03). Overall, these data study suggest that muscarinic M 3 receptors are the predominant, if not the exclusive, subtype mediating contractile responses to muscarinic agonists in male mouse urinary bladder smooth muscle...|$|E

(+) -Cis-dioxolane induced concentration-dependent contractions of the iris sphincter muscle (pEC 50 = 6. 41 ± 0. 10, Emax= 181 ± 17 [*]mg, n= 38) and urinary bladder smooth muscle (pEC 50 = 6. 97 ± 0. 04, Emax= 4. 28 ± 0. 25 [*]g, n= 54). These contractions were competitively antagonized by {{a range of}} muscarinic receptor antagonists (pKB values are given for the iris sphincter muscle and the bladder smooth muscle, respectively) : atropine (9. 30 ± 0. 07 and 9. 40 ± 0. 04), AQ-RA 741 (6. 35 ± 0. 04 and 6. 88 ± 0. 03), darifenacin (9. 56 ± 0. 05 and 9. 12 ± 0. 05), methoctramine (5. 75 ± 0. 07 and 5. 81 + 0. 06), oxybutynin (8. 10 ± 0. 09 and 8. 59 ± 0. 06), pirenzepine (6. 79 ± 0. 05 and 6. 89 ± 0. 04), secoverine (7. 54 ± 0. 05 and 7. 66 ± 0. 05), p-F-HHSiD (7. 55 ± 0. 09 and 7. 50 ± 0. 05) and <b>zamifenacin</b> (8. 69 ± 0. 10 and 8. 36 ± 0. 06). A significant correlation between the pKB values in the bladder and the pKB values in the iris was obtained. In both tissues, the pKB values correlated most favorably with pKi values for these compounds at human recombinant muscarinic m 3 receptors. A reasonable correlation was also noted at human recombinant muscarinic m 5 receptors given the poor discriminative ability of ligands between m 3 and m 5 receptors. Overall, the data from {{this study suggest that}} the muscarinic receptors mediating contraction of the rabbit iris sphincter muscle and urinary bladder smooth muscle are similar and equate most closely with the pharmacologically-defined muscarinic M 3 receptor...|$|E

These responses were antagonized by several muscarinic receptor antagonists (pKb values for the ciliary muscle and the bladder smooth muscle, respectively) : atropine (8. 25 ± 0. 14 and 9. 21 ± 0. 09), pirenzepine (6. 31 ± 0. 13 and 6. 70 ± 0. 25), tolterodine (7. 97 ± 0. 14 and 8. 68 ± 0. 12), oxybutynin (7. 40 ± 0. 08 and 7. 88 ± 0. 12), <b>zamifenacin</b> (6. 46 ± 0. 19 and 7. 69 ± 0. 11), S-secoverine (6. 66 ± 0. 14 and 8. 13 ± 0. 07), AQ-RA 741 (6. 16 ± 0. 15 and 7. 08 ± 0. 23), p-F-HHSiD (7. 10 ± 0. 27 and 7. 35 ± 0. 07) and responses were not antagonized by PD 102807 (up to 100 [*]nM). In urinary bladder smooth muscle, the profile of antagonist pKB values correlated significantly with pKi values at human recombinant m 3 muscarinic receptors, suggesting that M 3 muscarinic receptors mediated the response. In the ciliary muscle, a significant (P 8). The role of pigmentation in the atypical behaviour of darifenacin was examined. In blue coloured eyes, darifenacin produced apparent surmountable, competitive antagonism of the responses to (+) -cis-dioxolane (pKB= 8. 76 ± 0. 07). The antagonist profile obtained in this tissue suggested the involvement of a site which has the pharmacological attributes of the M 5 receptor. We suggest that the dog urinary bladder contracts in response to M 3 muscarinic receptor activation. Contraction of the brown-eyed dog ciliary muscle is more complex and may include involvement {{of at least two}} receptors, possibly the M 5 and M 3 receptor, whereas blue-eyed dog ciliary muscle may involve a single population of M 5 muscarinic receptors...|$|E
40|$|Although it {{is unclear}} to what extent {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms represent a normal perception of abnormal function or an abnormal perception of normal function, many believe that IBS constitutes the clinical expression of an underlying motility disorder, affecting primarily the mid- and lower gut. Indeed, transit and contractile abnormalities have been demonstrated with sophisticated techniques in a subset of patients with IBS. As a consequence, drugs affecting gastrointestinal (GI) motility have been widely employed {{with the aim of}} correcting the major IBS manifestations, ie, pain and altered bowel function. Unfortunately, no single drug has proven to be effective in treating IBS symptom complex. In addition, the use of some medications has often been associated with unpleasant side effects. Therefore, the search for a truly effective and safe drug to control motility disturbances in IBS continues. Several classes of drugs look promising and are under evaluation. Among the motor- inhibiting drugs, gut selective muscarinic antagonists (such as <b>zamifenacin</b> and darifenacin), neurokinin 2 antagonists (such as MEN- 10627 and MEN- 11420), beta 3 -adrenoreceptor agonists (eg, SR- 58611 A) and GI-selective calcium channel blockers (eg, pinaverium bromide and octylonium) are able to decrease painful contractile activity in the gut (antispasmodic effect), without significantly affecting other body functions. Novel mechanisms to stimulate GI motility and transit include blockade of cholecystokinin (CCK) A receptors and stimulation of motilin receptors. Loxiglumide (and its dextroisomer, dexloxiglumide) is the only CCKA receptor antagonist that is being evaluated clinically. This drug accelerates gastric emptying and colonic transit, thereby increasing the number of bowel movements in patients with chronic constipation. It is also able to reduce visceral perception. Erythromycin and related 14 -member macrolide compounds inhibit the binding of motilin to its receptors on GI smooth muscle and, therefore, act as motilin agonists. This antibiotic accelerates gastric emptying and shortens orocecal transit time. In the large bowel a significant decrease in transit is observed only in the right colon, which suggests a shift in fecal distribution. Several ‘motilinomimetics’ have been synthesized. Their development depends on the lack of antimicrobial activity and the absence of fading of the prokinetic effect during prolonged administration. 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 4 agonists with significant pharmacological effects on the mid- and distal gut (such as prucalopride and tegaserod) are available for human use. These ‘enterokinetic’ compounds are useful for treating constipation- predominant IBS patients. 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists also possess a number of interesting pharmacological properties that may make them suitable for treatment of IBS. Besides decreasing colonic sensitivity to distension, these drugs prolong intestinal transit and may be particularly useful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Finally, when administered in small pulsed doses, octreotide, besides reducing the perception of rectal distension, accelerates intestinal transit, although other evidence disputes such an effect...|$|E
