5|$|The Blastocladiomycota were {{previously}} considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent molecular data and ultrastructural characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are saprotrophs, feeding on decomposing organic matter, {{and they are}} parasites of all eukaryotic groups. Unlike their close relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit <b>zygotic</b> meiosis, the blastocladiomycetes undergo sporic meiosis.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{bands that}} emerged from Wales include the Beatles-nurtured power pop group Badfinger in the 1960s, Man and Budgie in the 1970s and the Alarm in the 1980s. Many groups emerged during the 1990s, led by Manic Street Preachers, {{followed}} {{by the likes of}} the Stereophonics and Feeder; notable during this period were Catatonia, Super Furry Animals, and Gorky's <b>Zygotic</b> Mynci who gained popular success as dual-language artists. Recently successful Welsh bands include Lostprophets, Bullet for My Valentine, Funeral for a Friend and Kids in Glass Houses. The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers and bands such as Carreg Lafar, Fernhill, Siân James and the Hennessys.|$|E
25|$|Sex and {{reproduction}} are separate in ciliates. C. uncinata {{is capable of}} mating with other C. uncinata cells that have the same mating type. After mating type complementary, the germ-line nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce <b>zygotic</b> nuclei. Each conjugated cell transfers one <b>zygotic</b> nucleus to the other cell where the <b>zygotic</b> nuclei fuse. The diploid germ-line nucleus undergoes mitosis which creates a duplicated germ-line nucleus. At this point the somatic nucleus is being degraded.|$|E
25|$|While oscillatory {{transcription}} plays a {{key role}} in the progression of the yeast cell cycle, the CDK-cyclin machinery operates independently in the early embryonic cell cycle. Before the midblastula transition, <b>zygotic</b> transcription does not occur and all needed proteins, such as the B-type cyclins, are translated from maternally loaded mRNA.|$|E
25|$|Dinocysts or dinoflagellate cysts are {{typically}} 15 to 100µm {{in diameter and}} produced by around 15–20% of living dinoflagellates as a dormant, <b>zygotic</b> stage of their lifecycle, which can accumulate in the sediments as microfossils. Organic-walled dinocysts are often resistant and made out of dinosporin. There are also calcareous dinoflagellate cysts and siliceous dinoflagellate cysts.|$|E
25|$|They {{began their}} own {{collaboration}} in 1991. The brothers have often made pieces with plastic models or fibreglass mannequins of people. An early piece consisted of eighty-three scenes {{of torture and}} disfigurement derivative of those recorded by Francisco Goya in his series of etchings, The Disasters of War (a work they later returned to) rendered into small three-dimensional plastic models. One of these was later turned into a life-size work, Great Deeds Against the Dead, shown along with <b>Zygotic</b> Acceleration, Biogenetic, De-Sublimated Libidinal Model (Enlarged x 1000) at the Sensation exhibition in 1997.|$|E
25|$|In {{more modern}} times {{there has been}} a {{thriving}} musical scene. Bands and artists which have gained popularity include acts such as Man, Budgie, and solo artists John Cale & Mary Hopkin in the early 1970s and solo artists Bonnie Tyler and Shakin' Stevens in the 1980s. These were followed by a wave of acts in the 1990s and early 21st century which produced a credible Welsh 'sound' embraced by the public and the media press of Great Britain. Such acts included the Manic Street Preachers, Stereophonics, Catatonia, Super Furry Animals and Gorky's <b>Zygotic</b> Mynci; the latter two bands being notable for bringing Welsh language songs to a British audience.|$|E
25|$|In the {{non-traditional}} arena, many Welsh musicians {{have been}} present in popular rock and pop, either as individuals, (e.g. Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, Dave Edmunds, Shakin' Stevens), individuals in groups (e.g. John Cale of The Velvet Underground, Green Gartside of Scritti Politti, Julian Cope of Teardrop Explodes and Andy Scott of Sweet, Roger Glover of Deep Purple and Rainbow), or as bands formed in Wales (e.g. Amen Corner, The Alarm, Man, Budgie, Badfinger, Tigertailz, Young Marble Giants), but not until the 1990s did Welsh bands begin {{to be seen as}} a particular grouping. Following on from an underground post-punk movement in the 1980s, led by bands like Datblygu and Fflaps, the 1990s saw a considerable flowering of Welsh rock groups (in both Welsh and English languages) such as Catatonia, Manic Street Preachers, Feeder, Stereophonics, Super Furry Animals, The Pooh Sticks, 60ft Dolls and Gorky's <b>Zygotic</b> Mynci.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s and 1980s were a less {{influential}} {{time for}} Welsh popular music, with many Welsh acts, such as Bonnie Tyler and Shakin' Stevens, being commercially successful but through mimicking American music styles such as Motown or Rock and Roll. The Welsh language scene saw {{a dip in}} commercial popularity, but a rise in experimentation with acts such as punk band Trwynau Coch leading into a 'New Wave' of music. Bands that followed, like Anhrefn and Datblygu, found support from BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, {{one of the few}} DJs outside Wales to champion Welsh language music. In the 1990s, the Welsh pop scene flourished, with the emergence of Manic Street Preachers and the Stereophonics, who although not singing in Welsh, brought a sense of Welshness through iconography, lyrics and interviews. The same period saw Catatonia, Super Furry Animals and Gorky's <b>Zygotic</b> Mynci, bilingual bands that were successful enough to bring the Welsh language to an English speaking audience.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, {{research}} horticulturist David W. Ramming and technician Ronald L. Tarailo—Californian grape breeders {{working for}} the ARS, the chief scientific research agency of the USDA—crossed Thompson Seedless and Concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel, superior seedless grapes. [...] The researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs (<b>zygotic)</b> instead of the maternal tissue (somatic). [...] From 1231emasculations (removal of male flower parts to control pollination) of Thompson Seedless, the researchers produced 130ovules using embryo rescue procedures. [...] From these, 40embryos developed and three seedlings were planted. [...] The original seedling of Thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with California State University, Fresno. [...] It was later selected in 1986 by Ramming and Tarailo and tested in the San Joaquin Valley under the name A29-67, and was introduced as [...] "Thomcord." ...|$|E

50|$|The cycles {{differ in}} when mitosis (growth) occurs. <b>Zygotic</b> meiosis and gametic meiosis have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the n phase in <b>zygotic</b> meiosis {{and during the}} 2n phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, <b>zygotic</b> and gametic meiosis are collectively termed haplobiontic (single mitotic phase, not to be {{confused}} with haplontic). Sporic meiosis, on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed diplobiontic ({{not to be confused}} with diplontic).|$|E

50|$|Nucellar embryony (notated Nu+) {{is a form}} of seed {{reproduction}} {{that occurs}} in certain plant species, including many citrus varieties. During the development of seeds from plants that possess this genetic trait, the nucellar tissue which surrounds the megagametophyte can produce additional embryos (polyembryony) which are genetically identical to the parent plant. These nucellar seedlings are clones of the parent. By contrast, <b>zygotic</b> seedlings are sexually produced and inherit genetic material from both parents. <b>Zygotic</b> and nucellar embryos can occur in the same seed, and a <b>zygotic</b> embryo can divide to produce multiple embryos.|$|E
5000|$|Maternal to <b>zygotic</b> {{transition}} (MZT) is {{the stage}} in embryonic development during which development comes under the exclusive control of the <b>zygotic</b> genome. This requires both <b>zygotic</b> genome activation (ZGA) and degradation of maternal products. MZT is often thought to be synonymous with midblastula transition (MBT), but these processes are, in fact, distinct. However, the MBT roughly coincides with ZGA in many metazoans, and thus may share some common regulatory features. For example, both processes are proposed to be regulated by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio. MBT strictly refers {{to changes in the}} cell cycle and cell motility that occur just prior to gastrulation. In the early cleavage stages of embryogenesis, rapid divisions occur synchronously and there are no [...] "gap" [...] stages in the cell cycle. During these stages, there is also little to no transcription of mRNA from the <b>zygotic</b> genome, but <b>zygotic</b> transcription is not required for MBT to occur. Cellular functions during early cleavage are carried out primarily by maternal products - proteins and mRNAs contributed to the egg during oogenesis.|$|E

5000|$|In the <b>zygotic</b> {{life cycle}} the {{organism}} is haploid instead, spawned by the proliferation and differentiation {{of a single}} haploid cell called the gamete. Two organisms of opposing sex contribute their haploid gametes to form a diploid zygote. The zygote undergoes meiosis immediately, creating four haploid cells. These cells undergo mitosis to create the organism. Many fungi and many protozoa utilize the <b>zygotic</b> life cycle.|$|E
