40|$|Hospital-based {{studies suggest}} that {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) infection causes frequent cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality, but epidemiologic studies have shown less morbidity and mortality. The authors performed a retrospective cohort study of 10, 259 recombinant immunoblot assay-confirmed, HCV antibody-positive (HCV+), allogeneic blood donors from 1991 to 2002 and 10, 259 HCV antibody-negative (HCV-) donors matched for year of donation, age, gender, and <b>Zone</b> <b>Improvement</b> <b>Plan</b> <b>Code</b> (ZIP Code). Vital status through 2003 {{was obtained from the}} US National Death Index, and hazard ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated by survival analysis. After a mean follow-up of 7. 7 years, there were 601 (2. 92 %) deaths: 453 HCV+ and 148 HCV- (hazard ratio (HR) = 3. 13, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 60, 3. 76). Excess mortality in the HCV+ group was greatest in liver-related (HR = 45. 99, 95 % CI: 11. 32, 186. 74), drug- or alcohol-related (HR = 10. 81, 95 % CI: 4. 68, 24. 96), and trauma/suicide (HR = 2. 99, 95 % CI: 2. 05, 4. 36) causes. There was also an unexpected increase in cardiovascular mortality among the HCV+ donors (HR = 2. 21, 95 % CI: 1. 41, 3. 46). HCV infection is associated with a significant, threefold increase in overall mortality among former blood donors, including significantly increased mortality from liver and cardiovascular causes. High rates of mortality from drug/alcohol and trauma/suicide causes are likely due to lifestyle factors and may be at least partially preventable. © The Author 2008.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Army relies on <b>Zone</b> <b>Improvement</b> <b>Plan</b> (ZIP) <b>codes</b> to assign recruiters and to track recruit production. ZIP codes have different densities of potential recruits; the Army uses commercial market segmentation data to analyze markets and past accessions to assign recruiters and quotas to maximize production. We use 347 variables from publicly available United States government agencies {{for each of}} 34, 007 ZIP codes to cluster ZIP codes into similar groups. We use between 2 and 18 clusters for each of five categories of data, using three dissimilarity calculation methods, and three clustering algorithms. Using national recruiting leads {{as a proxy for}} market potential, we find the best cluster assignment by fitting Poisson regressions predicting leads from ZIP code cluster membership. Economic cluster assignments predict leads with a pseudo R-squared value of 0. 69, reducing the need for United States Army Recruiting Command to rely on proprietary data with 66 market segments per ZIP code for market analysis and predicting recruiting potential. These 18 clusters provide an easier tool for recruiting commanders. Additionally, these clusters offer a new method of identifying potentially high-production ZIP codes without using previous accessions and the highly correlated number of recruiters assigned as predictor variables.

5000|$|Robert Aurand Moon (April 15, 1917, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, USA [...] - [...] April 11, 2001, Leesburg, Florida, USA), {{sometimes}} called [...] "Mr. ZIP", {{is considered the}} father of the ZIP <b>Code</b> or <b>Zone</b> <b>Improvement</b> <b>Plan,</b> a mechanism to route mail in the United States. He developed the idea in the 1940s while working as a postal inspector in Philadelphia, although his system used only the first three digits of what became a five-digit, and later a nine-digit, system. The first Directory of Post Offices using five-digit ZIP code numbers was published in 1963.|$|R
2500|$|By 1930 {{or earlier}} {{the idea of}} {{extending}} postal district or zone numbering plans beyond large cities to cover even small towns and rural locales was in the air. These developed into postal codes as we define them today. (The name of US postal codes, [...] "ZIP codes", reflects this evolutionary growth from a zone <b>plan</b> to a <b>zone</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> [...]) Modern postal codes were first introduced in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in December 1932, but the system was abandoned in 1939. The next country to introduce postal codes was Germany in 1941, followed by Argentina in 1958, the United States in 1963 and Switzerland in 1964. The United Kingdom began introducing its current system in Norwich in 1959, {{but they were not}} used nationwide until 1974.|$|R

40|$|PROBLEM: Many {{patients}} are {{not satisfied with}} the accessibility and availability of general practice, and {{they would like to see}} improvement. DESIGN: Quality-improvement study with pre-intervention and post-intervention data collection in 36 general practices. SETTING: General practices located in the south of The Netherlands. KEY MEASURES FOR IMPROVEMENT: Patient satisfaction, experiences and awareness; practice information; and experiences of a mystery patient. STRATEGY FOR CHANGE: The practices received feedback about their accessibility and availability compared with data from practices of colleagues. The practices developed practice-based <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> using these feedback results. EFFECTS OF CHANGE: Eighty per cent of the <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> were completed or almost completed in 5 months. After the intervention, the accessibility by phone within 2 min increased significantly (10 % improvement). The practices that designed an <b>improvement</b> <b>plan</b> showed a larger increase (25 % improvement) than practices that did not. Patient awareness of an information leaflet and a separate telephone number for emergency calls also significantly increased (29 % improvement and 12 % improvement) in practices that designed <b>improvement</b> <b>plans.</b> LESSONS LEARNED: Feedback and practice-based <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> were a stimulus to work on and to improve accessibility and availability. All practices started <b>improvement</b> <b>plans,</b> but the overall effect of the changes was modest. This may be due to acceptable accessibility and availability before the intervention was introduced and to the time period of 5 months, which seemed to be too short to complete all practice-based <b>improvement</b> <b>plans.</b> The mystery patient was more satisfied with the accessibility than the real patients. This may be related to our concept of accessibility. We learned that adding a mystery patient for data collection can contribute to more objective measurements of practice accessibility than patient questionnaires alone...|$|R

40|$|This article explores school <b>improvement</b> <b>planning</b> under {{conditions}} of high-stakes accountability {{by means of a}} content analysis of school <b>improvement</b> <b>plans.</b> The schools examined here were identified by their accountability agencies as low performing and were put on probation to reverse their decline. Schools in three accountability systems are compared. Content analyses indicated that school <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> across the three jurisdictions were very similar, suggesting institutional isomorphism. However, certain policy design features prompted variation in the levels of internalization of exter-nal demands by school sites. School <b>improvement</b> <b>plans</b> (SIPs) are a widespread feature in high-stakes accountability systems. SIPs are often a mandatory feature for schools put on probation by their accountability agency for persistently low performance. In many accountability systems, accountability agencies treat SIPs as central to a school’s path back to healthy performance. Often, SIPs are extensive docu-ments subject to official review and approval. Whether they are hastily thrown together or carefully crafted, these SIPs are vivid testimony to the way schools (and districts) think about the task of school improvement unde...|$|R
