25|$|The other effect {{occurred}} when the dish was pointed towards the ground, causing a strong return that produced a sharp return on the display. Due to the circular scanning pattern, the dish would be pointed to the sides when the beam first struck the ground, continuing to strike the ground while the scanner continued rotating until it is pointed down, and then back up until the beam no longer intersects the ground again. Since the beam strikes the ground at a point closer to the aircraft when it is pointed straight down, the returns during this period are closest to the zero ring. When the reflector rotated further to the sides the beam would strike the ground further away and produce blips further from the <b>zero</b> <b>line.</b> Conveniently, the geometry of the situation causes the returns to form a series of straight lines, producing an effect similar to an artificial horizon.|$|E

40|$|At the {{interface}} between two-dimensional materials with different topologies, topologically protected one-dimensional states (also named as zero-line modes) arise. Here, {{we focus on the}} quantum anomalous Hall effect based zero-line modes formed at {{the interface}} between regimes with different Chern numbers. We find that, these zero-line modes are chiral and unilaterally conductive due to the breaking of time-reversal invariance. For a beam splitter consisting of two intersecting <b>zero</b> <b>lines,</b> the chirality ensures that current can only be injected from two of the four terminals. Our numerical results further show that, in the absence of contact resistance, the (anti-) clockwise partitions of currents from these two terminals are the same owing to the current conservation, which effectively simplifies the partition laws. We find that the partition is robust against relative shift of Fermi energy, but can be effectively adjusted by tuning the relative magnetization strengths at different regimes or relative angles between <b>zero</b> <b>lines.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
