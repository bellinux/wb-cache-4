40|$|The {{influence}} of a double bond {{in the middle of}} an otherwise flexible hydrocarbon chain on the melting of such assemblies has been investigated by comparing the melting behavior of zinc stearate and <b>zinc</b> <b>oleate.</b> By monitoring features in the infrared spectra that are characteristic of the global conformation of the hydrocarbon chain, it is shown that the double bond effectively decouples the thermal evolution of conformational disorder in the chain segments oil either side of the double bond and the melting of each of these segments in the assembly occurs as independent events. ...|$|E
40|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostar {{synthesized}} {{by simple}} and up-scalable microwave-assisted surfactant free hydrolysis method was applied as catalyst for biodiesel synthesis through one-step simultaneous esterification and transesterification from high {{free fatty acid}} (FFA) contaminated unrefined feedstock. It was found that ZnO nanostar catalyst was reacted with FFA to yield <b>zinc</b> <b>oleate</b> (ZnOl) as intermediate and finally became zinc glycerolate (ZnGly). With the re-deposition of ZnGly back to the ZnO nanostar catalyst {{at the end of}} the reaction, the catalyst can be easily recovered and stay active for five cycles. Furthermore, the rate of transesterification is highly promoted by the presence of FFA (6 wt. %) which makes it an efficient catalyst for low grade feedstock like waste cooking oil and crude plant oils.

40|$|The linear {{saturated}} {{stearic acid}} and the bent mono-unsaturated oleic acid do not mix and form solid solutions. However, the zinc salts of these acids can. From X-ray diffraction and DSC measurements {{we show that}} the layered zinc stearate and <b>zinc</b> <b>oleate</b> salts form a homogeneous solid solution at all composition ratios. The solid solutions exhibit a single melting endotherm, with the melting temperature varying linearly with composition but with the enthalpy change showing a minimum. By monitoring features in the infrared spectra that are characteristic of the global conformation of the hydrocarbon chain, and hence can distinguish between stearate and oleate chains, it is shown that solid solution formation is realized {{by the introduction of}} gauche defects in a fraction of the stearate chains that are then no longer linear. This fraction increases with oleate concentration. It has also been possible from the spectroscopic measurements to establish a quantitative relation between molecular conformational order and the thermodynamic enthalpy of melting of the solid solutions...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} non-hydrolytic {{solution}} phase synthesis of two-dimensional zinc oxide (ZnO) nanopellets by using self-made organometallic compound (<b>zinc</b> (II) <b>oleate,</b> Zn(C 18 H 33 O 2) 2) as single precursor. Zn(C 18 H 33 O 2) 2 is prepared by ion exchange reaction between non-toxic fatty acid (palm oil extract) and ion Zn 2 +. The controlling process of thermal pyrolysis of precursor {{is carried out}} under inert argon (Ar) atmosphere. This technique is very effective and reproducible in controlling the shape of ZnO semiconductor nanostructures. The as-synthesized ZnO nanocrystals are found in two-dimensionally well-faceted triangular and hexagonal thin pellet structures. Transmission electron micrograph(s) (TEM) show that the morphologies of ZnO nanopellets can be controlled by annealing duration. X-ray powder diffraction patterns reveal that all the peaks of ZnO nanopellets can be well indexed with standard hexagonal phase of ZnO crystal structure. Â© 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Isolated rabbit hepatocytes were {{incubated}} with [35 S]methionine {{to label}} intracellular pools of apolipoprotein B (apo-B). The cells were then reincubated with {{an excess of}} unlabelled methionine {{in the presence of}} oleate or protease inhibitors and the intracellular sites of accumulation of radiolabelled apo-B and the mass of apo-B were determined by isolation and analysis of subcellular fractions. Oleate or inhibitors of metalloproteases (o-phenanthroline), serine proteases (aprotinin), serine/cysteine proteases (leupeptin) or cysteins proteases (calpain inhibitor I; ALLN) but not aspartate proteases (pepstatin) resulted in inhibition of the cellular degradation of apo-B. The effect of o-phenanthroline was reversed by the addition of <b>zinc</b> ions. <b>Oleate,</b> o-phenanthroline and leupeptin also stimulated secretion of radiolabelled apo-B; the effects of the inhibitors and oleate were additive, suggesting that they could act via different mechanisms. o-Phenanthroline caused accumulation of apo-B in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) membranes; leupeptin caused accumulation of apo-B in the SER and cis-Golgi membranes, and ALLN and aprotinin caused accumulation of apo-B in the trans-Golgi membranes. These results suggest that intracellular degradation of apo-B occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the trans-Golgi membranes and involves different proteases. Apo-B that accumulates in the ER membrane can be diverted into the lumen for secretion; however, apo-B that accumulates in the trans-Golgi membrane is irretrievably diverted from secretion...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{conformation}} and phase-transitions in anchored alkyl chain bilayer assemblies in organic-inorganic hybrids. The alkyl chain bilayers in organic-inorganic hybrids bear a striking resemblances to the lipid bilayers that {{are an integral part}} of biomembranes. However, unlike the lipid bilayer where individual lipid molecules can undergo the total absence of translational mobility. The anchored bilayer are, therefore, the simplest model system for understanding the structure, organization and thermal behaviour of alkyl-chain assemblies. The anchored bilayer in the organic-inorganic hybrids also offer the advantage that unlike the lipid bilayers that are essentially fluid like, these are solids and therefore, amenable to study by a variety of solid-state spectroscopic techniques. The objective of the present works was to determine the organization, conformation and thermal behaviour of alkyl chains in these class of materials- the alkyl ammonium layered pervoskites and in zinc soaps of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The preparation, conformation and orientation of alkyl chains assemblies in the layered(CH 3 CH 2) nNH 3) 2 PbI 4 is described in chapter 2 and the phase-transitions and associated changes in conformation in presented in chapter 3. In chapter 4 the preparation, structure, conformation and phase-transitions of alkyl chains in the m = 2 member of the layered (CH 3 NH 3) m- 1 (CH 3 CH 2) nNH 3) 2 PbmI 3 m+ 1 Ruddleson-Popper series is discussed. The thermal behavior of zinc soaps of saturated fatty acids is discussed in chapter 5 and formation and phase-transitions in solid solution between saturated zinc soaps of differing chain lengths, zinc stearate and zinc myristate is presented in chapter 6. The effect of a rigid link or double bond on the evolution of conformational disorder and phase-transitions of other-wise flexible hydrocarbon chains is explored in chapter 7 by comparing the thermal behavior of <b>zinc</b> <b>oleate</b> and zine elaidate with that of zinc stearate. A unique feature of the zinc soaps is that they form solid solutions over the entire composition range feature of the zinc soaps is that they form solid solutions over the entire composition range between soaps of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The formation and conformation of alkyl chains in the solid solution of zinc stearate and <b>zinc</b> <b>oleate</b> is discussed in chapter 8...|$|E
30|$|Zn 1 −xS {{composite}} shells for getting a longer PL peak wavelength, {{as well as}} high stability and PL efficiency. However, very little reports focused on the NIR emission of composite cores coated with a higher band gap composited shell. Recently, Pons et al. reported that near-infrared-emitting CdTeSe/CdZnS core/shell QDs prepared using cadmium oxide (CdO), zinc oxide (ZnO), tetradecylphosphonic acid (TDPA), cadmium oleate (Cd(OA) 2), and <b>zinc</b> <b>oleate</b> (Zn(OA) 2) as precursors revealed a high stability [10]. Because of decreased lattice mismatch between the core and the shell, the interface strain decreases dramatically during the shell growth, indicating that the spatial distribution of defects in core/shell QDs can be controlled by the shell growth. A {{better understanding of the}} shell effect on optical properties of QDs is important for optimizing the synthesis. Because Cd-based QD is undesirable for biological imaging due to toxicity, a CdZnS shell with a ZnS-rich layer coated on the surface of CdSe is used to decrease the release of Cd ions in this paper. We further have a technique of glass coating {{on the surface of the}} QDs as well for the purpose of drastically reducing the amount of Cd released from the QDs as demonstrated in the previous publications [11, 12].|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the oral}} cavity, {{orthodontic}} appliances {{come into contact}} with saliva which may cause corrosion capable of changing their surface morphology due to the release of metal ions. Surface roughness can influence the effectiveness of tooth movement. One of the ions possibly released when body fluid comes into contact with brackets and archwire is nickel ion (Ni). Ni, {{one of the most popular}} components of orthodontic appliances, is, however, a toxic element that could potentially increase the likelihood of health problems such as allergic responses during treatment. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different artificial salivary pH on the ions released and the surface morphology of stainless steel (SS) brackets-nickel-titanium (NiTi) and archwire combinations. Methods: Brackets and archwires were analyzed by an Energy Dispersive X-Ray Detector System (EDX) to determine their composition, while NiTi archwire compound was examined by means of X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The immersion test was performed at artificial salivary pH levels of 4. 2; 6. 5; and 7. 6 at 37 °C for 28 days. Ni ion release measurement was performed using an Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). Surface morphology was analyzed by means of a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results: The chemical composition of all orthodontic appliances contained Ni element. In addition, XRD was depicted phases not only NiTi but also Ni, Titanium, Silicon and <b>Zinc</b> <b>Oleate.</b> The immersion test showed that the highest release of Ni ions occured at a pH of 4. 2, with no significant difference at various levels of pH (p=. 092). There were surface morphology changes in the orthodontic appliances. It was revealed that at a pH of 4. 2, the surfaces of orthodontic appliances become unhomogenous and rough compared to those at other pH concentrations. Conclusion: The reduction of pH in the artificial saliva increases the amount of released Ni ions, as well as causing changes to the surface morphology of brackets and archwires...|$|E
