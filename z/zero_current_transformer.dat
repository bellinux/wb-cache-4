The ELCB is an important equipment to install at each of house, hospital, factory, or every place that need the power supply.

Beam lifetime measurements required a resolution of a few ppm (parts per million). This technology has many potential applications and is specially interesting for very high precision current measurements in the standards laboratories.

In the case of CT selection, protection engineer has to pay attention on transient behavior as well as steady state performance of <b>current</b> of <b>transformers.</b> Transient performance of <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> varies with system parameters and <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> parameters.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is <b>Current</b> <b>Transformer</b> Transient {{response}} study using an electromagnetic Transient program (EMTP). <b>Current</b> <b>transformers</b> are considered eyes for power system protection. Behaviours of protection systems depend largely on information fed to them by instrument <b>transformers.</b> Ferromagnetic <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> have for many years provided practical method of current measurement, however there are limitations associated with <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> operation:- notably, difficult in maintaining accuracy over {{the full range of}} operating conditions, and most particularly <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> tendency to suffer saturation of iron core during severe faults, with accompanying severe ratio or loss of output. These limitations might lead to mal operation of protective relays due to distorted inputs from <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> particularly in transient periods. This thesis involved studying the behaviour of <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> in both steady state and transient periods. An emphasis being put on transient periods which are very crucial in behaviour of <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> because transformation errors are greatest in these periods. Errors in <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> transformation might affect operation of entire protection schemes. Maloperation of <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> in transient periods have very bad effect on relay co-ordination and worst condition might be failure of protection scheme operation altogether. Over the past decades engineers have been trying to develop a <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> model that would represent a <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> well in transient periods. It has proved to be rather difficult {{to come up with a}} single detailed model that would satisfy all possible conditions. This is due to non-linearity of magnetising curve and saturation effects of <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> iron cores. The author has considered different <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> models with their merits and demerits being highlighted. It has been shown that different <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> models have to be used when considering different operating conditions of a <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> in a power system. ATP-EMTP an Electromagnetic Transient Program was developed in the sixties for the study of electromagnetic transients in power systems. It has proved to be a very useful tool in this regard. The program development is still going on today to accommodate a wide application in power systems. Several components have been developed to represent different components in a power system. It is only recently that there has been a growing interest to include modelling of protective equipment. This has been accelerated by the inclusion of MODELS in the EMTP program. This thesis explores the effect of transients taking into account different conditions like transient fault currents, effects of high frequency waves and surges. Effects of different types of burdens on <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> were explored as well. Due to limitations of EMTP, simulation results are only applicable to <b>current</b> <b>transformers</b> with ARMCO M 4 oriented steel with ungapped cores. The author arrived at several conclusions. The most important conclusion is that mal operation of protective relays due to <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> saturation can be avoided easily if proper <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> selection is given priority in power protection design. EMTP package proved to be very useful and handy when studying transients though one has to be careful with numerical oscillations which might be present during simulations.

40|$|There is {{ever-increasing}} {{demand in}} telecommunication system, data server and computer equipment for low voltage, high current power supply. LLC resonant converter {{is a good}} topology on primary side of the converter because it has soft switching and resonant conversion. However, the passive rectifier in the secondary side has high power dissipation. Synchronous rectifier is a popular method to reduce this rectification loss. Although there are many types of synchronous rectifier for PWM converter, {{most of them do}} not function well in LLC resonant converters. It is because the wave form of LLC resonant converter is different from PWM. The objective of this research is to reduce the power dissipation and physical size at the same time. In this thesis, a novel current driven synchronous rectifier with saturable <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> and dynamic gate voltage control for LLC resonant Converter is presented. This novel circuit reduces the rectification loss and size of the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> in the synchronous rectifier. This synchronous rectifier has several outstanding characteristics compared with generic voltage driven and current driven synchronous rectifier. The saturable feature reduces the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> turns. Inherent dynamic gate voltage controlled by saturable <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> reduces gate loss in the MOSFET. A novel driving circuit is proposed for accurate turn off time. It reduces loss significantly. This synchronous rectifier is completely self-contained which can replace the rectifier diode as a drop in replacement. It is insensitive to parasitic inductance. In order to explain the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> saturable, a model of saturable <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> is proposed. A prototype demonstrates the advantages of the proposed current driven synchronous rectifier. Furthermore, a novel integrated synchronous rectifier is presented which provides a more compact system. The synchronous rectifier <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> is integrated with the main transformer which reduces the number of circuit joints in power path. Each soldering joint generates significance loss in power converter. A pair of 0. 5 mΩ soldering joint in 25 A current path produces 0. 62 W loss. The placement of the integrated <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> is important. A criterion for the placement of the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> within the main transformer is to avoid interference to the <b>current</b> <b>transformer</b> from the magnetic flux of the main transformer.
