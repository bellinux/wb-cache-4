40|$|Coastal {{areas are}} {{home to more than}} half of the world's {{population}} and many of its most populated urban areas. Coastal urbanism remains very much in demand despite major risk factors such as sea level rise, longterm shoreline erosion, storm surges, land liquefaction, and subsidence. City-building on reclaimed land is an ambitious form of development yet prevalent around the world, especially where an economic growth agenda is pursued aggressively against the availability of land resources. This thesis develops a critical design agenda to respond to how pro-growth forces and environmental change can be negotiated towards a reconsidered coastal urbanism. The thesis argument is that coastal urban and territorial form should not follow a static master plan based on a risk model; instead, it should employ/follow a dynamic gradient of permanence and ephemerality in multiple time scales, following coastal succession as a design analogy. Tokyo Bay is the site of experimentation. The world's largest metropolitan area has a long history of land reclamation debates and projects, which resulted in a highly articulated urban coast with reclaimed shorelines, and near- and off-shore artificial islands with a mix of uses. The on-going construction of the urban archipelago is an outcome of urban and regional metabolisms, where incinerated solid waste, dredged sediment, excavated soil, and demolished buildings are deposited to make new land. Demand for post-industrial urban development and land reclamation is still alive in coastal Tokyo despite the vulnerabilities of flooding and seismic events. Large waterfront sites are now available for new development. The construction of permanent and temporary facilities in Tokyo Bay for the 2020 Summer Olympics offers an opportunity to develop a succession- based design strategy-not only for the 2020 peak condition, but also in anticipation of future transformations. The design exploration establishes, via strategic cartography, a resiliency district framework based on a gradient of permanence and flexibility in the ground condition. The sharply delineated boundary between land and sea is rethought as a dynamic frontier <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> that adapts to flooding and sea level rise and as an active site for coastal deposition and submersion. A second, elevated ground level is proposed to serve as a pedestrian and emergency thoroughfare, as well as an extension of transportation and logistics infrastructure. The Metabolist imaginary envisioned Tokyo Bay as a site of continuous urban growth towards a mega-scale climax state; ground was taken for granted and the possibilities of urban decline or reconstruction were hardly considered within the same design utopia. This project argues for a New Metabolism in which the ground is conceived as an indeterminate landscape of change. The uncertainties of the ground are addressed by an 'artificial land' infrastructure which organizes and facilitates transformation over time. by Caner Oktem. Thesis: S.

40|$|International audienceA {{bridging}} domain {{method for}} coupled atomistic-continuum models is proposed that enables to compare various coupling terms. The approach {{does not require}} the finite element mesh to match the lattice spacing of the atomic model. It is based on an overlapping domain decomposition method that makes use of Lagrange multipliers and weight functions in the coupling zone in order to distribute the energy between the two competing models. Two couplings are investigated. The L 2 coupling enforces the continuity of displacements between the two models directly. The H 1 coupling involves the definition of a strain measure. For this purpose, a moving least-square interpolant of the atomic displacement is defined. The choice of the weight functions is studied. Patch tests and a graphene sheet with a crack are studied. It is shown that both continuous and discontinuous weight functions can be used with the H 1 coupling whereas the L 2 coupling requires continuous weight functions. For the examples developed herein, the L 2 coupling produces less error in the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> interest. The <b>flexibility</b> <b>of</b> the H 1 coupling with constant weight function may be beneficial but the results may be affected depending on the topology <b>of</b> the bridging <b>zone...</b>|$|R
40|$|Global {{concern over}} the {{possible}} deleterious effects of noise on marine organisms was catalyzed when toothed whales stranded and died {{in the presence of}} high intensity sound. The lack of knowledge about mechanisms of hearing in toothed whales prompted our group to study the anatomy and build a finite element model to simulate sound reception in odontocetes. The primary auditory pathway in toothed whales is an evolutionary novelty, compensating for the impedance mismatch experienced by whale ancestors as they moved from hearing in air to hearing in water. The mechanism by which high-frequency vibrations pass from the low density fats of the lower jaw into the dense bones of the auditory apparatus is a key to understanding odontocete hearing. Here we identify a new acoustic portal into the ear complex, the tympanoperiotic complex (TPC) and a plausible mechanism by which sound is transduced into the bony components. We reveal the intact anatomic geometry using CT scanning, and test functional preconceptions using finite element modeling and vibrational analysis. We show that the mandibular fat bodies bifurcate posteriorly, attaching to the TPC in two distinct locations. The smaller branch is an inconspicuous, previously undescribed channel, a cone-shaped fat body that fits into a thin-walled bony funnel just anterior to the sigmoid process of the TPC. The TPC also contains regions of thin translucent bone that define <b>zones</b> <b>of</b> differential <b>flexibility,</b> enabling the TPC to bend in response to sound pressure, thus providing a mechanism for vibrations to pass through the ossicular chain. The techniques used to discover the new acoustic portal in toothed whales, provide a means to decipher auditory filtering, beam formation, impedance matching, and transduction. These tools {{can also be used to}} address concerns about the potential deleterious effects of high-intensity sound in a broad spectrum of marine organisms, from whales to fish...|$|R

30|$|How can {{the parties}} {{respond to these}} problems? Voice {{channels}} are considered in the next section, but, within the logic of Fig.  4, it is worth considering the ‘individual’ solution that involves only the actors immediately concerned, as that reflects {{the logic of the}} game theoretic pay-offs discussed earlier. This solution to potential breaches of goodwill seeks to limit potential gains by narrowing the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> acceptance. Thus, employers and employees might seek to segment the <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> acceptance into a series of more narrowly defined jobs. This has a number of advantages for the more vulnerable party. Considering Fig.  4, dividing the former <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> acceptance into two or more separate jobs has a number of effects. It reduces both the scope for cherry picking and its potential gains owing to the smaller variation in task values to either party within them. Narrow jobs also make it easier to detect and punish breach more quickly. Because they require only narrow, firm-specific, skills that can be learned more quickly, finding replacement workers or jobs is easier, thus reducing the potential cost and difficulty of punishing breach. Thus, compared with work systems based on broad flexible jobs, those based on narrow jobs can be more robust, and more resistant to attempts to play hawk or dove. However, this is achieved at the cost <b>of</b> reduced task <b>flexibility,</b> and reduced opportunities for dynamic on-the-job learning: a move away from the learning and towards the lean and taylor models. Such loss <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> need not occur all at once, but it may come about progressively over time as tasks whose acceptance would formerly have been expected automatically become problematic.|$|R

In reports, {{such as that of}} the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education (NCIHE, 1997), in Green Papers such as the Learning Age (DfEE, 1998) and its Scottish equivalent, Opportunity Scotland (Scottish Office, 1998), in university mission statements, in course advertisements, prospectuses and brochures, in all these places and more, exhortations <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> have emerged almost unchallenged.

Properties of entropy that make it a suitable measure <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> are outlined. After that, the strategic importance <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> is established. Then, previous research on definitions <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> and different measures <b>of</b> <b>flexibility</b> are discussed, as well as entropic measures developed by other researchers. This leads to proposing a entropy as general measure <b>of</b> process <b>flexibility</b> {{that can be used}} on a dynamic basis, i. e., along a time continuum. A mathematical model is developed as well as the application of entropy within the model. A computer simulation of a job shop model is used to test the measure through a number of different scenarios. Results of the simulation show that entropy succeeds in measuring flexibility when the relative demands of products change, but is not successful when the relative demands do not change or change a little. It is concluded that entropy is a relative measure {{that can be used to}} monitor process flexibility with time, but needs to be combined with other parameters to be of more practical use...|$|R
