The objective of this work was to evaluate the functional properties and the amino acid profile of enzymatic hydrolysates from Bluewing searobin (Prionotus punctatus), using two microbial enzymes, Alcalase and Flavourzyme. The enzymatic hydrolysate obtained through {{the addition of the}} enzyme Alcalase reached the maximum solubility (42 %) at pH 9, water holding capacity (WHC) of 2. 4 gwater gprotein− 1, 4. 5 goil gprotein− 1 of oil holding capacity (OHC) and an emulsifying activity index (EAI) of 54 m 2 gsolids− 1 at pH 3. On the other hand, the hydrolysate obtained from Flavourzyme attained 38 % of solubility at pH 9, 3. 7 gwater gprotein− 1 and 5. 5 goil gprotein− 1 for the holding capacities, and an EAI of 71 m 2 gsolids− 1 at pH 11. The hydrolysate with Flavourzyme produced best results for WHC, OHC, and EAI because it had solubility lower than the hydrolysate of Alcalase. The hydrolysate produced by Alcalase had a higher amino acid content compared with Flavourzyme’s hydrolysate. However, both showed a good essential amino acid amounts. In general, these results indicate the potential utilization of the hydrolysate from Bluewing searobin in food formulations for the direct human consumption...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} on measuring the combined effects of (1) time after sludge application, (2) temperature of equilibration, and (3) soil properties (principally pH and texture) on P availability and chemical fractions. Plant-available P (measured by iron-oxide strip extraction) was highest in the coarse textured soil. Plant-available P decreased from 20 to 60 d after application, probably due to combined effects of chemical fixation and biological immobilization, but increased thereafter. Plant-available P in all soils was lower at 37 °C than at 25 °C over the entire incubation period. This difference might reflect greater immobilization of P by microorganisms at 37 °C. Sludge P was predominantly found in the non-occluded P (Fe and Al-bound P) fraction which is biologically-available, and thus may contribute to eutrophication if eroded into surface waters. ^ A parallel study was carried out on the contribution of 4 different manures to soil P fractions and their potential for leaching into the soil. Beef feedlot, sheep feedlot, turkey house, and composted paunch manures were applied to a central Nebraska soil in alternate years from 1991 to 1997 in amounts approximating replacement of P removed by irrigated corn. Highest available P (Bray and Kurtz- 1) was in turkey manure-amended plots. In all cases, P accumulated in the 0 – 15 cm tillage zone. All inorganic P fractions increased with manure application, but Ca-P decreased {{as a percentage of}} total inorganic P.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of transient phenomena inside Liquid Rocket Engines (LREs) {{has not been}} feasible until {{now because of the}} many challenges posed by the operating conditions inside the combustion chamber. Especially, the departure from ideal gas because of the cryogenic injection in a high-pressure chamber is one of the ma jor hurdle for such simula- tions. In order to begin addressing these issue, a real-gas model has been implemented in a massively parallel flow solver. This solver is capable of performing Large-Eddy Simula- tions (LES) in geometrical configurations ranging from an axisymmetric slice to a 3 D slice up to a full 3 D combustor. We present here the results from an investigation of unsteady combustion inside a small-scale, multi-injectors LRE. Both thermally perfect gas (TPG) and real gas (RG) approaches are evaluated for this LOX-GH 2 system. The Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state (PR EoS) is used to account for real gas effects associated with the injection of cryogenic oxygen. Realistic transport properties are computed but simplified chemistry is used in order to achieve a reasonable turnaround time. Results show the impor- tance of the unsteady dynamics of the flow, especially the interaction between the different injectors. The role of the equation of state is assessed and the real gas model, despite a limited <b>zone</b> <b>of</b> <b>application,</b> seems to have a strong influence on the overall chamber behav- ior. Although several features in the simulated results agree well with past experimental observations, the {{prediction of}} heat flux using a simplified flux boundary condition is not completely satisfactory. This work also reviews in details the state of our knowledge on supercritical combustion in a coaxial injector configuration, stressing issues where numeri- cal modeling could provide new insights. However, many developments and improvements are required before an LES modeling of such a flow is both feasible and valid. We finally propose a comprehensive roadmap towards the completion of this goal and the possible use of CFD as a design tool for a modern liquid rocket engine. M. S.

A field study using 2 -Chloro- 6 -(Trichloro-Methyl) Pyridine, ‘N-Serve’, with anhydrous ammonia and lime {{was established in the}} fall of 1969 at the University of Nebraska Mead Field laboratory. The experimental sites were located on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam and an Ortello loamy fine sand. These soils were medium to slightly acid. A completely randomized block design with slip plot treatment arrangement was employed. The plain plots consisted of 0, 75, 150, and 225 pounds per acre rates of anhydrous ammonia. Each main plot, also, consisted of 0, 1. 5 and 3 ton per acre rates of lime on the Ortello site and 0, 2, and 4 ton per acre rates on the Sharpsburg. Each treatment was replicated four times at each site. Each main plot contained two subplots of anhydrous ammonia with and without ‘N-Serve’. Anhydrous ammonia with and without ‘N-Serve’ was applied in mid-November using injector knives 8 to 9 inches deep. “N- Serve’ (23 % active ingredient xylene solution) at the rate of 0. 2 % of the weight of applied nitrogen as placed into the application tank prior to addition of the anhydrous ammonia.

It iteratively modifies an initial geometry until a prescribed pressure distribution is reached on the blade surface. The method solves the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations in a numerical domain of which some boundaries (the blade walls) move during the transient part of the computation. The geometry modification algorithm is based on the transpiration principle: a normal velocity distribution is computed from the difference between the actual and prescribed pressure distributions, and is used to modify the blade shape. A time iteration is then performed on this new blade shape, taking into account the grid movement during the time stepping.
