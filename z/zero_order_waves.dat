40|$|The {{vertical}} electronic {{spectrum of}} pyrrole is investigated {{by means of}} second and third order n-electron valence state perturbation theory. The three 1 A 1 -, 1 B 2 + and 1 A 1 + π->π* valence states, {{as well as the}} 3 s, 3 p and 3 d π- and σ-type Rydberg states, are considered. Particular attention is paid to the description of the valence states, where different active spaces of increasing size are used to improve the <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> <b>wave</b> function. For the Rydberg states and the covalent valence state 1 A 1 -, the perturbative results show a coherent trend and are in accordance with those of the previous high-level studies. For the two ionic valence states (1 B 2 + and 1 A 1 +), rather large active spaces are required to get satisfactory results...|$|R
40|$|The n-electron {{valence state}} {{perturbation}} theory (NEVPT) {{belongs to the}} family of multireference perturbation theories. Starting from a CAS-CI <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> calculation, all the contracted double excitations are generated and a <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> Hamiltonian is built making use of Dyall's model Hamiltonian where all the bielectronic interactions between the active electrons are taken into account. The first order correction to the wave function is built as a summation of multireference functions each of which has an energy corresponding to a well defined physical process (e. g. an ionization involving the active electrons). The NEVPT approach presents some desirable characteristics such as a) invariance under orbital rotation {{in each of the three}} orbital classes (core, active and virtual), b) strict separability (size consistence) with respect to molecular dissociation, c) absence of intruder states. The theory can be applied to any solution of a CAS-CI calculation and is therefore well suited to the treatment of electronically excited states. The theory can be formulated either in a state specific approach or in a quasi-degenerate formalism. The latter is well suited in cases where the mixing of the configurations in the <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> <b>wave</b> function is poorly described in the variational procedure, as can occur in avoided crossings between ionic and covalent states or in excited states of mixed valence-Rydberg character. The theory is illustrated through a few significant test calculations...|$|R
40|$|A {{reformulation}} of nondiffracting beams, {{based on}} more general (travelling wave) solutions of the nonparaxial wave equation, is presented. <b>Zero</b> <b>order</b> nondiffracting beams {{are found to}} be radial standing waves arising from counterpropagating <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> Hankel <b>waves</b> of the first and second kind, while higher order nondiffracting beams are formed from counter-rotating spiral waves which are described by Hankel functions of the corresponding order. The resulting physical picture is more general than the well-known integral representation of Bessel functions and we expect it to have implications for studies of the applications of nondiffracting beams. Generic descriptions of the transverse profiles of the electric field, applicable to experimental configurations for realising nondiffracting beams, follow directly from this formulation. Finally, the existence of classes of periodically nondiffracting beams, possessing finite angular momentum and having the characteristics of rotating and spiral waves, is predicted...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{perturbations}} of the Kerr-Newman dilatonic black hole background. For this purpose we perfom a double expansion {{in both the}} background electric charge and the wave parameters of the relevant quantities in the Newman-Penrose formalism. We then display the gravitational, dilatonic and electromagnetic equations, which reproduce the static solution (at <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> in the <b>wave</b> parameter) and the corresponding wave equations in the Kerr background (at first <b>order</b> in the <b>wave</b> parameter and <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> in the electric charge). At higher orders in the electric charge one encounters corrections to the propagation of waves induced {{by the presence of}} a non-vanishing dilaton. An explicit computation is carried out for the electromagnetic waves up to the asymptotic form of the Maxwell field perturbations produced by the interaction with dilatonic waves. A simple physical model is proposed which could make these perturbation relevant in the detection of radiation coming from the region of space near a black hole...|$|R
40|$|Recently, an {{acoustic}} waveguide sensor based on multiple mode conversion of {{surface acoustic waves}} at the solid—liquid interfaces has been introduced for the concentration measurement of binary and ternary mixtures, liquid level sensing, investigation of spatial inhomogenities or bubble detection. In this contribution the sound wave propagation within this acoustic waveguide sensor is visualized by Schlieren imaging for continuous and burst operation the first time. In the acoustic waveguide the antisymmetrical <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> Lamb <b>wave</b> mode is excited by a single phase transducer of 1 MHz on thin glass plates of 1 mm thickness. By contact to the investigated liquid Lamb waves propagating on the first plate emit pressure waves into the adjacent liquid, which excites Lamb waves on the second plate, what again causes pressure waves traveling inside the liquid {{back to the first}} plate and so on. The Schlieren images prove this multi reflection within the acoustic waveguide, which confirms former considerations and calculations based on the receiver signal. With this knowledge the sensor concepts with the acoustic waveguide sensor can be interpreted in a better manner...|$|R
40|$|Subsonic {{propulsion}} systems for future aircraft may incorporate ultra-high bypass ratio ducted fan engines whose dominant noise source is the fan with blade passage frequency less than 1000 Hz. This low frequency combines with {{the requirement of}} a short nacelle to diminish the effectiveness of passive duct liners. Active noise control {{is seen as a}} viable method to augment the conventional passive treatments. An experiment to control ducted fan noise using a time domain active adaptive system is reported. The control sound source consists of loudspeakers arrayed around the fan duct. The error sensor location is in the fan duct. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the in-duct error sensor reduces the mode spillover in the far field, thereby increasing the efficiency of the control system. In this first series of tests, the fan is configured so that predominantly <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> circumferential <b>waves</b> are generated. The control system is found to reduce the blade passage frequency tone significantly in the acoustic far field when the mode orders of the noise source and of the control source are the same. The noise reduction is not as great when the mode orders are not the same even though the noise source modes are evanescent, but the control system converges stably and global noise reduction is demonstrated in the far field. Further experimentation is planned in which the performance of the system will be evaluated when higher order radial and spinning modes are generated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the linear propagation of an electron wave in a collisionless, inhomogeneous, nonstationary and anisotropic plasma. The plasma {{is characterized by}} its distribution function, $f_H$, at <b>zero</b> <b>order</b> in the <b>wave</b> amplitude. This distribution function, from which are derived all the hydrodynamical quantities, may be chosen arbitrarily, provided that it solves Vlasov equation. Then, from the linearized version of the electrons equation of motion, and from Gauss law, is derived an envelope equation for the wave amplitude, assumed to evolve over time and space scales {{much larger than the}} oscillation periods of the wave. The envelope equation may be cast into an equation for the the wave action, derived from Whitham's variational principle, that demonstrates the action decay due to Landau damping. Moreover, the Landau damping rate is derived at first order in the variations of the wave number and frequency. As briefly discussed, this paper generalizes numerous previous works on the subject, provides a theoretical basis for heuristic arguments regarding the action decay, and also {{addresses the}} propagation of an externally driven wave...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The time {{course of}} ethanol {{disappearance}} {{from the blood}} has been examined in normal males and females and in alcohol misusers.

In the majority (75 %) of normal females the blood ethanol concentration was still increasing at 30 min.
