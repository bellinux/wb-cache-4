50|$|To {{distinguish}} it from the already existing town of Moresnet (in the neighboring municipality of Plombières), Neutral Moresnet was renamed Kelmis (in French: La Calamine)after kelme, the local dialect word for <b>zinc</b> <b>spar.</b>|$|E
50|$|Smithsonite, or <b>zinc</b> <b>spar,</b> is zinc {{carbonate}} (ZnCO3), a mineral ore of zinc. Historically, smithsonite was identified with hemimorphite {{before it was}} realised that they were two distinct minerals. The two minerals are very similar in appearance and the term calamine {{has been used for}} both, leading to some confusion. The distinct mineral smithsonite was named in 1832 by François Sulpice Beudant in honor of English chemist and mineralogist James Smithson (c.1765-1829), whose bequest established the Smithsonian Institution and who first identified the mineral in 1802.|$|E
50|$|After {{the demise}} of Napoleon's Empire, the Congress of Vienna of 1814-15 redrew the European map, aiming at {{creating}} a balance of power. One of the borders to be delineated was the one between the newly founded United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Prussia. Both parties could agree on the larger part of the territory, as borders mostly followed older lines, but the district of Moresnet proved problematic, {{mainly because of the}} valuable <b>zinc</b> <b>spar</b> mine called Altenberg (German) or Vieille Montagne (French) located there. Both the Netherlands and Prussia were keen to appropriate this resource, which was needed in the production of zinc and brass—at that time, Bristol in England was the only other place where zinc ore was processed.|$|E
