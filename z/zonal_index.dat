We analysed <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> (from 40 °N to 60 °N) over planetary wave fields (Europe, East Asia, East Pacific and North America) at 500 hPa geopotential height fields in four seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. The results are summarized as follows. (1) There were apparent differences {{in the distribution of}} subtropical high pressure belts at between 200 hPa and 500 hPa geopotential height field in summer. Subtropical high pressure belts at 500 hPa geopotential height field was influenced by subtropical jet stream flowing north of south Asian subtropical high centered at the Tibetan Plateau at 200 hPa geopotential height field. (2) Therefore, we attempted {{to research the}} feature of pressure fields at 500 hPa mean geopotential height field in high and low index years respectively, by standard deviation for 21 years mean 500 hPa geopotential height field. In high index year, the deviation in mid-latitude showed positive anomaly field, and negative anomaly field in high-latitude. On the contrary, positive anomaly appeared in high-latitude, and negative anomaly in mid-latitude in low index year. These anomalous fields were corresponded to planetary wave fields where <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> was high. (3) In planetary wave fields, <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> in East Asia area and East Pacific area were high in autumn, although North America area indicated high <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> in winter and low in spring.

40|$|An {{idealized}} {{atmospheric model}} is employed {{to quantify the}} strength of the eddy feedback and the persistence of the <b>zonal</b> <b>index.</b> The strength of the surface frictional damping on the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> is varied, and an external zonal momentum forcing is included to compensate for the momentum change associated with the friction change such that the climatological jet latitude and shape are unchanged. The model can generate a nearly identical climatology and leading mode of the zonal mean zonal wind for different frictional damping rates, except when the jet undergoes a regime transition. For those experiments without a regime transition, as the surface friction is increased, the strength of eddy feedback is enhanced but the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> becomes less persistent. A simple feedback model suggests that the e-folding decorrelation time scale of the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> can be determined by the frictional damping rate and the strength of eddy feedback. The strength of eddy feedback is found {{to be related to the}} instantaneous vertical wind shears near the surface controlled by the frictional damping. Furthermore, the climate response to an external zonal torque is proportional to the decorrelation time scale, although the simple prediction used here overestimates the climate response by a factor of 2...|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the relation of}} the annular mode to the kinematics of a fluctuating jet in zonal-mean zonal wind and to the <b>zonal</b> <b>index,</b> using an idealized model of fluctuations in the eddy-driven jet. When the sphericity of the domain is accounted for, observed and numerically simulated annular modes for the Southern Hemisphere summertime are found to be in excellent agreement. In particular, the annular mode and <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> mode are shown to be related but distinct. Although the annular mode is strongly (but not identically) related to fluctuations in jet position, fluctuations in jet strength and width are shown to also be important for its simulation. When the sphericity of the domain is neglected, analytic expressions for the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of zonal-mean geopotential for the cases of individual fluctuations in jet strength, position, and width can be obtained. None of these EOF modes have the characteristics of the annular mode. In the presence of simultaneous fluctuations in jet strength and posi-tion, the leading zonal-mean geopotential EOF mode (strongly resembling the annular mode) is shown to mix the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> mode of zonal-mean zonal wind with other EOF modes, demonstrating why the annular mode and <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> mode are related but distinct. The greater sensitivity to domain size of EOF modes of geopotential relative to the EOF modes of zonal-mean zonal wind is also discussed. This study focuses on the Southern Hemisphere summertime, which is characterized by a single, eddy-driven jet; the generality of the results presented suggest that the conclusions should be qualitatively unchanged in the presence of both subtropical and eddy-driven jets. 1...|$|E
40|$|An {{idealized}} atmospheric {{general circulation}} model {{is used to}} investigate the factors controlling the time scale of intraseasonal (10 – 100 day) variability of the extratropical atmosphere. Persistence on these time scales is found in patterns of variability that characterize meridional vacillations of the extratropical jet. Depending {{on the degree of}} asymmetry in the model forcing, patterns take on similar properties to the <b>zonal</b> <b>index,</b> annular modes, and North Atlantic Oscillation. It is found that the time scale of jet meandering is distinct from the obvious internal model time scales, suggesting that interaction between synoptic eddies and the large-scale flow establish a separate, intraseasonal time scale. A mechanism is presented by which eddy heat and momentum transport couple to retard motion of the jet, slowing its meridional variation and thereby extending the persistence of <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> and annular mode anomalies. The feedback is strong and quite sensitive to model parameters when the model forcing is zonally uniform. However, the time scale of jet variation drops and nearly all sensitivity to parameters is lost when zonal asymmetries, in the form of topography and thermal perturbations that approximate land–sea contrast, are introduced. A diagnostic on the zonal structure of the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> provides intuition on the physical nature of the index and annular modes and hints at why zonal asymmetries limit the eddy–mean flow interactions. 1...|$|E

Namias [I] has shown that cycles lasting several weeks are prone to occur during February and March. This year the minimum point in the index cycle occurred near the middle of February, at least ten days earlier than all but one period studied by Namias, and more t,han twenty days earlier than the cycle in 1951 which was described by the author [2].

Multi-echo SE was used for T 2 mapping. Global (T 2 in RT divided by T 2 in normal cartilage) and <b>zonal</b> T 2 <b>index</b> (deep T 2 divided by superficial T 2) of RT were calculated. ResultsAverage MOCART score was 71. 8 (95 % CI 62. 2 to 81. 3) at six, 75. 2 (95 % CI 62. 8 to 87. 5) at twelve, 71. 8 (95 % CI 55. 4 to 88. 2) at eighteen and 84. 4 (95 % CI 77. 7 to 91. 0) at twenty-four months. The global T 2 index ranged between 0. 8 and 1. 2 (normal healthy cartilage) in 1 / 11 (9 %) patients at baseline, 8 / 12 (67 %) at 12 months, 11 / 13 (85 %) at 18 months and 13 / 16 (81 %) at 24 months.

The atmospheric circulation {{is represented by}} six indices: the three leading principal components (PCs) of an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of 20 European pressure series from 1822 to 1995, which represent the central tendency of European pressure (EOF 1), a zonal circulation pattern (EOF 2) and a meridional pattern (EOF 3), a North Atlantic <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> constructed from Gibraltar and Reykjavik pressure series for 1821 – 1995; a Western European <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> constructed from Madrid, Barcelona, Lund and Trondheim for 1786 – 1995; and an index constructed from Paris and London, 1774 – 1995.

In the frequency domain there are three frequencies (. 03,. 07 and. 17 cpd (cycle per day) corresponding to periods of 33, 14 and 6 days) at which PV index and the eddy index exhibit local maxima. The high correlation found at periods of 33 days is mainly due to eddy activity at high latitudes while the local correlation maxima found at the shorter periods are mainly due mid-latitude eddy activity. The correlation between the PV index and the geopotential height anomaly at 500 mb, at each grid point in the Northern Hemisphere, shows the existence of most of the teleconnection patterns summarized by Wallace and Gutzler (1981) : the North Atlantic Oscillation, the North Pacific Oscillation, and the Pacific/North American patterns.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} conodont biostratigraphy and {{palaeoecology}} in the Darriwilian (Middle Ordovician) of Baltoscandia, with focus on limestone strata showing {{traces of the}} ~ 470 Ma L-chondrite parent body break-up. The evidence for this cosmic event includes abundant centimeter to decimeter-sized fossil meteorites and elevated levels of sediment-dispersed extraterrestrial L-type chromite found in a stratigraphical interval corresponding to the uppermost Lenodus antivariabilis, the L. variabilis, and the Yangtzeplacognathus crassus conodont biozones, and the lower Microzarkodina hagetiana Subzone of the Lenodus (Eoplacognathus?) pseudoplanus Zone. Whereas these fossil meteorites are found only on freshly-sawed limestone-slabs at the active Thorsberg quarry on Mount Kinnekulle, southern Sweden, the occurrence of chromite has been recorded from various localities in Sweden, {{as well as in}} Russia and south-central China. A high-resolution conodont biostratigraphy over the c. 2. 5 m thick, chromite-rich interval at the abandoned Hällekis quarry, Kinnekulle, was established in order to improve correlation between chromite-yielding sequences. Since the meteorite/chromite-rich interval here directly associates with a conspicuous rock sequence known as the ‘Täljsten’ interval, these strata were also investigated for palaeoecological and environmental changes. This anomalous interval has previously been suggested to represent a relative sea-level fall, but it has also been speculated that its formation could have been linked to the L-chondrite parent body break-up. Hence, the nature of the ‘Täljsten’ needed to be further explored in terms of faunal dynamics and depositional setting. The conodont fauna demonstrated continuous faunal reorganizations throughout the sampled sequence, as did additional microfaunal components. Along with observed changes in microfacies, it could be verified that the chromite-rich interval coincides with a gradually progressing regression-transgression cycle. An interesting find of tiny Panderodus conodont elements, including a serrate arcuatiform element, was made in a bed deposited just prior to the inferred maximum lowstand of the ‘Täljsten’ interval. Such serrate elements have previously been referred to as ecophenotypes of non-serrate forms, but sometimes also as distinctive species or subspecies. The Hällekis specimens, described as Panderodus serratus hallekisensis, represent one of the earliest records of the genus and hence provided clues to the primitive morphology and suprageneric relationship of Panderodus. Due to an observed tendency for overlapping morphologies and inconsistencies in identifications, the shapes of dextral Pa-elements from the <b>zonal</b> <b>indices</b> L. variabilis, Y. crassus and L. (E?) pseudoplanus were quantitatively compared using landmark-based geometric morphometrics. Linear shape of the posterior and posterio-lateral denticle rows combined was considered to best reflect the overall shape of the element-type in question, and 23 landmarks were used for the analysis; 4 fixed and 19 sliders (semi-landmarks). The analyses highlighted large-scale shape and symmetry related differences between the three species, but also revealed some overlaps. It also became clear that the three taxa display notable shape-variation of the dextral Pa element, a matter only looked into closer for L. variabilis. The Y. crassus elements included in the analysis suggest that the Baltoscandian and Chinese forms cannot be regarded as equivalents. The contingencies regarding the <b>zonal</b> <b>indices</b> naturally influence, e. g., the potential for a high-resolution correlation of chromite distribution between Kinnekulle and coeval sedimentary sequences at other localities. It was recently shown that the > 1000 km 2 Osmussaar Breccia in north-western Estonia contains non-reworked L-type chromite, suggesting a connection to an L-chondritic impactor. An assessment of the conodont fauna of the limestones above the brecciate layers indicates that the formation of the breccia concurred with the deposition of the meteorite/chromite-yielding strata in Sweden. The limestone bed immediately superposing the breccia could be brought to the Microzakodina ozarkodella Subzone of the L. (E?) pseudoplanus Zone, i. e. only slightly higher stratigraphically than the recognized upper limit for high abundances of extraterrestrial material. This stratigraphical divergence as compared to the Swedish interval can be explained by a period of non-deposition and a resulting hiatus, a conceivable scenario considering the numerous sedimentation-gaps characterizing the early Darriwilian of north-western Estonia...|$|R

The genus piphyphyllum is shown to be polyphyletically derived and its species are referred back to Lithostrotion. The monospecific genus Nemistium is considered synonymous with Lithostrotion and ranoved. Its one species is an evolutionary intermediate between two species of Lithostrotion. The genus Orionastraea is reviewed and 0. sera sp. nov. is described. Two species of Orionastraea are referred to Hadsonia gen, nov. which, though similar morphologically to Orionastraea, has a different ancestral species. H. matura Sp. nov. is described in this genua. The genus Aulina is excluded from the Lithostrotiontidae as it is thought to have different ancestors. It is restricted to include only forms with massive coralla and A. botanica sp. nov. and A. rotif ormis aphroidia subsp. nov, are described. Fasciculate species of Aulina are referred to Easoioaulina gen, nov. as they are apparently unrelated to Aulina sensu stricto.

Our findings indicate that Java droughts are intensified during El Niños that coincide with negative EQWIN conditions, which are also linked to a strengthened Indian monsoon...|$|R
40|$|There is {{urgent need}} for a {{consistent}} blocking identification method {{that can be used}} and compared across reanalyses, models and climate scenarios. We present such a method and diagnose daily blocking frequency in 43 years (1958 - 2000) of ERA- 40 Reanalysis for indices defined on both the commonly used geopotential height and potential temperature fields as well as a <b>zonal</b> wind <b>index.</b> Applications of various blocking indices to the same data highlights the importance of a consistent methodology for comparison and a method that identifies blocks along a path that varies with the latitude of the storm track. Since the method accommodates blocking detection using 500 mb zonal-wind which is readily available in climate model output, we diagnose blocking in 14 CMIP 3 models under two different greenhouse gas scenarios. Blocking duration remains nearly constant among the scenarios, but a robust reduction in blocking frequency with global warming is demonstrated. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} processes that determine the time scale of zonal-mean-flow variability are examined with an idealized numerical model {{that has a}} zonally symmetric lower boundary. In {{the part of the}} parameter space where the time-mean zonal flow is characterized by a single (double) jet, the dominant form of zonal-mean-flow variability is the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> (poleward propagation), and the time-mean potential vorticity gradient is found to be strong and sharp (weak and broad). The e-folding time scale of the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> is found to be close to 55 days, much longer than the observed 10 -day time scale. The e-folding time scale of the poleward propagation is about 40 days. The long e-folding time scales for the <b>zonal</b> <b>index</b> are found to be consistent with an unrealistically strong and persistent eddy–zonal-mean-flow feedback. A calculation of the refractive index indicates that the background flow supports eddies that are trapped within midlatitudes, undergoing relatively little meridional propagation. Additional model runs are performed with an idealized mountain to investigate whether zonal asymmetry can disrupt the eddy feedback. For single-jet states, the time scale is reduced to about 30 days if the mountain height is 4 km or less. The reduction in the time scale occurs because the stationary eddies excited by the mountain alter the background flow in a manner that leads to the replacement of zonal-index events by shorter-time-scale poleward propagation. With a 5 -km mountain, the time scale reverts and increases to 105 days. This threshold behavior is again attributed to a sharpening of the background zonal jet, which arises from an extremely strong stationary wave momentum flux convergence. In contrast, for double-jet states, the time scale changes only slightly and the poleward propagation is maintained in all mountain runs. 1...|$|E

The cold polar outbreak over the Gulf of Mexico weather type shows a variation coincident with ten year running precipitation means for several places in Mexico {{for the period}} 1919 – 66.

We found that dust emission was strongly correlated with Asian Polar Mid-latitude Index (APMI) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) in March. In April, dust emission {{was correlated with}} Far Eastern <b>Zonal</b> <b>Index</b> (Fezi).

40|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} index {{for the south}} Asian summer monsoon has been a subject of some controversy and received considerable attention in recent years (Webster and Yang; Goswami et al. 1999). Two major <b>indices</b> are the <b>zonal</b> wind shear <b>index</b> proposed by Webster and Yang (1992, hereafter referred to WYI) and the meridional shear index defined by Goswami et al. (1999, hereafter referred to as GKA; the index is hereafter referred to as MHI).

40|$|In an {{investigation}} of the properties of the quasi-geostrophic Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux for planetary-scale motions, particular attention is given to the relation between the EP flux divergence and the meridional flux of eddy potential vorticity, and the relations between the EP flux, group velocity, and the <b>zonal</b> mean refractive <b>index</b> in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys limit. This latter diagnostic has appeared {{in a number of different}} forms as that quantity whose gradient determines the refraction of group velocity paths or EP flux trajectories. The question is considered which, if any, of these forms holds for planetary scale motions. In this investigation, a planetary-scale motion is formally defined to be one for which Burger's (1958) quasigeostrophic theory is appropriate...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the contemporary pollen rain-vegetation relationship for vegetation communities within the Natal Drakensberg, a region which is recognized as having the potential for extensive palynological investigations. The objective {{was to investigate the}} fundamental assumption underlying palynology, viz: that the pollen rain of a particular region is indicative or representative of the existing vegetation of that region. If the modern pollen rain is indicative of and/or distinctive for a particular vegetation community then the principle of methodological uniformitarianism can be applied, which states that the present day patterns and relationships can provide a factual basis for the reconstruction of the past through the extrapolation of modern analogues backwards in time. A vegetation survey was conducted in thirteen communities identified as pertinent to the research and a two-year modern pollen rain sampling programme was carried out, using both surface soil and pollen trap samples as a means of recording and quantifying the pollen rain. Once the necessary sample preparation and pollen counts had been performed, descriptive and numerical/statistical methods were employed to determine and describe the existing pollen-vegetation relationship. Descriptive analysis of the data sets was carried out with the aid of spectra depicted as rotated bar graphs and representing the relative percentage frequencies of the collected/counted taxa. Annual and seasonal pollen influx values were calculated and presented. Analysis of variance was applied to test various hypotheses related to sampling strategy and pollen influx variation. Statistical methods employed were two-way indicator species analysis (a classification analysis technique), detrended correspondence analysis and principal components analysis (ordination techniques), canonical correlation analysis (for data set association) and multiple discriminant analysis (for determination of vegetation <b>zonal</b> <b>indices).</b> The latter technique allowed for the probability of modern analogues to be assessed which are necessary for accurate interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages if the assumption under investigation is correct. The findings of the study were that the modern pollen rain-vegetation assumption holds true. Recommendations are put forward regarding future contemporary pollen studies with regards to the number of soil and pollen trap samples required, the magnitude of the pollen count and the numerical/statistical techniques most appropriate to clearly interpret the results. The conclusions are that future fossil pollen spectra can be expected to provide a good indication of former regional vegetation patterns for the study region. The study has extended the limited understanding of the contemporary pollen rain-vegetation relationship in South Africa and enables the interpretation of fossil pollen spectra to be carried out with greater confidence. This in turn lends greater credibility to possible Quaternary environmental change models required to help understand present and possible future environmental change. ...|$|R
