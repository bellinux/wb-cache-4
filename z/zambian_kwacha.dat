50|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1963, Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia in 1964. Its first revenues were issued in 1964 and depicted the coat of arms. The design was reissued in 1968 denominated in the <b>Zambian</b> <b>kwacha.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The name kwacha {{was first}} used in Zambia where the <b>Zambian</b> <b>kwacha</b> was {{introduced}} in 1968. It derives from the Chinyanja or Chichewa word meaning [...] "it has dawned", while tambala translates as [...] "rooster" [...] in Chichewa. The tambala was so named because a hundred roosters announce the dawn.|$|E
40|$|Similar {{to global}} currencies, the <b>Zambian</b> {{currency}} (<b>kwacha)</b> has varied considerably against major currencies {{since the early}} 1990 s. Existing empirical evidence reveals that fluctuations in exchange rates can potentially generate distortions in the economy. However, insufficient empirical evidence on Zambia exists. Thus, this thesis contributes empirically to the literature on exchange rate volatility {{and its impact on}} the economy with Zambia as a case study. Consequently, volatility in the kwacha bilateral exchange rates is modelled using three alternative GARCH models in order to characterise the underlying currency volatility. The influence of fundamental factors on conditional volatility of exchange rates is also examined. In addition, principal components analysis (PCA) is used to capture the common underlying pattern in the estimated conditional volatility series through which a new GARCH series (GARCH-PCA) is constructed and used in trade and monetary and foreign exchange intervention rule analysis as an alternative measure of exchange rate risk. PCA has not been previously employed in such analyses. Cointegration analysis is used for trade-exchange rate volatility analysis while SVAR and GMM are employed with variations to the conventional specification of monetary and foreign exchange intervention rules in the literature in determining the relevance of exchange rate volatility in monetary and foreign exchange policies. The results reveal that the kwacha bilateral exchange rates examined are characterised by different conditional dynamics in terms of volatility persistence and response to price shocks. The positive influences of exchange rate regime, money supply and openness on conditional volatility predominate. Exchange rate volatility affects international trade flows and underpins monetary policy and foreign exchange decision-making process. Thus, the results are amenable for trade policy formulation and monetary policy improvements and they justify foreign exchange interventions. GARCH-PCA, an index of exchange rate volatility, reflecting influences from Zambia proves to be a useful alternative measure of exchange rate volatility. Its performance is comparable to the trade-weighted measure in terms of sign, size and statistical significance of the estimated coefficients.

50|$|The <b>Zambian</b> <b>kwacha</b> {{was first}} issued in 1968 {{to replace the}} Zambian pound. The design of the kwacha bill changed as time went on, also, {{different}} bills were either introduced in or withdrawn from circulation. Seven emissions of the first kwacha are known to exist, while only one emission of the second kwacha was introduced in circulation in January 1, 2013 and still existing since then without any changes in design or security features. Each emission share similar general features in design throughout all the banknotes, with slight changes concerning the colors and the activity based theme on the reverse of the banknotes.|$|E

50|$|On January 23, 2012, the Bank of Zambia {{proposed}} certain {{measures in}} regards of the redenomination of the <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha.</b> Such recommendations were initially {{approved by the}} government, {{being one of the}} measures required to address costs associated with the continuous devaluation of the national currency, due to depreciation throughout time, {{as a direct result of}} several years of high inflation rates that characterized the national economy during the late decades of the 20th century, and the early years of the 21st century. The recommendations were assented to the parliament on November 3, 2012. Later, The Re-Domination of Currency Act (Act 8 of 2012) was enacted on December 3, 2012.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, {{a second}} {{emission}} of the <b>Zambian</b> <b>kwacha</b> was issued. Initially, the emission comprised the same five banknotes {{of the first}} emission, and all five denominations bore the signatures of Dr Justin B. Zulu, Mr Valentine S.

Kuwani, the second, third, and forth governors of the Bank of Zambia, respectively, except for the 50 ngwee bills that never existed with Dr Zulu's signature, {{as well as the}} 1 kwacha bills that never showed Mr Kuwani's signature. The second emission banknotes were exactly similar to these of the first emission, except for a slight difference, in which the dot (•) between the currency symbol and the face value was removed. The banknotes were printed by Thomas De La Rue & Co. Limited, and specimen banknotes were issued for each denomination, with the word SPECIMEN overprint in red sans on both the obverse and reverse.|$|E
5000|$|Among Zimbabweans {{who have}} moved to Zambia are {{a small number of}} white Zimbabwean farmers, whose numbers had reached roughly 150 to 300 people [...] They farm a variety of crops {{including}} tobacco, wheat, and chili peppers on an estimated 150 farms. The capital they brought, combined with general economic liberalisation under the late Zambian president Levy Mwanawasa, has been credited with stimulating an agricultural boom in Zambia. In 2004, {{for the first time in}} 26 years, Zambia exported more corn than it imported. [...] Zambia was considered the [...] "easy option" [...] for Zimbabwean farmers as compared to other potential destinations such as Malawi or Nigeria due to the close resemblance between the soil and climate of Zambia and that of Zimbabwe, as well as Zambia's relative stability; however, farmers who relocated to Zambia typically took on heavy debts denominated in <b>Zambian</b> <b>kwacha</b> while selling their produce abroad for U.S. dollars, which put them into difficulties when the kwacha appreciated almost one-third against the dollar in 2006.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the empirical relationship between monthly spot copper price movements and monthly <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha</b> / US Dollar spot exchange rates, {{for the period}} January 2005 to February 2015. The ARDL bounds short-run estimate reveals there is {{both positive and negative}} coefficient interaction of copper price movements on the exchange rates in the short-run. However, the overall impact of copper prices on the exchange rate, is not significant in the short-run. The ARDL bounds test also confirms the presence of a long-run relationship between copper prices and the exchange rate. The coefficient estimates reveal that both the consumer price index and the terms-of-trade have a statistical weak impact on the exchange rate in both the short and long run. The study finds that Zambia's GDP has a negative impact on the exchange rate in the short-run, but has a statistically significant positive long-run effect. China's GDP, is used as a proxy to capture foreign demand for copper, it has both a positive and negative interaction on the exchange rate in the short-run and a negative effect in the long-run...|$|E
40|$|Cotton is one unquestioned {{success of}} Zambia’s turn towards a market economy. After {{liberalization}} in late 1994, production rose from 20, 000 mt to over 100, 000 mt in the 1998 harvest year. After collapsing {{to less than}} 50, 000 mt in 2000, it has risen steadily, nearing 200, 000 mt in 2005. Over 2002 - 2005, exports of cotton lint were first among all agricultural exports in value, 30 % higher than any other agricultural export (Export Board of Zambia 2006). The closest competitor to cotton during this time –raw cane sugar –is primarily produced on large operations, while cotton is almost entirely a smallholder crop. Its potential role in poverty alleviation and food security is, thus, very large. The success of this sector has been achieved despite persistent declines in international cotton prices since 1995, serious problems of credit default during the late 1990 s, the departure in 1999 of the sector’s biggest company, Lonrho, and a very recent crisis {{brought on by the}} appreciation of the <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha</b> during 2006. food security, policy, Zambia, Africa, cotton, Crop Production/Industries, Q 18,...|$|E
40|$|The first officially {{recorded}} {{outbreak of}} African swine fever (ASF) in Zambia was in Eastern province in 1965. The disease now covers almost the whole province and is endemic in the indigenous breeds. In 1989, {{an outbreak of}} ASF occurred on a commercial property in central Zambia {{for the first time}} and was eradicated by depopulation. In order to examine the justification of the drastic control measures and the continued ban on the export of pigs and their products, the impact of the outbreak on the affected property as well as the potential consequences on the commercial pig sector in the district was assessed in the present study. The affected property lost 421, 238 <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha</b> (ZK) (US$ 39, 965) as a result of the outbreak and control measures. However, the cost to the district could have been at least ZKI 4, 917, 500 (US$ 1, 415, 323) if the measures had not been effected. Furthermore, not taking such measures would have increased the risk to the entire commercial pig sector along the line of rail in urban centers...|$|E
40|$|The {{sources of}} {{volatility}} {{in the real}} and nominal <b>Zambian</b> <b>kwacha</b> exchange rates {{with respect to the}} currencies of the major trading partners are examined from January 1964 to December 2006 using the GARCH method. The results reveal that exchange rates are characterised by different conditional volatility dynamics based on the three GARCH models employed. Principal components analysis is used to generate new exchange rate volatility series that capture the common underlying pattern in the estimated conditional variances, as alternative measures of exchange rate uncertainty. In terms of the factors accounting for the volatility in the exchange rate, the switch from fixed to the flexible exchange rate regime had a significant positive effect on the conditional volatility of all exchange rates. In addition, while both monetary and real factors account for the observed volatility in exchange rates, the former had a relatively larger effect than the latter, thus highlighting the important role of monetary policy in exchange rate management. In the short-run, increases in exchange rate volatility are underpinned by money supply due to the existence of nominal rigidities. Thus, a steady growth rate in money supply is recommended to reduce volatility. In the medium to long-term, policies aimed at diversifying trade and integrating the economies of Zambia and her major trading partners will further reduce volatility in kwacha exchange rates as openness has a relatively stronger positive effect among the real factors examined...|$|E
40|$|Anthrax is endemic in Luangwa National Park and the {{adjoining}} Game Management areas. The first official {{case of the}} disease was reported in 1922 in Luambe National Park. In 1987 a large-scale anthrax epidemic ravaged almost the entire Luangwa Valley. Since then at least three epidemics of the disease have been reported. Localised sporadic cases of the disease occur almost annually. Despite the frequent epidemics little is known of anthrax {{in terms of its}} epidemiology and impact on conservation. Mortalities were not investigated as wildlife officials attributed the mortalities to natural factors, animal population densities were not estimated and a no systematic disease surveillance programme exists. The number of animals that have died of the disease is not known. Anthrax mortalities are estimated in thousands. For example it is estimated that 4200 hippos and 1000 other animals, including five wild dogs, succumbed to the disease in 1987. No wild dog has been reported in the area since the 1987 epidemic. The objectives of this study were: # to describe the epidemiology and the socio-economic impact of anthrax in the Luangwa Valley; # to examine the control measures adopted when epidemics occur; # to suggest alternative methods of dealing with disease outbreaks in the light of a quantitative risk and cost benefit analyses. Data was collected from reports was undertaken at the veterinary department, the wildlife offices and the national archives. Informal discussions were held with the local community on anthrax epidemics using the rapid rural appraisal technique. Data on animal demographics and rainfall were collected from National Parks and Wildlife Service and the National Meteorological Department. Soil, faeces, and bone samples were collected where large numbers of carcasses had been found during epidemics in the Luangwa National Park. These samples were examined for viable anthrax spores by the Department of Scientific Services in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Information gleaned from official and verbal reports were collated and are presented in tabular from. The information found is inadequate to enable comprehensive quantitative risk and cost/benefit analyses. The economic cost of the disease arises mainly from the trade embargo resulting from veterinary quarantine regulations and the value of animal carcasses. Different scenarios were developed and are examined to present a risk analysis for proposed alternative control measures that could be adopted by the veterinary department when anthrax occurs in the Luangwa Valley. The probability of spreading anthrax by allowing trade in game trophies after treatment with formalin is estimated to be 0. 0003 - 0. 5. Although the impact of the disease on the economic utilisation of wild herbivores and community based natural resource management in the area has never been investigated the potential cost of anthrax epidemics is significant. The estimated cost of anthrax epidemics, depending on the size, {{as a result of the}} current disease control strategy are 124, 3 – 2079, 5 million <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha.</b> The proposed alternative disease control measures could decrease the cost to 43, 5 – 852, 6 million <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha.</b> It is suggested that various measures be adopted to enable a better understanding of the dynamics of anthrax in the Luangwa Valley. These include : # the establishment of a veterinary unit with in the park # improved surveillance and reporting of diseases # regular censuses and estimates of population densities within the Park # improved communication between the veterinary Department and the Wildlife Authority.

40|$|Political {{events can}} be {{described}} as events that affect a country's economic and regulatory environment. Such events may include changes in monetary and fiscal policy, changes in trade and foreign policy, cabinet reshuffles and changes in government. In emerging markets, political events can affect asset prices because of the impact they can have on foreign sentiment and investor confidence. Elections in particular can cause considerable uncertainty which can lead to herding behavior by investors, if outcomes do not reflect prior predictions. Unfavorable election results can lead to currency depreciation, stock market crashes and economic deterioration as investors change their expectations and demand higher premiums due to the perceived increase in sovereign as well as currency risk. This research focuses specifically on the effect of presidential elections on the exchange rate between U. S. Dollar and <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha.</b> The study employs the event study methodology by dividing elections into two periods and these are; a month leading to the election and another month after the elections. The study will examine three distinct presidential elections that occurred in Zambia in 2011, 2015 and 2016 respectively. The research uses daily time series data for the periods September 2011, January 2015 and August 2016. The methodology makes use of the currency pair's daily mid-rate as inputs to the market model. The market model was used to calculate average abnormal returns and cumulative average abnormal returns. Test of significance was conducted using t-test with 5 percent level of significance using a two-tailed test. The results of the t-test show that political events represented by the presidential elections had a statistically significant effect on the Kwacha, with noteworthy observations concentrated around the days following the event. The study recommends that key policy makers and stakeholders should place more emphasis in ensuring a healthy and safe political environment in the country. Investors should also be cautioned against viewing emerging markets as one homogenous group. The results in this study are unique to Zambia, which has had a history of holding peaceful (and arguably), free and fair elections since becoming a multi-party democracy in 1991...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{people are}} dying from treatable diseases because they cannot reach medical care when they need it most. Typical methods of transport, such as wheelbarrows or motorcycles, are too slow, dangerous, or expensive. The bicycle ambulance is a locally produced and maintained, fuel-less vehicle that provides safe, affordable transport. The design of this appropriate technology varies greatly between countries because of the variability in local conditions, such as terrain, cultural stigmas, and availability of materials. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} bicycle ambulance (Zambulance) designed for Zambia. The Zambulance is a two-wheeled trailer that carries a sheet metal stretcher, and can be towed by common bicycles. The ambulance is fabricated from standard bicycle components and steel stock, such as 25 mm round tube that can be easily bent to minimize cuts and welds. A single rider can transport one patient at average speeds of 25 kph for distances up to 35 km on passable B-grade roads. The trailer is 200 cm by 98 cm and weighs 22 kg, while the stretcher is 200 cm by 65 cm and weighs 20 kg. The Zambulance costs 1, 200, 000 <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha</b> or about 315 USD (based on exchange rate on December 27, 2007). One Zambulance can be fabricated in about 20 hours, which are usually spread over 5 days. There are currently forty-seven Zambulances in Zambia, and more are being produced by Disacare Wheelchair Center in Lusaka, Zambia. From January 2006 to August 2007, one bicycle ambulance was used over 125 times to transport patients from their homes to the nearby clinic and hospice. According to records, the ambulance carried men and {{women between the ages of}} twelve and ninety who were suffering from various ailments including cholera, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, blindness, broken bones, anemia, and pneumonia. A production manual, user manual, and assessment material is available online for free downloading at [URL] Long-term monitoring and evaluation of the design is needed, but current data suggests that the Zambulances are already saving lives by closing the transport gap between patients and healthcare. by Jessica Vechakul.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} impact on {{agricultural}} productivity of the Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP) {{as well as the}} impact of credit provided to small-scale farmers by commercial banks. It compares the two strategies by government (i. e. FISP which is a government subsidy programme and government grants to commercial banks for on-ward lending to small-scale farmers). This is to determine which policy intervention is promoting agricultural growth among the targeted farmers. The study hypothesises that subsidies through FISP and credit from private lending institutions allow farmers to have access to production inputs and reduces production costs. This enables farmers to maximise output leading to an increase in productivity and growth. This study was done by conducting a survey and data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) criterion are the methods used and the tool for analysis was the Statistical Package for Social Scientist (SPSS). Simple random multistage stratified purposive sampling was used in selecting household respondents. Multistage {{in the sense that the}} farm settlements were not defined in a particular pattern with house numbers. Stratified purposive sampling in the sense that farmers had to be separated according to the kind of institution they benefited from. The sample size for the study was 140 individual household for small-scale farmers. Major findings of the study showed that loan beneficiary farmers were investing more in productive assets compared to FISP beneficiary farmers. They had even showed elements of diversification as they were investing more in small livestock such as chickens, goats and pigs unlike the FISP beneficiaries. They had also spent a total of <b>Zambian</b> <b>Kwacha</b> (ZMW) 48, 100 compared to ZMW 28, 462 spent by FISP beneficiaries on productive assets. In terms of investments for assets used in the home, we concluded that both groups had a similar lifestyle but FISP farmers had a higher standard of living compared to loan beneficiary farmers as they had spent 10. 6 % more in terms of expenditure. The field plots under cultivation were grouped into three categories, i. e. farmers who cultivated plots below 2. 5 hectares, 2. 6 hectares to 5. 0 hectares and above 5. 1 hectares to assess which category of farmers was showing growth in terms of land under cultivation. For the 11 % FISP beneficiaries who had graduated from the below 2. 5 hectares of land being ploughed to the middle bracket, only 1 % of the farmers managed to sustain their increase in ploughed land. There were no farmers who managed to plough above 5. 1 hectares of land under the FISP category. As for the loan beneficiary group, we see movement in all three categories indicating growth in terms of productivity. We noticed that from the 4 % farmers who managed to graduate from the below 2. 5 hectares category to the 2. 6 hectares to 5. 0 hectares category, a further 3 % of the beneficiaries managed to graduate to the above 5. 1 hectares of area ploughed. We determined variability in output by examining its relationship with independent variables such as educational level attained, fertiliser quantity used, maize seed quantity used and access to assets (oxen) ceteris paribus. Only fertiliser and hybrid maize seed use were found to be statistically significant with p-values below 5 % and 10 % significant levels respectively in both cases. A 1 kilogram (kg) increase in fertiliser and hybrid maize seed use would result in a 0. 69 % and 0. 26 % increase respectively in the quantity of 50 kg bags harvested for FISP beneficiary farmers. A 1 kg increase in fertiliser and hybrid maize seed use would result in a 0. 83 % and 0. 11 % increase in the quantity of 50 kg bags of maize harvested by the loan beneficiary farmers. Comparing the two beneficiary groups in terms of productivity and income earned through the sale of maize on the market, the loan beneficiary group was found to be doing far much better compared to the FISP group. In the 2009 / 10 farming season, the loan group sold a total of 6754 bags of maize compared to 3428 bags sold by the FISP group. In the 2010 / 11 farming season, the loan group sold 7769 bags as opposed to the 4606 bags sold by the FISP group while in the 2011 / 12 farming season, the loan group sold a total of 9151 bags of maize on both markets compared to 4822 bags of maize that was sold by the FISP group. Though it may be difficult to distinguish the real effects of both the FISP and loan programme on its beneficiaries due to lack of baseline information based on regression results alone, and claim that it has made either group better than the other, it is clear that the fertiliser support policy is working better for loan beneficiaries when compared to FISP beneficiaries. This gives them an edge in income over FISP beneficiaries and graduates them into higher brackets of productivity and asset possession leading to higher yields, more income and increased growth in agricultural productivity in general. It is recommended that educational level attained should be one of the major criteria for farmer selection when introducing new advanced technologies to increase productivity. The other recommendation is that, to invest in improved ploughing methods such as use of oxen, the area under cultivation should not be less than 2. 5 hectares. It is also recommended that government should increase service delivery in an efficient manner as it has positive externalities on farmers dealing with the private sector as well other than just those targeted farmers they are servicing under the FISP programme.
