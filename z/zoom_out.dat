5|$|In the film, {{images from}} {{unmanned}} aerial drones show the viewer {{the point of}} view of CIA commanders in Washington. These were filmed by John Marzano (Aerial Director Of Photography) using a helicopter mounted with a Wescam 35 on the nose of a helicopter, and Cineflex's V14 surveillance system, hanging from the side. Its 1–40 zoom allowed the filmmakers to fly very high and then <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> of Ferris strolling through a market-place, creating the film's final shot.|$|E
25|$|Galactic Civilizations II {{is powered}} by a custom 3D game engine, {{although}} most user interface elements are displayed in 2D. Planets and ships are restricted to a single plane in space, but the user may pan and zoom as they wish, even to view the details of individual ships. Players may <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> to view the galactic map on a wide scale, at which point the ships, planets and anomalies are replaced by icons. It is possible to play the game in this mode.|$|E
25|$|TVS's {{identity}} {{featured a}} six coloured symbol that formed up {{in three stages}} from the outside in before zooming out and sitting alongside the TVS lettering, accompanied by a shortened version of the station theme New Forest Rondo. There were different variations for weekday and weekend, which only differed in the <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> to the lettering. The ident was shot initially on film of a mechanical model, but was later shot using video effects and from 1985, a computer generated version of the ident was used. Accompanying this ident was a clock on a black background with the six TVS colours either side, and an ident sequence following the theme 'For the best view of the South' which was used prior to the news.|$|E
40|$|Visuospatial {{attention}} {{can either}} be "narrowly" focused on (zooming in) or "widely" distributed to (<b>zooming</b> <b>out)</b> different locations in space. In the current {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study, we investigated the shared and differential neural mechanisms underlying the dynamic "zooming in" and "zooming out" processes while potential distance confounds from visual inputs between zooming in and <b>zooming</b> <b>out</b> were controlled for. When compared with <b>zooming</b> <b>out,</b> <b>zooming</b> in differentially implicated left anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), which may reflect the functional specificity of left anterior IPS in focusing attention on local object features. By contrast, <b>zooming</b> <b>out</b> differentially activated right inferior frontal gyrus, which may reflect higher demands on cognitive control processes associated with enlarging the attentional focus. A conjunction analysis between zooming in and <b>zooming</b> <b>out</b> revealed significant shared activations in right middle temporal gyrus, right superior occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal cortex. The latter result suggests that the right posterior temporal-occipital-parietal system, which is known to be crucial for the control of spatial attention, is involved in updating the internal representation of the spatial locations that attentional processing is associated with...|$|R

This {{countdown}} was also based on the 2000 version. After 20 seconds, the screen did not show the remaining time due to an error thus forcing it to shut off. This caused some people to count down off time. However, the screens placed at the bottom still showed the countdown clock from 1999.|$|E
500|$|... 2010–11 - present, aka [...] "Pendulum”: As {{the seconds}} also in yellow {{in a new}} {{typeface}} <b>zoom</b> <b>out,</b> they reveal the next second as they disappear from the screen. A pendulum can also be seen, swinging as the numbers also coated with radiation <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> from a red [...] "warp" [...] background. A silver art deco border adorns the screens. The upper segment shows an analog clock displaying the current time. At some points, fireworks were added to maintain the theme. At midnight, the pendulum shatters and the words [...] "Happy New Year!" [...] flip out. The timer debuted on the 2010–11 edition of Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve and made a brief appearance in the 2011 movie New Year's Eve. The countdown's theme {{was based on the}} clock on the Paramount Building. (For 2010–11, the Toshiba logo was on the upper portion of the lower Toshibavision screen; it was on the lower portion for 2011–12, which would eventually switch to the upper portion. Also, the upper Toshibavision analog clock was two seconds late for 2011–12. For accuracy purposes, the second hand was removed from the top screen for 2011–12. The second hand was again removed for 2012-13, but returned in 2013-14. However, the second hand was again two seconds late. (This countdown theme is now used for global countdown celebrations in the Square.) ...|$|E
500|$|Optical effects artist Dunn {{claimed that}} [...] "up to 80 percent of some reels was {{optically}} printed." [...] These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years. The optical printer improved {{some of the}} deep focus shots. One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive graininess, such as the optical <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> of the snow globe. Welles decided to superimpose snow falling to mask the graininess in these shots. Toland said that he disliked {{the results of the}} optical printer, but acknowledged that [...] "RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production—a by no means inconsiderable assignment—with ability and fine understanding." ...|$|E

The opening shot of [...] "The Coon" [...] is also inspired by a sequence from Watchmen: both feature a close-up of a city sidewalk and <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> to someone looking down from the top of a tall skyscraper. A poster of the Coon shown at Cartman's Coonicon 2009 is inspired by the front cover of The Dark Knight Returns, the Batman graphic novel by Frank Miller. Other common comic book film traits parodied in [...] "The Coon" [...] include costumes that do little to actually conceal secret identities, trophies adorning superhero secret lairs, and sudden disappearing exits and entrances.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} to feature battling wizards, {{who would have}} had creatures (originally named Titans) to raise, and be powered by belief. A key idea was the ability to turn living beings into Titans. Healey's early visualisation featured the Horned Reaper from Dungeon Keeper representing Titans. The team wanted the player {{to see the world}} from the same perspective as possessing a creature in Dungeon Keeper (it was originally intended for the player {{to be able to take}} control of creatures in the first-person). Molyneux wanted [...] "limitless flexibility" [...] and the ability to <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> to see the world from the sky. It was decided to make the player a god when it was realised that humans could not wield the powers that were being implemented. The spells that were to be cast became miracles, and the wizards' supporters became worshippers. The mechanic of turning living beings into Titans was dropped because of problems with balance, with certain Titans having advantages over others. After the name Titans was dropped, others were considered, including Sards, Demes, Ikons, Psiphs, and Amalians. None had unanimous support, so they ended up being called 'creatures'. Elements of the Wizard theme, such as Temples resembling a wizard's tower, remain in the final game. Temples were originally named Citadels and some sported a medieval, fairy-tale look.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{was among}} the first {{directors}} to use video assist during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of 2001, he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. On some films, such as Barry Lyndon, he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses [...] "dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers". For Barry Lyndon he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using [...] "pure candlelight", and in doing so Kubrick [...] "made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting... You almost posed like for portraits." [...] LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's [...] "magic lens" [...] and that he became a [...] "legend" [...] among cameramen around the world.|$|E

40|$|Harel (1988) {{introduces}} {{the notion of}} <b>zooming</b> <b>out</b> as a useful operation in working with higraphs. <b>Zooming</b> <b>out</b> allows one to consider less detailed versions of a higraph by dropping some detail from the description in a structured manner. Although {{this is a very}} useful operation it seems it can be misleading in some circumstances by allowing the user of the <b>zoomed</b> <b>out</b> higraph to make false inferences given the usual transition system semantics for higraphs. We consider one approach to rectifying this situation by following through Harel's suggestion that, in some circumstances, it may be useful to consider higraphs with edges that have no specific origin or destination. We call these higraphs loose higraphs and show that an appropriate definition of zooming on loose higraphs avoids some of the difficulties arising from the use of zooming. We also consider a logic for connectivity in loose higraph...|$|R

500|$|... 2009–10, aka [...] "Clock": The {{seconds in}} yellow numbers <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> of the screen's center, where a second {{hand of a}} clock sticks out. Electricity zaps the number as it zooms out. The hand moves {{counterclockwise}} instead of clockwise. The timer is placed in front a variety of clock gears. Every 10 seconds the hour indicators around the clock face glow red. Meanwhile, the upper segment of the Toshiba billboard shows more gears and the 2010 sign slowly being lifted up towards the ball, becoming 2010 as it neared {{the top of the}} sign. At midnight, the hand stops ticking and the words [...] "Happy New Year!" [...] flip out and the sign that once showed the numbers 2010 on the upper half of the Toshiba Vision comes back down and says [...] "TOSHIBA" [...] instead. This was the first countdown utilizing Toshiba's new interlocking display system known as ToshibaVision. The countdown made its only appearance on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to simulcast on the lower right corner, via camera. The countdown's theme was loosely based on the entrance to the Paramount Building in Times Square. This countdown is also used for the Global Countdown ceremonies that take place in Times Square on December 31, replacing the year with the current year, then rolling to the next year.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{described}} Notorious {{as having}} [...] "some {{of the most}} effective camera shots in his—or anyone's—work". Hitchcock played off Grant's star power in his first scene, introducing his character with shots {{of the back of the}} actor's head showing him observing Alicia carefully. The excess of her drinking is reinforced the next morning with a close-up and <b>zoom</b> <b>out</b> from a glass of fizzing aspirin beside her bed. The camera switches to her point of view and the viewer sees Grant as Devlin, backlit and upside down. The film also contains a tracking shot at Sebastian's mansion in Rio de Janeiro: starting high above the entrance hall, the camera tracks all the way down to Alicia's hand, showing her nervously twisting the key there.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{well-known}} HBO program opener, [...] "Neon Lights", began movies airing {{outside of}} primetime from November 1, 1986, to September 30, 1997.

From 1997 to 1999, HBO used several feature presentation bumpers designed by Pittard Sullivan featuring the network logo in different situations (such as a fish in water, a celebrity in a limousine, a large HBO logo chasing a man and a neon HBO logo on the rooftop of a building); these sequences were also used by the network as IDs from 1997 to 2002, and in upcoming program and evening schedule bumpers until 2000.|$|E
