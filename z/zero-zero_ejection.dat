25|$|The {{empty weight}} {{increased}} by 200kg (440lb), {{partly due to}} the addition of two Martin-Baker Mk 10 <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats, in place of the Mk 4 used in the F1C, which had a forward speed limitation.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage 2000 is {{available}} as a single-seat or two-seat multi-role fighter. The pilot flies the aircraft {{by means of a}} centre stick and left hand throttles, with both incorporating hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a SEM MB Mk10 <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seat (a license-built version of the British Martin-Baker Mark 10).|$|E
500|$|The {{technological}} advances {{incorporated into the}} Harrier II, compared with the original Harrier, significantly reduce the workload on the pilot. The supercritical wing, hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control principle, and increased engineered [...] stability make the aircraft fundamentally easier to fly. Ed Harper, general manager for the McDonnell Douglas Harrier II development program, summarized: [...] "The AV-8B {{looks a lot like}} the original Harrier and it uses the same operating fundamentals. It just uses them a lot better". A large cathode-ray tube multi-purpose display, taken from the F/A-18, makes up much of the instrument panel in the cockpit. It has a wide range of functions, including radar warning information and weapon delivery checklist. The pilots sit on UPC/Stencel 10B <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats, meaning that they are able to eject from a stationary aircraft at zero altitude.|$|E
5000|$|Variant {{with added}} Martin-Baker Mk.11, <b>zero-zero</b> class <b>ejection</b> seats and modernized {{avionics}} ...|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the {{fuselage}} included a height differential between the two seats of the cockpit; this provided generous levels of visibility for the instructor in the rear seat. Each cockpit is fitted with a Martin-Baker Mk10B <b>zero-zero</b> rocket-assisted <b>ejection</b> seat. Air is fed to the aircraft's rear-mounted Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour engine via intakes {{on each of the}} forward wing roots. During the aircraft's development, Hawker had worked closely with Rolls-Royce to reduce the engine's fuel consumption and to ensure a high level of reliability.|$|R
50|$|The AT-3 is a low-wing {{monoplane}} with {{a straight}} wing and a conventional slab tailplane. The AT-3 has five weapon mounts (one centerline, two inboard underwing, two outboard underwing) and wingtip launch rails. There are two <b>Zero-zero</b> Martin-Baker 10 <b>ejection</b> seats in the tandem dual-control cockpit of production models. The rear seat (the Instructor position) is elevated 30 cm to allow better over-the-nose visibility. There's a rarely used small bomb bay feature in the aircraft, now mostly holding an auxiliary fuel tank. AT-3 has two Honeywell/Garrett TFE731-2-2L non-afterburning turbofan engines, producing a total thrust of 3178 kg (31.1 kN; 7000 lb). It is able to carry various size iron bombs, rocket pods, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles and locally produced TC-1 IR Air-to-air missiles.|$|R
500|$|The {{glass cockpit}} {{is covered by}} a transparent, acrylic canopy that {{provides}} the pilot with a good, all-round field of view. A centre stick is used for pitch and roll control while rudder pedals control yaw. A throttle is located {{to the left of}} the pilot. The cockpit incorporates hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a Martin-Baker Mk-16LE <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seat. The cockpit incorporates an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and a wide-angle, holographic head-up display (HUD), which has a minimum total field of view of 25 degrees. The EFIS comprises three colour multi-function displays, providing basic flight information, tactical information, and information on the engine, fuel, electrical, hydraulics, flight control, and environment control systems. The HUD and MFD can be configured to show any available information. Each MFD is [...] and [...] tall and is arranged side-by-side in portrait orientation. The central MFD is placed lowest to accommodate a control panel between it and the HUD.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{differs from}} the baseline EMB-312 Tucano trainer aircraft in several respects. It {{is powered by a}} more powerful [...] Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-68C engine (compared to the EMB-312's [...] powerplant); has a strengthened airframe to sustain higher g loads and increase fatigue life to 18,000–12,000 hours in operational environments; a reinforced landing gear to handle greater takeoff weights and heavier stores load, up to 1,550kg (3,300lb); Kevlar armour protection; two internal, wing-mounted [...]50 cal. machine guns (with 200 rounds of ammunition each); capacity to carry various ordnance on five weapon hardpoints including Giat NC621 20mm cannon pods, Mk 81/82 bombs, MAA-1 Piranha air-to-air missiles (AAMs), BLG-252 cluster bombs, and SBAT-70/19 or LAU-68A/G rocket pods on its underwing stations; and has a night-vision goggle-compatible [...] "glass cockpit" [...] with hands-on-throttle-and-stick controls; provision for a datalink; a video camera and recorder; an embedded mission-planning capability; forward-looking infrared; chaff/flare dispensers; missile approach warning receiver systems and radar warning receivers; and <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats. The structure is corrosion-protected and the side-hinged canopy has a windshield able to withstand bird strike impacts up to [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{squadron}} was disbanded {{again in}} the second half of 1988 in the face of serious problems with maintaining the Nanchang A-5C. Equipment and personnel were transferred to other units and the problematic A-5Cs were sent to China for overhaul. The squadron was reestablished after their return on 13 November 1989 and soon returned to operational status. Its role was changed in May 1990 to that of an Operational Conversion Unit. Although the pilots were converted to the A-5C, there were many aircrew fatalities caused by its relatively primitive ejection seat. The A-5 fleet was grounded and aircrews were again transferred to other squadrons. The first batch of new <b>zero-zero</b> capable Martin-Baker <b>ejection</b> seats was delivered to PAF Base Masroor on 1 July 1991, and within 2 months the A-5C fleet began flying again.|$|R

5000|$|Although two-seat {{variants}} are planned, {{the examples}} built to date are crewed {{by a single}} pilot on a Martin-Baker <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seat; a locally developed ejection seat is planned for future installation. Tejas requires a very short runway and [...] "rockets off the runway and into the air in a mere 500 metres".|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} has a tandem stepped {{dual control}} cockpit equipped with Martin-Baker Mk 10 <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats. The instructor's {{seat at the}} rear position is raised by 35 cm to provide better visibility. The canopy was made as a single piece (prototypes and planes 701-707), later changed to a two-piece canopy, both opening to the starboard side.|$|E
50|$|The Neshers' {{airframe}} {{was identical}} to the Mirage 5, {{but there was an}} extensive refitting of Israeli avionics, a Martin-Baker <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seat, and improved provisions for a wider range of AAMs (Air-to-Air Missiles), including the Israeli Shafrir heat-seeking missile. Fifty-one Nesher fighters (Nesher S) and ten Nesher two-seat trainers (Nesher T) were built in all.|$|E
50|$|The DC (two-seat) {{prototype}} #003 first flew on January 23, 1977, and {{was lost}} on November 24, 1977 due to tail flutter. The left elevator broke off while {{in level flight}} at 500 m altitude and 1,045 km/h. The Martin-Baker Mk RU10J <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats functioned well and the two test pilots ejected safely. After this event the aft fuselage structure was reinforced.|$|E
50|$|The Ranger 2000 was {{powered by}} a Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D-5C {{turbofan}} mounted in the rear fuselage and fed by two air intakes above the wing roots. The wing was straight a low-mounted {{and it had a}} retractable nosewheel landing gear. It had a crew of two in tandem, with the rear instructor raised to maintain visibility. Both crew had a Stencel <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seat.|$|E
50|$|In the cockpit, the HJT-36 has a {{conventional}} tandem two-seat configuration with the trainee pilot forward and the instructor in the raised {{seat to the}} rear. The single-piece canopy gives both pilots good, all-round vision. The prototype aircraft used Zvezda K-26LT lightweight <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats. However, these may be replaced with Martin-Baker Mk.16 IN16S seats, due to a price escalation of the former. The pilots have both conventional and manual flight controls.|$|E
50|$|In January 2003, VT-10 {{initiated}} instructor orientation {{flights in}} the T-6A “Texan II”, the joint Air Force/Navy platform slated {{to replace the}} T-34C “Turbomentor” as the primary phase syllabus trainer. The T-6A “Texan II”, is a single engine, two-seat trainer, which is fully aerobatic. It features a pressurized cockpit, a G-tolerance enhancement system and dual <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats. The T-6A utilizes a state-of-the-art digital cockpit, to help familiarize students with what they will encounter in their fleet tours.|$|E
5000|$|The cockpit {{is covered}} by a two-piece bubble canopy {{providing}} 360 degrees of visual coverage for the pilot. The canopy lifts upwards to permit cockpit entry and exit. The Controls {{take the form of}} a conventional centre stick and a throttle stick located to the left of the pilot. These also incorporate [...] "hands on throttle and stick" [...] (HOTAS) controls. A <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seat is provided for the pilot, permitting safe ejection in an emergency even at zero altitude and zero speed.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{military}} {{issued a}} request for proposal for a trainer {{to be used by}} the United States Air Force and United States Navy. Cessna responded with the 526, based on its 525 CitationJet civilian business jet. The 526 and 525 shared 75% commonality including the wings, engines and landing gear. The electrical- hydraulic- and fuel systems were also common to the two types. The 526 had a redesigned fuselage featuring a tandem two-seat cockpit with <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats; and a new empennage with a low-mounted tailplane instead of the 525's T-tail.|$|E
5000|$|The pilot had an {{ejection}} seat. On activation, it propelled {{the pilot}} upward from the vehicle with an acceleration of roughly 14 times {{the force of}} gravity for about a half second. From the ground, it was sufficient to propel the seat and pilot to an altitude of about [...] where the pilot’s parachute could be automatically and successfully deployed. Manufactured by Weber Aircraft LLC, {{it was one of the}} first <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats, capable of saving the operator even if the aircraft was stationary on the ground - a necessity given the LLRV's low and slow flight envelope.|$|E
50|$|A <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seat is {{designed}} to safely extract upward and land its occupant from a grounded stationary position (i.e., zero altitude and zero airspeed), specifically from aircraft cockpits. The zero-zero capability was developed to help aircrews escape upward from unrecoverable emergencies during low-altitude and/or low-speed flight, as well as ground mishaps. Parachutes require a minimum altitude for opening, to give time for deceleration to a safe landing speed. Thus, prior {{to the introduction of}} zero-zero capability, ejections could only be performed above minimum altitudes and airspeeds. If the seat was to work from zero (aircraft) altitude, the seat would have to lift itself to a sufficient altitude.|$|E
5000|$|All {{crew members}} sit on forward-facing, {{upward-firing}} Douglas Escapac <b>zero-zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats. In [...] "group eject" [...] mode, initiating ejection from either front seat ejects the entire crew in sequence, {{with the back}} seats ejecting 0.5 seconds before the front {{in order to provide}} safe separation. The rear seats are capable of self ejection, and the ejection sequence includes a pyrotechnic charge that stows the rear keyboard trays out of the occupants' way immediately before ejection. Safe ejection requires the seats to be weighted in pairs, and when flying with a single crewman in the back the unoccupied seat is fitted with ballast blocks.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} tandem-seating arrangement (student in-front/instructor behind) in a bird strike-resistant glass canopy with allround vision. The cabin, which is pressurized, {{is equipped with}} an On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), air conditioning, and Martin-Baker CH16C <b>Zero-Zero</b> <b>ejection</b> seats. The flight controls, which are fully balanced and harmonized, are optimized for easy of operation and overall effectiveness. An anti-g system is also present {{in order to minimize}} the effects of high g-forces experienced during tactical training and aerobatic maneuvers. Pilots are able to spend a greater amount of time concentrating on the aircraft's external situation and upon mission data inputs due to an ergonomic design approach, ease-of-use controls, and clear visual/system data displays. In addition, a full autopilot and civil flight management system are also present.|$|E
