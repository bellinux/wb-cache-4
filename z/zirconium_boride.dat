40|$|This {{translation}} {{from the}} original Russian book outlines {{the production of a}} variety of materials by methods of self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS). The types of materials discussed include: hard, refractory, corrosion and wear-resistant materials, as well as other advanced and speciality materials. The authors address the issue of optimal parameters for SHS reactions occurring during processes involving a preliminary metallothermic reduction stage, and they calculate this using thermodynamic approaches. In order to confirm the effectiveness of this approach, the authors describe experiments focussing on the synthesis of elemental crysalline boron, boron carbides and nitrides. Other parts of this brief include theoretical and experimental results on single-stage production of hard alloys on the basis of titanium and <b>zirconium</b> <b>borides,</b> as well as macrokinetics of degassing and compaciton of SHS-products.

40|$|Hafnium and <b>zirconium</b> <b>borides</b> {{are leading}} {{candidate}} materials {{for use in}} ultra-high-temperature applications thanks to their excellent combination of physical, mechanical and oxidation resistance properties. It {{has been shown that}} the addition of MoSi 2 allows the densification without the application of pressure, improves the oxidation resistance and the mechanical properties at high temperatures. Despite the use of this sintering additive for several ultra high temperature ceramics, the densification mechanisms are still unclear and matter of debate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool to explore microstructure at small length scale. A careful literature analysis reveals that neither detailed TEM work nor any reports on densification mechanism are available for this class of materials. In the present work, the microstructure of HfB 2 -MoSi 2 and ZrB 2 -MoSi 2 composites was analyzed in detail in order to gain an insight into the densification mechanism during pressureless sintering. The formation of solid solutions was observed in ZrB 2 -MoSi 2 system, whilst the solubility of Mo into HfB 2 lattice seems to be more limited. For both composites the presence of (TM,Mo) 5 SiB 2, where TM=Hf or Zr, was detected.

5000|$|Refractory {{carbides}} like {{titanium carbide}} and borides like titanium boride and <b>zirconium</b> <b>boride</b> can evaporate without undergoing decomposition in the vapor phase. These compounds are deposited by direct evaporation. In this process these compounds, compacted {{in the form}} of an ingot, are evaporated in vacuum by the focused high-energy electron beam, and the vapors are directly condensed over the substrate. [...] Certain refractory oxides and carbides undergo fragmentation during their evaporation by the electron beam, resulting in a stoichiometry that is different from the initial material. For example, alumina, when evaporated by electron beam, dissociates into aluminum, AlO3 and Al2O. Some refractory carbides like silicon carbide and tungsten carbide decompose upon heating, and the dissociated elements have different volatilities. These compounds can be deposited on the substrate either by reactive evaporation or by co-evaporation. In the reactive evaporation process, the metal is evaporated from the ingot by the electron beam. The vapors are carried by the reactive gas, which is oxygen in case of metal oxides or acetylene in case of metal carbides. When the thermodynamic conditions are met, the vapors react with the gas in the vicinity of the substrate to form films. Metal carbide films can also be deposited by co-evaporation. In this process, two ingots are used, one for metal and the other for carbon. Each ingot is heated with a different beam energy so that their evaporation rate can be controlled. As the vapors arrive at the surface, they chemically combine under proper thermodynamic conditions to form a metal carbide film.|$|E

Tantalum composites remain a less explored class of ceramics. In this contribution, TaB 2 -based ceramics were hot pressed with addition of 5 - 10 vol% MoSi 2. Temperatures in the range of 1680 - 1780 ?C led to relative density around 90 - 95 %. The microstructure was studied through X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and the results enabled the rebuilding of the densification mechanisms occurring upon sintering.

40|$|Some {{transition}} metal carbides and borides are ultra-high temperature ceramic compounds that have application {{in the nuclear}} and aerospace industries. The existing thermodynamic assessments of the systems containing the hafnium and <b>zirconium</b> carbides and <b>borides</b> were examined, along with all available experimental and theoretical data. One of the challenges of thermodynamic modelling is in accurately describing the point defects in ordered compounds. In the {{transition metal}} carbides and borides, vacancies and substitutional defects are common and {{play a significant role}} in determining the material behaviour. Hafnium and zirconium are very difficult to separate, and as such there is always some level of contamination in these compounds. Despite this, there is very limited quantitative information available about the effect that this contamination has on the properties of the material. Using first principles calculations of substitutional point defects in UHTC compounds, the CALPHAD modelling in existing thermodynamic assessments of the ternary boron-hafnium-zirconium and carbon-hafnium-zirconium systems was considered and areas for improvement were identified using the first principles insights. Hafnium and zirconium carbide have a wide range of stoichiometry facilitated by carbon vacancies. Developments to first principles techniques have allowed calculations of properties such as the vacancy formation energy that should be considered in thermodynamic assessment, but are currently not explicitly considered in the modelling. Using the carbon-zirconium system as an example, a method was developed by which the vacancy formation energy and vacancy-vacancy interaction energies can be considered directly in an existing CALPHAD optimisation without losing any of the information already encoded within it. This was applied to a thermodynamic assessment in the literature and to a new assessment of the carbon-zirconium system that was performed incorporating new experimental insights. Open Acces...|$|R

Zirconium (Zr), zirconium disilicide (ZrSi 2), and boron carbide (B 4 C) were reacted in graphite crucibles for 60, 120, 180, and 240 minutes.

Thermal shock disks were quenched from temperatures of 1800 degrees, 2000 degrees, 2200 degrees, and 2400 degrees F. The life of turbine blades containing 93 percent ZrB 2 plus 7 percent B by weight was determined in gas-turbine tests. The blades were run at approximately 1600 degrees F and 15, 000 to 26, 000 rpm.

To form <b>Zirconium</b> <b>Boride</b> (ZrB 2) reinforcement in the matrix, two chemical salts of Potassium Tetrafluoroborate (KBF 4) and Potassium Hexafluorozirconate (K 2 ZrF 6) were added. After the fabrication of the test specimen, the specimen is subjected to turning in CNC high speed turning center. Four important parameters of tool nose radius, cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were taken for the present investigation. The in-situ composites were fabricated via-stir casting method followed by manually forge it. The fabricated specimen was turned using a 0. 4 mm nose radius and 0. 8 mm nose radius of PCD CNC inserts. After turning, the metal removal rate and surface roughness were measured and investigated. Based on the results obtained, it was observed that 0. 8 mm nose radius inserted tool produced excellent machinability when compared to 0. 4 mm nose radius. It was noted here that the higher rate of cutting speed, lower rate of feed rate and lower depth of cut combination process parameter produced excellent machinability. Further, the graphite reinforced in-situ AA 7075 - 3 % ZrB 2 - 1 % Gr hybrid composite exhibited improved machinability than others samples of AA 7075 alloy, AA 7075 - 3 %ZrB 2 in-situ composite.

40|$|A {{ceramic paste}} {{that can be}} applied {{relatively}} easily, either by itself or in combination with one or more layer(s) of high-temperature ceramic fabrics, such as silicon carbide or zirconia, has been invented as a means of patching cracks or holes in the reinforced carbon-carbon forward surfaces of a space shuttle in orbit before returning to Earth. The paste or the paste/fabric combination could also be used to repair rocket-motor combustion chambers, and could be used on Earth to patch similar high-temperature structures. The specified chemical composition of the paste admits of a number of variations, and the exact proportions of its constituents are proprietary. In general, the paste consists of (1) silicon carbide, possibly with addition of (2) hafnium carbide, zirconium carbide, <b>zirconium</b> <b>boride,</b> silicon tetraboride, silicon hexaboride, or other metal carbides or oxides blended with (3) a silazane-based polymer. Because the paste is viscous and sticky at normal terrestrial and outer-space ambient temperatures, high-temperature ceramic fabrics such as silicon carbide or zirconia fabric impregnated with the paste (or the paste alone) sticks to the damaged surface to which it is applied. Once the patch has been applied, it is smoothed to minimize edge steps as required [forward-facing edge steps must be < or equal to 0. 030 in. (< or equal to 0. 76 mm) in the original intended space-shuttle application]. The patch is then heated to a curing temperature thereby converting it from a flexible material to a hard, tough material. The curing temperature is 375 to 450 F (approx. 190 to 230 C). In torch tests and arc-jet tests, the cured paste was found to be capable of withstanding a temperature of 3, 500 F (approx. 1, 900 C) for 15 minutes. As such, the material appears to satisfy the requirement, in the original space-shuttle application, to withstand re-entry temperatures of approx. 3, 000 F (approx. 1, 600 C) ...|$|E
40|$|Burnable poisons {{are used}} in all modern nuclear {{reactors}} to permit higher loading of fuel without the necessity of an overly large control rod system. This not only permits a longer core life but {{can also be used}} to level the power distribution. Commercial nuclear reactors commonly use B{sub 4 }C in separate non-fueled rods and more recently, <b>zirconium</b> <b>boride</b> coatings on the fuel pellets or gadolinium oxide mixed with the fuel. Although the advantages are great, there are problems with using these materials. Boron, which is an effective neutron absorber, transmutes to lithium and helium upon absorption of a neutron. Helium is insoluble and is eventually released to the interior of the fuel rod, where it produces an internal pressure. When sufficiently high, this pressure stress could cause separation of the cladding from the fuel, causing overly high centerline temperatures. Gadolinium has several very strongly absorbing isotopes, but not all have large cross sections and result in residual burnable poison reactivity worth at the end of the fuel life. Even if the amount of this residual absorber is small and the penalty in operation small, the cost of this penalty, even if only several days, can be very high. The objective of this investigation was to study the performance of single isotopes in order to reduce the residual negative reactivity left over at the end of the fuel cycle. Since the behavior of burnable poisons can be strongly influenced by their configuration, four forms for the absorbers were studied: homogeneously mixed with the fuel, mixed with only the outer one-third of the fuel pellet, coated on the perimeter of the fuel pellets, and alloyed with the cladding. In addition, the numbers of fuel rods containing burnable poison were chosen as 8, 16, 64, and 104. Other configurations were chosen for a few special cases. An enrichment of 4. 5 wt% {sup 235 }U was chosen for most cases for study in order to achieve a 4 -year fuel cycle. A standard pressurized water reactor fuel core was chosen for the study, and state-of-the-art neutronic reactor core computer codes were used for analysis. Power distribution, fuel burnup, reactivity due to burnable poisons and other fission products, spectrum shift, core reactivity, moderator void coefficients, as well as other parameters were calculated as a function of time and fuel burnup. The results not only showed advantages of separation of burnable poison isotopes but revealed benefits to be achieved by careful selection of the configuration of even naturally occurring elements used as burnable poisons. The savings in terms of additional days of operation is shown in Figure 1, where the savings is plotted for each of six favorable isotopes in the four configurations. The benefit of isotope separation is most dramatic for dysprosium, but even the time savings in the case of gadolinium is several days. For a modern nuclear plant, one day's worth of electricity is worth about one million dollars, so the resulting savings of only a few days is considerable. It is also apparent that the amount of savings depends upon the configuration of the burnable poison...|$|E
