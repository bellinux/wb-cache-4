5000|$|Metazeunerite is an arsenate mineral with a {{chemical}} formula of Cu(UO2)2(AsO4)2·8H2O. The origin of this mineral {{comes from the}} dehydration process that metazeunerite must go through, and its association with <b>zeunerite.</b> As dehydration occurs, <b>zeunerite</b> loses an electron and is then metamorphosed into metazeunerite.|$|E

50|$|<b>Zeunerite</b> is a green copper uranium arsenate mineral with formula Cu(UO2)2(AsO4)2•(10-16)H2O. It is {{a member}} of the {{autunite}} group. Metazeunerite is a dehydration product.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized weathering zone of hydrothermal uranium ore deposits which contain arsenic. Olivenite, mansfieldite, scorodite, azurite and malachite {{are found in}} association with <b>zeunerite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Abernathyite {{forms as}} a coating on {{fractures}} of asphaltic sandstone containing uranium deposits. The mineral occurs {{in association with}} heinrichite, scorodite, and <b>zeunerite.</b> Abernathyite is known from France, Germany, Poland, South Africa, and the United States.|$|E
50|$|From 1859 Zeuner {{worked the}} {{stand-in}} {{director of the}} ETH Zürich, and in May 1865 {{he took over the}} position officially. His former professor, Albin Weisbach, commemorated his friend's acquisition of the post by naming a mineral after him - the transparent green crystal <b>zeunerite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Radiometric {{survey and}} mineralogical {{studies have been}} carried out since 1950, which has {{assessed}} that the mountain formation contains high-grade uranium. Detailed investigations were also carried out during July-August 1951. Uranium was found mainly in the form of <b>zeunerite</b> at three locations though other rock types showed a certain degree of radioactivity.|$|E
5000|$|Metazeunerite is an {{uncommon}} radioactive secondary mineral found in [...] "arsenic bearing hydrothermal uranium deposits" [...] across the world. This widespread mineral occurs specifically in Europe, western North America, Australia, Brazil and Chile, Namibia, and Kazakhstan. [...] It is currently studied through thermal decomposition by calculating the {{different levels of}} dehydration, as <b>zeunerite</b> is transformed into metazeunerite.|$|E
50|$|Brooks Mountain is {{the highest}} peak in the York Mountains range on the Seward Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska. It {{is located in the}} central part of the Teller Quadrangle, about 25 mi east of Cape Prince of Wales. It has an {{elevation}} of 2,918 ft. It has tin ore deposits, and high-grade uranium has also been found in the form of <b>zeunerite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beside the uranium-bearing {{mineralisation}} types, {{there are}} about one dozen different styles of other mineralisation ranging from Sn-W, Pb-Zn, fluorite-barite to quartz-hematite. They had no economic importance but contributed to the large variety of the several hundred minerals known from the deposit. Especially in the oxidation zones of Schneeberg and Oberschlema, many rare secondary minerals are found, with many of them being newly discovered there. For example, in samples from a single ore shot in Schneeberg five new uranium minerals were discovered in 1871, namely walpurgite, <b>zeunerite,</b> troegerite, uranospinite and uranosphaerite.|$|E
5000|$|Geology of the {{mountain}} has been studied since 1902. The mountain formation {{has been reported to}} be an igneous sedimentary rock formation with granite (in a limited area of [...] ), felsic and mafic dykes. Granites in the southwest face of {{the mountain}} contain <b>Zeunerite,</b> a form of uranium. Its age is conjectured to be Mesozoic with intrusions of black slate formations which are in turn dated to the formations of the Cambrian and Pre-Cambrian age. The limestone formations of the Fort Clarence Limestone series are dated to a different set of formations of the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian age.|$|E
40|$|A {{suite of}} uranyl arsenates have been {{analysed}} by Near-infrared spectroscopy. The NIR spectra of <b>zeunerite</b> and metazeunerite {{in the first}} HOH fundamental overtone are different and the spectra of uranyl arsenates of different origins in the 6000 to 7500 cm- 1 region are different. NIR spectroscopy provides a method of determination of the hydration of uranyl arsenates and has implications for the structure {{of water in the}} interlayer. Such a conclusion is also supported by the water OH stretching region where considerable differences are observed. NIR is an excellent technique {{for the study of the}} autunite minerals and may be used to distinguish between different autunite phases such as the partially dehydrated autunites for example <b>zeunerite</b> and metazeunerite...|$|E
40|$|Since 1960, {{the number}} of {{described}} uranyl mineral species has been multiplied by three. To date more than 200 mineral species containing uranium as a main structural element are reported in Nature, and the crystal structures have been determined and refined for only one third of them. Furthermore, many new uranyl minerals are still reported to data, showing sometimes novel chemical compositions and structural arrangements. The uranium mineralogy is a fascinating subject, and an essential field of research as it contributes to {{the improvement of the}} management techniques of nuclear waste. The first part of this work was dedicated to the mineralogical characterisation of uranyl minerals, and especially of the autunite-type minerals, occurring in the Rabejac deposit. Indeed, the identification analyses have shown that many samples contain uranyl arsenates of the autunite and meta-autunite groups. Electron-microprobe chemical analyses performed on these minerals species indicate that the P content in (meta-) <b>zeunerite</b> and (meta-) uranospinite is significant in several samples, confirming the solid-solution series between uranyl arsenates and phosphates. Also, cationic substitutions occurring on the A site were observed, especially in uranospinite samples, in which significant amount of Ca is substituted for Mg. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments have been performed on many members of the (meta-) zeunerite-(meta-) torbernite series, and the crystallographic parameters were put into correlation with the variation of the chemical composition. The crystal structure of arsenuranospathite, the Asanalogue of the Al-bearing uranyl phosphate uranospathite, was solved for the first time, indicating that these two minerals are isostructural (Dal Bo et al., 2015). Also, a structure model is proposed for metauranocircite-I, one of the Ba-bearing uranyl phosphate of the meta-autunite group. Investigations of uranyl mineral samples from other localities have allowed to discover single-crystals of bassetite, one of the Fe end-members of the autunite group. The crystal structure of bassetite was also solved for the first time, and these new structural data were presented in parallel to those obtained on saléeite, the Mg-analogue of bassetite (Dal Bo et al., 2016). Thanks to these new data, a discussion about the mineral hierarchy of the (meta-) autunite group is proposed. In addition, the crystal structure of the rare Al-bearing uranyl phosphate furongite from the Kobokobo pegmatite was determined, showing that this mineral species has unique and novel structural features. This specific study, as well as the redefinition of the structural formula of phuralumite, was the occasion to provide a review about the formation of Al polyhedra clusters in uranyl minerals, and to try to elucidate their physicochemical conditions of crystallisation. Many new crystallographic data were also collected on uranyl minerals for which the crystal structure was already reported in the literature. Therefore, it was possible to confirm the previous studies, or to highlight important discrepancies, {{especially in the case of}} the Al-bearing uranyl phosphate phuralumite. The H-bonds networks, which are essential for the stability of the structure, have been established in the structure of the uranyl carbonate liebigite, and in the structure of the uranyl silicates cuprosklodowskite, kasolite and soddyite. The second part of this work was devoted to the hydrothermal synthesis of uranyl oxysalts. The experimental conditions, as well as the chemical systems, were chosen in agreement with the conditions occurring in natural uranium deposits, or in geological repositories. A new compound, Be[(UO 2) (PO 4) ] 2 (H 2 O) 2. 5, has been synthesized at low temperature. This is the third Be-bearing uranyl phosphate reported to date, and its crystal structure is based upon sheets showing the uranophane anion topology, typical of uranyl silicates occurring in the oxidation zone of the uranium deposits. The well-known Ba[(UO 2) 3 (MoO 4) 4 (H 2 O) ](H 2 O) 3 and (NH 4) 2 [(UO 2) (MoO 4) 2](H 2 O) compounds have been synthesized, and new crystallographic data were collected on them. In addition, it was possible to determine the hydrogen-bonds networks for the first compound, and to redefine the Mo 6 + coordination polyhedra in the second one...|$|E
