50|$|Zoom ring: This {{control is}} found on most EF zoom lenses. It {{is used for}} {{changing}} the focal length of the lens. The <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> usually has certain, common, focal lengths marked on it. To set the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> to any given focal length, one must turn the ring so that the marked focal length matches the zoom index. The zoom index is typically a white, or black, line found next to the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The X10 has {{magnesium}} alloy {{top and bottom}} plates, and a mechanical <b>zoom</b> <b>ring.</b> According to Fujifilm, the fact that 1mm rather than 0.8mm aluminium sheets were chosen for {{the front and rear}} makes the camera [...] "nearly twice as rigid as ordinary cameras". Besides controlling <b>zoom,</b> the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> is also used to power on the camera.|$|R
50|$|Zoom burst is a {{photographic}} technique, attainable with zoom lenses with a manual <b>zoom</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{lens barrel}} {{is made of}} {{magnesium}} alloy, and the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> will scratch after some weeks of regular use.|$|R
50|$|However, the Nikkor AF 70-210 f/4 variant is a two-touch system (dedicated {{focus and}} <b>zoom</b> <b>rings),</b> {{compared}} {{to the rest of}} the lens range, which utilizes a one-touch (push-pull) system for focusing and zooming.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in August 2006, {{the current}} {{incarnation}} of the lens (AF-S VR 4.5-5.6G IF-ED) improves on the original with VR stabilization technology {{as well as with}} internally focusing components (IF). More expensive than its partner 55-200mm lens, its construction is similar, with the exterior shell being fabricated from plastic components. It also shares a similarly stiff <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> with the 55-200mm, although a side benefit of this is that zoom creep is eliminated. Unlike the 55-200, the 70-300mm lens is full-frame. Also, the longer barrel length allowed the focus ring to be relocated in front of the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring,</b> making manual focus operations simpler.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{features}} a weather resistant matte black plastic exterior with the G-brand label and a rubber focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>ring.</b> The {{barrel of the}} lens telescopes outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 70mm to 300mm.|$|R
50|$|The HDR-FX1 {{includes}} three 1/3-inch 16:9 1.12 Megapixel gross CCDs. Each CCD measures 960 x 1080 pixels. It includes a 12x optical Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens, a 3.5-inch LCD screen, a <b>zoom</b> <b>ring,</b> focus ring, and an iris / aperture ring.|$|R
50|$|The lens showcases {{a weather}} {{resistant}} matte-black plastic exterior {{with a pair}} of rubber focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings.</b> The barrel of the lens telescopes outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 16mm to 35mm. The lens does not feature image stabilization.|$|R
50|$|The camera {{has many}} SLR-like {{handling}} features â€” dual control wheels for aperture and shutter speed, manual focus (focus-by-wire) and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings,</b> and a flash hot shoe. It {{is among the}} largest non-SLR cameras built, and is positioned {{at the high end}} of the bridge-camera market.|$|R
50|$|The lens {{features}} an all-plastic construction with rubber focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings.</b> The {{barrel of the}} lens telescopes outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 18mm to 200mm. To combat zoom creep, the lens features a small zoom lock switch on the main lens barrel.|$|R
5000|$|Manual <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> and {{optional}} use {{of manual}} focus ring (fly-by-wire). Autofocus uses hybrid phase detection system (sensors above the lens) for quick focus assist followed by contrast detection system (TTL) for fine focus. Phase detection {{system should be}} switched off in the menu when accessory lenses are mounted.|$|R
50|$|The lens showcases a matte-black weather {{resistant}} plastic exterior {{with a rubber}} focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>ring.</b> There is also a zoom lock to prevent zoom creep and an Autofocus-Manual focus switch. The barrel of the lens telescopes outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 24mm to 70mm.|$|R
5000|$|The lens showcases {{a weather}} {{resistant}} solid all-metal finish [...] {{with a pair}} of metal focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings.</b> The lens also features a prominent Zeiss badge {{on the side of the}} barrel. The barrel of the lens telescopes outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 16mm to 35mm.|$|R
50|$|The lens showcases {{a glossy}} black (or silver) plastic {{exterior}} {{with a pair}} of rubber focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings.</b> The barrel of the lens telescopes outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 55mm to 210mm. However, the lens does not come with a zoom lock to help in combatting zoom creep.|$|R
5000|$|This lens is {{available}} in Canon, Nikon, and Sigma, Pentax, and Sony mounts. HSM focusing {{is available}} only in the Canon, Nikon, and Sigma variants. [...] The build quality is typical of Sigma EX lenses, with a painted metal lens barrel and damped focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings.</b> As expected for a lens of these specifications, {{there is a large}} protruding front element.|$|R
50|$|The lens showcases an off-white weather {{resistant}} plastic and metal exterior {{with a rubber}} focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>ring.</b> The lens features external controls for enabling image stabilization, limiting the focal range of the lens, and changing focusing modes. It also features an three external focus-hold buttons for locking in focus on a subject in motion. The lens maintains its physical length throughout its zoom range.|$|R
50|$|The 18-105mm {{features}} a minimalist metal exterior reminiscent of Sony's Zeiss lenses. The 18-105mm lens {{features a}} wide digital <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> encircling the lens barrel, {{as well as}} a much narrower electronic focusing ring. A two-speed power-zoom rocker {{can be found on the}} side of the lens. There is no zoom lock to prevent zoom creep due to the zoom mechanism being inside the lens barrel itself.|$|R
5000|$|Imaging-Resource {{noted that}} [...] "the zoom lens obscures {{the lower right}} {{quadrant}} of the optical viewfinder", from about 45mm equivalent focal length to 28mm wide angle. Additionally, the user's index finger may appear in the viewfinder while zooming. In spite of this, Imaging-Resource expressed a preference for the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> experience, and TechCrunch referred to the viewfinder shading as [...] "more quaint than problematic".|$|R

50|$|Some reviewers praised {{its value}} and optical performance, but criticized its handling, noting a stiff <b>zoom</b> <b>ring,</b> {{diminutive}} focus ring, and difficulty switching to manual focus. Because the lens has a completely plastic body, including the mount, as is usual for lenses {{in this market}} segment, it is much lighter, but also less sturdy, than more expensive lenses of comparable size and capability which belong to a higher priced, and more professionally oriented, market segment.|$|R
50|$|It has a {{long list}} of {{advanced}} prosumer features, like combining having wide angle (28mm equivalent on a 35mm camera) with having a long-zoom which is rare among long-zoom cameras (most of which being 35mm equivalent at the wide end of the zoom). It also has a full range of manual settings, mechanical <b>zoom</b> <b>ring,</b> high ISO-sensitivities and some of the versatile features of Live-Preview Digital cameras (LPDs) or compact cameras like movie mode, movable LCD panel, macro mode, etc.|$|R
50|$|With the Maxxum line, {{the heavy}} duty metal bodies of earlier Minoltas were {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} lighter and less expensive plastics. The Maxxum 7000, {{the most popular of}} the new Maxxums, introduced the innovation of arrow buttons for setting aperture and shutter speed, rather than a shutter speed dial on the body and an aperture ring on the lens. That way, the only control necessary on the lens is the manual focus <b>ring</b> (plus the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> in the case of zoom lenses).|$|R
50|$|Fujifilm FinePix S9500 or FinePix S9000 is {{a bridge}} digital camera {{released}} by Fujifilm in 2005 and {{intended for the}} enthusiastic amateur. It {{is a member of}} the Fujifilm FinePix family and has been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S100fs.It has a long list of advanced prosumer features, like combining having wide-angle ability (28 mm equivalent on a 35 mm camera), full range of manual settings, mechanical <b>zoom</b> <b>ring,</b> high ISO-sensitivities, and some of the versatile features of Live-Preview Digital cameras (LPDs) like movie mode, movable LCD panel, and macro mode.|$|R
50|$|Zoom creep is a {{phenomenon}} in zoom lenses where the angle {{of view of the}} lens changes when gravity is allowed to freely act on it. If the lens has a <b>zoom</b> <b>ring,</b> holding it when the lens is held upwards or downwards will prevent this change. In lenses with push-pull zoom, creep is prevented by holding the extending part of the lens. Some lenses, such as the Tamron SP AF 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II LD Aspherical IF and Canon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM, have a zoom lock to stop the effect.|$|R
500|$|The sleeve is threaded, {{making it}} {{compatible}} with 72mm filters, but vignetting is severe with the sleeve in place. The construction is plastic although the lens' rear mount is metal. The distance meter is recessed inside a window, but no {{depth of field}} meter or infrared index is present. The 7/8" [...] <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> is made of raised rubber ridges and operates over a 75 degree turning radius. The focus ring is similarly constructed with more closely spaced ridges and a 100 degrees of turning action. The ridges of both rings are parallel to the lens.|$|R
5000|$|The 9xi {{used both}} the older Minolta AF lenses and the xi-series lenses. Many {{of the new}} xi lenses had a new [...] "powerzoom" [...] {{function}} where the <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> electronically <b>zoomed</b> the lens via a motor. This allowed for a few extra functions, such as auto-zoom and zooming effects while exposing; in practice, however, it was slower to use, drained camera batteries and prevented pre-xi camera bodies from accepting the lenses {{because they did not}} have the ability to power the zoom. The xi-series lenses are generally seen as a failure, and no SLR manufacturer offers power-zooming lenses today.|$|R

5000|$|Minolta {{created a}} new {{category}} of [...] "bridge cameras," [...] {{with the introduction of}} the DiMAGE 7. Designed for use by people familiar with 35mm single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras but without the added cost or complication of interchangeable lenses or optical reflex viewfinders, the DiMAGE incorporated many of the features of a higher-level film camera with the simplicity of smaller compact digicams. The camera had a traditional <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> and focus ring on the lens barrel and was equipped with an electronic viewfinder (EVF) rather than the direct optical reflex view of an SLR. It added other features such as a histogram, and the cameras were compatible with Minolta's flashes for modern film SLRs.|$|R
5000|$|The manual <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> {{allows a}} smooth {{progression}} from 35-420 mm equivalent and silent zooms when recording movies. The camera also includes an [...] "extended optical zoom" [...] system providing greater optical zoom ability when shooting at lower resolutions, giving up to 19.3Ã— optical zoom at 3MP. Apertures from f/2.8 to f/11 are supported, though the larger apertures {{are not available}} at high zoom levels (f/3.7 at full zoom). Shutter speeds range from 60 secs to 1/2000 sec. Auto-focus and a [...] "Macro" [...] autofocus modes are available, or a fluid-damped focus ring can be used. The AF-macro setting can be selected for all camera modes. The camera also has a macro capability (5 cm minimum focal range at 1Ã— zoom).|$|R
5000|$|DMC-FZxx: bridge digital cameras, {{resemble}} digital SLRs in many ways, {{but have}} a non-interchangeable, non-extending zoom lens. The FZ70/72 bridge camera is as large and heavy as a medium-sized DSLR, has a 1/2.3" [...] sensor, a very wide zoom range (20-1200mm, 60x) and extensive manual controls, including fully manual focus, and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings</b> on the lens. The FZ200 has a 25-600 mm lens (35 mm equivalent) superzoom with f/2.8 light sensitivity through the whole range and shoots 12 MP stills and full HD video with 24/30/50/60 fps and 120 or 200 fps for slow motion. FZ1000 uses a 1" [...] sensor (as does the Sony RX10). Compared to the RX10, the FZ1000 can shoot 4K video, is priced considerably lower and has double the optical zoom, but no built-in ND Filter and no fixed aperture.|$|R
5000|$|Variable {{depth of}} field and [...] "refocusing": Lytro's [...] "Focus Spread" [...] feature allows the {{depth of field}} (depth of focus) of a 2 {{dimensional}} representation of a Lytro image to be expanded after a picture has been taken. Instead of having to set the focus at a particular distance, [...] "Focus Spread" [...] allows more of an 2D image to be in focus. In some cases {{this may be the}} entire 2D image field. Users also are able to [...] "refocus" [...] 2D images at particular distances for artistic effects. The ILLUM allows the [...] "refocus-able" [...] and [...] "Focus Spreadable" [...] range to be selected using the optical focus and <b>zoom</b> <b>rings</b> on the lens. The ILLUM also features [...] "focus bracketing" [...] to extend the refocusable range by capturing 3 or 5 consecutive images at different depths.|$|R
50|$|The lens has {{a weather}} {{resistant}} plastic construction with a matte-black finish and rubber <b>zoom</b> and focus <b>rings.</b> The {{barrel of the}} lens moves outward from the main lens body as it's zoomed in from 28mm to 70mm.|$|R
5000|$|They {{created a}} new {{category}} of [...] "SLR-like" [...] cameras {{with the introduction of}} the DiMAGE 7 and DiMAGE 5. These cameras mixed many of the features of a traditional SLR camera with the special abilities of a digital camera. They had a mechanical <b>zoom</b> <b>ring</b> and electronic focus ring on the lens barrel and used an electronic viewfinder (EVF) showing 100 per cent of the lens view. They added many high level features such as a histogram and made the cameras TTL-compatible with Minolta's final generation of flashes for film SLRs. The controls were designed to be used by people familiar with SLR cameras, however the manual zoom auto-focus lens was not interchangeable. The model 5 had a 1/1.8-inch sensor with 3.3 megapixels, and the fixed zoom was equal to a 35-250 mm (relative to 24Ã—36mm format). The Dimage 7, later 7i, 7Hi and A1 had 5-megapixel sensors for which the same lens provided 28-200 mm equivalent coverage. The later A2 and A200 increased the sensor resolution to 8 megapixels.The Dimage 5 and 7 original models were more sensitive to infrared light than later models, which incorporated more aggressive IR sensor filters, so have become popular for infrared photography.|$|R
50|$|In December 2007, Sony {{released}} the HD1000, the shouldermount {{version of the}} HC7.
