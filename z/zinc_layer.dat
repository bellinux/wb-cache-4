50|$|Galvanization {{consists}} of an application on the object to be protected of a layer of metallic zinc by either hot-dip galvanizing or electroplating. Zinc is traditionally used because it is cheap, adheres well to steel, and provides cathodic protection to the steel surface in case of damage of the <b>zinc</b> <b>layer.</b> In more corrosive environments (such as salt water), cadmium plating is preferred. Galvanization often fails at seams, holes, and joints where there are gaps in the coating. In these cases, the coating still provides some partial cathodic protection to iron, by acting as a galvanic anode and corroding itself instead of the underlying protected metal. The protective <b>zinc</b> <b>layer</b> is consumed by this action, and thus galvanization provides protection only for a limited period of time.|$|E
50|$|Galvanized iron is {{actually}} steel {{covered in a}} protective layer of zinc, but it was soon discovered that this <b>zinc</b> <b>layer</b> naturally corroded due to exposure to the atmosphere and rainwater, as well as cement, runoff, etc. Once corrosion occurred down to the base metal, plaques and rust would form, leading to sediment build-up that would gradually clog these drains.

The intercalation of CA with a nanocarrier, <b>zinc</b> <b>layered</b> hydroxide, produces cinnamate-zinc layered hydroxide (ZCA), {{which has been}} previously characterized. Intercalation is expected to improve the solubility and cell specificity of CA. The nanocarrier will also protect CA from degradation and sustain its release. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effect of intercalation on the anti-inflammatory capacity of CA. Methods: In this study, the anti-inflammatory activity of ZCA was investigated and compared with that of nonintercalated CA. Evaluations were based on the capacity of ZCA and CA to modulate the release of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2, interleukin (IL) - 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL- 1 β, and IL- 10 in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264. 7 cells. Additionally, the expression of proinflammatory enzymes, ie, cyclooxygenase- 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), were examined. Results: Although both ZCA and CA downregulated nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL- 1 ß, and IL- 6, ZCA clearly displayed better activity. Similarly, expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase were inhibited in samples treated with ZCA and CA. The two compounds effectively inactivated the transcription factor NF-κB, but the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL- 10, was significantly upregulated by ZCA only. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that ZCA possesses better anti-inflammatory potential than CA, while <b>zinc</b> <b>layered</b> hydroxide had little or no effect, and these results were comparable with the positive control.

We have developed a nanodelivery formulation based on para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS) and <b>zinc</b> <b>layered</b> hydroxide using <b>zinc</b> nitrate salt as a precursor.

The newly developed formulation was also found active against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and Candida albicans.

50|$|For the pH of {{drinking}} water, the threshold value is 6.5 - 9.5. pH values outside the neutral range (pH 6.5 - 7.5) are principally critical, since they provide {{an indication of}} the corrosion behaviour of water. Slightly acidic water (pH 4 - 6.5) usually corrodes galvanized iron pipes, but also copper and asbestos cement pipes. This process is known as acid corrosion. Practical experience has shown that the use of unprotected steel pipes is only possible at neutral pH values. By lower pH values, the removal of the pure <b>zinc</b> <b>layer</b> is promoted. As a result of the dissolved salts and gases, natural cold waters usually show a slightly alkaline reaction. These properties are created by setting the equilibrium concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. Higher alkaline pH values (pH 9 - 14) in the presence of oxygen as an oxidant lead to so-called oxygen corrosion. To avoid the described acid or oxygen corrosion, buffer solutions are added to the raw water for drinking water production. By the pH-stabilizing effect of hypolimnetic aeration, the application of these buffer solutions can be reduced, thus reducing operating costs.|$|E

As-prepared, well-crystalline LZH-DS has a basal spacing of 31. 5 Å. After treatment with methanol at room temperature, <b>zinc</b> hydroxide <b>layers</b> shrank to form two new layered phases with basal spacings of 26. 4 and 24. 7 Å. The shrinking was accompanied by a decrease in the content of DS anions in the interlayer space, indicating a change in the alignment of the intercalated anions and a decrease in the charge density of the <b>zinc</b> hydroxide <b>layers.</b> The latter effect was assessed by the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of powder X-ray diffraction patterns, revealing the successive removal of Zn ion tetrahedra from the hydroxide layers, with the octahedrally coordinated Zn ions left unaffected. The interlayer space of all three phases was modeled by molecular dynamics, and the models were validated by the comparison of modeled and experimental powder XRD patterns and one-dimensional electron density maps. The arrangement of DS anions in the interlayer space of LZH-DS also depended on temperature. Remarkably, the basal spacing was considerably increased at 55 °C, which was explained by the formation of a second-staging heterostructure with the regular alternation of layers with two basal spacings, 31. 5 and 34. 2 Å. This is the first reported interstratification phenomenon in layered hydroxides intercalated with aliphatic molecules.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} work studying the factors influencing {{on the service}} life of hot-dip galvanised reinforcement bars. The experimental {{part of the study}} consisted of accelerated corrosion tests among others. The comparison of the measured crack width of concrete with the rate of corrosion values, and also with other measured values such as the corrosion potential, the resistivity of concrete, and the mechanical properties of the steel indicated no correlation irrespective of the duration of the exposure or type of aggressive liquid. The rate of corrosion decreased as a function of exposure time. This was not dependent on the water-to-cement ratio of concrete. Three probable corrosion mechanisms are determined for hot-dip galvanised reinforcement bars in cracked concrete, based on long-term durability tests and other studies. The first mechanism consists of a local dissolution of the eta (η) and zeta (ζ) phases of the <b>zinc</b> <b>layer.</b> In the second mechanism, {{as a result of the}} non-uniformity of the zinc coating, local dissolution of the eta (η) and zeta (ζ) phases, together with longitudinal and perpendicular cracking in the <b>zinc</b> <b>layer,</b> may lead to the local separation of the <b>zinc</b> <b>layer.</b> In the third mechanism, as a result of the non-uniformity of the zinc coating, full dissolution of eta (η) phase and partial dissolution of the zeta (ζ) phase, together with longitudinal and perpendicular cracking in the ferrite, may lead to the local separation of the <b>zinc</b> <b>layer</b> and the ferrite. The effects of different reinforcing steels on the service life of outdoor concrete structures were estimated through calculations. A stochastic method based on the probability of damage, Monte Carlo simulation, and reliability and sensitivity analyses were also used. In carbonated intact and cracked concrete the use of hot-dip galvanised reinforcement bars could double the service life compared with the use of ordinary steel reinforcement bars. In chloride-contaminated intact concrete the service life as a result of using hot-dip galvanised reinforcement bars is 3 - 5 times longer compared with ordinary steel reinforcement bars. The conclusion is based on the results received with the critical water-soluble chloride content, 1. 0 - 1. 5 wt%CEM, which is substantially higher than the critical water-soluble chloride content, 0. 3 - 0. 4 wt%CEM, for ordinary steel reinforcement bars...|$|E
