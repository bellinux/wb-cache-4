5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} held <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> royal forester for Worcestershire {{as well as}} sheriff. The {{evidence for}} this is that after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired this because his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to <b>the</b> <b>Office</b> <b>of</b> Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E

During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held <b>the</b> <b>office</b> <b>of</b> acting governor for three days.
