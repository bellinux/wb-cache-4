30|$|The {{efficacy}} of sampling and isolation of airborne wood-decay fungi was firstly checked. As mentioned previously, we identified 11 taxa from 110 disks, despite using 201 disks for the sampling. Presumably, {{part of the}} important fungi may be lost during the subculturing processes on a PDA medium containing biocides. To check this hypothesis, mass losses of the Japanese cedar disks were compared between the disks from which the identified taxa were selected and those not selected. The mean mass loss of the disks from which the taxa were identified was about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>larger</b> <b>as</b> that of the disks from which no taxa were isolated. Statistical analysis using T test revealed {{a significant difference between}} these two groups. In conclusion, important taxa that influence decay risk can be successfully identified in this experimental procedure even though some unimportant fungi might be missed during the subculturing processes.|$|R

40|$|Since 1994, the European Community Household Panel {{provides}} information on changes in the French households income and on household situation vis-à-vis the labour market month after month. Using the five available waves, this paper investigates the impact of some family events {{and changes in the}} job market situation on poverty exits and entries. The analysis focuses on working age households. Poor households are defined as those with a living standard lower than 60 % of the median equivalent income. Five years poverty incidence is found to be 31 %, that is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>larger</b> <b>as</b> one year incidence. One third of poor households exit from poverty in the year after while 6 % of non-poor fall into. Labour income has a major contribution to changes in living standard level. An econometric estimation of poverty flows leads to the following results: Changes in employment situations {{have a major impact on}} poverty entries and exits. Probability of poverty exit increases with the number of working months while the risk of entering poverty increases when the number of working months decreases. For couples, child births increase the risk of poverty entry, but do not modify the probability of poverty exit. After a child departure the household is more likely to exit poverty, but the risk of poverty entry is not significantly affected. A high education level protects against poverty entry, but does not increase the chances of living poverty. Low Income Dynamics, Poverty, Probit Model, Panel...|$|R

The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ("extirpation") by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized Lynx genus.

40|$|Background and Aims: Following {{unilateral}} ovariectomy, the contralateral ovary underwent hypertrophy and {{the number}} of ovulations remained unchanged. The aim {{of the present study was}} to elucidate the mechanism, which occurred by this compensation, through examination of ovarian follicular development in operated rats.

Results: Large follicles soon recovered after surgery, but it took 5 weeks for small and medium-sized follicles to recover. The rate of atresia at the 'critical point' was 31. 1 % in unilateral ovariectomized animals and 73. 9 % in the sham-operated rats. Conclusions: These findings showed that in operated rats, the recovery of the number of follicles varied depending on the size of the follicle.

5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E

The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year.

Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player.

40|$|To further our {{knowledge}} of the structure-function relationship and mechanism of action of the Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE), a series of recombinant CPE (rCPE) species containing N- and C-terminal CPE deletion fragments was constructed by recombinant DNA approaches. Each rCPE species was characterized for its ability to complete the first four early steps in the action of CPE, putatively ordered as specific binding, a postbinding physical change to bound CPE, large-complex formation, and induction of alterations in small-molecule membrane permeability. These studies demonstrated that (i) at least 44 amino acids can be removed from the N terminus of CPE without loss of cytotoxicity, (ii) removal of the first 53 amino acids from the N terminus of CPE produces a fragment that appears to be noncytotoxic because it cannot undergo the post-binding physical change step in CPE action, (iii) removal of as few as five amino acids from the C terminus of CPE produces a noncytotoxic fragment lacking receptor binding activity, and (iv) a fragment lacking the first 44 N-terminal amino acids of native CPE formed <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> much <b>large</b> complex and was <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> cytotoxic as native CPE. From these structure-function results, it appears that the minimum-size cytotoxic CPE fragment comprises approximately residues 45 to 319 of native CPE.
