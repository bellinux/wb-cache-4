40|$|Bit {{error rate}} (BER) {{monitoring}} {{is the ultimate}} goal of performance monitoring in all digital <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> as well as optical fiber <b>transmission</b> <b>systems.</b> To achieve this goal, optimization of the decision threshold must also be considered because BER is dependent on the level of decision threshold. In this paper, we analyze a pseudo-error counting scheme and propose an algorithm to achieve both BER monitoring and adaptive decision threshold optimization in optical fiber <b>transmission</b> <b>systems.</b> To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conduct computer simulations in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian distribution cases. According to the simulation results, BER and the optimum decision threshold can be estimated with the errors of 40 -Gb/s <b>transmission</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|Across North America, {{electricity}} transmission systems are interconnected into wide area synchronous grids, or interconnections. Suppliers are legally required to follow reliability standards. In 2006, Québec's <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as a full interconnection because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems. Québec will consequently {{be able to develop}} its own reliability standards, as needed, and these will apply in addition to the relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay <b>transmission</b> <b>system,</b> the cross-rope suspension tower was invented. This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension tower, the tower legs are spread apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E

In this project, we attempt to reconcile on the one hand the need for media <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> {{and on the other hand}} the concern of privacy protection.

40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the operation and}} applicability of soliton <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> versus NRZ (Non Return to Zero) <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> for the 1300 nm optical window. For a dIfferent number of in-line amplifiers the BER (Bit Error Rate) curves of both <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> have been simulated. For both systems the same fibre dispersion and attenuation has been assumed and all amplifier gains have been chosen so that the fibre losses are compensated for. In case of the soliton system an extra dispersion shifted fibre has been located directly after the laser diode to unchirp and compress the laserpulses. With respect to the BER simulations, soliton and NRZ <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> {{are expected to be}} competitive. Transmission exhibiting an error probability below 10 - 9 is attainable for both systems Under equal circumstances, we conclude from our simulations that soliton systems show better BER performance than NRZ systems beyond 450 km. Owing to the dispersion compensating properties soliton <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> are advantageous when long haul transmission is considered. However, NRZ transmission is both a well established and relatively simple technique and can be more readily implemented...|$|R

5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E

In addition to power transmission technology, Hydro-Québec plans to offer high-speed internet over its transmission lines within a few years; the utility started testing internet over its lines in January 2004.|$|E
5|$|During {{periods of}} low demand gas {{is taken from}} the National <b>Transmission</b> <b>System</b> (NTS) at Beltoft, North Lincolnshire and {{transferred}} via a 12-inch diameter 15km pipeline to the Lindholme Compression Site. Here gas is heated in a water bath heater then through a pressure let-down skid and via a 16-inch 1.5km pipeline to the Hatfield Moor well site for injection into the reservoir for storage. The sandstone reservoir has a capacity of about 4.1 billion cubic feet (116 million cubic metres). During periods of high demand gas is withdrawn from the reservoir and through the 16-inch pipeline to the Lindholme site. Here the gas is dehydrated with glycol and compressed using a gas-turbine driven compressor to a pressure suitable for export to Beltoft and into the NTS.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{condition}} monitoring and fault diagnosis of gear <b>transmission</b> <b>systems.</b> Since the gear <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been used in}} very wide applications, such as the aerospace engineering, manufacturing industry, marine engineering, etc., it is crucial to monitor the working condition of the gear <b>transmission</b> <b>systems.</b> For this purpose, a new method has been proposed in this study to investigate the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of gear <b>transmission</b> <b>systems.</b> In the new method, the oil analysis and vibration analysis have been integrated to collect the fault signals of the gears. Then an intelligent classifier based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is adopted to diagnose the fault types of the gears. To verify the proposed approach, the fault experiments have been carried out in a gear fault simulator. The analysis results show that the lubricant information and vibration information can be well used for the accurate fault detection of the gears. The fault diagnosis rate reaches up to 91. 7 %. Hence, the proposed method can be used in practice for the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of gear <b>transmission</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) storm surge that brought {{water up to}} 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated storm surge of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate was determined to have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm surge was responsible {{for a majority of}} the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) stretch of road leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power <b>transmission</b> <b>system,</b> though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The storm surge destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E
