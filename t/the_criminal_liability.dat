Even {{though there is}} no Czech equivalent for <b>the</b> institution of <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> of legal entities, and consequently it cannot be part of Czech legal system, there have been many heated debates, conducted both by professionals, politicians and amateurs. Czech criminal law does not contain the term collective responsibility, as it is traditionally based on <b>the</b> individual <b>criminal</b> <b>liability.</b> It has adopted the principle societas delinquere non potest, and for this reason <b>the</b> introduction of <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> of legal entities would be perceived as massive change, change that could have profound impact on <b>the</b> Czech <b>criminal</b> law as such. The topic is controversial; it is manifested in the way the arguments pro and contra are submitted. The thesis consists of seven chapters. Basic definitions are followed by a short historical overview of delictual liability of legal entities in European continental law. Next chapter lists arguments pro and contra introduction of <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> of legal entities. Tendencies in international and in European continental law constitute one of the main arguments for introducing this institution into Czech legal [...] ...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Criminal</b> Corporate <b>Liability</b> <b>The</b> {{definition}} of legal {{person is not}} outlined in criminal law, but {{can be found in}} Section 18, Subsection 2 of the Civil Code. Corporate <b>criminal</b> <b>liability</b> is then a concept that has been newly introduced to <b>the</b> Czech statutory <b>criminal</b> law, what has caused a certain intrusion of the system of basic principles of <b>criminal</b> law, mainly <b>the</b> principle of individual <b>criminal</b> responsibility. <b>The</b> term "imputability" appears, which means that a conduct of agents or other persons designated in <b>the</b> Act on <b>Criminal</b> <b>Liability</b> of Legal Persons and Proceedings Against Them (further as "the Act") can be imputed to a legal person, if the physical person is culpable for the conduct and the conduct causes imputability of <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> offence to <b>the</b> legal person.
