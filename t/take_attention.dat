25|$|Adding {{secondary}} {{actions to}} the main action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can simultaneously swing their arms or keep them in their pockets, speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions. The important thing about secondary actions is that they emphasize, rather than <b>take</b> <b>attention</b> away from the main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out. For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases {{it is better to}} include them at {{the beginning and the end}} of the movement, rather than during.|$|E
25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed her bare feet in the cement to <b>take</b> <b>attention</b> away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

The conflict is particularly intense between the idealistic Communications Director Toby and the more pragmatic Doug Wegland (Handler). A problem appears when it becomes clear that RU-486 [...] an emergency contraception [...] will receive government approval on the same day as the announcement ceremony. This will not only <b>take</b> <b>attention</b> away from the event, but also give political ammunition to the Right, and raise questions about the professionalism of the campaign. Josh strongly wants to [...] "wave off the FDA" [...] on the release, and it later appears that his underlying motive for this is to rectify a previous mistake. In {{the early part of the}} story, he applied pressure to pass a bill on anti-tobacco measures, but Gianelli points out the error in passing a bill that could have given them political leverage against the Republicans in the upcoming election.|$|E

2500|$|In some cases, a {{spectrum}} approach joins together conditions {{that were previously}} considered separately. A notable example of this trend is the autism spectrum, where conditions on this spectrum may now all {{be referred to as}} autism spectrum disorders. In other cases, what was treated as a single disorder comes to be seen (or seen once again) as comprising a range of types, a notable example being the bipolar spectrum. A spectrum approach may also expand the type or the severity of issues which are included, which may lessen the gap with other diagnoses or with what is considered [...] "normal". Proponents of this approach argue that it is in line with evidence of gradations in the type or severity of symptoms in the general population, and helps reduce the stigma associated with a diagnosis. Critics, however, argue that it can <b>take</b> <b>attention</b> and resources away from the most serious conditions associated with the most disability, or on the other hand could unduly medicalize problems which are simply challenges people face in life.|$|E

Carolyn Petit of GameSpot found that the visuals captured the look of the anime very well. She stated that the controls were complex but featured little depth. She mentioned that attacks made the battle within the game feel [...] "tremendous", but stated the Ki building process would <b>take</b> <b>attention</b> away from the combat due to being time consuming and leaving the player wide open to an attack. She also had complaints over the multiplayer, claiming that as the screen became split down the middle on offline multiplayer, it would limit the player's view and that online multiplayer was better but would be riddled with opponents that would instantly log off if things don't go their way. Jeremy Jastrzab of PAL Gaming Network pointed out that the game was good by itself, but was not as good as any of the previous games, stating that [...] "there is no excuse for it being worse than its predecessors." ...|$|E
