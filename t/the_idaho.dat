5|$|The {{mountains}} of Sawtooth National Forest have a varied geological history. The northern Sawtooth Mountains formed from the Eocene Sawtooth batholith, while south of Alturas Lake the Sawtooth, Smoky, and Soldier mountains formed from the Cretaceous granodiorite of <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> Batholith. Foothills of the Smoky Mountains {{are from the}} Pennsylvanian and Permian Dollarhide formations. The White Cloud Mountains are underlain by the gray granodiorite of <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> batholith, {{while some of the}} exposed rock is baked impure limestone from the Permian Grand Prize Formation.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic surveys show that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E

5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E

5|$|As Siletzia accreted it also {{jammed the}} {{existing}} subduction zone, halting subduction of the Farallon plate.

5|$|Even before non-aboriginal {{people came}} to the region, the Kootenay River valley was an {{important}} path of trade and transport between the tribes of the Canadian Rockies and <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> Panhandle, mostly between the Ktunaxa (who practiced agriculture and aquaculture) and the Salish, Blackfeet and Pend d'Oreilles {{of the south and}} east, and with the Shuswap in the north. The physiographic continuation of the Kootenai Valley southwards from present-day Bonners Ferry, Idaho into the Pend Oreille basin via the Purcell Trench formed a natural corridor through which natives of the area could interact. The barrier formed by the Rocky Mountains to the east, however, meant that tribes of the area, especially the Ktunaxa, were economically and linguistically isolated from the Great Plains tribes (with the exception of the Shoshone, whose territory spanned both sides of the Rockies).|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{original}} routing {{of what is now}} I-84 existed as early as 1923; however the portion of now I-84 into Idaho was not yet constructed. In 1926, much of the route was signed as US-30S, from the now eastern terminus at I-80 (US-530 then), northwest into Ogden. Between Ogden and Brigham City, the highway was to be concurrent with US-91, then US-30S split off northwest to <b>the</b> <b>Idaho</b> border. The entire western branch of US-30S was an unimproved road, however the concurrency into Ogden was paved. The remainder of the route to its now terminus was mostly graded with a few improved sections, and by 1937, the entire route was paved.|$|E
