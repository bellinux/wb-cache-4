Depending on subject's age, culture and sex, the prevalence rates of homosexuality vary depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed: sexual attraction, sexual behavior, or sexual identity. Assessing sexual attraction will yield the greatest prevalence of homosexuality in a population whereby the proportion of individuals indicating <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> sex attracted is {{two to three times}} greater than the proportion reporting same sex behavior or identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.

He went to the lord Rama temple where religious programme was going on. All saints were singing some hymns. When Temple Clergy told Nabha Dass to preach any hymn. Other sage persons put their objection for not belonging to sage community and asked how can you allow him. Priest told them there should be no objection if any person wants to sing a hymn. Before starting hymn Nabha Dass said, [...] "jaat na puchhie saadh ki, poochh leejie gyan, mol karo kirpan ka, pari rahne do mian". That means [...] "do not ask caste, religion from holy saints, ask about enlightenment of the God". (Bhagat Bhagti Bhagwan Guru Chatur Naam Baap Ek Inke Pad Bandan Kiye Nasin Vigan Anek).

40|$|We {{study the}} {{electron}} transport through the graphene PNP junction under {{a magnetic field}} and show that modes mixing plays an essential role. By using the non-equilibrium Green's function method, the space distribution of the scattering state for a specific incident modes as well {{the elements of the}} transmission and reflection coefficient matrixes are investigated. All elements of the transmission (reflection) coefficient matrixes are very different for a perfect PNP junction, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> at a disordered junction due to the mode mixing. The space distribution of the scattering state for the different incident modes also exhibit the similar behaviors, that they distinctly differ from each other in the perfect junction but are almost same in the disordered junction. For a unipolar junction, when the mode number in the center region is less than that in the left and right regions, the fluctuations of the total transmission and reflection coefficients are zero, although each element has a large fluctuation. These results clearly indicate the occurrence of perfect mode mixing and it plays an essential role in a graphene PNP junction transport...|$|E

GDRP {{can be classified}} in two form, that is GRDP at Current Market Prices and GRDP at Constant Prices. GRDP at Current Market Prices is calculating with two approaches, those are approach production and approach income. GRDP at Constant Prices can be calculated using two methods, revaluation and deflation. By using GDRP data, then it can be known which sector is prominent sector in that region. Some methods who using GDRP data as decisive prominent sector is method of Typology Klassen, LQ, MRP, Overlay and Shift Share. These methods classifying the economic sectors into four groups, they are prominent sector, growing sector, potential sector and under developed sector, based on large of contribution and rate of growth.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{dispersal}} pattern of Pollen and spores and their transportation mechanism, the surface sediments of Sagami Bay was studied palynologically. In regard to the dispersal and transportation, the following four groups are recognized: Group A: Pollen and spores of this group such as Pinus and Gleichenia have a large buoyancy and are consequently transported by the winds and water currents for a relatively long period. The dispersal pattern of this group is much influenced by hydraulic conditions. Group B: Quercus, Cyclobalanopsis, Alnus and Cryptomeria belong to this group. Although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> anemophilous flowers as pine, {{they do not have}} the same bladders with pine pollen. pollen grains of this group are carried to Sagami Bay by the winds and rivers and deposited within a short period because of a relatively small buoyancy. Group C: Tsuga, Ulmus-Zelkova, NAP(Non Arboreal Pollen) and FS(Fern Spores) of Monolete type belong to this group. Pollen and spores of this group are transported to the bay mainly by the rivers and deposited immediately after the water poured out into the sea. Group D: Keteleeria, Carya and Liquidamber etc. belong to this group. Pollen of this group are reworked fossils from the Pre-Pleistocene sediments. So they are little influenced by the winds in the secondary dispersal process...|$|E

In order to achieve at the Business Excellence (BE) is emphasized to the need for the simultaneous measurement of organizational performance on the Critical Success Factors (CSFs), environmental, social issues and challenges. Objective of current study was to evaluate of sustainable development in used motor oil industry using BE models. Therefore, a framework was discussed as distinct from other common practices to measure performance of an industry. The models allow multi -dimensional focuses on different indicators of the organization's internal, external and CSFs. The check list method was used to collect data in site of industry in the present study. Then, obtained results were surveyed by models such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA), European Federation for Quality Management (EFQM) and Kanji’s Business Excellence Model (KBEM). Results of current analyze indicated that despite the fact that these models and approaches are different, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> in term of shared concepts.

The main reference source is used in this study is the work of these two thinkers associated with ‘Ulum al-Hadith in "History and Introduction to Hadith" by Hasbi Ash-Shiddieqy and " Introduction to Hadith " by Ismail M.
