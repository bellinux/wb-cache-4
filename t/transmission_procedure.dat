40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} the following question: How much information do the ker-nel function and the bandwidth provide for nonparametric kernel estimation? The question is addressed {{by showing that}} kernel estimation of a cumulative distribution function (CDF) is an information <b>transmission</b> <b>procedure</b> for transforming the empirical cumulative distri-bution function into a smooth estimate. The transmission channel is the kernel function itself, which is a conditional distribution with a data point as its location parameter and a bandwidth as its scale parameter. The output of the information <b>transmission</b> <b>procedure</b> is the kernel estimate of the CDF which is a marginal distribution constructed as the sample average of the kernel functions centered at each data point. This framework provides a lower bound for the entropy of the kernel estimate of the distribution {{in terms of the}} entropy of the kernel function and the bandwidth, an input information measure for kernel smoothing, and a measure of information for kernel estimation. A family of maximum entropy kernels that includes several well-known kernel functions is identified. These kernels are compared according to the information measures developed herein. 1...|$|E
