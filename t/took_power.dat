5|$|As Romulus was {{an alleged}} usurper, Julius Nepos claimed to hold legally {{the title of}} the emperor when Odoacer <b>took</b> <b>power.</b> However, few of Nepos' contemporaries were willing to support his cause after he ran away to Dalmatia. Some historians regard Julius Nepos, who ruled in Dalmatia until being murdered in 480, as the last lawful Western Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Just {{months after}} its proclamation, in December 1789, the Liège Republic was {{condemned}} by the Austrians, and {{was occupied by}} troops from neighbouring Prussia. Disagreements between the Prussians and the Prince-Bishop about the form a restoration would take led to a Prussian withdrawal and the revolutionaries soon <b>took</b> <b>power</b> again.|$|E

50|$|Although most locomotive-hauled trains <b>take</b> <b>power</b> {{directly}} from the locomotive, there have been examples (mainly in continental Europe) where restaurant cars would <b>take</b> <b>power</b> {{directly from}} the overhead wires.

5|$|The sources {{appear to}} {{indicate}} that Ælfhelm's successor was Uhtred of Bamburgh, the first magnate in decades to govern northern and southern Northumbria together. The text known as De obsessione Dunelmi ("On the siege of Durham"), relates that Uhtred <b>took</b> <b>power</b> after defeating a Scottish invasion.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} led to {{the white}} community also becoming increasing radicalised. Some whites planned to attempt a coup d'état if a black majority government <b>took</b> <b>power.</b> As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as Corps de Voluntaires Européens ("European Volunteer Corps") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks.|$|E
5|$|As a {{proxy for}} his father, Romulus made no {{decisions}} and left no monuments, though coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, Milan, Ravenna, and Gaul. Several months after Orestes <b>took</b> <b>power,</b> a coalition of Heruli, Scirian and Turcilingi mercenaries demanded that he give them {{a third of the}} land in Italy. When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under the leadership of the Scirian chieftain Odoacer. Orestes was captured near Piacenza on 28 August 476 and swiftly executed.|$|E

5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is not certain, however, {{if it was the}} religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent.

5|$|Devolution {{continued}} {{to be part of}} the platform of the Labour Party which, in May 1997, <b>took</b> <b>power</b> under Tony Blair. In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII <b>took</b> <b>power</b> {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E

5|$|Following Llywelyn's {{death in}} 1240, Gwynedd's power {{declined}} {{and many of}} its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247.

Llywelyn extended the castle with an additional tower to the south, similar to that built at Dolforwyn, probably in order to provide additional accommodation.|$|E

Owain was eventually released in 1277 and there has been much historical debate over which castle he was held in.

5|$|Glina {{is a small}} {{market town}} in the Banovina region of Croatia located about 55 {{kilometers}} (34 miles) south of Zagreb.

Shortly after the Ustaše <b>took</b> <b>power,</b> the Croatian Minister of Justice, Mirko Puk, established a base in the town.|$|E

5|$|His {{seclusion}} from Syrian politics ended {{after the}} Military Committee of the Ba'ath Party <b>took</b> <b>power</b> in a coup d'état on 8 March 1963. The Military Committee's stated {{goal was to}} reestablish a pan-Arab state; a goal Atrash shared. He was appointed Minister of Labor and Social Affairs in Salah al-Din al-Bitar's first government, and {{became a member of}} the Presidential Council, an organ responsible for running day-to-day state affairs. In February 1964 Atrash was elected to the 12-member Ba'ath Party National Command, which was nominally the highest policy-making body of the party.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II <b>took</b> <b>power.</b> The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking land from the Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E
5|$|In the Springtime of the Peoples {{during the}} Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries {{took to the}} streets, many flying the tricolour.

Also, a naval war ensign used these colours.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis <b>took</b> <b>power.</b> People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E
5|$|Schmidt had {{secretly}} been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees {{ever since the}} Nazis <b>took</b> <b>power</b> in Germany in January 1933. When she eventually tried {{to leave the country}} on 28 June 1939, Sicherheitsdienst (SD) agents arrested her at the Dutch border and took her to Gestapo headquarters. Once there she was seen by Walter Schellenberg, who at that time worked in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. He gave her an ultimatum: cooperate with the Nazis or be sent to a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA <b>took</b> <b>power.</b> Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
