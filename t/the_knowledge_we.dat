2500|$|This thesis targets {{a problem}} with the nature of inquiry {{originally}} postulated by Plato in Meno. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible. In other words, [...] "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack <b>the</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>we</b> don't know what we are seeking and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems." [...] The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this paradox. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either consciously or unconsciously, a rationalist claims we don't really [...] "learn" [...] things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply bring to light what we already know.|$|E

Everything which can convey to the human mind distinct and accurate impressions of events, social facts, professional peculiarities, or past history, whether of the higher or more familiar character, is of use. All that is necessary is, that the pictures should be true to nature, if not absolutely drawn from living sitters. <b>The</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> gain by our looser reading, often becomes serviceable in modes and manners little anticipated in the moments when it is acquired.|$|E

We live to contemplate, enjoy, act, adore; and we may know all {{that is to be}} known in this world, and what Satan knows in the other, without being able to do any of these. We are to ask, therefore, first, is <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> would have fit food for us, good and simple, not {{artificial}} and decorated? and secondly, how much of it will enable us best for our work; and will leave our hearts light, and our eyes clear?

Consequently no method of investigation is the only method; and no law forbidding any particular method can cut us off from <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> hope to gain by it. The only knowledge we lose by forbidding cruelty is knowledge at first hand of cruelty itself, which is precisely the knowledge humane people wish to be spared.|$|E

60|$|For {{the sake}} {{of those who are}} anxious to acquire <b>the</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>we</b> give the {{following}} explanation: Let us begin with north. The large point midway between N and E (to the right) is north-east. The corresponding point midway between N and W (to the left) is north-west. A glance will show that the corresponding points towards the south are respectively south-east and south-west (usually written S.E. and S.W., as the two former points are written N.E. and N.W.). Now, to read off the compass with this amount of knowledge is very simple. Thus: North, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north. But be it observed that, {{in the language of the}} sea, the th is thrown overboard, except when the words north and south occur alone. When conjoined with other points they are pronounced thus: nor'-east, sou'-east; and so on.|$|E

On the one hand, I should {{have to tell you}} things known only to an inner circle, things which were it known I had whispered to any one my life would be forfeited. On the other hand, if I keep silent I should doom you to a life of misery. I have resolved to take the former alternative. I may first tell you what you do not know, that I have long been viewed with suspicion by those of the higher priesthood who know my views, which are that <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> possess should not be confined to ourselves, but should be disseminated, at least among that class of educated Egyptians capable of appreciating it.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{thanks to}} these {{important}} researches, {{it has become}} evident that, so far as our present knowledge extends, {{the history of the}} horse-type is exactly and precisely that which could have been predicted from a knowledge of the principles of evolution. And <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> now possess justifies us completely in the anticipation, that when the still lower Eocene deposits, and those which belong to the Cretaceous epoch, have yielded up their remains of ancestral equine animals, we shall find, first, a form with four complete toes and a rudiment of the innermost or first digit in front, with, probably, a rudiment of the fifth digit in the hind foot;[3] while, in still older forms, the series of the digits will be more and more complete, until we come to the five-toed animals, in which, if the doctrine of evolution is well founded, the whole series must have taken its origin.|$|E

60|$|SECONDLY, I {{say that}} THE SAME TRUTHS MAY BE DISCOVERED, AND CONVEYED DOWN FROM REVELATION, WHICH ARE DISCERNABLE TO US BY REASON, AND BY THOSE IDEAS WE NATURALLY MAY HAVE. So God might, by revelation, {{discover}} {{the truth of}} any proposition in Euclid; as well as men, by the natural use of their faculties, come to make the discovery themselves. In all things of this kind there is little need or use of revelation, God having furnished us with natural and surer means {{to arrive at the}} knowledge of them. For whatsoever truth we come to the clear discovery of, from the knowledge and contemplation of our own ideas, will always be certainer to us than those which are conveyed to us by TRADITIONAL REVELATION. For <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> have that this revelation came at first from God, can never be so sure as <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> have from the clear and distinct perception of the agreement or disagreement of our own ideas: v.g. if it were revealed some ages since, that the three angles of a triangle were equal to two right ones, I might assent to the truth of that proposition, upon the credit of the tradition, that it was revealed: but that would never amount to so great a certainty as the knowledge of it, upon the comparing and measuring my own ideas of two right angles, and the three angles of a triangle. The like holds in matter of fact knowable by our senses; v.g. the history of the deluge is conveyed to us by writings which had their original from revelation: and yet nobody, I think, will say he has as certain and clear a knowledge of the flood as Noah, that saw it; or that he himself would have had, had he then been alive and seen it. For he has no greater an assurance than that of his senses, that it is writ in the book supposed writ by Moses inspired: but he has not so great an assurance that Moses wrote that book as if he had seen Moses write it. So that the assurance of its being a revelation is less still than the assurance of his senses.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, {{stretched}} {{at ease in}} {{the shade}} of a roadside tree, we watch the motions of a labourer in a distant field, and after a time begin to wonder languidly as to what the fellow may be at. We watch the movements of his body, the waving of his arms, we see him bend down, stand up, hesitate, begin again. It may add to the charm of an idle hour to be told the purpose of his exertions. If we know he is trying to lift a stone, to dig a ditch, to uproot a stump, we look with a more real interest at his efforts; we are disposed to condone the jar of his agitation upon the restfulness of the landscape; and even, if in a brotherly frame of mind, we may bring ourselves to forgive his failure. We understood his object, and, after all, the fellow has tried, and perhaps he had not the strength--and perhaps he had not <b>the</b> <b>knowledge.</b> <b>We</b> forgive, go on our way--and forget.|$|E
60|$|As {{everybody}} knows nowadays, <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> possess of life before {{the beginnings of}} human memory and tradition {{is derived from the}} markings and fossils of living things in the stratified rocks. We find preserved in shale and slate, limestone, and sandstone, bones, shells, fibres, stems, fruits, footmarks, scratchings and the like, {{side by side with the}} ripple marks of the earliest tides and the pittings of the earliest rain-falls. It is by the sedulous examination of this Record of the Rocks that the past history of the earth's life has been pieced together. That much nearly {{everybody knows}} to-day. The sedimentary rocks do not lie neatly stratum above stratum; they have been crumpled, bent, thrust about, distorted and mixed together like the leaves of a library that has been repeatedly looted and burnt, and it is only as a result of many devoted lifetimes of work that the record has been put into order and read. The whole compass of time represented by the record of the rocks is now estimated as 1,600,000,000 years.|$|E

"For {{the house}} {{is the image of}} the world, and we that live and labor in it are the image of our Father who made the world; and, like him, we labor to make for {{ourselves}} a worthy habitation, which shall not shame our teacher. This is his desire; for in all his works, and that knowledge which is like pure water to one that thirsts, and satisfies and leaves no taste of bitterness on the palate, we learn the will of him that called us into life. All <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> seek, the invention and skill we possess, and the labor of our hands, has this purpose only: for all knowledge and invention and labor having any other purpose whatsoever is empty and vain in comparison, and unworthy of those that are made {{in the image of the}} Father of life. For just as the bodily senses may become perverted, and the taste lose its discrimination, so that the hungry man will devour acrid fruits and poisonous herbs for aliment, so is the mind capable of seeking out new paths, and a knowledge which leads only to misery and destruction.|$|E
60|$|True memory, {{which we}} must now {{endeavour}} to understand, consists of knowledge of past events, but not of all such knowledge. Some knowledge of past events, for example what we learn through reading history, is {{on a par with}} <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> can acquire concerning the future: it is obtained by inference, not (so to speak) spontaneously. There is a similar distinction in our knowledge of the present: some of it is obtained through the senses, some in more indirect ways. I know that there are at this moment a {{number of people in the}} streets of New York, but I do not know this in the immediate way in which I know of the people whom I see by looking out of my window. It is not easy to state precisely wherein the difference between these two sorts of knowledge consists, but it is easy to feel the difference. For the moment, I shall not stop to analyse it, but shall content myself with saying that, in this respect, memory resembles the knowledge derived from the senses. It is immediate, not inferred, not abstract; it differs from perception mainly by being referred to the past.|$|E
60|$|Within {{these four}} sorts of {{agreement}} or disagreement is, I suppose, contained all <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>we</b> have, or are capable of. For all the inquiries {{we can make}} concerning any of our ideas, all that we know or can affirm concerning any of them, is, That it is, or is not, the same with some other; that it does or does not always co-exist with some other idea in the same subject; that it has this or that relation with some other idea; or {{that it has a}} real existence without the mind. Thus, 'blue is not yellow,' is of identity. 'Two triangles upon equal bases between two parallels are equal,' is of relation. 'Iron is susceptible of magnetical impressions,' is of co-existence. 'God is,' is of real existence. Though identity and co-existence are truly nothing but relations, yet they are such peculiar ways of agreement or disagreement of our ideas, that they deserve well to be considered as distinct heads, and not under relation in general; since they are so different grounds of affirmation and negation, as will easily appear to any one, who will but reflect on what is said in several places of this ESSAY.|$|E
