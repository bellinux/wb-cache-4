5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from the fire to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>monitored</b> for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
5|$|At 1200UTC on July13, the JTWC {{upgraded}} Billie {{further to}} typhoon status, making Billie the first tropical cyclone <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>monitored</b> by the JTWC {{since its inception}} earlier in 1959. Now tracking steadily towards the northwest, the typhoon reached its peak intensity at 1200UTC {{the next day with}} maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) according to the JTWC and a minimum barometric pressure assessed by the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) at 970mbar (hPa; 28.64inHg). By this time Billie's eye had shrunk to a size roughly 50km (30mi) in diameter. At 0900UTC on July15, Billie passed just 30km (20mi) north of Taiwan; fifteen hours later the typhoon made landfall north of Fuzhou, China in Zhejiang with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph).|$|E

5|$|The {{tropical}} depression originated {{from an area}} of low pressure in the South China Sea on September1. Scattered convection was associated with the system, with the center devoid of showers and thunderstorms, as the low slowly tracked westward in a weak steering environment. Weak outflow had formed along the northern edge of the system; however, intensification was not anticipated. The following day, convection began to form around the center of circulation and weak diffluence was noted around the system due to an anticyclone to the north. With low wind shear, convective banding features began to develop and the possibility of the system becoming a tropical cyclone increased. Early on September3, the JMA began issuing advisories on the cyclone, classifying it as a {{tropical depression}}, the twentieth depression <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>monitored</b> by the JMA during the season.|$|E

25|$|In mid-2008, an eel-pass was {{installed}} at Greylake Sluice, consisting of an open-topped metal channel, fitted with bristles on its base, which allows glass eels {{returning from the}} Sargasso Sea to wiggle their way past the sluice.

The installation, together with a similar one at Oath lock on the River Parrett, has provided valuable information on the migration and decline of eels.

25|$|Another {{application}} in {{research is to}} entrap biomolecules for sensory (biosensors) or catalytic purposes, by physically or chemically preventing them from leaching out and, {{in the case of}} protein or chemically-linked small molecules, by shielding them from the external environment yet allowing small molecules <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>monitored.</b> The major disadvantages are that the change in local environment may alter the functionality of the protein or small molecule entrapped and that the synthesis step may damage the protein. To circumvent this, various strategies have been explored, such as monomers with protein friendly leaving groups (e.g. glycerol) and the inclusion of polymers which stabilize protein (e.g. PEG).|$|E
25|$|Biogenic amines {{have been}} implicated as a {{potential}} cause of red wine headaches. In wine, histamine, cadaverine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, and tyramine have all been detected. These amines are created by the degradation of amino acids found in grape must and {{left over from the}} breakdown of dead yeast cells after fermentation. Most LAB have the potential to create biogenic amines, even some strains of O. oeni, but high levels of biogenic amines are most often associated with species from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. In the European Union, the concentration of biogenic amines in wine is beginning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>monitored,</b> while the United States currently does not have any regulations.|$|E
