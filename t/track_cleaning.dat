5|$|There {{are also}} vacuum trains that are {{designed}} to remove trash off of the tracks, but are ineffective and often broken. A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station <b>track</b> <b>cleaning</b> will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars will be part of the operation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction RF oscillators, {{especially}} {{voltage controlled}} oscillators (VCOs), {{are essential to}} RF communication, broadcasting, and receiving systems. Their functions include generating, <b>tracking,</b> <b>cleaning,</b> amplifying, and distributing RF carriers. The VCOs in a phase-locked loop configuration {{can also be used}} for clock recovery, carrier recovery, signal modulation and demodulation, and frequency synthesizing. Photonic RF systems [1 [...] 3] embed photonic technology into the traditional RF systems. In particular, in a photonic RF system, optical waves are used as a carrier to transport RF signals through optical fiber to remote locations. In addition, some of the RF signal-processing functions, such as signal mixing [4], antenna beam steering [5, 6], and signal filtering [7, 8] can also be accomplished optically. The photonic technology o#ers the advantages of low loss, light weight, high frequency, high security, remoting capability, and immunity to electromagnetic interference a...|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, kauri dieback was {{discovered}} on Great Barrier Island. The disease, known as kauri collar rot, has begun spreading through kauri forests on the mainland. The disease causes yellowing leaves, thinning canopy, dead branches, lesions that bleed resin and tree death. It {{is caused by}} Phytophthora agathidicida which {{was identified as a}} new species in April 2008. Its closest known relative is Phytophthora katsurae. The phytophthora is believed to be spread on people's shoes or by mammals, particularly feral pigs. A collaborative response team has been formed to work on the disease. The team includes MAF Biosecurity, the Conservation Department, Auckland and Northland regional councils, Waikato Regional Council, and Bay of Plenty Regional Council. The team is charged with assessing the risk, determining methods and their feasibility to limit the spread, collecting more information (e.g. how widespread), and ensuring a coordinated response. The Department of Conservation has issued guidelines {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease, including keeping to defined <b>tracks,</b> <b>cleaning</b> footwear before and after entering kauri forest areas, and staying away from kauri roots.|$|R

50|$|In 1909, {{the level}} {{crossing}} at the Crosswall was again {{the cause of}} a dispute. The railway company had renewed their track, but had not reinstated the tramway, arguing that this was not their responsibility. In March 1911, Sunday services were introduced. In 1912, a new siding was constructed at New Bridge to hold trams ready to take passengers after band performances on the Sea Front or at Granville Gardens. In July 1911, three new trams were purchased at a cost of £1,830. They were delivered in 1912. In June 1913, the <b>track</b> <b>cleaning</b> tram was adapted to enable it to water the streets where it ran. The track was by this time in a poor condition. A report estimated a repair cost of £3,477. A decision was made to spend £1,500 on the most urgent repairs, with the rest to be done as soon as possible.|$|E

50|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race - two on Friday, {{and a third}} on Saturday. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted 90 minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. In the first free practice session, several large damp patches around the circuit - caused by late <b>track</b> <b>cleaning</b> rather than rain - dissuaded drivers from attempting laps and left the frustrated teams sitting in the pits waiting for the surface to dry as low track temperatures made the situation worse. When the cars did take to the track, many of the drivers either went off the road or spun. Räikkönen only did three laps, before retiring with a gearbox problem, causing him to finish last. Massa set the session's fastest time, ahead of McLaren duo Heikki Kovalainen and Hamilton. After the session had ended, Fisichella was given a three-place grid penalty by the stewards for exiting the pit lane whilst the light at its exit was still red.|$|E

40|$|Ballast is {{the most}} common {{material}} supporting the rail track structure due to its large shear strength, high load bearing capacity and free-drainage. However, the fouling of ballast effects deterioration of track performance, and eventually demands <b>track</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Fouling refers to the progressive intrusion of fines into the ballast layer and subsequently filling the voids. Coal spilling from wagons during transport, sleeper and ballast degradation and soil pumping from soft subgrade are the major factors contributing to ballast fouling. Queensland rail network suffers mainly due to ballast breakdown and intrusion of coal fines. The maintenance costs of ballasted tracks can be significantly reduced if an accurate estimation of the different types of fouling material and associated degradation mechanisms in the ballast layer can be quantified. Moreover, modern track design should be able to capture particle breakage and adjust the ballast type and gradation for improved performance. A series of large-scale triaxial tests were performed with the objective of studying the effects of coal fouling on the shear strength of ballast. The strength and deformation characteristics were investigated for fresh ballast mixed with different percentages of coal fines. In this study, the shear strength properties are linked to ballast fouling indices to better assess the effect of coal fouling on track degradation. The shear strength of ballast was found to reduce significantly with the increase in coal fines. Practical implications of coal-fouled ballast are discussed with reference to possible fouling mechanisms and associated degradation of the track substructure...|$|E

40|$|Several days {{following}} the Columbia accident a team formed and began planning for the reconstruction of Columbia. A hangar at the Kennedy Space Center was selected for this effort due to it's size, available technical workforce and materials science laboratories {{and access to the}} vehicle ground processing infrastructure. The Reconstruction team established processes for receiving, handling, decontamination, <b>tracking,</b> identifying, <b>cleaning</b> and assessment of the debris. Initially, a 2 -dimensional reconstruction of the Orbiter outer mold line was developed. As the investigation progressed fixtures which allowed a 3 -dimensional reconstruction of the forward portions of the left wing's leading edge was developed. To support the reconstructions and forensic analyses a Materials and Processes (M&P) 'team was formed. This M&P team established processes for recording factual observations, debris cleaning, and engineering analysis. Fracture surfaces and thermal effects of selected airframe debris were assessed, and process flows for both nondestructive and destructive sampling and evaluation of debris were developed. The Team also assessed left hand airframe components that were believed to be associated with a structural breach of Columbia. A major portion of this analysis was evaluation of metallic deposits were prevalent on left wing leading edge components. Extensive evaluation of the visual, metallurgical and chemical nature of the deposits provided conclusions that were consistent with the visual assessments and interpretations of the NASA lead teams and the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. Analytical data collected by the M&P Team showed that a significant thermal event occurred at the left wing leading edge in the proximity of LH RCC Panels 8 - 9, and a correlation was formed between the deposits and overheating in these areas to the wing leading edge components. The analysis of deposits also showed exposure to temperatures in excess of 1649 C (3200 F), which would severely degrade support structure, tiles, and RCC panel materials. The integrated failure analysis of wing leading edge debris and deposits strongly supported the hypothesis that a breach occurred at LH RCC Panel 8...|$|R
40|$|Injection in the LHC is a {{delicate}} moment, since the LHC collimation system cannot offer adequate protection during beam transfer. For this reason, a complex chain of injection protection devices has been put in place. Among them, the SPS scrapers are the multi-turn cleaning system installed in the SPS aimed at halo removal immediately before injection in the LHC. The upgrade in luminosity of the LHC foresees beams brighter than those currently available in machine, posing serious problems {{to the performance of}} the existing injection protection systems. In particular, the integrity of beam-intercepting devices is challenged by unprecedented beam parameters, leading to interactions potentially destructive. In this context, a new design of scrapers has been proposed, aimed at improved robustness and performance. This thesis compares the two scraping systems, i. e. the existing one and the one proposed for upgrade. Unlike any other collimation system for regular halo cleaning, both are "fast" systems, characterised by the variation of the relative distance between the beam and the absorbing medium during cleaning, which enhances the challenge on energy deposition values. Assets / liabilities of the two systems are highlighted by means of numerical simulations and discussed, with particular emphasis on energy deposition in the absorbing medium, time evolution of the beam current during scraping and losses in the machine. Advantages of the system proposed for upgrade over the existing one are highlighted. The analysis of the existing system takes into account present operational conditions and addresses the sensitivity to settings previously not considered, updating and extending past studies. The work carried out on the upgraded system represents the first extensive characterisation of a multi-turn cleaning system based on a magnetic bump. Results have been obtained with the FLUKA-SIXTRACK coupling, developed during this PhD activity from its initial version to being a state-of-art <b>tracking</b> tool for <b>cleaning</b> studies in circular machines. Relevant contributions to the development involve the handling of time-varying impact conditions. An extensive benchmark against a test of the scraper blades with beam has been carried out, to verify the reliability of results. Effects induced in the tested blades confirm the high values of energy deposition predicted by the simulation. Moreover, the comparison with the time profile of the beam intensity measured during scraping allowed the reconstruction of the actual settings of the blades during the test. Finally, the good agreement of the quantitative benchmark against readouts of beam loss monitors finally proves the quality of the analyses and the maturity of the coupling...|$|R
5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use wheel-rim disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel <b>cleaning.</b> <b>Tracking</b> high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch. High pressure arches direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done [...] "V-jet" [...] nozzles, rotating [...] "turbo" [...] nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.|$|R
