40|$|In {{deregulated}} {{electric power}} systems, {{one of the}} most important topics is to augment the <b>total</b> system <b>social</b> <b>welfare.</b> Many different methods have been carried out for this problem. One of the most viable methods to increasing system <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> is to supply the reactive demands as locally. In this way, the reactive demands are supplied via locally reactive sources and the capacity of transmission lines is not used to transfer reactive power of demands. Thus, the congestion of lines is not reached and the system <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> which is related to the congestion of lines is increased. In this scope, this study addresses an optimal Reactive Power Planning (RPP) in a deregulated power system. The proposed method optimizes two objective functions at the same time within one general objective. The optimized objectives are minimization of total investment in reactive power support and maximizing of <b>total</b> system <b>social</b> <b>welfare.</b> Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to solve the optimization problem.

In the deregulated environment, some generators may {{not be willing to}} participate in the congestion management process for their own economic interest or some other operational constraints. By using Generator Sensitivity (GS), we select generators actually participating in congestion alleviation.

The proposed approach makes use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimise the schedule of Generating Companies (GenCos), Distributing Companies (DisCos) and TCSC location and size based on severity power index, while the Newton–Raphson algorithm minimizes the mismatch of the power flow equations.

40|$|An {{optimization}} {{approach for}} designing a transit service system is proposed. Its objective {{would be the}} maximization of <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>welfare,</b> by providing a profitable fare structure and tailoring operational strategies to passenger demand. These operational strategies include full route operation (FRO), limited stop, short turn, and a mix of the latter two strategies. The demand function is formulated to reflect the attributes of these strategies, in-vehicle crowding, and fare effects on demand variation. The fare is either a flat fare or a differential fare structure; the latter is based on trip distance and achieved service levels. This proposed methodology is applied to {{a case study of}} Dalian, China. The optimal results indicate that an optimal combination of operational strategies integrated with a differential fare structure results in the highest potential for increasing <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>welfare,</b> if the value of parameter ε related to additional service fee is low. When this value increases up to more than a threshold, strategies with a flat fare show greater benefits.

40|$|In recent years, {{there are}} growing {{concerns}} {{on the issue}} of parallel trade on pharmaceuticals. It is an existing issue in European Union and an emerging issue in the North America and Asia. In the existing studies, the attentions are mainly focused on the price and <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in the importing country. If parallel trade was legally permitted, what would happen in the exporting country is also an important issue. In this paper, a model is developed to explore the drug price, supply and <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in both the exporting country and importing country in the presence of parallel trade. The possible policy reactions of the government in the two countries are also discussed. Parallel trade will lead to a higher drug price and then a <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> loss in the exporting country; under certain circumstances, the pharmaceutical firm may cut off the drug supply, which leads to a net welfare loss to the exporting country. The firm’s <b>total</b> profit and <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in the importing country may increase or decrease. The later finding is contradicted to an existing study because of the relaxation on some assumptions. The results show that the negotiated price in the presence of parallel trade is sensitive to the market size of the drug and transaction cost of parallel trade. Therefore, those factors have important policy implications to the policy maker in the exporting country. With proper policy reactions, the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> loss could be avoided. For the importing country, the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> change when parallel trade is legally permitted is closely related to the firm’s bargaining power in the foreign market.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} pricing items to maximize revenue when faced with buyers with complex preferences, and show that a simple and natural pricing scheme achieves surprisingly strong guarantees. Our pricing scheme immediately implies approximation bounds for revenue maximization in general combinatorial auctions, both in the limited and unlimited supply settings.

Furthermore, an access charge that maximizes social welfare is explored and determined. Two cases are considered: in the first case, the market is fully covered; {{and in the second}} case, the market is not fully covered. With full market coverage, an entrant has an incentive for service bundling if there is sufficient service differentiation. The entrant's bundling strategy reduces the incumbent's profit. In this case, the <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> is independent of the level of the access charge and only has an effect of redistributing the net surplus between consumers and the incumbent.

In this case, the <b>total</b> <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> is dependent on the level of access charge and the welfare maximizing access charge is less than the unit cost of providing access. ...|$|E
