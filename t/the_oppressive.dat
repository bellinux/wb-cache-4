5|$|A similar {{depiction}} of Hollywood appears in Nathanael West's novel The Day of the Locust (1939), which many critics see {{as an important}} precursor to Barton Fink. Set in a run-down apartment complex, the book describes a painter reduced to decorating movie sets. It portrays Hollywood as crass and exploitative, devouring talented individuals in its neverending quest for profit. In both West's novel and Barton Fink, protagonists suffer under <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> industrial machine of the movie studio.|$|E
5|$|Catching Fire is a 2009 {{science fiction}} young adult novel by the American novelist Suzanne Collins, the second book in The Hunger Games trilogy. As {{the sequel to}} the 2008 bestseller The Hunger Games, it {{continues}} the story of Katniss Everdeen and the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem. Following {{the events of the}} previous novel, a rebellion against <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> Capitol has begun, and Katniss and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are forced to return to the arena in a special edition of the Hunger Games.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>oppressive</b> {{taxes and}} brutal {{collection}} methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. Süß {{goes so far}} as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks Süß's coach with a sledgehammer, Süß has the blacksmith hanged on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought protection from <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
5|$|Created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, Raynor is {{loosely based}} on a {{character}} {{of the same name}} in the 1991 film Rush. Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the ordinary man in a series populated with politically motivated characters. Raynor's physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself. A Terran in his thirties, Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a marshal on a backwater colony world. Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolution against <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> Terran Confederacy but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk's genocidal tactics, forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk's tyranny.|$|E

5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media. Many of these {{have focused on the}} possible sexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, or simply a reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 Mercator {{moved from}} Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves. He never gave {{his reasons for}} the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic {{intolerance}} of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; {{there was to be}} a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, {{the revolutionary}} French {{government}} conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution. This centralised {{the government of}} the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, Mülhausen joined France and Valtellina valley, the Cisalpine Republic, separating from Switzerland. The new regime, known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French satellite state. The fierce French suppression of the Nidwalden Revolt in September 1798 was an example of <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> presence of the French Army and the local population's resistance to the occupation.|$|E

5000|$|Both teams {{finished}} the contest badly exhausted, especially Princeton, {{as during the}} last half of the game <b>the</b> heat was <b>oppressive.</b> <b>The</b> Princeton Alumni Weekly noted: [...] "If this game proved anything at all it proved that a fine forward passing game can defeat a fine line-plunging game." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1953 the {{collection}} of 17 short stories El trueno entre las hojas (1953; Thunder Among the Leaves) was published and circulated internationally, {{but it was not}} until the 1960 publication of the novel Hijo de hombre (Son of Man) that Roa Bastos won major critical and popular success. The novel draws on <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> history of Paraguay from the rule of Dr. Jose Gaspar de Francia in the early 19th century until the Chaco War in the 1930s. Its multiple narrative perspectives and historical and political themes anticipate his most famous work, Yo, el Supremo, written more than a decade later. Roa Bastos adapted Hijo de hombre into an award-winning film in the same year as its publication.|$|E
5|$|In 2285, {{the northeastern}} {{region of the}} United States {{has turned into a}} dystopia ruled by <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> Great Northern Empire of the Americas. The only {{resemblance}} to entertainment that exists is the electronic noise of the Noise Machines (NOMACS). The empire is ruled by Emperor Nafaryus, Empress Arabelle, Crown Prince Daryus, and Princess Faythe. In a distant village called Ravenskill, a man named Gabriel possesses the natural ability to make music and sing ("The Gift of Music"). He has an older brother, Commander Arhys of the Ravenskill Rebel Militia, who has a son, Xander, with his deceased wife, Evangeline ("A Better Life").|$|E
5|$|In the novel, the Afro-Caribbean slave {{population}} violently {{react to}} <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> regime {{imposed on them}} by the French colonials. The end result of this armed reaction {{is the emergence of}} a brutal regime in which the oppressed become the oppressors. Sadly, the leaders of the newly produced regime fail to break the mold imposed by the French colonials. The ruling Afro-Caribbeans end up enslaving and oppressing their own kind and the resulting social situation is devoid of any progress. Carpentier's perspective on the Haitian revolution is revealed in the way that he portrays the cyclical nature of reactionary violence.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan first {{appears in}} StarCraft as a twenty-six-year-old Terran Ghost, a psychic trained both {{physically}} and mentally as an expert espionage agent and assassin. Initially the second-in-command of Sons of Korhal, a revolutionary movement against <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> Confederacy of Man, she is captured by the insectoid Zerg and infested, turning her into a human/Zerg hybrid completely {{under the control of}} the Zerg Overmind. She becomes one of the Zerg's most powerful agents, but during the Brood Wars, she replaces the Overmind following its destruction at the end of the great war, and gains control of the Zerg to seek dominance over the galaxy. Kerrigan's life before her infestation is further explored in the Starcraft novels Uprising and Liberty's Crusade, while Queen of Blades elaborates on her infested character.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria grew to hate Conroy, {{thanks to}} <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> system, {{and he was}} also unpopular among the rest of the British royal family. His efforts to place the Duchess in the role of regent were {{ultimately}} unsuccessful, as Victoria ascended the throne after reaching her majority in 1837. Conroy was immediately expelled from Victoria's household, though he remained in the Duchess of Kent's service for several more years. Given a pension and a baronetcy, Conroy retired to his estate near Reading, Berkshire, in 1842 and died heavily in debt twelve years later.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Soviet {{and native}} Stalinists was {{widespread}} among {{not only the}} general population but also the PZPR ranks, which limited <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> system's damage in Poland to well below that of other European communist-ruled countries. Political violence after 1947 was not widespread. The Church, subjected to partial property confiscations, remained largely intact, the marginalized to a considerable degree intelligentsia retained its potential to affect future reforms, the peasantry avoided wholesale collectivization and remnants of private enterprise survived. Gradual liberalizing changes took place between Stalin's death in 1953 and the Polish October of 1956.|$|E

5000|$|Nadirs is a {{collection}} of largely autobiographical short stories by Romanian-German writer and Nobel laureate Herta Müller. The stories center on life in the Romanian countryside [...] and <b>the</b> violent, <b>oppressive</b> atmosphere of Romania in the mid-20th century.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>oppressive</b> heat slows McTeague's {{progress}}. Schouler's {{progress is}} also beginning to wane when he spies McTeague and moves in to arrest him. After a confrontation, McTeague's horse bolts and Schouler shoots it, puncturing the water container. The water spills onto the desert floor. The pair fight one last time, with McTeague proving the victor; however, Schouler has handcuffed himself to McTeague. The film ends with McTeague {{left in the}} desert with no horse and no water, handcuffed to a corpse and unable to reach the remaining money.|$|E
5|$|The people, {{who felt}} the {{severity}} of his laws, {{at the same time}} acknowledged their justice, and found themselves protected from the rapacity of their superiors. Andronikos's energetic efforts to rein in <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic. The aristocrats were infuriated with him, and to make matters worse, Andronikos seems to have become increasingly deranged; executions and violence became increasingly common, and his reign turned into a reign of terror. Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape <b>the</b> <b>oppressive</b> life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E
