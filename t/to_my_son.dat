"From The Doctor <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>son</b> Thomas" [...] is a {{viral video}} {{recorded}} by actor Peter Capaldi {{and sent to}} Thomas Goodall, an autistic nine-year-old boy in England, to console the child over grief from the death of Goodall's grandmother. Capaldi filmed the 42-second video in character as the 12th incarnation of The Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who. Capaldi's message had {{a positive effect on}} Thomas; his father said that the boy smiled {{for the first time since}} learning of his grandmother's death, and gained the courage to go to her funeral.|$|E

Bledsoe described his son's religious conversion and travels to Yemen, {{where he had been}} “trained and programmed” to kill. Bledsoe said, “Our children are in danger,” and that, “It seems to me that Americans are sitting around doing nothing about radical extremists. This is a big elephant in the room.” On an earlier occasion, Bledsoe had said, [...] "If it can happen <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>son,</b> it can happen to anyone’s son.” ...|$|E

2500|$|King Prakasadharma (Po Kia Pho Pa Mo, as {{transcribed}} {{from the}} Chinese) ruled Champa from 653 AD to approximately 687. Upon ascending to the throne, he also assumed the name Vikrantavarman. During his reign, he expanded {{the borders of}} Champa toward the South and sent ambassadors and tribute (including tame elephants) to China. Inscriptions link him not only <b>to</b> <b>Mỹ</b> <b>Sơn,</b> {{but also to the}} nearby urban settlements of Trà Kiệu and Đồng Dương. He began the religious practice of donating [...] "kosas" [...] or decorated metallic sleeves to be placed over a lingam. Unusually for a king of Champa, he was devoted not only to Shiva, but also to Vishnu.|$|E

Born near {{the close of}} the buffalo days he was, and ever since with his baby hands he began to model statuettes of horses and buffalo and deer with clay from the river-banks, his one object in life has been {{to make a name for}} himself in the world of art. And now, at last, he has furnished the drawings for one of my books, this book. His own grandfather, Black Eagle, was a mighty warrior against the Snakes. What would the old man say, I wonder, if he were alive and could see his grandson so sympathetically picturing incidents in the life of Bird Woman, a daughter of the Snakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Winter Garden shows, however, Diamond {{announced}} that he needed a break, and he engaged in no more live performances till 1976. He used those four years {{to work on the}} score for Hall Bartlett's film version of Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull and to record two albums, Serenade and Beautiful Noise. He said years later, [...] "I knew I'd come back, but I wasn't sure when. I spent one year on each of those albums...I'd been on the road six years. I had a son 2½ and I felt he needed me more than the audience did. So for four years I devoted myself <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>son</b> Jesse." [...] He also said he needed to get back to having a private life, one where he could be anonymous.|$|E

Ridgeway and Vaughan write that nothing {{was placed in the}} bathtub drain to prevent debris from {{draining}} away, and none of the bathwater was saved. Other than the gruesome scene, the hotel room was clean and orderly. There was a legal pad and a pen present on the desk; a single page had been torn from the pad, and a message written on it: [...] "To those who I love the most: Please forgive me for the worst possible thing I could have done.

2500|$|Dynastic tradition: Among the Bonapartes this {{includes}} legal {{changes in the}} succession order during {{the first and second}} empires, and post-monarchy attempts to change heirs by testament. Napoleon I quarreled openly with some of his brothers, particularly over their marriages, and dethroned or de-dynasticized them. When Napoleon III's only son, the Prince Imperial Louis Napoléon, died in 1879, his will purported to exclude his cousin and genealogical heir, Prince Napoléon Joseph, from headship of the deposed dynasty due to political differences, in favor of his elder son, Prince Victor Napoléon. Although almost all Bonapartists therefore recognized his son, Napoléon Joseph insisted that his dynastic claim remained intact. Yet as Imperial pretender he likewise disavowed his heir, writing in his will, [...] "I leave nothing to Victor, my elder son. He is a traitor and a rebel.... I recommend <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>son</b> Louis to remain faithful to my political and religious opinions. They are in the true tradition of my uncle Napoleon I. I hope that Louis will be the representative of the cause of the Napoleons. His aim must be to organise French democracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In one puranic story, it is {{stated that}} once Shiva and Parvati {{were playing a}} game of dice. For any game {{there has to be}} an umpire, who has to declare who is the winner. Shiva and Parvati agreed to have Nandi (the divine bull) as the umpire. Nandi is a {{favorite}} of Shiva, as he is Shiva's vehicle. Although Shiva lost the game, Nandi declared him the winner. It is stated that Parvati was indignant over Nandi's partiality for Shiva and cursed him that he should die from an incurable disease. Thereupon Nandi fell at the feet of Parvati and pleaded for forgiveness. [...] "Mother forgive me. Should I not show at least this amount of gratitude to one who is my master? Is it not humiliating for me to declare that my master has lost the game? To uphold his honor I no doubt uttered a lie. But am I to be punished with such severity for so small an offence?", Nandi prayed for forgiveness in this manner. Parvati forgave Nandi and taught him the means to atone for his lapse. She told him, [...] "The Chaturdasi day in the month of Purattaasi; Tamil: September - October (Bhadrapada; Sanskrit: August - September) is the day when my son's birthday is celebrated. On that day you must to offer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>son</b> what pleases you the most". [...] For Nandi the most enjoyable and relishing food is green grass. As directed by Parvati Nandi worshipped Ganapathi by offering green grass. Nandi was then relieved of his dreaded disease. His health improved and by the grace of Parvati he was redeemed.|$|E
