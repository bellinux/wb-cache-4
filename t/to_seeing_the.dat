Cynthia White was declared to be dead by the state of New Jersey in 1992, but Pamela Jenkins claimed that she saw White alive as late as 1997. Mumia supporters often claim that White was a police informant and that she falsified her testimony against Abu-Jamal.|$|E

Later that year, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force for service in World War II, serving until 1945. After the war, he matriculated to the University of Kentucky. While there, he {{served as president of the}} Omicron Delta Kappa honor society and the Lamp and Cross society; he was also a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity.

5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E

The 1969 election marked the biggest gains ever made by an opposition party in Malaysia (before 2008), and came close <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> ruling Alliance toppled from power. However, a march made by the DAP along with Gerakan as part of the opposition team led to violence, and resulted in what was euphemistically termed the 13 May Incident.

Because of the gravity of the events, the NCIS said the guards were expected to wait for NCIS investigators to give their statements (this is standard operating procedure (SOP) when criminal actions are possible).

Mahrad had also admitted to being present at the murder scene, and claimed that the blood stains found on his trousers occurred {{as a result of his}} accidentally falling across Parker. Ali, defended by Mohammed Latif, denied being at the scene and claimed to have been asleep at the time of the murder, although a recording from a police van indicated this was a [...] "story" [...] that he had encouraged the others to [...] "stick to".

Carlivati said that Todd was convinced that Starr's alleged rape was karmic payback, even when Starr insisted that she had not been raped. [...] Branco postulated that Todd's conclusion and strong reaction <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> two in bed together was Todd's inability to separate sex from violence, stating, [...] "Todd, in that instance, became unhinged, paranoid, and out-of-control". Todd was in denial, and even almost hit Starr twice when she challenged his beliefs. [...] The scenes were praised as [...] "riveting". [...] Soap columnist Marlena De Lacroix, a self-described [...] "Todd hater" [...] who felt that the character was psychotic, expressed hope that they were [...] "the beginning of a storyline that will delve into Todd's mind and enlighten viewers as to the complexities of a character who is mentally ill". De Lacroix worried that although the storyline had the potential to be memorable, it could be another way to build sympathy for Todd.|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{enormous}} commitment to Steven Spielberg's Hook, which opened {{the same month}} as JFK, composer John Williams {{did not have time}} to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for JFK before he saw the film in its entirety. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies. Williams remembers, [...] "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film – the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans." [...] Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> film. For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as [...] "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines." [...] The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy's assassination and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, [...] "This is a very resonant subject for people of my generation, and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the account}} of the Confession of Peter found in the Gospel of Matthew, Christ designates Peter as the [...] "rock" [...] upon which Christ's church will be built. The Catholic Church {{considers}} the Bishop of Rome, the pope, to be the successor to Saint Peter. Some scholars state Peter was the first Bishop of Rome. Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome. Many scholars hold that a church structure of plural presbyters/bishops persisted in Rome until the mid-2nd century, when the structure of a single bishop and plural presbyters was adopted, and that later writers retrospectively applied the term [...] "bishop of Rome" [...] to the most prominent members of the clergy in the earlier period and also to Peter himself. On this basis, Oscar Cullmann, Henry Chadwick, and Bart D. Ehrman question whether there was a formal link between Peter and the modern papacy. Raymond E. Brown also says that it is anachronistic to speak of Peter in terms of local bishop of Rome, but that Christians of that period would have looked on Peter as having [...] "roles that would contribute in an essential way {{to the development of the}} role of the papacy in the subsequent church". These roles, Brown says, [...] "contributed enormously <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> bishop of Rome, the bishop of the city where Peter died, and where Paul witnessed to the truth of Christ, as the successor of Peter in care for the church universal".|$|E
