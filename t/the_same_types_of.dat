5|$|While various {{religions}} and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through {{concepts such as}} theistic evolution, there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their {{religions and}} who raise various objections to evolution. As had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation in 1844, the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> natural causes as other inherited traits in animals. In some countries, notably the United States, these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy, a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education. While other scientific fields such as cosmology and Earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts, evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists.|$|E

25|$|In Central Mexico, {{barbecue}} outlets {{are common}} and numerous in midsize to large size cities, and often exist at roadside stalls in outlying {{areas of the}} metropolitan area. These outlets may not qualify as being restaurants per se, although they often offer <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> foods. These outlets may offer barbacoa-style foods.

25|$|Alternating {{current is}} used to {{transmit}} information, as {{in the cases of}} telephone and cable television. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. POTS telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the baseband audio frequency. Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz. These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> information over the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of nesting specimens of the related Citipati, with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> egg {{in the original}} Oviraptor specimen, showed that the eggs actually belonged to Oviraptor, not Protoceratops, and that the type specimen was likely brooding the eggs, not feeding on them. While this discovery did {{not rule out the}} possibility that Oviraptor included eggs in its diet, its exact feeding strategies remain unknown. The only Oviraptor philoceratops skeleton preserved the remains of a lizard in the region of its stomach cavity, implying that the species was at least partially carnivorous.|$|E

25|$|Writing {{systems were}} preceded by proto-writing, which used pictograms, ideograms and other {{mnemonic}} symbols. Proto-writing lacked {{the ability to}} capture and express {{a full range of}} thoughts and ideas. The invention of writing systems, which dates {{back to the beginning of}} the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic Era of the late 4th millennium BC, enabled the accurate durable recording of human history in a manner that was not prone to <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> error to which oral history is vulnerable. Soon after, writing provided a reliable form of long distance communication. With the advent of publishing, it provided the medium for an early form of mass communication.|$|E

TV3 {{argue that if}} made available, it could air such shows in prime-time slots. In the past such shows as Rookie Blue, Rescue Me, Big Love, United States of Tara, Tangle and The Secret Life of Us have been purchased by RTÉ and aired between 00:00 and 06:00 on RTÉ Two. RTÉ has argued that TV3 has rarely gone after <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> imported programming and that such shows perform better than when broadcast in prime time on TV3.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays, in {{all forms}} of digital X-ray imaging (radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT) the {{conversion}} of X-ray energy into visible light {{can be achieved by}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> electronic sensors, such as flat panel detectors, which convert the X-ray energy into electrical signals, small bursts of current that convey information that a computer can analyze, store, and output as images. As fluorescence is a special case of luminescence, digital X-ray imaging is conceptually similar to digital gamma ray imaging (scintigraphy, SPECT, and PET) in that in both of these imaging mode families, the information conveyed by the variable attenuation of invisible electromagnetic radiation as it passes through tissues with various radiodensities is converted by an electronic sensor into an electric signal that is processed by a computer and made output as a visible-light image.|$|E
