The proposed sale was expected to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's. Analysts commenting on the transaction stated that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. David Palmer from UBS stated <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>will</b> need to work with its large group of franchise owners to brighten its locations and stabilize sales which could take several years and require significant reinvestment, while Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus stated that Burger King will need at least a year to right its fundamentals.|$|E

5|$|GM {{assembly}} plants were operated in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by General Motors New Zealand Limited {{in an earlier}} and quite separate operation from Holden's in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants have been reduced.

5|$|With {{the opening}} of its Whopper Bar {{locations}} in the United States during 2010, Burger King reported {{that it would be}} the first time in its North American locations that beer would be available for purchase. Although beer is available at fast food restaurants throughout Europe, including Burger King, this is the first time a major fast food chain has attempted to sell beer in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>company</b> <b>will</b> be selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch including Budweiser, Bud Lite and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because of the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is a practical one because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} process, the Proprietors leased {{the canal}} to British Waterways in 2005. However, British Waterways had to {{withdraw}} from the scheme in 2008, due to financial difficulties, and the role of project leaders was taken over by Stroud District Council. Following the re-organisation, the Stroud Valleys Canal Company was established in March 2009. It is a limited company, with two independent directors and three directors representing Stroud District Council, the Proprietors, and the Cotswold Canals Trust. Its purpose is to hold the assets for the canals, and its charitable status means that stamp duty land tax {{does not have to be}} paid. <b>The</b> <b>company</b> <b>will</b> be responsible for management and maintenance of the canal once it is re-opened. The Department for Transport is in the process of reorganising how funding for major transport schemes is managed, and this has enabled Stroud District Council to submit a bid for £1.5 million to the newly formed Gloucestershire Local Transport Board. This is to fund the replacement of Ocean railway culvert with a bridge. A second application for £650,000 has been made to enable part of the Thames and Severn Way long distance footpath to be created. The funding is for the section from Saul Junction to Chalford.|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} enacted FASB Statements 160 and 141 (R) bring {{changes to}} accounting for noncontrolling interests (formerly known as minority interests) for companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. In particular, SFAS No. 160 {{will change the}} presentation of minority interests on the financial statements. The minority interests in shareholders' equity {{will be required to}} be reported as a component of total shareholders' equity. In addition, consolidated net income as presented on the income statement will include minority interests in income. For clarity, companies are instructed in both cases to break out the portions of equity or income attributed to the minority interest, but the "bottom line number" will change with the enactment of these statements. This report examines the consequences of these changes for companies reporting minority interests. In particular, we find that (1) shareholders’ equity will increase by 2 %, though 10 % of <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> see increases of over 25 %; (2) income from continuing operations will increase by 3 %, though 12 % of <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> see increases of over 25 %; (3) liabilities to shareholders’ equity will decline by 2 %, though 10 % of <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> see declines of over 20 %; and (4) times interest earned will increase by 1 %, though 9 % of <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>will</b> see increases of over 10 %.

5|$|On {{release of}} Guitar Hero 5, 35 {{of the songs}} from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Guitar Hero 5 for a small fee (approximately $0.10 per song), and are treated as {{downloadable}} content for the game playable in all game modes; the World Tour export was available on release, while the Smash Hits export was available a few days afterwards. Furthermore, 61 of the 65 tracks from Band Hero are importable into Guitar Hero 5. All transferred songs are also playable in Band Hero. However, Guitar Hero 5 is not backwards-compatible with World Tour. The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual {{to be able to}} redownload available songs in a pack (on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3) or individual songs (on the Wii) that have been updated to include the new features. Players on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack. Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues—not technical issues—according to Bright. Tim Riley, the head of music licensing at Activision, stated that <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>will</b> continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into Guitar Hero 5, but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games. While reviewers appreciated Activision's efforts to allow the importing of songs from previous games, they felt that the small number of tracks that were available at launch was at odds with the impression that Activision had made of the process before the game's release.|$|E
