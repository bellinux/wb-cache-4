5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal {{allies of the}} K'iche' Maya. The growing power of the Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily defensible ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines. Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a pre-dawn operation, taking control without firing a shot. Because of American pressure, he retained the popular Minh as a token head of state, while holding <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). In August, the Vietnam War expanded with the Tonkin Gulf incident, a disputed encounter between North Vietnamese and American naval vessels; Washington accused the communists of launching an attack in international waters.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1970, taking {{advantage}} of a visit by Sihanouk to Moscow and Beijing, the prince was deposed by the National Assembly, who promptly announced the creation of the Khmer Republic. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>power,</b> however, fell into the hands of Lon Nol. The general promptly issued an ultimatum to the North Vietnamese, ordering them out of the country, but the only real result was that the Cambodian Army led a bloody pogrom against ethnic Vietnamese in the eastern provinces.|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  10, it can {{be found}} that, at the initial stage of load {{increasing}} after connecting DGs, <b>the</b> equivalent <b>real</b> <b>power</b> of PCC bus is negative because the controllable DGs balance <b>the</b> increased <b>real</b> <b>power</b> of DN. As the output limits of the controllable DGs are reached, <b>the</b> equivalent <b>real</b> <b>power</b> of PCC bus becomes positive.

5000|$|The {{mayor of}} the palace held and wielded <b>the</b> <b>real</b> and {{effective}} <b>power</b> to make decisions affecting the kingdom, while the kings {{had been reduced to}} performing merely ceremonial functions, which made them little more than figureheads (rois fainéants, [...] "do-nothing kings"). The office may be compared to that of the peshwa, shogun or prime minister, all of which have similarly been <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>powers</b> behind some ceremonial monarchs.|$|R
50|$|The Carolingians {{consolidated}} {{their power}} in the late seventh century, eventually making the offices of mayor of the palace and dux et princeps Francorum hereditary and becoming the de facto rulers of the Franks as <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>powers</b> behind <b>the</b> throne.|$|R
5|$|The ancient {{historian}} Tacitus describes Domitian's first {{speech in}} the Senate as brief and measured, {{at the same time}} noting his ability to elude awkward questions. Domitian's authority was merely , however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function. Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's , promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and Antonius Primus and replacing them by more reliable men such as Arrecinus Clemens.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), but was told that was impossible. However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E
5|$|War fever ran high, and by April, McKinley {{reported}} to Congress that efforts at diplomatic resolution had failed; a week later, Congress declared war. By this time, McKinley {{had begun to}} rely on Assistant Secretary of State William R. Day for day-to-day management of the State Department, and was even inviting him to cabinet meetings, as Sherman had stopped attending them. Day, a McKinley associate of long standing, superseded his boss as <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> in the State Department. Sherman, sensing {{that he was being}} made a mere figurehead and recognizing, at last, his declining health and worsening memory, resigned his office on April 25, 1898.|$|E
5000|$|The {{arrival of}} new hospites (foreign {{settlers}} in the Kingdom Hungary, who were allowed to apply their own foreign law in their settlements; particularly Germans and especially after 1242) considerably restricted <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>powers</b> of <b>the</b> county heads, since the hospites were outside his jurisdiction.|$|R

5|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun, a Turkish soldier, {{had managed}} to become {{governor}} of Egypt in 868. By using the country's immense wealth to raise an army of his own, and exploiting the instability of the central Abbasid government, over the next years he became de facto autonomous, although he continued to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Abbasid caliph—for most of his reign the powerless al-Mu'tamid—and to forward some tax revenue to the central government. Ibn Tulun's power made him a major rival to <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> behind the Abbasid throne, al-Mu'tamid's brother and regent al-Muwaffaq. The latter tried in 877 to wrest Egypt from Ibn Tulun, but the attempt failed spectacularly, and {{in the following year}} Ibn Tulun extended his area of control over Syria up to the border zone with the Byzantine Empire in the north and up to Raqqa in the western Jazira in the east, immediately adjacent to the Abbasid metropolitan province of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as Food Power, however, food power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power.</b> After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Ngô Đình Nhu {{was known}} to favor an even harder line against the Buddhists. Nhu was the younger brother of President Diệm and his main confidant, and was {{regarded}} as <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> behind the Ngô family's rule. Nhu had made statements calling for {{the suppression of the}} protests through his English-language newspaper, the Times of Vietnam. There were persistent reports that Nhu was seeking to usurp power from his elder brother and to attack the Buddhists. Nick Turner of Reuters approached Nhu and interviewed him about these rumors. Nhu said that if the Buddhist crisis were not resolved, he would stage a coup, demolish Xá Lợi in two hours, and head a new anti-Buddhist government. The news was promptly published, which the American embassy largely disregarded, purportedly unconvinced as to Nhu's seriousness.|$|E
50|$|The táltos {{always had}} a horse, {{frequently}} appearing in Hungarian folk tales. However, the Táltos Horse always was ugly, causing them to be mocked by everybody. It is said in myths, that only the táltos could see <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>powers</b> hidden in <b>the</b> horse, and the heroes of the folk tales.|$|R
50|$|The {{apparent}} power delivered by a generator as calculated by a simplistic multiplication of the voltage {{and the current}} is, in general, greater than <b>the</b> actual (<b>real)</b> <b>power</b> delivered {{as measured by the}} work done or heat produced. What is more the total {{apparent power}} consumed by two different circuits is not, in general, equal to their arithmetic sum. Boucherot developed a theorem relating <b>real</b> and apparent <b>power</b> with the introduction of a new concept, reactive power. Reactive power represents the energy stored in electric and magnetic fields and is not consumed, hence does not figure in <b>the</b> total of <b>real</b> <b>power.</b> Boucherot's theorem states that the total reactive power can be found by an arithmetic sum of its components and <b>the</b> total <b>real</b> <b>power</b> can likewise be found by an arithmetic sum of its components. The square of the total apparent power, on the other hand, is equal to the sum of the square of <b>the</b> total <b>real</b> <b>power</b> and <b>the</b> square of the total reactive power.|$|R
50|$|Originally planned as a trilogy, and {{extended}} to a five book fantasy series {{with an alternative}} medieval setting. The major story arc takes the Red Knight from the relative obscurity of command of a little-known mercenary company to fame, international renown, worldly power, and confrontation with <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>powers</b> of his world and perhaps with his own belief system.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. <b>The</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country. Thơ had a rapport with the military officers, having befriended Minh years earlier. He was regarded as a genial and affable administrator with a reputation for making compromises.|$|E
5|$|During the Long March Zhu and Zhou Enlai {{organized}} certain {{battles in}} tandem. There were few positive effects since <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> {{was in the}} hands of Bo Gu and Otto Braun. In the Zunyi Conference, Zhu supported Mao Zedong’s criticisms of Bo and Braun. After the conference, Zhu cooperated with Mao and Zhou on military affairs. In July 1935 Zhu and Liu Bocheng were with the Fourth Red Army while Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai with the First Red Army. When separation between the two divisions occurred, Zhu was forced by Zhang Guotao, the leader of Fourth Red Army, to go south. The Fourth Red Army barely survived the retreat through Sichuan Province. Arriving in Yan'an, Zhu directed the reconstruction of the Red Army under the political guidance of Mao.|$|E
5|$|The HNC, {{which had}} representatives {{from a wide}} range of social groups, {{selected}} the aging civilian politician Phan Khắc Sửu as chief of state, and Suu chose Trần Văn Hương as prime minister, a position that had greater power. However, Khánh and the senior generals retained <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power.</b> At the same time, a group of Catholic officers were trying to replace Khánh with their co-religionist, General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, and the incumbent was under pressure. During 1964, South Vietnam had suffered a succession of setbacks on the battlefield, in part due to disunity in the military and a focus on coup plotting. In the meantime, both Saigon and Washington were planning a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam in an attempt to deter communist aggression, but were waiting for stability in the south before starting the air strikes.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{conflicting}} political, {{religious and}} social positions, the English Civil War was fought between {{the supporters of}} Parliament and those of King Charles I, known colloquially as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms, involving Scotland and Ireland. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced by the Commonwealth. Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653; a period of personal rule followed. After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son Richard as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the Restoration. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power.</b> This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament {{and could not be}} suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament. Also since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed {{in the face of the}} monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch. With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.|$|E

25|$|Power factors below 1.0 {{require a}} utility to {{generate}} more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>power</b> used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to {{the square of the}} current). Alternatively all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current.|$|E
