50|$|In contrast, low-g {{conditions}} can be disastrous for helicopters. In {{such a situation}} their rotors may flap beyond normal limits. The excessive flapping can cause {{the root of the}} blades to exceed the limit of their hinges and this condition, known as mast bumping, can cause the separation of the blades from the hub or for the mast to shear, and hence detach the whole system from the aircraft, falling from the sky. This is especially true for helicopters with teetering rotors, such as the two-bladed design seen on Robinson helicopters.This effect was first discovered when many accidents with Bell UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters occurred. These particular helicopters simply crashed without any obvious cause. Later, it was found that these accidents usually happened during low <b>terrain</b> <b>flight</b> after passing a ridge and initiating a dive from the previous climb.Articulated and rigid rotor systems do not lose controlling forces up to 0g, but may encounter this depending on their flapping hinge offset from the mast. However, dangerous situations, as with a teetering rotor, may not occur.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} {{insights}} into human perception, navigation performance {{and confidence in}} helicopter overland navigation. Helicopter overland navigation is a challenging mission area {{because it is a}} complex cognitive task, and failing to recognize when the aircraft is off-course can lead to operational failures and mishaps. A human-in-the-loop experiment to investigate pilot misperception during simulated overland navigation by analyzing actual navigation trajectory, pilots ’ perceived location, and corresponding confidence levels was designed. Fifteen military officers with prior overland navigation experience completed four simulated low-level navigation routes, two of which entailed auto-navigation. Analysis shows that there is no correlation between perceived and actual location of the aircraft, nor between confidence level and actual location. There is however some evidence that there is a negative correlation between perceived location and intended route of flight, suggesting that there is a bias towards that intended flight route. If aviation personnel can proactively identify the circumstances in which usual misperception occur in navigation, they may reduce mission failure and mishap rate. Fleet squadrons and instructional commands can benefit from this study to improve operations that require low-level flight while also improving crew resource management.

Department of Defense maintain records regarding wildlife strikes with military aircraft. Although rotary-wing aircraft operations comprise important mission components within all 4 military services, no assessment of wildlife strikes to military rotary-wing aircraft has been conducted. The objectives of this project were to 1) conduct a comprehensive analysis of data available from all military services regarding wildlife strikes with rotary-wing aircraft, and 2) provide recommendations to reduce the frequency and negative impacts of these strikes. We acquired all available wildlife strike records and parsed our database to include only wildlife strikes to military rotary-wing aircraft occurring within the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, or within near-shore areas along the coasts. We assessed the effects of year, month, time of day, event location (i. e., on- or off-airfield), and wildlife group involved on the frequency of wildlife strikes with rotary-wing aircraft. The frequency of wildlife strikes was highest during autumn (Sept–Nov; 41. 6 % of all strikes) and lowest during winter (Dec–Feb; 10. 4 %). Wildlife strikes occurred most often when aircraft were traveling en route (38. 3 %) or were engaged in <b>terrain</b> <b>flight</b> (28. 9 %).

40|$|Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) {{applications}} are growing {{day by day}} and this will lead Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in the close future to share the same airspace of manned aircraft. This implies the need for UAS to define precise safety standards compatible with operations standards for manned aviation. Among these standards {{the need for a}} Sense And Avoid (S&A) system to support and, when necessary, sub¬stitute the pilot in the detection and avoidance of hazardous situations (e. g. midair collision, controlled flight into <b>terrain,</b> <b>flight</b> path obstacles, and clouds). This thesis presents the work come out {{in the development of a}} S&A system taking into account collision risks scenarios with multiple moving and fixed threats. The conflict prediction is based on a straight projection of the threats state in the future. The approximations introduced by this approach have the advantage of high update frequency (1 Hz) of the estimated conflict geometry. This solution allows the algorithm to capture the trajectory changes of the threat or ownship. The resolution manoeuvre evaluation is based on a optimisation approach considering step command applied to the heading and altitude autopilots. The optimisation problem takes into account the UAV performances and aims to keep a predefined minimum separation distance between UAV and threats during the resolution manouvre. The Human-Machine Interface (HMI) of this algorithm is then embedded in a partial Ground Control Station (GCS) mock-up with some original concepts for the indication of the flight condition parameters and the indication of the resolution manoeuvre constraints. Simulations of the S&A algorithm in different critical scenarios are moreover in-cluded to show the algorithm capabilities.

40|$|The Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AMRDEC) {{conducted}} a simulation {{to examine the}} performance of the Comanche Contact Analog world-referenced symbology displayed on the Comanche HIDSS when compared with a compressed symbology design similar to that specified by the former MIL-STD 1295. Six experimental test pilots flew one modified ADS- 33 maneuver (hover turn, bob-up), an unusual attitude recovery, and two <b>terrain</b> <b>flight</b> tactical tasks in the NASA Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS). Analysis of the pilot objective performance data and subjective data showed the following results. Objective test results showed that 1295 symbology yielded more rapid maneuvering in the hover turn bob-up than Contact Analog symbology. The average margin of difference in the time to complete the maneuver was approximately two seconds, which was statistically significant. There were no significant differences measured between symbology sets with respect to altitude or position performance measures for all other maneuvers. The NOE target ID task data showed improved accuracy in determining heading to target when using Contact Analog over MIL-STD- 1295. Subjective test results, including handling qualities ratings (HQRs) and NASA-TLX workload ratings, showed small but consistent advantages of 1295 symbology over Contact Analog for most parameters. For the bob-up maneuver, 1295 symbology handling qualities were rated Desired for lateral position error and time to complete whereas Contact Analog was rated adequate. The average HQRs for all other maneuvers were rated the same for both symbology sets. Pilot comments and the results of an online questionnaire more strongly favored 1295 over Contact Analog. Repeated comments from all six pilots led to a focus on design issues with six Contact Analog symbols. Those symbols were the heading tape, horizon line, radar altitude six-second predictor, the position of the torque symbol, the absence of a hover position cue, and the widespread positioning of the symbology to the outer edges of the display field-of-view. Pilots rated the present design of three of the six symbols as having safety-of-flight implications. Those symbols were the heading tape, horizon line, and six-second predictor. To summarize, test results showed no objective data that would warrant restricting experimental test pilots from flying constrained tasks. Small but consistent advantages were recorded for the MILSTD- 1295 symbology design when executing ADS- 33 constrained tasks. No general performance differences were recorded for the operational maneuvers (NOE, contour flight modes) except for the azimuth-to-target task, which favored the Contact Analog heading tape design. There were consistent and strong pilot comments supporting the MIL-STD- 1295 design over Contact Analog in both this current simulation and in Comanche Sim I. Three Contact Analog symbols warrant modification and further evaluation to mitigate safety-of-flight implications noted by participating test pilots.
