25|$|Graham Kennedy {{returned}} to the Nine Network after his departure from In Melbourne <b>Tonight</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Graham Kennedy Show in 1973, but was banned from appearing from television in 1975 after an infamous 'crow-call' incident. Kennedy subsequently returned in 1977 as the host of Blankety Blanks. In 1979, commercial stations were mandated to provide 'C'-classified programming targeted at children between 4-5pm, and a minimum of 30 minutes of pre-school programming prior to that. These regulations saw {{the establishment of a}} number of children's series including Simon Townsend's Wonder World and Shirl's Neighbourhood.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{positive}} assessments, [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] {{produced more}} variety within critical opinion. In his [...] "commendable" [...] 8.6 {{out of ten}} rating review, Ross Bonaime of Paste asserted that the program displayed some exceptional dimension into the characters—from Lana's apparent self-consciousness, to Cheryl's eccentric and [...] "odd" [...] persona, and Krieger's past. Ultimately, Bonaime professed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] was slightly inferior to its predecessor; [...] "'Space Race, Part II' doesn’t {{have some of the}} big laughs that the first part featured. By that, I mean Archer never rode Cyril through waves of Lana’s puke joyously. It is a step down from the first part comedically, but the episode does give us a few fun moments for each member of the cast." [...] Analogous sentiments were echoed by Blair Marnell of CraveOnline, who concluded: [...] "The space adventure had some fun moments, but it seemed to lack the punch provided by the two episodes that proceeded it. Even though it was good to see Barry again this season, his appearance in this episode seemed pretty tacked on." [...] VanDerWerff affirmed that the episode was a superb conclusion to Archer third season, despite not being as [...] "relentlessly entertaining" [...] as [...] "Space Race: Part I". While deeming the episode as a hilarious finale, TV Overmind writer Kevin Fitzpatrick claimed that [...] "Space Race: Part II" [...] left many unanswered questions to the audience. Conversely, Eric Hochberger of TV Fanatic applauded the episode, issuing it a 4.7 out of 5 stars. [...] "Archer ended its third season <b>tonight</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conclusion to its two part episode, 'Space Race'. And, man, from the second Archer announced he left his light saber in his other space pants, you knew you were in for a solid ending." ...|$|E
