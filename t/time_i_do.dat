McTell's 2012 UK tour, branded “An English Heartbeat”, commenced in October, {{and saw the}} release of a CD of guitar instrumentals called Sofa Noodling. In an interview published ahead of his 2013 “One More for the Road” tour, McTell said, “It could be the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a big tour... {{this is the beginning of}} slowing things down”.|$|E
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized thatI do not {{subscribe to the}} myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should {{be held responsible for}} anti-Semitism. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.|$|E

500|$|In October 2012, Genndy Tartakovsky {{was asked}} about the episode during an AMA on Reddit, and he replied [...] "Next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a public {{appearance}} I'll bring it with me!". Adult Swim later asked fans on Twitter if there was still any interest in the episode, and the response was [...] "overwhelming". The episode was finally uploaded on AdultSwim.com via YouTube on January 22, 2013.|$|E

And I'm not like any of them. I'm all of them. I'm none of them. You know what I mean.?" ...|$|E
500|$|Shel Talmy, the {{producer}} on the track, {{has gone on}} record and put the controversy to rest {{in an interview with}} The Guardian, saying [...] "contrary to myth, Jimmy didn't play on 'You Really Got Me'." [...] In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying [...] "Oh, Crikey! I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' but I did play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it. But every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> an interview, people ask me about 'You Really Got Me.' So maybe somebody can correct Wikipedia so people won't keep asking me." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 2013, Activision {{community}} manager Dan Amrich attempted {{to explain the}} acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video. This history includes the 2003 acquisition of NOLF publisher Fox Interactive by Vivendi Universal Games (who also owned Sierra Entertainment), {{as well as the}} 2008 merger between Vivendi Universal Games (VUG, which had since been renamed Vivendi Games) and video game publisher Activision, forming the Activision Blizzard holding company. After the merger, Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others. In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF, Amrich asked his colleagues, saying that [...] "he person that I normally talk to about this stuff does not believe that we [...] currently have the rights. They've never seen it, they've never been given the permission to put that stuff on [...] He said, basically, 'If we had it, I would {{love to be able to}} reissue those old games.'" [...] Amrich also asked a friend of his who working at NOLF developer Monolith (since acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment), who also did not know who the IP belonged to. Amrich concluded that [...] "at this <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe that Activision has the rights to No One Lives Forever." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott {{said that}} the film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Ultimate Guitar, Gary Holt {{said that he}} is ready to contribute with the songwriting for the next album. When speaking to Revolver, King was asked if there were any plans in place for the band to begin working on the album, he said, [...] "Funny thing is, Repentless isn't even two years old yet, though it seems like it is. But from that session, there are six or eight songs that are recorded — some with vocals, some with leads, but all with keeper guitar, drums and bass. So when those songs get finished lyrically, if the lyrics don't change the songs, they'll be ready to be on the next record. So we already have more than half a record complete, if those songs make it." [...] He also gave conceivable consideration that it could be released next year, [...] "I'm certainly not gonna promise it, because every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I make a liar of myself! [...] " [...] When asked about any plans or the timeline the band would like to release the album, King said, [...] "It depends on touring — getting time to rehearse, getting time to make up new stuff. We haven't even done Australia on this run yet at all. We're hitting Japan finally later this year. But if things go well, I'd like to record next year. But timelines change all the time." [...] In an October 2017 interview, Holt once again expressed his desire to contribute to the songwriting for the next Slayer album, saying, [...] "When that time comes and we are ready for the next album, if Kerry wants me to contribute, I've got riffs. I've got stuff right now that I've written that I am not using for Exodus, because it was kind of maybe just unintentional subconscious thing, like, 'It sounds a little too Slayer.'" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was looking}} at him; not a muscle of his face moved in the least. And yet, even at the <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not suspect him of insensibility. It {{was a sort of}} rapt thoughtfulness. Then he stirred slightly.|$|R

2500|$|Despite never airing on television, [...] "Rude Removal" [...] did see limited showing {{at certain}} {{animation}} festivals and conventions, including an {{event at the}} 1998 World Animation Celebration on February 21, 1998. Tartakovsky would sometimes show the cartoon when he spoke in public. One such showing occurred during a lecture given at the Rhode Island School of Design on November 15, 2008. He {{was asked about the}} segment during a Reddit AMA in October 2012, and he replied [...] "Next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> a public appearance I'll bring it with me!".

2500|$|In Hebron is {{a public}} guest house {{continuously}} open, with a cook, a baker and servants in regular attendance. These offer a dish of lentils and olive oil to every poor person who arrives, and it is set before the rich, too, should they wish to partake. Most men express the opinion this {{is a continuation of}} the guest house of Abraham, however, it is, in fact from the bequest of [...] Tamim-al Dari and others....

60|$|I {{looked at}} him for quite a long <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand. <b>I</b> thought he was mad. It must be remembered that I was very young, and I looked upon him as a middle-aged man. I forgot {{everything}} but my own amazement.|$|R

2500|$|Jo Ann Compton's {{daughter}} Laurie Ann {{was stabbed}} to death in 1988—and a decade later, the mom was tangled in her grief. [...] "I hope they're in the same hell I'm in," [...] she said of her daughter's murderers on a 1998 show. Oprah brought in Dr. Phil to help Jo Ann. He {{asked her if she}} thought her daughter would want her to be in so much pain—and Compton said no. [...] "Maybe the betrayal is focusing on the day of her death, rather than celebrating the event of her life," [...] Phil continued. [...] "She lived for 18 vibrant years, and you focus on the day she died." [...] After a moment, Compton uttered her breakthrough sentence: [...] "I never thought of it that way." [...] Later, she sobbed while revealing that she had been planning to end her life after the show. When Compton returned to the show in 2011, she had a new viewpoint on the daughter she lost: [...] "She continues to stay alive every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> something positive." [...] Compton's surviving daughter, Cindy, said [...] "She went from existing to living. It was an amazing transformation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the future}} of Savatage, {{frontman}} Jon Oliva explained, [...] "As far as that goes, the whole Wacken thing came up, and I was, like, you know what? If we're going to do anything, {{we have to do}} it now. I don't want to do it when I'm 60 years old. I mentioned that to Paul. He said to me, 'We're going to do the Wacken thing, but let's just wait until the winter tour is over and then you and me we're going to sit down in January and discuss what we're going to do.'" [...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I get rained on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winchester was {{respected}} by the others professionally, {{but at the}} same time, as a Boston blue blood, he was also snobbish, as when he stated in the scrub room, [...] "I do one thing at a <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it very well, and then I move on," [...] which drove much of his conflict with the other characters. Still, the show's writers occasionally allowed Winchester's humanity to shine through, such as in his dealings with a young concert pianist who had partially lost the use of his right hand, the protection of a stuttering soldier from the bullying of other soldiers (it is revealed later that Winchester's sister Honoria stutters), his keeping a vigil with Hawkeye when Hawkeye's father went into surgery back in the States ("Sons and Bowlers"), his willingness to be officer of the day for Hawkeye when Hawkeye was offered three days in Seoul, giving blood to a patient even though he already donated blood five days earlier, or his continuing a family tradition of anonymously giving Christmas treats to an orphanage. Winchester subjects himself to condemnation after realizing that [...] "it is sadly inappropriate to offer dessert to a child who has had no meal." [...] Isolating himself, he is saved by Klinger's own gift of understanding. Klinger scrapes together a Christmas dinner for Charles, with the provision that the source of the gift remain anonymous (Klinger had overheard Winchester's argument with the manager of the orphanage). For the final moment of the episode ("Death Takes a Holiday"), the two are simply friends as Charles says, [...] "Thank you, Max," [...] and Klinger replies, [...] "Merry Christmas, Charles." [...] As well, in the series finale [...] "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen", Charles comes across a group of Chinese musicians who surrender to him. When Charles takes them back to the camp as prisoners of war and later listens to his record of Mozart's [...] Quintet in A major for Clarinet and Strings, K. 581, the musicians attempt to play the piece of music. Charles, ever the perfectionist, cannot stand to hear them play the piece incorrectly (and is impressed that they can even attempt to play the music after only hearing it once) and spends the next week conducting them on how to play the piece properly. During this time, Charles is forced to use the little patience that he rarely shows. When the Chinese musicians are taken off to a prisoner of war camp in a prisoner exchange to Charles' dismay and protest, their final goodbye to Charles is the Mozart piece played correctly. Later, one of the musicians returns to the camp mortally wounded on a Jeep. When Charles inquires as to where the other musicians are, it's revealed that the truck the musicians were on was ambushed and that there were no other survivors. In a combination of shock and disbelief, Charles returns to The Swamp to listen to the Mozart record, but removes the record and smashes it in anger. Later still on the final night that everyone at the M*A*S*H is together, Charles says that before the war, music was a stress reliever to him, but because of the Chinese musicians and their fate, music will forever be a reminder of the horrors of war.|$|E
