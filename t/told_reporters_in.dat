The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane <b>told</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>in</b> 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.|$|E

25|$|ATC {{instructed}} {{the flight to}} change its transponder code to 7500, the universal signal for hijack, expecting that, {{if they had not}} been hijacked, the pilots would respond to that effect.

Worried that a possible hijacked plane might strike a target in Alaska, Governor Tony Knowles ordered the evacuation of large hotels and government buildings in Anchorage. At nearby Valdez, (also in Alaska), the U.S. Coast Guard ordered all tankers filling up with oil to head out to sea. Lt. Gen.
