40|$|Abstract: Timed {{specifications}} {{are often}} formalised at an absolute level of pre-cision, {{which does not}} reflect the real world that the specifications model, i. e., in the real world, inputs cannot be sampled with absolute precision and physical hard-ware cannot react instantaneously. As a result the developed specifications can often become unimplementable. In this paper, we consider the <b>time</b> <b>bands</b> model which allows time to be structured into several layers of abstraction and relationships be-tween bands to be formalised. This allows the timed specifications developed under idealised assumptions to be approximated using the <b>time</b> <b>band</b> in which the variables are sampled. We implement the approximated specifications using teleo-reactive programs embedded with <b>time</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{the determinants of}} coupon values at the brand level {{within the context of}} a complex marketing program. A two-equation, fixed-effects, panel-data model accounts for the bidirectional causality between brand prices and discount levels. The empirical model is fitted with data on household purchases of ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and captures the industry's 1996 price cuts and <b>discount</b> <b>reductions.</b> Higher brand prices cause coupon values to rise, supporting the price discrimination hypothesis. Coupon values fall with in-store displays and more intense advertising but rise when couponed products are featured in store flyers. Discount levels are positively related to brand market share and the size of discounts redeemed for rival cereals. Coupon values fall with increasing brand loyalty among RTE cereal purchasers. Cereal prices are positively affected by coupon values, advertising expenditures, input costs, and the prices of competing brands. Inventory levels are negatively correlated with brand price.
