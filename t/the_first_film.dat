5|$|After {{seeing how}} well <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>film</b> was made, {{the cast and}} crew signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace at the end of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>film,</b> and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>film.</b> They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>film),</b> which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
