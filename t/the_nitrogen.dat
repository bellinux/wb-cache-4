40|$|Solid-state [15 N]NMR {{was used}} to measure the use of the amide and amino nitrogens of {{glutamine}} and asparagine for synthesis of storage protein in cotyledons of soybean (Glycine max L. cv.

No major discrimination in the incorporation of the amide or amino nitrogens of glutamine into protein is apparent, but <b>the</b> same <b>nitrogens</b> of asparagine are used with a degree of specificity. During the first seven days in culture with asparagine as <b>the</b> sole <b>nitrogen</b> source, <b>the</b> amino <b>nitrogen</b> donates approximately twice as much nitrogen to protein as does <b>the</b> amide <b>nitrogen.</b> <b>The</b> use of <b>the</b> amide <b>nitrogen</b> increases with longer periods of culture.

These results indicate that in a developing cotyledon, a transaminase reaction is of major importance in the utilization of asparagine for synthesis of storage protein and that, at least {{in the early stages of}} cotyledon development, reduced activities of ammonium-assimilating enzymes in the cotyledon tissue or in other tissues of the seed or pod may be a limiting factor in the use of asparagine-amide nitrogen...|$|R

5|$|Azotobacter is a genus of usually motile, oval or spherical {{bacteria}} that form thick-walled cysts and may produce {{large quantities of}} capsular slime. They are aerobic, free-living soil microbes which {{play an important role}} in <b>the</b> <b>nitrogen</b> cycle in nature, binding atmospheric nitrogen, which is inaccessible to plants, and releasing it in the form of ammonium ions into the soil (nitrogen fixation). In addition to being a model organism for studying diazotrophs, it is used by humans for the production of biofertilizers, food additives, and some biopolymers. The first representative of the genus, Azotobacter chroococcum, was discovered and described in 1901 by the Dutch microbiologist and botanist Martinus Beijerinck. Azotobacter species are Gram-negative bacteria found in neutral and alkaline soils, in water, and in association with some plants.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing <b>the</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E

However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by New Horizons suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.|$|E
