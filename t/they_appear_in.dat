5|$|Braun {{was very}} fond of Negus and Stasi, her two Scottish Terrier dogs, and <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> her home movies. She usually kept them away from Hitler's German Shepherd, Blondi. Blondi was killed {{by one of the}} entourage on 29 April 1945 when Hitler ordered that one of the cyanide {{capsules}} obtained for Braun and Hitler's suicide the next day be tested on the dog. Braun's dogs and Blondi's puppies were shot on 30 April by Hitler's dog handler, Fritz Tornow.|$|E
5|$|Chariots {{existed in}} the Minoan civilization, as they were {{inventoried}} on storage lists from Knossos in Crete, dating to around 1450 BC. Chariots were also used in China {{as far back as}} the Shang Dynasty (c.16001050 BC), where <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> burials. The high point of chariot use in China was in the Spring and Autumn period (770476 BC), although they continued in use up until the 2nd century BC.|$|E

5|$|For some Native American tribes, dragonflies {{represent}} swiftness and activity; for the Navajo, they symbolize pure water. They are {{a common}} motif in Zuni pottery; stylized as a double-barred cross, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> Hopi rock art and on Pueblo necklaces. They {{have been used in}} traditional medicine in Japan and China. In Indonesia, adults are caught on poles made sticky with birdlime, then fried in oil as a delicacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, the Marvell Press {{published}} Listen presents Philip Larkin reading The Less Deceived (Listen LPV1), an LP {{record on}} which Larkin recites all the poems from The Less Deceived {{in the order}} <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the printed volume. This was followed, in 1965, by Philip Larkin reads and comments on The Whitsun Weddings (Listen LPV6), again on the Marvell Press's record label (though the printed volume was published by Faber and Faber). Once again the poems are read in {{the order in which}} <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> the printed volume, but with Larkin including introductory remarks to many of the poems. A recording of Larkin reading the poems from his final collection, High Windows, was published in 1975 as British poets of our time. Philip Larkin; High Windows: poems read by the author (edited by Peter Orr) on the Argo record label (Argo PLP 1202). As with the two previous recordings, the sequencing of the poems is the same as in the printed volume.|$|E
5|$|In J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, Elves {{are one of}} {{the races}} that inhabit a fictional Earth, often called Middle-earth, and set in the remote past. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> The Hobbit and in The Lord of the Rings, but their complex history is {{described}} more fully in The Silmarillion. Tolkien had been writing about Elves long before he published The Hobbit.|$|E
5000|$|Each Epoch in Yarsani belief saw the {{appearance}} of the seven secondary divine manifestations or Haft Tan. In the First Epoch <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> their true angelic form, while <b>in</b> subsequent Epochs <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> human incarnations. The [...] "Haft Tan" [...] are charged with responsibility for the affairs of the internal realm.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 and 2014, <b>they</b> both <b>appeared</b> on the ITV2 comedy {{panel show}} Celebrity Juice. From February 2013 to March 2015 <b>they</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> adverts for {{supermarket}} Morrisons. Since February 2016, <b>they</b> have <b>appeared</b> <b>in</b> adverts for car company Suzuki.|$|R

5|$|Lice were {{ubiquitous}} in human society {{until at least}} the Middle Ages. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> folktales, songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House, and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder delusional parasitosis. A louse {{was one of the}} early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, Micrographia.|$|E
5|$|Broad-headed {{compared}} with other cicadas, the double drummer is mostly brown with a black pattern {{across the back of}} its thorax, and has red-brown and black underparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the female lacks the male's tymbals and sac-like covers. Found in sclerophyll forest in Queensland and New South Wales, adult double drummers generally perch high in the branches of large eucalypts. They emerge from the ground where they have spent several years as nymphs from November until March, and live for another four to five weeks. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> great numbers in some years, yet are absent in others.|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on calcareous soil.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, despite the fact that <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E

People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E

5|$|Since {{microbes}} {{were not}} known until the Early Modern period, <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> earlier literature indirectly, through descriptions of baking and brewing. Only with {{the invention of}} the microscope, as used by Robert Hooke in his 1665 book Micrographia, and by Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s, the germ theory of disease, and progress in microbiology in the 19th century were microbes observed directly, identified as living organisms, and put to use on a scientific basis. The same knowledge also allowed microbes to appear explicitly in literature and the arts.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that at one}} time the manuscript was in the possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text similar to one of Bessarion's manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople {{around the time of the}} fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to Paul Canart, the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way <b>they</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat, a paleographer at the British Museum, first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce. The similarity of the text with the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.|$|E
5|$|They usually winter along coasts and on inland lakes, bays, inlets, and streams, {{with birds}} {{migrating}} {{to the nearest}} body of water that will not freeze over in the winter: western Canadian loons go to the Pacific, Great Lakes loons to the Gulf of Mexico region, eastern Canadian loons to the Atlantic, and some loons to large inland lakes and reservoirs. <b>They</b> <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> most of the inland waters of the United States. The South Carolina coast, the Gulf coast adjacent to the Florida panhandle, and the Atlantic seaboard from Massachusetts to Maine {{have some of the}} highest concentrations of common loons. Occasional vagrants are recorded inland in Mexico, in San Luis Potosí and Coahuila, as well as in Chiapas and Oaxaca in the south. They are accidental in northern Japan and the Commander Islands in northwestern Pacific, and Cuba in the West Indies.|$|E
