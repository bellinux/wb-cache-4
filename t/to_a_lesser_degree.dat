5|$|Automotive {{manufacturers}} {{often use}} patterns to disguise upcoming products. This camouflage {{is designed to}} obfuscate the vehicle's visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns' purpose is to prevent visual observation (and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> photography), that would subsequently enable reproduction of the vehicle's form factors.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} there were about forty Jesuit colleges (secondary schools) {{scattered}} throughout the Commonwealth. They were educating mostly szlachta, burgher sons <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of the Crown, who built the town of Zamość, established an academy there in 1594; it had functioned as a gymnasium only after Zamoyski's death. The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled the wartime decline of the burgher class.|$|E

50|$|An {{increase}} in temperature, and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> humidity will cause an {{increase in}} density altitude. Thus, in hot and humid conditions, the density altitude at a particular location may be {{significantly higher than the}} true altitude.|$|R
5|$|Luxury {{items were}} in high demand among the {{increasingly}} prosperous nobility, and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> among the wealthy town merchants. Brick and stone residential buildings became common, but only in cities. The mature Gothic style was represented not only in architecture, but also in sacral wooden sculpture.

5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} classification {{arrangements were}} proposed by Pseudo-Geber (in the Geber corpus, c. 1310), Paracelsus (De Natura Rerum libri nonem, 1525–6; and later works), Basil Valentine (Conclusiones, 1624), and Boerhaave (Elementa Chemiæ, 1733). They attempted {{to separate the}} more characteristic metals from substances having those characteristics <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Such substances included zinc, antimony, bismuth, stibnite, pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or bastard metals.|$|E

5|$|The {{east has}} a more {{continental}} climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate {{over most of the}} country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, but also on bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation. Increase the crown radius of the front tire {{has been shown to}} decrease the size or eliminate self stability. Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b>|$|E

50|$|Both an {{increase}} in temperature, decrease in atmospheric pressure, and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> increase in humidity will cause {{an increase}} in density altitude.

5|$|Warfarin {{decreases}} {{blood clotting}} by blocking an enzyme called vitamin K epoxide reductase that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X have decreased clotting ability. The anticlotting protein C and protein S are also inhibited but <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> A few days {{are required for}} full effect to occur and these effects can last {{for up to five}} days.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> elsewhere), the new development was treated with suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> France.|$|E

Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, {{but it is also}} clear that she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> Rose.|$|E
