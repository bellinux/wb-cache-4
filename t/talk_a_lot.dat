We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E

EMU’s insists on linking peace and social justice – it is home to the Center for Justice and Peacebuilding, and its mission statement refers to Micah 6:8 on doing justice, loving mercy and walking humbly with God. ”It’s no exaggeration to say that the graduate program in conflict transformation epitomizes the mission of EMU as a whole,” reported All-American Colleges in 2006.

2500|$|Radke {{discussed}} {{his relationship with}} Escape the Fate members since his departure from the band, stating that {{they have tried to}} reconcile with Radke but he was uninterested in getting back on friendly terms with them after they kicked him out and misinformed their fans about Radke getting caught with heroin inside prison. Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could be talking about the war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things that I would like to say. So I did. On the record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Arab {{commentators}} had a {{more negative}} response. Rami Khouri, the editor of The Daily Star {{and director of the}} Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut, argued that Obama gave [...] "a lot of good, positive vibes" [...] but, ultimately, it [...] "was only rhetoric". He referred to what he saw as the hypocrisy of Obama praising human rights after meeting with Egyptian and Saudi leaders who have suppressed those same rights. He stated that the Muslim world is still waiting for Obama's words to [...] "translate" [...] into real policy. Al Jazeera bureau chief Abderrahim Foukara made similar remarks, saying, [...] "he talked about Palestinians killing Israelis, but he didn't <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about Israelis killing Palestinians, especially {{in the context of the}} latest Israeli war on Gaza." [...] Foukara also said, [...] "he's come to us with his message of peace, but there are U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and there are civilians being killed there by American forces." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1999 Swedish film , Floberg {{played the}} role of Claes, one of two {{fishermen}} who rescues Polish Irena, played by Izabella Scorupco, from the water. The two fishermen later gets in trouble, as it turns out that Irena is being chased by members of the russian mafia. This was the fifth time Floberg played in a film directed by Erik Gustavson, who praised him: [...] " [...] is my Robert De Niro. Our fifth film together. It has always gone well". Floberg, on the other hand, dryly commented: [...] "Yes, I got a phone call [...] this time too". In an interview with Verdens Gang, he elaborated on his relationship with Gustavson: [...] "We have a really good understanding. We <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in codes, and save a lot of time. Besides, I really like the way Erik works". Floberg also expressed his satisfaction with playing a [...] "good guy" [...] for once, humorously acknowledging that he is probably considered Norway's [...] "number one movie-psycho". Co-star Scorupco, on the other hand, characterized Floberg as charming, and [...] "easy to fall in love with". In Misery Harbour, a Scandinavian/Canadian collaboration from the same year, Floberg returned to playing a negative character. He received critical acclaim for his depiction of the arrogant literary critic Johan Hoeg, being described as [...] "brilliant", and [...] "taking on the role (...) with razor-sharp spitefulness".|$|E

Elijah Raven was in court with two or three of his friends--small working farmers who had some {{interested}} motive in desiring to appear as his supporters. He, too, had engaged a lawyer to conduct his case. The judge, said Bawcombe, who had never seen one before, was a tarrible stern-looking old man in his wig.

[...] He didn't rightly remember afterwards what he called him, but 'twere your lordship or your worship, he was sure.
