5|$|In {{the third}} stage, Pottier had to abandon due to <b>tendinitis.</b> The lead was back with Trousselier, who {{also won the}} stage.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{missed the}} last month of the season due to <b>tendinitis</b> in his elbow. Despite a strong start from Ellis during the playoff chase in the final week of the season, the Pirates lost the {{division}} to the New York Mets. Ellis again {{led the league in}} home runs allowed per nine innings pitched ratio (0.328).|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons, however, Hamels {{suffered}} through several injuries, and pitched only sparingly. He missed most of the 2004 season with elbow <b>tendinitis,</b> making only four starts. In 2005, he broke his pitching hand in a bar fight before the season began; after rehabilitation, {{he was assigned to}} Clearwater. In July, the Phillies promoted him to the Class AA Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, where he surrendered the first home run of his professional career in his first start. Subsequently, he was shut down {{for the remainder of the}} season with back spasms.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005–2006 season, Lysacek again competed on the Grand Prix. He placed {{second at}} the 2005 Skate America, {{but it was}} clear that his Grease free skate was not working. Lysacek and coach Frank Carroll made the {{decision}} to find a new long program. Lysacek's new Carmen program was a success at the 2005 NHK Trophy, where Lysacek placed second. Lysacek was the only American man to qualify for the 2005–2006 Grand Prix Final, but he withdrew before the event because of bursitis and <b>tendinitis</b> in his right hip.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{signed with}} the Cincinnati Reds on April 8, 1995. Again he {{struggled}} with injury, and {{was placed on the}} disabled list once for <b>tendinitis</b> in his right shoulder and once for a strained rib cage muscle. In his only year with the club, Jackson posted a team-best 2.39 ERA, while recording 41 strikeouts over 40 games. Jackson and the Reds made the playoffs, winning the National League Divisional Series but losing the National League Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves in four games. Jackson was granted free agency on November 3, 1995.|$|E
5|$|DeGrom {{compiled}} four quality {{starts in}} his first four MLB starts, but did not record a win in any of them. On July 8, deGrom pitched seven scoreless innings and recorded 11 strikeouts in giving the Mets their 4,000th franchise victory. Along with Steve Cishek of the Miami Marlins, deGrom was named the National League's (NL) Co-Player of the Week {{for the period of}} July 21 to July 27 after allowing only one earned run in two starts that week. He was named the NL Rookie of the Month for July. On August 11, deGrom went on the disabled list with rotator cuff <b>tendinitis.</b> Rafael Montero was called up on August 12 in deGrom's place. On August 23, Montero was re-sent back to the 51s to make room for deGrom coming off the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{failed to}} finish a game due to injury on only eight {{occasions}} since {{taking control of the}} Packers as quarterback. Significant injuries suffered by Favre during the streak includes a first-degree shoulder separation, deep thigh bruise, severely bruised left hip, severely sprained left ankle, wind knocked out coupled with coughing up blood, sprained right thumb, right elbow <b>tendinitis,</b> left mid-foot sprain, sprained lateral collateral ligament of the left knee, broken left thumb, softball-sized bruise of the left hamstring, mild concussion, sprained right hand, injured ulnar nerve of the right elbow, bone spurs on the left ankle, torn right biceps, pulled groin, stress fracture of the left ankle coupled with an avulsion fracture of calcaneus, and a sprained sternoclavicular joint of the right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 {{he led the}} Major Leagues {{in games}} pitched, with 81, while also leading the Majors in holds, with 33. The 1994 MLB season was Shortened to 115 games for the Giants; however, over 36 games pitched, Jackson led National League {{relievers}} in ERA (1.49), opponents average (.164), and hits per 9.0 innings pitched (4.9) while finishing second in strikeouts per 9.0 innings pitched (10.84). The already shortened season was again shortened for Jackson due to <b>tendinitis</b> in his right elbow. This led to two stints on the disabled list: one from June 17 until July 2, and another from July 6 {{until the end of}} the season. On October 17, 1994, Jackson was granted free agency.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{part of his}} NBA career, Parker was still {{considered}} an erratic shooter of the ball and during the 2005 off-season, Coach Popovich decided {{to work on this}} aspect of his play. Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland forbade Parker to shoot any three-point shots, and among others, corrected his shooting motion and his thumb position. As a result, by the 2006–07 season, Parker had reduced his three-point shots by 117 while shooting 147 more normal field goal attempts compared to 2005, and his accuracy rose by 4% (field goals and three-point shots) {{and he was able to}} connect on 78% of his free throws that season. Parker's field goal percentage is also high for a point guard, and his speed also makes him a fast break player. However, his style of play has had adverse effects on his knees (<b>tendinitis).</b>|$|E
5|$|Lieber's 2002 {{season was}} curtailed by right elbow problems, which plagued him all year. On August 1, facing the San Diego Padres, Lieber allowed two runs in seven innings but {{received}} a no-decision in an 87 Cubs' victory. He {{was placed on}} the DL with right elbow <b>tendinitis</b> the next day, and he underwent Tommy John surgery on August 8, ending his season. In 21 starts, Lieber compiled a 68 record, a 3.70 ERA, 87 strikeouts, 12 walks, and 153 hits allowed in 141 innings pitched. He still managed to tie Randy Wolf, Brett Tomko, Pedro Astacio, and teammate Matt Clement for tenth in the league with three complete games. After the season, he became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, he was {{assigned}} to the Mets minor league camp. After rehabilitating from surgery, Humber resumed pitching with St. Lucie in 2006, posting a 2.37 ERA in seven starts. He compiled a 3–1 win–loss record. On July 31, 2006, a year after his surgery, Humber was once again promoted to Binghamton, where he was 2–2 with a 2.88 ERA. He was an early September call-up when the Major League rosters expanded on September 1. However, Humber did not make his Major League Baseball debut until September 24, 2006. He made two appearances for the Mets as a relief pitcher, pitching two innings. However, Humber was unable to obtain his pre-surgery velocity. That fall, he began play in the Arizona Fall League but his participation was discontinued when he endured shoulder <b>tendinitis.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} record the band staged an eventful world tour. While touring in Barcelona in 2000, Oasis {{were forced to}} cancel a gig when an attack of <b>tendinitis</b> caused Alan White's arm to seize up, and the band spent the night {{drinking}} instead. After a row between the two brothers, Noel declared he was quitting touring overseas altogether, and Oasis were supposed to finish the tour without him. Noel eventually returned for the Irish and British legs of the tour, which included two major shows at Wembley Stadium. A live album of the first show, called Familiar to Millions, was released in late 2000 to mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder <b>tendinitis</b> and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating arthroscopic surgery on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} year off from baseball, Zito signed a minor league {{contract}} {{to return to the}} Athletics on February 16, 2015. In spring training, Zito competed for a role on the Athletics' 25-man roster, possibly as a long reliever. On April 4, 2015, Zito accepted an assignment to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds. Zito's Nashville teammates lauded him for embracing the Triple-A lifestyle and for his commitment to the team: charting pitches between starts, coaching first base, and even buying dinner for the entire team on his birthday. Zito spent the entire season with Nashville, including about a month on the disabled list with left shoulder <b>tendinitis.</b> He was activated on the next-to-last day of the season on which he pitched one scoreless inning of relief. In a total of 24appearances (22 starts), he accrued an 8–7 record with a 3.46 ERA and 91 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|He was fit for {{the start}} of 2005–06 and set up two of Chesterfield's goals in the 3–1 opening day victory over Blackpool. He went on to score his first goals for Chesterfield with a brace after coming on as a half-time {{substitute}} against Yeovil Town; he scored from a pass from Paul Hall after Yeovil goalkeeper Chris Weale was left stranded after being lobbed, and then scored his second after gaining the ball from Mark Allott, which helped his team to a 3–1 victory. An 89th-minute goal from Smith against Bradford City on 7 January 2006 saw his team earn a 1–0 victory. He agreed to a new two-year contract at Chesterfield in March and finished 2005–06 with 29 appearances and scoring three goals. His recurring knee injury was confirmed to be severe patella <b>tendinitis,</b> which resulted in him being un{{fit for the}} start of 2006–07. He made his return to action in a friendly against Staveley Miners Welfare in August and made his first league appearance of the season in a 4–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest on 2 September 2006 after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute. He scored the winner for Chesterfield in the Football League Trophy against Oldham Athletic with a diagonal shot from distance. Smith suffered from a knee injury in March 2007, which resulted in him undergoing surgery that ruled him out {{for the remainder of the}} 2006–07 season; in which he made 17 appearances and scored one goal, while Chesterfield were relegated to League Two. His severe <b>tendinitis</b> affected him in September, and eventually made his return in a 2–1 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup first round on 10 November. He was sent out on loan at League Two club Lincoln City for a month on 4 January 2008 and made his debut for the team a day later, helping set up the first goal in a 2–0 victory over Rochdale, after Jamie Forrester scored from goalkeeper Sam Russell's parry of a Smith effort. He made four appearances during his stay at Lincoln, all as a substitute, which was concluded after Lincoln decided against extending his loan at the club.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Mota {{made the}} Expos out of spring {{training}} {{for the first time}} in his career. On May 12, he had a 1.59 ERA through his first 20 games of the year. However, eight earned runs allowed over his next six games raised his ERA to 4.00. Afterwards, though, he had a 2.08 ERA over his next 12 games. On June 17, he was the winning pitcher when he threw a scoreless inning in a 4–1 victory over Toronto. In his next game, on June 19, he was the losing pitcher when he gave up three runs (only one run was earned) without recording an out in a 4–1 loss to the New York Mets. However, after that 12-game stretch, he gave up five earned runs over his next four games to bring his ERA up to 4.29. On July 13, he was placed on the disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career with right shoulder <b>tendinitis.</b> Mota returned at the beginning of September, but he had a 10.57 ERA and two losses in his final 11 games of the year. He finished the season with a 1–3 record and a 5.26 ERA in 53 games.|$|E
5|$|Merckx {{looked to}} be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thévenet beat him, {{becoming}} the first French winner in seven years. Thévenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) managed to do so. In 1980, Hinault was going for a third consecutive win, but had to pull out because of <b>tendinitis,</b> and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk. Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race {{as well as the}} one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another Frenchman—Laurent Fignon—achieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.|$|E
5|$|With many clubs {{interested}} in his services, Pugh signed for fellow League Two club Shrewsbury Town on 29 May 2007 for a compensation fee. Shrewsbury manager Gary Peters revealed that he had already attempted to sign him {{earlier in the season}} as part of a swap deal when striker Glynn Hurst moved to Bury. He made his debut in a 4–0 away win over Lincoln City, setting up Andy Cooke for the third goal with a cross. He suffered an injury in November 2007 and underwent a scan, which was believed to be a cartilage problem. Days after discovering the results of the scan, which revealed he was suffering from acute <b>tendinitis,</b> he returned to training. He scored his first goal for Shrewsbury on his return in a 4–0 home victory over Dagenham & Redbridge, turning in a Marc Tierney cross in the 78th minute before assisting Tierney for Shrewsbury's final goal. He scored a further two goals that season following the arrival of Paul Simpson as manager, and finished 2007–08 with 38 appearances and 4 goals, for a Shrewsbury team that ranked 18th place in League Two.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{his strong}} finish in 2012, Kendrick entered spring {{training}} assured of {{a spot in}} the Phillies' Opening Day starting rotation {{for the first time in}} five years and spent his first full season exclusively a member of the major league starting rotation. His 2013 season took the opposite trajectory of his 2012 campaign; he held a 4–1 record with a 2.47 ERA in his first eight starts, while he posted a 6–12 record with a 5.65 ERA in his final 22 starts. Some suggested that because Kendrick is a contact pitcher (i.e., he focuses on getting outs via batters hitting the ball rather than striking out), his career-worst batting average on balls in play indicated horrendous defense was the primary reason for his downturn, not necessarily poor pitching. However, both were likely contributing factors. On September 18, he was scratched from his scheduled start due to right rotator cuff <b>tendinitis,</b> which may have contributed to his poor pitching down the stretch. It was the first time in Kendrick's career he missed a start due to injury. He had initially planned on making his next start, but the Phillies announced on September 20 that Kendrick had been shut down for the remainder of the season after receiving a second opinion on the injury. The team placed him on the disabled list for his first career stint and Zach Miner took his spot in the rotation. Overall, he posted 10–13 with a 4.70 ERA in 182 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his <b>tendinitis</b> problems that had seen him play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a slight injury scare in training the night before the final, requiring a bandage on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit enough to play in the match.|$|E
25|$|Increased risk of <b>tendinitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tendinitis</b> usually {{involves}} {{disruption of the}} tendon fibers. It is most commonly seen in the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) in a front leg—the tendon that runs {{down the back of}} the leg, closest to the surface. <b>Tendinitis</b> is uncommon in the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT) of a front leg or either the SDFT or DDFT in a hindleg.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle third}} of the SDFT {{is most likely to}} suffer from <b>tendinitis</b> for several reasons.|$|E
25|$|An {{inflamed}} bursa {{is called}} bursitis. <b>Tendinitis</b> and impingement syndrome are {{often accompanied by}} inflammation of the bursa sacs that protect the shoulder. Inflammation caused by a disease such as rheumatoid arthritis may cause rotator cuff <b>tendinitis</b> and bursitis. Sports involving overuse of the shoulder and occupations requiring frequent overhead reaching are other potential causes of irritation to the rotator cuff or bursa and may lead to inflammation and impingement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tendinitis</b> is {{inflammation}} (redness, soreness, and swelling) of a tendon. In <b>tendinitis</b> of the shoulder, the {{rotator cuff}} and/or biceps tendon become inflamed, usually {{as a result}} of being pinched by surrounding structures. The injury may vary from mild inflammation to involvement of most of the rotator cuff. When the rotator cuff tendon becomes inflamed and thickened, it may get trapped under the acromion. Squeezing of the rotator cuff is called impingement syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Poor conformation: long, sloping pasterns and a long-toe, low-heel {{shape to}} the hoof (seen {{commonly}} in Thoroughbreds) predisposes a horse to <b>tendinitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound scans are {{frequently}} used to confirm a suspected <b>tendinitis</b> or bursitis {{as well as}} rule out a tear in the rotator cuff muscles.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} calcific <b>tendinitis</b> of the {{shoulder}} high energy extracorporeal shock-wave therapy can be useful. It is not useful in other types of tendonitis.|$|E
25|$|Mesenchymal stem cells, {{derived from}} the {{affected}} horse's bone marrow or fat are currently {{being used as a}} potential therapy for SDFT <b>tendinitis</b> and other injuries.|$|E
25|$|A Gel {{containing}} DMSO, dexpanthenol, and heparin, {{is sold in}} Germany {{and eastern}} Europe (commercialized under the Dolobene brand) for topical use in sprains, <b>tendinitis,</b> and local inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Signs {{of these}} {{conditions}} include the slow onset of discomfort and pain in the upper shoulder or upper third of the arm and/or difficulty sleeping on the shoulder. <b>Tendinitis</b> and bursitis also cause pain when the arm is lifted {{away from the body}} or overhead. If <b>tendinitis</b> involves the biceps tendon (the tendon located in front of the shoulder that helps bend the elbow and turn the forearm), pain will occur in the front or side of the shoulder and may travel down to the elbow and forearm. Pain may also occur when the arm is forcefully pushed upward overhead.|$|E
25|$|Patient {{can have}} {{enthesitis}} presenting as heel pain, Achilles <b>tendinitis</b> or plantar fasciitis, along with balanitis circinata (circinate balanitis), which involves penile lesions present in roughly 20 to 40 {{percent of the}} men with the disease.|$|E
25|$|Despite Donovan's praise however on May 17, 2006 Taylor {{was quietly}} {{released}} by the Seattle Storm, just {{a little over a}} month after she signed with the team. According to a WNBA article on their website she had been slowed down by <b>tendinitis</b> in her right ankle and toes. In all, she only played in only two preseason games, one on May 7 and the other May 12, just five days before her release, averaging 7.0 points and 3.5 rebounds on a 3-point basket late in the game. She missed an exhibition finale against the Minnesota Lynx and spent several other games on the injured list because her <b>tendinitis</b> in her foot.|$|E

25|$|On August 4, Chamberlain {{injured his}} {{shoulder}} {{in a game}} against the Texas Rangers and was placed on the 15-day disabled list with rotator cuff <b>tendinitis.</b> Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman later acknowledged that this injury had a lasting effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} used: horses {{with moderate}} or severe <b>tendinitis</b> {{have a better}} prognosis if managed conservatively (rested, brought back to work slowly), with about 50-60 percent returning to training.
