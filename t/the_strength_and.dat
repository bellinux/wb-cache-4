5|$|Despite {{his father}} {{saying he was}} betrayed by his friend C. W. McAllister during their climb on the mountain, Homer accepts and is aided by two Sherpas, but fires them after waking up one night to find them {{secretly}} dragging him up. Realizing he lacks <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> resources to reach the top, Homer enters a cave to find McAllister's frozen body and evidence proving it was Abraham who betrayed him. Tired and ashamed, Homer sticks his flag pole on the ledge. The ensuing crack collapses {{the rest of the}} mountain, making where he is on now the peak. Proud, he uses McAllister's body to sled down, where he is greeted by the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} knowledge on 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood there to be five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders was not surprised by <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E

5|$|In January 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the Secretary of State position, which Sherman, {{facing a}} {{difficult}} reelection campaign in 1898, quickly accepted. His appointment was swiftly confirmed when Congress convened that March. The appointment {{was seen as}} a good one, but many in Washington soon began to question whether Sherman, at age 73, still had <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> intellectual vigor to handle the job; rumors circulated to that effect, but McKinley did not believe them. Asked for advice on the inaugural address, Sherman offered a draft threatening intervention in Cuba, then in rebellion against Spain; the suggestion was ignored.|$|E

5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost.

5|$|On Athas, {{the planet}} of the Dark Sun {{campaign}} setting, dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200lbs.

Athasian dwarves do not live underground, but some communities focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no hair at all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offsprings that share <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> resiliency of dwarves with the size of humans.|$|E
5|$|The Nimitz-class {{aircraft}} carriers {{were ordered to}} supplement the {{aircraft carriers}} of the Kitty Hawk class and Enterprise class, maintaining <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> capability of the U.S. Navy after the older carriers were decommissioned. The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. aircraft carriers, in particular the Enterprise and Forrestal-class supercarriers, although {{the arrangement of the}} ships is relatively {{similar to that of the}} Kitty Hawk class. Among other design improvements, the two reactors on Nimitz-class carriers take up less space than the eight reactors used on Enterprise. Along with a more generally improved design, this means that Nimitz-class carriers can carry 90% more aviation fuel and 50% more ordnance when compared to the Forrestal class.|$|E

5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, equines, both horses and onagers, were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a yoke around their necks {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E

The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{science of}} stellar {{spectroscopy}} was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of {{stars such as}} Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in a stellar spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the stellar classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E

5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E

According to Richard Bulliet, {{they can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.|$|E

Examples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a Penning trap and positron plasmas.|$|E
