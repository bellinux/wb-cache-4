40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{and other}} system apparatus {{are the most}} valuable and essential equipment in the transmission of electrical energy. The protection of such equipment against transient overvoltages resulting from lightning and other causes is of an important consideration in power system design. This paper presents an analysis using EMTP software on a segment of a power system consisting of a 100 km, 345 kV transmission line terminated at a substation transformer 345 / 115 kV through a cable. This study is {{used to determine the}} optimum cable size and length that may attenuate and distort overvoltage waveshapes due to a lightning surge on a transmission line. A base EMTP case for the power system under study is evaluated without the presence of a <b>terminated</b> <b>cable,</b> and later used with different scenario...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first half}} of the series focuses on Alex Murphy's former partner, John T. Cable, who is slain by RoboCop after his system is hacked to program him to <b>terminate</b> <b>Cable.</b> Cable is then resurrected as a cyborg in most aspects {{identical}} to the RoboCop model, save for color and the addition of a second sidearm. [...] "RoboCable" [...] is sent to destroy RoboCop, but after several battles, Cable is convinced to ally with Murphy. Meanwhile, OCP (on the verge of bankruptcy) is taken over by a scheming executive, Damian Lowe, who manages to murder the entire board of directors. To bring OCP back, he plans to use an artificial intelligence called SAINT to automate the entire city.|$|R
50|$|The BNC (Bayonet Neill Concelman) {{connector}} is a {{very common}} type of RF connector used for <b>terminating</b> coaxial <b>cable.</b>|$|R
50|$|When used to <b>terminate</b> <b>cables,</b> in some {{applications}} {{both ends}} of the <b>cable</b> are <b>terminated</b> using identical connectors (generally male), as in registered jack telephone cables or Ethernet over twisted pair network cables, while in other applications the two ends are terminated differently, either with male and female of the same connector (as in an extension cord), which ends can be connected to each other in a loop, or with incompatible connectors, in an adapter cable.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1990s, <b>terminating</b> {{fiber optic}} <b>cables</b> was labor-intensive. The number of parts per connector, {{polishing}} of the fibers, {{and the need}} to oven-bake the epoxy in each connector made <b>terminating</b> fiber optic <b>cables</b> difficult. Today, many connectors types are on the market that offer easier, less labor-intensive ways of <b>terminating</b> <b>cables.</b> Some of the most popular connectors are pre-polished at the factory, and include a gel inside the connector. Those two steps help save money on labor, especially on large projects. A cleave is made at a required length, to get as close to the polished piece already inside the connector. The gel surrounds the point where the two pieces meet inside the connector for very little light loss. [...] Long term performance of the gel is a design consideration, so for the most demanding installations, factory pre-polished pigtails of sufficient length to reach the first fusion splice enclosure is normally the safest approach that minimizes on-site labor.|$|R
2500|$|RGB is {{also the}} term {{referring}} to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry. [...] It consists of three signals—red, green, and blue—carried on three separate cables/pins. RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS-170 and RS-343 standards for monochrome video. This type of video signal is widely used in Europe {{since it is the}} best quality signal that can be carried on the standard SCART connector. This signal is known as RGBS (4 BNC/RCA <b>terminated</b> <b>cables</b> exist as well), but it is directly compatible [...] with RGBHV used for computer monitors (usually carried on 15-pin <b>cables</b> <b>terminated</b> with 15-pin D-sub or 5 BNC connectors), [...] which carries separate horizontal and vertical sync signals.|$|R
2500|$|Affected {{areas are}} likely to be without {{electrical}} [...] power for an extensive period. This in turn can make fuel supplies for vehicles and emergency generators unavailable locally and impact both domestic water, industrial water, sewage plants, and drainage pumping. Due to the extensive use of point of sale scanners and registers in supermarkets this could also impact the ability of stores to sell essential items such as groceries and to preserve frozen food items, as well as <b>terminating</b> <b>cable</b> TV and most internet access.|$|R
50|$|The 110 style IDC {{connection}} {{is often used}} {{at both ends of}} Category 5 cable runs through buildings, as shown in the image. In switch rooms, 110 blocks are often built into the back of patch panels to <b>terminate</b> <b>cable</b> runs. At the other end, 110 connections may be used with keystone modules that are attached to wall plates. 110 blocks are preferred over 66 blocks in high-speed networks because they introduce less crosstalk and many are certified for use in Category 5, Category 6 and Category 6a wiring systems.|$|R

50|$|The {{connector}} {{contains two}} parallel rows of contacts within a shielded case having a characteristic D-shape {{similar to that}} used in D-subminiature connectors. The contacts are not pins, but small flat bands of metal, called ribbon contacts. The connectors are manufactured in many capacities, including 14-, 24-, 36-, 50-, 64-, and 100- pin varieties. They may be mounted on boards, panels, or may <b>terminate</b> <b>cables.</b> Wires are attached by means of solder, crimping or insulation displacement. Female connectors have bail locks for a sturdy connection to the male connector. Screws may also be employed to secure connections.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} the current distribution in Cable-In-Conduit Conductors (CICC's) experiencing linearly ramping transport currents and transverse magnetic fields was conducted for both infinitely long, periodic cables and finite length <b>cables</b> <b>terminated</b> in low resistance joints. The goal {{of the study was}} to gain insight into the phenomenon known as Ramp Rate Limitation, an as yet unexplained correspondence between maximum attainable current and the ramp time taken to reach that current in CICC superconducting magnets. A discrete geometric model of a 27 strand multiply twisted CICC was developed to effectively represent the flux linkages, mutual inductances, and resistive contact points between the strands of an experimentally tested cable. The results of the numerical study showed that for fully periodic cables, the current imbalances due to ramping magnetic fields and ramping transport currents are negligible in the range of experimentally explored operating conditions.

50|$|Generally, {{serial port}} {{connectors}} are gendered, only allowing connectors {{to mate with}} a connector of the opposite gender.

50|$|For example, the Main Distribution Frame (MDF) {{located at}} a {{telephone}} central office <b>terminates</b> the <b>cables</b> leading to subscribers on the one hand, and cables leading to active equipment (such as DSLAMs and telephone switches) on the other.

50|$|The C {{connector}} {{is a type}} of RF connector {{used for}} <b>terminating</b> coaxial <b>cable.</b> The connector uses two-stud bayonet-type locks.
