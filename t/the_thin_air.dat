5|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were unable}} to start a fire using {{friction}} due to <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to tend the many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to give some protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{response}} to the P-47 praised its dive speed and high-altitude performance, while criticizing its turning performance and rate of climb (particularly at low-to-medium altitudes). The turbosupercharger in the P-47 gave the powerplant its maximum power at 27,000ft (8,230m), and in <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> above 30,000ft (9,144m), the Thunderbolt remained comparatively fast and nimble relative to other aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, sprint athletes {{perform better}} at high altitudes because of <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>air,</b> which {{provides}} less air resistance. In theory, <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the partial pressure of oxygen being lower), but {{this difference is}} negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash {{is already in the}} muscles and bloodstream when the race starts. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000 m above sea level are marked with an [...] "A." ...|$|R
50|$|Qualifying for the Mexican Grand Prix saw few surprises. The turbo powered {{cars were}} {{expected}} to dominate in the high (2240 m) altitude of Mexico City where the naturally aspirated cars would lose approximately 20-25% of their power in <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
50|$|By comparison, {{the summit}} of Mt. Everest is at 8848 m;commercial airliners {{typically}} cruise between 10 km and 13 km where <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach 30.4 km and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0 km.|$|R
2500|$|Life jackets for {{outfitting}} large commercial transport {{ventures in}} potentially dangerous waters, such as coastal cruises, offshore passages, and overwater air flights, consisting of either a single air chamber or {{a pair of}} (twin or double) sealed air chambers constructed of coated nylon (sometimes with a protective outer encasing of heavier, tougher material such as vinyl), joined together. For use aboard ships they may be constructed of foam. [...] Twin air chambers provide for redundancy {{in the event of}} one of the air chambers leaking or failing to [...] "fire", for example if <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> cell fabric is sliced open by sharp metal fragments during emergency evacuation and egress. Most life jackets for leisure use are of the single air chamber type.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922 Mallory {{returned}} to the Himalayas {{as part of the}} party led by Brigadier-General Charles Bruce and climbing leader Edward Strutt, with a view to making a serious attempt on the summit. Eschewing their bottled oxygen, which was at the time seen as going against the spirit of mountaineering, Mallory, along with Howard Somervell and Edward Norton almost reached the crest of the North-East Ridge. Despite being hampered and slowed by <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> <b>air,</b> they achieved a record altitude of [...] before weather conditions and the late hour forced them to retreat. A second party led by George Finch reached an elevation of approximately [...] using bottled oxygen both for climbing and—a first—for sleeping. The party climbed at record speeds, a fact that Mallory seized upon during the next expedition.|$|E
2500|$|Variations in {{hemoglobin}} {{amino acid}} sequences, {{as with other}} proteins, may be adaptive. For example, hemoglobin {{has been found to}} adapt in different ways to high altitudes. Organisms living at high elevations experience lower partial pressures of oxygen compared to those at sea level. This presents a challenge to the organisms that inhabit such environments because hemoglobin, which normally binds oxygen at high partial pressures of oxygen, must be able to bind oxygen when it is present at a lower pressure. Different organisms have adapted to such a challenge. For example, recent studies have suggested genetic variants in deer mice that help explain how deer mice that live in the mountains are able to survive in <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> <b>air</b> that accompanies high altitudes. A researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found mutations in four different genes that can account for differences between deer mice that live in lowland prairies versus the mountains. After examining wild mice captured from both highlands and lowlands, it was found that: the genes of the two breeds are [...] "virtually identical–except for those that govern the oxygen-carrying capacity of their hemoglobin". [...] "The genetic difference enables highland mice to make more efficient use of their oxygen", since less is available at higher altitudes, such as those in the mountains. Mammoth hemoglobin featured mutations that allowed for oxygen delivery at lower temperatures, thus enabling mammoths to migrate to higher latitudes during the Pleistocene. This was also found in hummingbirds that inhabit the Andes. Hummingbirds already expend a lot of energy and thus have high oxygen demands and yet Andean hummingbirds have been found to thrive in high altitudes. Non-synonymous mutations in the hemoglobin gene of multiple species living at high elevations (Oreotrochilus, A. castelnaudii, C. violifer, P. gigas, and A. viridicuada) have caused the protein to have less of an affinity for inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), a molecule found in birds that has a similar role as 2,3-BPG in humans; this results in the ability to bind oxygen in lower partial pressures.|$|E

50|$|Insects can fly and kite at {{very high}} altitude. In 2008, a colony of bumble bees was {{discovered}} on Mount Everest at more than 5,600 m above sea level, the highest known altitude for an insect.

50|$|More recently, {{attempts}} {{have moved to}} high-altitude locations, such as Mexico City, where <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> results in lower aerodynamic drag, which more than offsets the added difficulty of breathing.

50|$|The sixth All-Africa Games {{were held}} in September 1995 in Harare, Zimbabwe.

60|$|In his {{explanation}} I recognized {{a trick of}} gearing that Kantos Kan had taught me that time we sailed under false names in the navy of Zodanga beneath Sab Than, the Prince.

60|$|That is to say, {{there we}} stopped--on the summit, in fair {{view of the}} Jungfrau, a wall of rock crowned with fields of eternal snow, whose {{dazzling}} brightness almost put my eyes out.

50|$|There {{are several}} ways to reduce energy usage in air transportation, from {{modifications}} to the planes themselves, to how air traffic is managed. As in cars, turbochargers are an effective way to reduce energy consumption; however, instead of allowing for the use of a smaller-displacement engine, turbochargers in jet turbines operate by compressing <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> at higher altitudes. This allows the engine to operate as if it were at sea-level pressures while taking advantage of the reduced drag on the aircraft at higher altitudes.|$|R
50|$|The track {{has several}} quirks {{that make it}} unique within the NHRA's {{schedule}} of events. First, and foremost, is the altitude. At over 5,000 feet above sea-level, <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is much <b>thinner</b> than any of its sea-level counterparts, which translates out to less air being pushed over the rear wings, {{and a loss of}} downforce, <b>the</b> <b>thinner</b> <b>air</b> also slows <b>the</b> cars down dramatically, a 330 mph run on any other track would barely top 320 at Bandimere, while a sub-4 second run would be over the 4 second mark.|$|R
25|$|Increased {{water intake}} {{may also help}} in {{acclimatization}} to replace the fluids lost through heavier breathing in <b>the</b> <b>thin,</b> dry <b>air</b> found at altitude, although consuming excessive quantities ("over-hydration") has no benefits and may cause dangerous hyponatremia.|$|R
