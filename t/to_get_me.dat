Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet her, and I just want her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

When he commented to a local on the [...] "gloomy atmosphere" [...] of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when {{at the start of}} the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, [...] "I know what you're digging for. You're trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> to talk about that massacre." [...] Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother.

500|$|The big {{sound film}} sensations {{of the year}} all took {{advantage}} of preexisting celebrity. On May 20, 1927, at New York's Roxy Theater, Fox Movietone presented a sound film of the takeoff of Charles Lindbergh's celebrated flight to Paris, recorded earlier that day. In June, a Fox sound newsreel depicting his return welcomes in New York and Washington, D.C., was shown. These were the two most acclaimed sound motion pictures to date. In May, as well, Fox had released the first Hollywood fiction film with synchronized dialogue: the short They're Coming <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Me,</b> starring comedian Chic Sale. After rereleasing a few silent feature hits, such as Seventh Heaven, with recorded music, Fox came out with its first original Movietone feature on September 23: Sunrise, by acclaimed German director F. W. Murnau. As with Don Juan, the film's soundtrack consisted of a musical score and sound effects (including, {{in a couple of}} crowd scenes, [...] "wild", nonspecific vocals).|$|E
500|$|Though Townsend {{was proud}} {{of what he had}} {{accomplished}} so early in his career, he was discouraged by his experience with the music industry. [...] "I was becoming a product of somebody else's imagination, and it was mixing with my own personality," [...] he later reflected. [...] "This combination was appalling." [...] He pushed to get his own projects off the ground. Despite getting notable touring gigs with other musicians, however, Townsend continued to face rejection of his own music. Relativity Records dropped Noisescapes from their label shortly after Townsend accepted Vai's offer, seeing no commercial appeal in Townsend's music. [...] "I have a hunch they only offered me a deal <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> to sing with Steve," [...] he mused. While touring with the Wildhearts, Townsend {{received a phone call from}} an A representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as [...] "just noise".|$|E

500|$|At an August {{debate in}} Owensboro, Farmer {{proposed}} the cross-promotion of Kentucky agricultural products {{and the state}} park system, awarding points for buying Kentucky produced groceries that could be redeemed for souvenirs and perks during stays at state parks. On October 21, The Kentucky Post gave Baesler its endorsement, contrasting her experience running a farm and her involvement with the agriculture department to Farmer's lack of agriculture experience and frequent absence at campaign events. Later that week, the Lexington Herald-Leader also endorsed Baesler, and followed {{up the next day}} with an article noting that, as of October 3, nearly one-third of the $87,825.20 Farmer had spent during the campaign went to relatives [...] including his parents, brother, sister, and in-laws [...] for salaries and campaign-related reimbursements. Interviewed by phone, Farmer responded, [...] " [...] probably worked 60, 70, 80 hours a week campaigning for me trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> elected. I don't think we have done anything wrong." [...] Richard Beliles, chairman of campaign finance watchdog Common Cause of Kentucky, said Farmer's actions were not illegal but were [...] "rather odd". Farmer overcame the bad press, however, to take the election by a vote of 575,049 to 466,321.|$|E

Kyle Richards and Vanderpump also accompany Gaga on a different sequence in the video, showing the trio taking revenge against a corporation. Vanderpump explained that they were contacted by Andy Cohen—who himself has a cameo appearance in [...] "G.U.Y."—from Bravo and were signed for side-roles in the video. Richards noticed that Gaga was a perfectionist on the set, with Vanderpump saying that the singer took charge of {{every detail of the}} production. They explained to The Hollywood Reporter that Gaga wanted the housewives to [...] "feel and look beautiful and fierce" [...] and during one of the homicide scenes she explained: [...] "I want you to whip that ponytail even more.

Rolling Stone stated that Shelton and Stefani [...] " [...] gush about their relationship in the press too much, as they [...] to keep some semblance of privacy. Instead, they wrote a song about it."

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed, finding Shelton [...] "embracing his {{new lease on life}} with renewed vigor and a new a love", who Erlewine later claimed was Stefani. The lyrics of the recording delve on Stefani's insecurities in a relationship that [...] "will likely have its shares of ups and downs": [...] "I'm so scared, I don't know what to do". Additionally, she explains in the lyrics how the two artists met: [...] "I never ever meant to get so into you / Thought I was using you just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> through" [...] and [...] "You know I'm broken, I don't trust anymore / Last thing I needed was to fall in love".|$|E

Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. [...] "They are going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> this time," [...] he yelled, sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E

[...] They are looking for a goat and just now Johnnie is cast in that role. [...] Regardless of his past record, those who demand victory at any price and by any means whatsoever, are insisting that he be fired forthwith and a man be placed in the position who, by fair means or foul, will gather in a team that will win victories and never lose a game." [...] Ultimately, Maulbetsch resigned at the end of May 1929 as Oklahoma A's coach in football, baseball, and basketball. [...] It was announced that he would spend the remaining year of his contract on a leave of absence at half pay.|$|E
500|$|While Hurley {{had been}} able to command Friday's respect, {{it soon became clear that}} Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday {{appeared}} one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. [...] "He still called me boss", Hurley recalled. [...] "I can't play for that little bastard", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. [...] "You're the one who seems to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> right. Can I come back to you?" [...] Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, [...] "Tickets, please!", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. A player standing near the forward started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.|$|E

500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{deciding}} Game 7 of the 2015 Finals {{was scheduled}} to be played at 7:00 PM on April 30, 2015 at the WFCU Centre in Windsor, Ontario. The Express shootaround was set to take place before that of the Rainmen. The road team was supposed to arrive for warm-ups at approximately 1:00 PM, but entered the stadium approximately two hours earlier. Express assistant coach Gerry Brumpton recounted, [...] "They snuck in here before they even had the light on. We were here in the dark, I opened up the curtain and I looked in and there they were. They were still here working out. So they had been here for a while." [...] The Express told their opponents to leave the arena, but they refused, with one Rainmen player dunking a basketball instead. Windsor's Bill Jones then attempted to take a ball from Halifax center Liam McMorrow, but the player [...] "flinched," [...] pretending to throw a punch. According to Rainmen player Forrest Fisher, Jones tackled McMorrow to the ground and Express guard Tony Bennett followed up by hitting McMorrow with a chair. Referring to the Rainmen, Jones said, [...] "A couple of them kicked me and tried to take swings at me. And my players were there and they came to my rescue to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> up." [...] Soon the violence escalated, with staff members and players from both teams involved. At around 10:40 AM, Windsor police received a phone call [...] "that between 15 to 20 men were involved in an altercation." [...] By the time they arrived at the WFCU Centre, however, the fighting was over and the Rainmen players had already reached their team bus.|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever you have to do <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You had {{to see some of the}} things my teammates did <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E
