5|$|Most of the {{characters}} are fully aware of Veridian's nature, and often try to manipulate the system {{in order to stop}} bad <b>things</b> <b>from</b> happening to them (and sometimes to mitigate the evil effects of some of Veridian's projects). They are also all susceptible to the potential rewards the company can offer despite the consequences of their actions, such as the company's attempt to hire Lem's mother, or the company's introduction of scented light bulbs with known flaws. Much of the comedy of the show comes from {{the characters}}' navigation of these morally ambiguous areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} fell briefly under British rule {{during the}} British invasions of the Río de la Plata. There was looting after the failed resistance, and Alberti hid all the valuable <b>things</b> <b>from</b> the half-built parish. In {{defiance of the}} new British rule, Alberti gave medical aid to the Spanish soldiers and Catholic burials to the deceased, and mailed the Spanish forces with details about the British troops located in the city. As a result, he was jailed. He was released by the British Juan Jaime Backhouse in order to restore religious practices (the invaders {{did not attempt to}} enforce Protestantism in the population), but under military escort. The British would be defeated by Santiago de Liniers, and driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E
5|$|Robert Dudley was {{a pioneer}} of new industries; {{interested}} in many <b>things</b> <b>from</b> tapestries to mining, he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history. The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor. On a personal level, he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis. Due to his interests in trade and exploration, {{as well as his}} debts, his contacts with the London city fathers were intense. He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers. English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester. This he did in the manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making). He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage. Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the Galleon Leicester, which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton, but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António, the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.|$|E

5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw <b>things</b> <b>from</b> a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the first}} series to feature Matt Smith as the {{eleventh}} incarnation of the Doctor, an alien Time Lord who travels through time and space in his TARDIS, {{which appears to be}} a British police box on the outside. Karen Gillan is also introduced as the Doctor's new companion Amy Pond, with her fiancé Rory Williams portrayed by Arthur Darvill, who is in seven episodes, and travels with the Doctor and Amy and is also a regular in the next series. Alex Kingston returns as River Song, a mysterious woman from the Doctor's future who summons the Doctor twice in this series. The main story arc concerns a pattern of cracks in the universe which appear over several episodes, sometimes going unnoticed by the characters. It is discovered that they have the power to erase <b>things</b> <b>from</b> existence, and this happens to Rory, causing Amy to forget him. In the series finale it is revealed that the cracks were caused by the TARDIS exploding and the Doctor is forced to reboot the universe to the state which it was in without the cracks.|$|E
25|$|The state name {{is simply}} México {{according}} to the 1917 Constitution of the United Mexican States, but to distinguish it from both {{the city and the}} country it is most often called Estado de México.

25|$|The {{change of}} regime in 1989 {{brought a new}} situation, and bands now revolted against {{corruption}} and the Americanization of the country. They felt that the new system retained the bad <b>things</b> <b>from</b> the previous one, but lacked that good things that many expected. In lyrics, they often mention the newly appearing organized crime, and the still low standard of living.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the series, Tyler {{frequently}} hears {{and sees}} <b>things</b> <b>from</b> {{his life in}} 2006. While in 1973, Tyler often sees images from the present day on his television, hears loved ones and medical staff talk about him and to him through phones and portable radios, along with being stalked by Test Card Girl (Rafaella Hutchinson & Harriet Rogers) and experiencing recurring hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|Barrie {{was very}} perspicacious in noticing {{many aspects of}} children's mental {{development}} decades before they were studied by cognitive psychologists. In particular, Peter lacks the mental capacity for secondary mental representation and cannot recollect the past, anticipate the future, consider two things at once or see <b>things</b> <b>from</b> another person's point of view. He is therefore amnesic, inconsequential, impulsive and callous.|$|E

25|$|The Oz {{portrayed in}} the book is very close to Baum's Oz, {{although}} Heinlein does make an attempt to explain some <b>things</b> <b>from</b> the standpoint of a science fiction author. He explains that Oz is on a retrograde planet, where the direction of rotation relative to the poles is reversed, resulting in the sun seeming to rise in what would normally be the west.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} in Shankar was examined {{in detail in}} an article by Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan.
