2500|$|The call data (known as Intercept Related Information or IRI in Europe and Call Data or CD in the US) {{consists}} {{of information about}} the targeted communications, including destination of a voice call (e.g., called party’s telephone number), source of a call (caller’s phone number), <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> duration, etc. [...] Call content is namely the stream of data carrying the call. [...] Included in the architecture is the lawful interception management function, which covers interception session set-up and tear down, scheduling, target identification, etc. [...] Communications between the network operator and LEA are via the Handover Interfaces (designated HI). [...] Communications data and content are typically delivered from the network operator to the LEA in an encrypted format over an IP-based VPN. [...] The interception of traditional voice calls still often relies on the establishment of an ISDN channel that is set up {{at the time of the}} interception.|$|E

50|$|Mlaika, {{a ten-year-old}} {{adolescent}} female African elephant, {{has been recorded}} imitating truck sounds coming from the Nairobi-Mombasa highway three miles away. Analysis of Mlaika's truck-like calls {{show that they are}} different from <b>the</b> normal <b>calls</b> <b>of</b> African elephants, and that her calls are a general model of truck sounds, not copies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sounds <b>of</b> trucks recorded at <b>the</b> same <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls.</b> In other words, Mlaika's truck calls are not imitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trucks that she hears, but rather, a generalized model she developed over time.|$|R

40|$|Future {{wireless}} {{mobile multimedia}} networks {{are likely to}} adopt micro/pico cellular architectures. A consequence of using small cell sizes is <b>the</b> increased rate <b>of</b> <b>call</b> handoffs as mobile terminals move between cells during <b>the</b> holding <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls.</b> In a network supporting multimedia services, <b>the</b> increased rate <b>of</b> <b>call</b> handoffs makes {{it very difficult for}} the network to guarantee <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> service (QoS) promised to a call at setup. This paper describes a handoff priority scheme which reduces <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>call</b> handoff failures in such a mobile multimedia network. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> this admission control policy on packet level performance is studied analytically for a homogeneous network supporting a mix of wideband and narrowband call...|$|R

50|$|In Brazil, collect {{calls are}} automated. The phone number {{to be called}} is prefixed with a special code. Then, as the person being called answers the telephone, he/she listens to a short {{standard}} recording informing him/her {{that it is a}} collect call. Next, the call is established and the caller is supposed to say his/her name and location within the next six seconds. If the person being called hangs up within those six initial seconds, nothing is charged. Otherwise, the remaining <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is charged to the recipient's phone line.|$|E

40|$|Since <b>the</b> early <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patriarch Abraham, <b>the</b> land <b>of</b> Israel {{had a very}} {{important}} place in the Old Testament.

Others regard this approach as spiritualising and stress <b>the</b> sociological importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> land in <b>the</b> Old and New Testament. Some interpreters even advocate a theology of ecology. This article points out <b>the</b> important place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal factor with regard to land in the Old Testament and attempts to indicate how this line of thought also pervades the New Testament. It is only when this factor is borne in mind, that the theologian and preacher can see <b>the</b> different aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> land in their true relation to each other...|$|R

5000|$|Thus, {{the issuer}} has an option which it pays for by {{offering}} a higher coupon rate. If interest rates in the market have gone down by the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> date, the issuer {{will be able to}} refinance its debt at a cheaper level and so will be incentivized to call the bonds it originally issued. [...] Another way to look at this interplay is that, as interest rates go down, the price of the bonds go up; therefore, it is advantageous to buy the bonds back at par value.|$|E
50|$|In {{this case}} the BBOA1REG API is used to {{register}} into the WebSphere Application Server for z/OS Daemon group (the cell short name), and multiple invocations of BBOA1INV are used to invoke the target EJB. BBOA1INV is synchronous so program control is held until the EJB returns a response. This API is useful when the calling program knows {{the size of the}} response message in advance. If the response message size is unknown at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> then the more primitive APIs (BBOA1SRQ (send request), BBOA1RCL (get response length), BBOA1GET (get message data)) would be more appropriate.|$|E

50|$|Watson {{returned}} {{to the states to}} revive his NBA career, participated in 2007 NBA summer league with the Spurs and later joined Charlotte Bobcats training camp. However, he once again failed to make the roster for the season. On November 1, 2007, he joined NBA D-League and was drafted 5th overall by the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. He averaged 26.4 points, 5.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.38 steals in 38.1 minutes per game for the Vipers before signed by Golden State Warriors on January 8, 2008.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a retrial {{queueing}} system with {{a finite number of}} homogeneous sources of calls and a single non-reliable server, which means that the server is subject to random breakdowns depending on whether it is busy or idle. <b>The</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> server may block or unblock the systems’s operations and <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interrupted request may be resumed or <b>the</b> <b>call</b> can be transmitted to the orbit.

His conviction and sentencing was deeply unpopular with the Yemeni populace. On February 2, 2011, President Obama called then-Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to discuss counterterrorism cooperation and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. At the end of the call, according to a White House read-out, Obama “expressed concern” over the release of Shaye.

40|$|The {{lognormal}} distribution {{has a very}} long history and is almost as important as its sister distributions, the normal and the binomial. It is commonly used to model continuous positive quantities in several fields. Our particular interest in the {{lognormal distribution}} comes from a cross-disciplinary call center project. One specific characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> center data is that <b>the</b> service <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> are lognormally distributed. <b>The</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service <b>times</b> is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key inputs for understanding and modelling call center operations. It {{can be used to}} derive system workload and delay, and ultimately to set staffing levels for call centers. Motivated from the project, we look at statistical inference for problems involving lognormal distributions. Techniques for providing point estimates and confidence intervals for a lognormal mean are studied. New methodologies are developed and compared with existing procedures. A new methodology based on local polynomial regression is then proposed to carry out nonparametric regression and provide corresponding confidence bands when the errors are lognormally distributed. A cross-validation type data-driven bandwidth selection procedure is also proposed to select the bandwidths needed. The developed methodologies then are applied to <b>the</b> <b>call</b> center data. ...|$|R
