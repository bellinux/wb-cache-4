40|$|The paper explores {{various aspects}} of {{populism}} focusing on the Bulgarian case study since 1989 with reference to its empirical manifestations, the legitimacy crisis and political culture traits. The text focuses on parliamentary represented parties and reconstructs the evolution of populism from an ephemeral phenomenon to {{an integral part of}} the political system. Particular attention is being paid to the year 2001, when the king's return unleashed the populist moment opening up the space for the massive influx of populist parties. The paper advocates the thesis that, with the exception of Ataka, populist parties generally remain within the limits set by constitutional democracy, yet at the same time, by reducing complexity <b>to</b> <b>trivialized</b> solutions they only aggravate the legitimacy crisis instead of overcoming it...|$|R

In Calgary's first round playoff {{series against the}} Vancouver Canucks, Ferland's physical play quickly made him a fan favourite in Calgary.

[...] His performance with the Flames earned Ferland a two-year, $1.65 million contract extension.|$|E

40|$|In {{the thesis}} {{we present a}} new method for parametrizing {{algebraic}} varieties over the field of characteristic zero. The problem of parametrizing is reduced to a problem of finding an isomorphism of algebras. We introduce the Lie algebra of a variety as a Lie algebra related to its group of automorphisms. Constructing an isomorphism of this one and some classical Lie algebra (for example the algebra of matrices of the zero trace) then leads to parametrizing the variety. The problem of finding an isomorphism of Lie algebras is further reduced <b>to</b> <b>trivializing</b> an associative algebra, which means finding an isomorphism of the algebra and a full matrix algebra. The last is a classical problem in number theory, when regarded over algebraically non-closed fields. We give algorithms for trivializing algebras of degrees up to 4 over number fields. In our work we used the method to parametrize Del Pezzo surfaces of degrees 8 and 9 over number fields. The algorithms are implemented for {{the case of the}} field of the rationals.

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{marriage}} {{in relation to}} women makes it an institution that some critics argue cannot {{and should not be}} accepted in the 21st century; to do so would mean <b>to</b> <b>trivialize</b> the abuses it was responsible for. Some critics argue {{that it is impossible to}} dissociate marriage from its past. Clare Chambers argues that:"(...) it is impossible to escape the history of the institution. Its status as a tradition ties its current meaning to its past". Past abuses of marriage are sometimes depicted in documentaries. A documentary in Ireland presented the story of elderly women who described their experiences with repeated acts of rape in marriage and the children born from these rapes, [...] during the time when marital rape was not criminalized, contraception, abortion and divorce were all illegal, and the marriage bar restricting married women's employment outside home was in force. Marital rape in Ireland was made illegal in 1990, and divorce was legalized in 1996.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{settled down}} {{somewhat}} {{in the following}} two games as Calgary won Game 4 by a 3–1 score before the Canucks, facing elimination, responded with a 2–1 victory on their home ice in Game 5. As the series progressed, Flames' rookie Micheal Ferland {{became one of the}} most popular players on the team as a result of his physical play, and his battles with Canucks defenceman Kevin Bieksa in particular. Bieksa attempted <b>to</b> <b>trivialize</b> Ferland's impact by calling him [...] "irrelevant." [...] Ferland had a significant impact on the sixth game of the series, in Calgary, however. After the Canucks stormed out to a 3–0 lead less than ten minutes into the game, Ferland started a Flames comeback by converting a pass from Matt Stajan late in the period. Calgary's top line of Monahan, Gaudreau and Hudler then combined for four goals and ten points as the Flames stormed back to tie the game twice before Matt Stajan scored the eventual series-winning goal in a 7–4 Flames victory. Ferland ended the scoring with an empty net goal with three seconds to play. The series victory was the first for the Flames since 2004 and set up a second round match-up with the Anaheim Ducks.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the volume}} focuses on the Holocaust, Holocaust denial, and Romania's responsibility, {{discussing}} them in relation with Stéphane Courtois' Black Book of Communism. Like Alan S. Rosembaum's Is the Holocaust Unique?, Încet spre Europa uses the polemical term [...] "comparative martyrology" [...] on comparisons made between the Holocaust and the Gulag (or other forms of communist repression). Although he agrees that communism is innately genocidal, Tismăneanu views the latter claims as attempts <b>to</b> <b>trivialize</b> the Holocaust. He also criticizes some versions of historical revisionism which, he argues, {{make it seem like}} the victims of communism were all [...] "friends of democracy" [...] and [...] "adherents to classical liberalism", but agrees that: [...] "The manner in which communism dealt with [...] is utterly illegal and this needs to be emphasized." [...] Tismăneanu, who theorizes a [...] "very complicated, bizarre, perverse, and well-camouflaged" [...] relationship between communism and fascism, preserved in both national communism and the political discourse of post-communist Romania, also argues: [...] "Romania will not un-fascify until it decommunizes, and will decommunize until it un-fascifies." [...] Such conclusions were also present in the Spectrele Europei Centrale ("The Specters of Central Europe", 2001), where he notably argues that the popularity of fascist ideology within the defunct Kingdom of Romania was exploited by the communist regime, leading to what he calls a [...] "baroque synthesis" [...] of extremes (an idea later expanded upon by essayist Caius Dobrescu).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to Thrun and others, {{personal}} service robots need increasingly more autonomy {{in order to}} function in the highly unpredictable company of humans. At the same time, the cognitive processes in artifacts will become increasingly alien to us. This has several reasons: 1. Maturana’s concept of structural determinism questions conventional forms of interaction. 2. Considerably different ways of embodiment result in incompatible referential frameworks (worldviews). 3. Engineers focus on the output of artifacts, whereas autonomous cognitive systems seek to control their input state. As a result, instructional interaction – the basic ingredient of conventional man–machine relationships – with genuine autonomous systems will become impossible. Therefore the increase of autonomy will eventually lead to a paradox. Today {{we are still in}} a position <b>to</b> anthropomorphically <b>trivialize</b> the behavioral pattern of current robots (von Foerster). Eventually, however, when self-organizing systems will have reached the high levels of autonomy we wished for interacting with them may become impossible since their goals will be completely independent of ours...|$|R
