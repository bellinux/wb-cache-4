5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used <b>to</b> <b>park</b> disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E

The continuation south via Saugus and the Newhall Tunnel towards Los Angeles, also part of Route 4, was added to the state highway system in 1917.|$|E

Construction began in 2013 with a scheduled opening date of May 1, 2014; however, the opening was delayed due to mechanical and technical issues. Following a preview opening <b>to</b> <b>park</b> employees in early August and a soft opening on August 16, 2014, Falcon's Fury officially {{opened to the public}} on September 2, 2014. Public response to the ride has been positive, praising the height of the tower and the drop experience.|$|E
5|$|The street {{became popular}} with entertainers {{including}} bear-baiters, theatres and public houses. However, {{it was not}} attractive to {{the middle and upper}} classes due to the nearby Tyburn gallows and St Giles, then a notorious rookery, or slum. The gallows were removed in 1783, {{and by the end of}} the century, Oxford Street was built up from St Giles Circus <b>to</b> <b>Park</b> Lane, containing a mix of residential houses and entertainment. The Princess's Theatre opened in 1840, and is now the site of Oxford Walk shopping area.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{create a}} visual {{impact in the}} same way as do other {{landscape}} features and give a sense of maturity and permanence <b>to</b> <b>park</b> and garden. They are grown for the beauty of their forms, their foliage, flowers, fruit and bark and their siting is of major importance in creating a landscape. They can be grouped informally, often surrounded by plantings of bulbs, laid out in stately avenues or used as specimen trees. As living things, their appearance changes with the season and from year to year.|$|E
5|$|As the frontrunners {{set their}} first timed laps in Q3, Hamilton {{made a mistake}} and ran wide at the last corner, leaving him behind Rosberg and both Ferrari drivers. Hülkenberg, both Williams drivers and Ricciardo were {{eliminated}} without setting another time, while the four fastest cars came out again. Hamilton set the fastest ever lap at the Bahrain Circuit, at 1:29.493, to achieve pole position ahead of Rosberg, who was just 0.077 seconds slower. Half a second behind, Vettel grabbed third place on the grid ahead of teammate Räikkönen. After qualifying, Hamilton's pole was put under threat after the FIA started an investigation after Hamilton reversed in the pit lane <b>to</b> <b>park</b> up. Hamilton was given a reprimand and his pole position stood.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o {{with a long}} throw-in {{down the}} right wing. The Cameroonian then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved {{the top of the}} crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, {{culminating}} with a through-ball <b>to</b> <b>Park</b> in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, taking out the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was not sufficient to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.|$|E

At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had <b>to</b> <b>park.</b> It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track.

5|$|In the 1820s {{a number}} of {{proposals}} for a railway between Manchester and Bolton were made, some well advanced enough to be submitted to Parliament. One, in 1825, was for a line from New Bailey in Salford, <b>to</b> <b>Park</b> Field in Bolton, and included a branch line to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The plan included {{the use of an}} inclined plane at Clifton to allow the railway to access the higher ground from thereon. Another scheme was to connect with the planned Liverpool and Manchester Railway near Eccles, and would reach Bolton via Moorside and Farnworth. Neither of these schemes progressed beyond the early stages of planning. In 1830 two more proposals to connect the towns were made. The Manchester to Preston Railway was unsuccessful, leaving open the way for the second scheme, which would become known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway.|$|E
5|$|Kahaanis first-look poster was {{launched}} on 2 December 2011, {{and the official}} trailer on 5 January 2012. The poster, portraying a pregnant Vidya Balan and lacking any romantic element, was well received. Critics' expectations were low, owing to the director's previous box-office failures. Vidya appeared in public with a prosthetic belly to promote the film, and mingled with the public in railway stations, bus stands and markets. She often carried a sketch of her on-screen missing husband, and asked people to help in finding him. Social-networking website Ibibo.com developed an online game, The Great Indian Parking Wars, which required players <b>to</b> <b>park</b> Vidya's taxi on a street; it was well-received, reaching 50,000 hits in 10 days.|$|E
