25|$|In the {{discussion}} of special relativity, forces played {{no more than a}} background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run {{at the same rate as}} the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a global inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, local inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, AI founder Marvin Minsky asked [...] "So the {{question}} is why didn't we get HAL in 2001?" [...] Minsky believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> that the central problems, like commonsense reasoning, were being neglected, while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms. John McCarthy, on the other hand, still blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems. There were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway.|$|E
2500|$|When {{an answer}} is {{composed}} of multiple or hyphenated words, some crosswords (especially in Britain) indicate {{the structure of the}} answer.

2500|$|Abbreviations, {{the use of}} {{a foreign}} language, variant spellings, or other unusual word tricks are {{indicated}} in the clue. A crossword creator might choose to clue the answer SEN (as in the abbreviation for [...] "senator") as [...] "Washington bigwig: Abbr." [...] or [...] "Member of Cong.", with the abbreviation in the clue indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> to be similarly abbreviated. The use of [...] "Var." [...] indicates the answer is a variant spelling (e.g., EMEER instead of EMIR), while the use of foreign language or a foreign place name within the clue indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> also in a foreign language. For example, ETE ( [...] , French for [...] "summer") might be clued as [...] "Summer, in the Sorbonne". ROMA could be clued as [...] "Italia's capital", whereas the clue [...] "Italy's capital" [...] would indicate the English spelling Rome.|$|E
2500|$|Another common clue type is the [...] "hidden clue" [...] or [...] "container", {{where the}} answer is hidden {{in the text of}} the clue itself.

2500|$|The P versus NP {{problem is}} a major unsolved problem in {{computer}} science. [...] Informally, it asks whether every [...] problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> no. [...] It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by Kurt Gödel to John von Neumann. [...] Gödel asked whether a certain NP complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper [...] "The complexity of theorem proving procedures" [...] and {{is considered by many}} to be the most important open problem in the field. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, 2006, The Globe and Mail {{published}} an editorial on the affair. Calling the controversy a [...] "small uproar", it defended {{the right of}} the journalist to question such phenomena, the [...] "need to ask hard questions and explore uncomfortable avenues", saying that it [...] "merely wondered". The editor claimed not to be surprised by the hundreds of letters of protest received, including those of First Ministers Charest and Harper. The editorial validated Wong's claims of alienation in Quebec, which the Globe called [...] "politics of exclusion". Asking whether this exclusion led to marginalization and perhaps alienation, it said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> [...] "arguable". However, it called the marginalization and alienation of the three shooters [...] "obvious". About whether it could be associated with the murders, it answered that [...] "o such evidence exists". In a sentence apparently intended to balance the assertions, it implied {{at the same time that}} an even worse discrimination existed in the Quebec of the past, as it wrote: [...] "By the same token, it would be remiss to forget that today’s Quebec is not the Quebec of yesteryear." [...] The Globe and Mail did not issue an apology for Jan Wong's piece, as requested by many, including the unanimous House of Commons.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. In some cases, {{there is}} danger of {{confusion}} in the answers, {{from the fact that}} the question may be of such a nature, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> long, and may, by different individuals, be differently expressed. This evil must be guarded against, by so shaping the question, as to admit of a reply in a single word. In reading large numbers, for example, each figure may be called for by itself, or they may be given one after another, the pupils keeping exact time. When it is desirable to ask a question to which the answer is necessarily long, it may be addressed to an individual, or the whole class may write their replies, which may then be read in succession.|$|E

6000|$|Now, {{it is this}} {{question}} I would ask you to consider; you, as a good middle type of the Latins, a Liberal but a Catholic, an artist but a soldier. The danger to the whole civilisation of which Rome was the fountain lies in this. That the more this strange Pruss people fail in all the other things, the more they will fall back on this mere fact of a brutal obedience. They will give orders; they have nothing else to give. I {{say that this is}} the question for you; I do not say, I do not dream of saying, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> for me. It is for you to weigh the chance that their very failures in the arts of peace will drive them back upon the arts of war. They could not, and they did not, dupe your people in diplomacy. They did the most undiplomatic thing that can be done; they concealed a breach of partnership without even concealing the concealment. They instigated the intrigue in Austria {{in such a way that}} Italy could honestly claim all the freedom of past ignorance, combined with all the disillusionment of present knowledge. They so ran the Triple Alliance that they had to admit your grievance, at the very moment when they claimed your aid. The English are stupider and less sensitive than you are; but even the English found the German Chancellor's diplomacy not insinuating but simply insulting; I swear I would be a better diplomatist myself. In the same way, there is no danger of people like you being corrupted in controversy. There is no fear that the professors who pullulate all over the Baltic Plain will overcome the Latins in logic. Some of them even claim to be super-logical; and say they are too big for syllogisms; generally having found even one syllogism too big for them. If they complain either of your abstention from their cause or your adhesion to any other, you have an unanswerable answer. You will say, as you did say, that you did not break the Triple Alliance, even for the sake of peace. It was they who broke it for the sake of war. You, obviously, had as much right to be consulted about Servia as Austria had; and on the mere chess-board of argument it is mate in one move. Nor are they in the least fitted to make an appeal to the popular sentiment of your people. The English, I dare say, and the French, have talked an amazing amount of nonsense about you; but they understand a little better. They do not write exactly like this, which is from the most public and accepted Prussian political philosopher (Chamberlain). [...] "Who can live in Italy to-day and mix with its amiable and highly gifted inhabitants without feeling with pain that here a great nation is lost, irredeemably lost, because it lacks the inner driving power," [...] etc., which has brought Von Kluck so triumphantly through Paris. Even a half-educated Englishman, who has heard of no Italian poet except Dante, knows that he was something more than amiable. Even a positively illiterate Frenchman, who has heard of no Italian warrior except Napoleon, knows that it was not in [...] "inner driving force" [...] that the artilleryman in question was deficient. [...] "Who can live in Italy to-day?" [...] Evidently the Prussian philosopher can't. His impressions are taken from Italian operas; not from Italian streets; certainly not from Italian fields. As a matter of fact such images of Italy as burn in the memories of most open-minded Northerners who have been there, are of exactly the other kind. I for one should be inclined to say, [...] "Who can live in Italy to-day without feeling that a woman feeding children, or a man chopping wood, may almost touch him with fear with the fulness of their humanity: so that he can almost smell blood, as one smells burning?" [...] Italians often look lazy; that is, they look as if they would not move; but not as if they could not move, as many Germans do. But even though this formula fitted the Italians, it seems scarcely calculated to please them. For the Prussians, then, with the failure of their diplomacy, the failure of their philosophy, we may also place the failure of their appeals to a foreign people. The Prussian writer may continue his attempts to soothe and charm you by telling you that you are irredeemably lost, and that all great Italians must have been something else. But the method seems to me ill adapted to popular propaganda; and I cannot but say that on this third point of persuasion, the German attempt is not striking.|$|E
