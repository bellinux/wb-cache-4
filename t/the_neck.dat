5|$|Vertebral artery dissection, {{a tear in}} {{the arteries}} in <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> which provide blood to the brain can result from {{rotation}} of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> while <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> is extended.

5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> vertebrae would not have allowed <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} <b>the</b> <b>neck),</b> {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> and that it covered the base of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> and continued onto the shoulder region. Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and {{pointed out that the}} cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around the upper part of <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, a study led by Matthew J. Cobley and {{published}} in PLOS ONE focused on the flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> of sauropods. They compared <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> of ostriches with sauropod genera {{to find out how}} flexible <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> really were. <b>The</b> study noted that previous biomechanics studies found <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> to have been positioned between the extremes of a vertical, and a downward slanted <b>neck.</b> In conclusion, <b>the</b> study found that sauropod neck flexibility should not be based on osteology alone, and if it is, the results should be used with caution. Even though {{there is a lack of}} preserved muscle tissue that would determine flexibility, sauropod necks were probably less flexible than previously thought.|$|R

5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited movement of <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, {{and the animals}} may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E

5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> outer surface, boring and cutting <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the muscular {{development}} of <b>the</b> bladder <b>neck</b> in human fetus, the muscular constitution of <b>the</b> bladder <b>neck</b> contructure was studied.

5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to the action of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> muscles attached to the ribs.
