25|$|Caprice gained series {{status for}} the 1966 model {{year and was}} {{positioned}} as the <b>top-line</b> full-size Chevrolet. It included a four-door hardtop, six- or nine-passenger station wagon, and a two-door hardtop with a squared-off formal roofline {{in contrast to the}} Impala/SS coupe's fastback roof styling.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everyone}} agrees with this unfavourable assessment, written {{well after the}} development of the very successful Paiste 2002 series. In particular, <b>top-line</b> malleable bronze cymbals proved exceptionally suitable for the louder music then developing. The best of them now approach, and some claim equal, the best bell bronze cymbals in quality.|$|E
25|$|Rambler sales {{increased}} in 1959, and AMC {{struggled to keep}} up with demand as production tripled to 91,491 Americans, with 32,639 (almost 36 percent) made up by the new wagon. The two-door sedans each sold nearly as well, also, at 29,954 for the lower-priced Deluxe and 28,449 for the <b>top-line</b> Super.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was while}} Booker was in Nashville {{recording}} his second solo album [...] "A Far Cry From Here" [...] that he [...] "fell {{in love with}} co-writing" [...] and decided to stay and make a living from professional songwriting. He ended up spending around seven years in the USA where he, according to Booker, [...] "existed by writing country music and working in Los Angeles, but more <b>top-lining</b> than actual proper songwriting." [...] During this time his cuts included [...] "Too Far From Texas" [...] for Stevie Nicks' Trouble in Shangri-La album and [...] "What R U Waiting 4", which was recorded by Tiffani Wood and Lindsay Lohan.|$|R
25|$|As {{it was the}} <b>top-line</b> Oldsmobile, {{the series}} had the most technologically {{advanced}} items available, such as the Hydramatic automatic transmission, the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, and Twilight Sentinel (a feature that automatically turned the headlights on and off via a timer, as controlled by the driver), and the highest-grade interior and exterior trim.|$|E
25|$|For 1935, Nuvolari set {{his sights}} on a drive with the German Auto Union team. They lacked <b>top-line</b> drivers but relented to {{pressure}} from Achille Varzi, who did not want Nuvolari in the team. Nuvolari then approached Enzo Ferrari, who at first rebuffed him as he had previously walked out on the team. Italy's prime minister Mussolini helped persuade Ferrari to take Nuvolari back.|$|E
25|$|After Octagon {{failed to}} obtain the {{necessary}} planning permission and subsequent leasing of the British Grand Prix to Silverstone, this left Brands Hatch without any <b>top-line</b> single-seater racing. However, high-profile single-seater did return in 2003, when the London Champ Car Trophy, a round of the CART Series {{was held at the}} circuit. Despite attracting around 40,000 spectators to see Sébastien Bourdais (Newman/Haas Racing Lola) win, the race was not retained for subsequent seasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} Kirkby and Hudson {{provided}} a <b>top-line</b> attraction {{for many years}} and they made great capital out of songs specially written for them by Weston and Lee. During {{the latter part of the}} First World War and for several years afterwards they toured music halls as a double act, though the discographer Brian Rust did not consider any of these songs to be music-hall in style. Several of the songs were recorded for Edison Bell between 1916 and 1925.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{many people who have}} been given their own caricatures, namely <b>top-line</b> {{personnel}} including Bernie Ecclestone, incorporating his suit and sunglasses (which often include the dollar symbol on the lenses), and Max Mosley, and team managers including Jean Todt, Frank Williams and Ron Dennis, and drivers, sans helmet, such as Mika Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher as well as celebrities, for instance Posh and Becks in 2007. A large mural illustrated by Bamber is in the cafe of Castle Combe Circuit.|$|E
25|$|For the 1959 model year, the Edsel brand fielded {{only two}} series, the Ford-based Ranger and Corsair. The larger Mercury-based Edsels were discontinued. Replacing the Pacer as the <b>top-line</b> Ford-based Edsel, the new Corsair was {{offered as a}} two-door and four-door hardtop, four-door sedan, and two-door convertible. The Ranger was sold as a two-door and four-door hardtop, two-door and four-door sedan, and the Villager station wagon. In the 1959 model year, 44,891 Edsels were sold in the U.S., and 2,505 were sold in Canada.|$|E
25|$|The first Grand Prix was a Catalina hardtop coupe trimmed to {{standards}} {{similar to the}} larger <b>top-line</b> Bonneville, with a distinctive grille and taillights. The bucket seats were upholstered in Morrokide vinyl, while nylon loop-blend carpeting covered the floor and lower door panels. The center console-mounted transmission shifter included a storage compartment and a tachometer. The rear bench seat included a center fold-down armrest and a speaker grille {{that could be made}} functional with the extra-cost Bi-Phonic rear speaker. Included were a padded instrument panel, deluxe steering wheel, courtesy lights, and other features.|$|E
25|$|This {{would be}} the final year for the {{rear-drive}} LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992–96 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The <b>top-line</b> LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to {{mark the end of}} an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe.|$|E
25|$|Their {{loss of the}} 1947 {{campaign}} was, {{more than}} the lapse of 1943 to 1945, {{the end of their}} first successful period. With the retirement of the famous front three of Eddie Burns, Roy Kirkaldy and Henry Porter (remarkably, none ever played for Australia owing to the war), Canterbury was unable to develop <b>top-line</b> players or attract established stars to its ranks, for the club’s budget in this era was largely devoted to the establishment and development of their licensed club. The club’s financial position is the late 1950s was so precarious that only a loan from patron Stan Parry prevented the club from closing down.|$|E
25|$|On October 26, 2007, {{shortly after}} the start of the 2007–08 season, the Kings and Brown agreed to a six-year, $19.05million {{contract}} extension that ran through the 2013–14 season. The contract was signed a full year before Brown hit restricted free agency, partially because young forwards Dustin Penner of the Anaheim Ducks and Thomas Vanek of the Buffalo Sabres had just received lucrative offer sheets in restricted free agency, and the Kings did not want Brown to get one. Brown produced his best offensive season that year. Continuing to play <b>top-line</b> minutes with Kopitar, he recorded 33 goals and 60 points. To date, that season remains the only year Brown has managed to reach the 30-goal and 60-point plateaus. Despite his personal success, the rebuilding Kings missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the fifth-straight year.|$|E
25|$|Zastava {{continued}} to produce vehicles for the Yugoslav and European markets until exports were limited by sanctions {{imposed by the}} United Nations in the 1990s. In 1984, automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin tested the United States market for Zastava vehicles, now branded as Yugo. As a result, in mid-1986, Yugo America began selling cars at a starting price of $3,990 for the entry-level GV ("Good Value") hatchback equipped with the 1,100 cc overhead-cam five-main-bearing engine and four-speed manual transmission. The similar GVL offered a plusher interior, but the sporty <b>top-line</b> GVX was powered by the 1300 cc engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and included as standard equipment a number of deluxe features such as a ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. However, though the GVX was billed as an upscale, sporty version of the base GV, it went from 0-60mph in 13.56 seconds, just a half a second faster than the GV. When the political instability in Yugoslavia intensified in early 1992, Zastava was forced to stop exports.|$|E
25|$|On 6 July, he {{was flying}} one of eight Spitfires that were {{scrambled}} to intercept three Italian Cant bombers and 30 Macchi 202s, Italy's <b>top-line</b> fighter. The eight Spitfires dived straight into the Italians. In seconds, with one burst Beurling had damaged a bomber. Then, suddenly {{he was on the}} tail of a Macchi whose pilot (probably Sergente Maggiore Francesco Pecchiari from 51° Stormo), spotting the Spitfire, plunged into a dive. The Canadian chased his prey for 15,000 ft and, when the Italian pulled up at 5,000, Beurling let go a two-second burst from 300 yards away. It was a perfect hit. Although he wasn't aware that he had been fired on, when Beurling inspected his Spitfire back at Takali, he found it riddled with bullets. Undaunted, that evening, just before dusk, he was in the air again in a patrol of four Spitfires. Radar had shown two German JU 88s and 20 Messerschmitts Bf 109Fs, heading towards Malta. After the four Spitfires dived and split up the formation, Beurling followed a fighter trying to escape at low level over the sea. After he laid down a two-second burst the German crashed into the Mediterranean.|$|E
500|$|Hed PE {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Blackout, on March 18, 2003. It peaked at No.33 on the Billboard 200, while its title track peaked at No.21 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No.32 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Allmusic's Johnny Loftus wrote that [...] "While it expands on melodic elements {{that had previously}} played a supporting role in the band's sound, Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm. And {{whether or not it}} is the presence of a <b>top-line</b> producer, (hed) pe have figured out a way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks." [...] Guitarist Jaxon joined the band in early 2004. He is the fourth person to fill this position.|$|E
500|$|Once {{assigned}} to the 432nd Fighter Squadron, Loisel began to quickly show his abilities once he started flying an aircraft that could compete with the <b>top-line</b> Japanese fighters. [...] Flying a P-38H, serial no. 42-66682, named the Screaming Kid, he shot down five Japanese fighters within his first two months of flying in the P-38s and earned a promotion to captain. [...] On August 21, 1943, while escorting USAAF bombers near Wewak, New Guinea, he shot down two Kawasaki Ki-61 [...] "Tony" [...] fighters, his first two victories. Less than a month later, on September 22, 1943, he claimed a Mitsubishi A6M [...] "Zero" [...] fighter near Finschafen, New Guinea. Slightly {{less than two months}} later Loisel obtained [...] "ace" [...] status by downing two more Zeroes near Oro Bay, New Guinea.|$|E
500|$|With Zephyr-mania {{sweeping}} the country, tributes {{turned up in}} the names of everything from sports teams to commercial products. [...] In 1934, Father Becker, principal of the newly built St. Mary High School in Menasha, Wisconsin, was so inspired by the dawn-to-dusk run that he chose [...] "Zephyrs" [...] as the mascot for the new school. [...] In Galesburg, Illinois, which is 162 rail miles from Chicago, the local high school named all its athletic teams the [...] "Galesburg Silver Streaks" [...] in honor of the train. [...] In 1935, the H. N. White Company changed the name of its <b>top-line</b> saxophones to [...] "King Zephyr." [...] Ford Motor Company introduced the [...] "Lincoln-Zephyr" [...] with the 1936 model year. [...] If advertisers {{could find a way to}} cash in on Zephyr-mania, they did.|$|E
500|$|A few demos {{produced}} by them {{were sent to}} songwriter Jenson Vaughan, who liked the lyrics and the [...] "bass-driven" [...] sound. Vaughan added the <b>top-line</b> on a demo and returned it to Moxey, who shared it with Benassi's European co-manager Paul Sears, who in-turn shared the demo with Oseary. Upon listening, Madonna {{was impressed with the}} demos and requested the Benassi Bros. to come to London for a recording session. Moxey commented that the singer [...] "loved [...] Benny is such a quality person; I think that made it all flow so much easier." [...] Two tracks from those sessions, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] and [...] "I'm Addicted", were included on the final track list of the album, named MDNA.

500|$|In the 2006–07 season, Henrik {{established}} himself as the Canucks' <b>top-line</b> centre. Winger Taylor Pyatt, who had been acquired in a trade from the Buffalo Sabres during the off-season, replaced Carter as the Sedins' linemate {{and went on to}} score a career-high 23goals. For the fifth-straight season, Henrik recorded a personal best, with 81 points; he set a new Canucks record for assists in one season with 71, beating the 62 by André Boudrias in 1974–75. Henrik passed Boudrias on 25 March 2007, with a three-assist effort during a 5–4 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. In the opening game of the 2007 playoffs against the Dallas Stars, Henrik scored a game-winning, quadruple-overtime goal to end the sixth longest game in NHL history (and longest in Canucks history) at 138minutes and six seconds of play. [...] He struggled to produce offensively in his 12games in the playoffs, however, managing four points as the Canucks were eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in the second round.|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that you need me too... best you ever had. It could be so easy, for you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the <b>top-line</b> of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E
500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and <b>top-line</b> writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this I knew I wanted to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players without spending loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever! ...|$|E

Optional on the Matador coupe was a landau vinyl roof with opera windows, and <b>top-line</b> Barcelonas offered new two-tone paint.|$|E
2500|$|The Belvedere {{replaced}} the Cranbrook as the <b>top-line</b> offering for 1954. Now, a separate model {{instead of just}} a two-door hardtop, it was also available as a convertible, two-door station wagon, and four-door sedan. The two-door hardtop version was now called the [...] "Sport Coupe". 1954 Belevederes featured full-length rocker sill moldings.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{offered in}} <b>top-line</b> Beaumont and base Invader trim, the top trim line was renamed Canso in {{anticipation}} of the Chevelle-based Acadian Beaumont which would arrive for 1964.

2500|$|In 1992, Elias {{moved to}} California, and shifted his focus from movies and rock music to advertising. His firm Elias Arts has won an Emmy Award for the [...] "Move" [...] theme for Nike Inc., and has {{garnered}} dozens of Clio Awards and other advertising trophies for work for <b>top-line</b> corporations such as Ford, GM, Nissan, Audi, Infiniti, Mercedes, AT, NASDAQ, IBM, Apple, Sony, Levi's, and Adidas.|$|E
2500|$|Programs of {{organizational}} innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives, {{to the business}} plan, and to market competitive positioning. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, [...] "Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive <b>top-line</b> growth, and for increasing bottom-line results".|$|E
2500|$|Influenced heavily by the S/Line from Collins, Heathkit {{designed}} the SB-series to become their <b>top-line</b> set of amateur radio equipment. [...] Like the S/Line, these new products {{were designed to}} operate together in various combinations as a system. The first models appeared in the 1965 catalog, displacing the large, heavy units of the tribes generation (except for the Marauder and Warrior, and the 6 meter units which remained for one year).|$|E
2500|$|The {{second and}} third generations {{essentially}} became the equivalent Rambler Six models, but equipped with a V8 engine. The Rebel nameplate was reintroduced in 1966 as the <b>top-line</b> intermediate-sized two-door hardtop. For the 1967 model year, AMC's all-new intermediate line took the Rebel name. American Motors dropped the historic [...] "Rambler" [...] marque from these intermediate sized models to become the AMC Rebel starting with the 1968 model year.|$|E
2500|$|The AMC Concord offered {{interiors}} {{that not}} only looked expensive, but were also comfortable and finished to a level equal in appearance to expensive American luxury cars. Even without the <b>top-line</b> [...] "Limited" [...] upgrade, the Concord [...] "was trimmed in first-class fashion". Interiors were available in [...] "deluxe grain" [...] vinyl in black, blue, beige, and nutmeg. Sculptured [...] "Rochelle velour" [...] fabric came in black, blue, wine, beige, and nutmeg. Leather was available only in nutmeg.|$|E
2500|$|The new styling was {{the work}} of {{designer}} Richard A. Teague, who would go on to design the 1968 Javelin and AMX. Many viewed the newly designed station wagon as the best looking of any American wagon, with its new trim lines, with ample passenger, and cargo room. Led by the <b>top-line</b> 440-series convertible, they were arguably the 1964's most attractive Detroit compacts. Car Life magazine titled its road test of the 1964 Rambler American: [...] "The Original Plain Jane Compact Car Just Got Back From the Beauty Parlor".|$|E
2500|$|For 1968, {{the line}} was further {{simplified}} from nine to five models, with the 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan comprising the base line (with the 220 designation no longer used), 4-door sedan and station wagon being offered in uplevel 440 guise, and a lone hardtop coupe making up the <b>top-line</b> Rogue trim line. The American, along with [...] "A-body" [...] Chryslers, were the only domestics that came as a hardtop coupe model, the Ford Falcon and Chevy Nova being only available as pillared sedans (and a wagon in the Ford Falcon line).|$|E
