5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>view</b> of Terminus retains {{some recent}} adherents, but other {{scholars}} have argued from Indo-European parallels that the personalised gods of Roman religion must have preceded the city's foundation. Georges Dumézil regarded Jupiter, Juventas and Terminus as the Roman {{form of a}} proto-Indo-European triad, comparing the Roman deities respectively to the Vedic Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga. In <b>this</b> <b>view</b> the sovereign god (Jupiter/Mitra) was associated with two minor deities, one concerned with the entry of men into society (Juventas/Aryaman) {{and the other with}} the fair division of their goods (Terminus/Bhaga).|$|E
5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as {{consciousness and}} Kali as power or energy. Consciousness and energy are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction.

5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman point out, it is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E
5|$|Asa Gray {{promoted}} {{and defended}} Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz who viewed every species {{as a distinct}} fixed unit {{in the mind of}} the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties.

5|$|Eastern Orthodox theologians are {{generally}} {{critical of the}} theory that Gregory was influenced by neoplatonism.

5|$|EdwardIII was a temperamental man but {{capable of}} unusual clemency. He {{was in many}} ways a {{conventional}} king whose main interest was warfare.

5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from <b>this</b> <b>view</b> in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E

He was unconvinced by Aquinas' theory of analogy and argued that God's attributes must be completely different from human attributes, making comparisons between the two impossible. Hume's scepticism influenced the logical positivist movement of the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two {{justifications}} for limiting parliamentary sovereignty: legitimacy {{and the current}} hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that <b>this</b> <b>view</b> was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. <b>This</b> <b>view</b> was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Mari's revenge: According to Alfonso Archi and Maria Biga, the {{destruction}} happened approximately {{three or four}} years after the battle of Terqa.

5|$|Moulting {{serves a}} number of {{functions}} – firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks.

5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for <b>this</b> <b>view</b> lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under <b>this</b> <b>view,</b> for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
