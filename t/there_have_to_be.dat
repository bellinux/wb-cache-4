But also I feel like <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was about someone who has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{conduction}} {{of nerve}} impulses {{is an example}} of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing. There are different types of receptor responses to stimuli, slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where to get greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more photons, as the photons can't become [...] "stronger" [...] for a specific frequency.|$|E
2500|$|A Jerusalem Post {{editorial}} {{expressed concern}} regarding the individuals invited {{to speak to}} the J Street February 2011 conference. They included Rebecca Vilkomerson, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, whom the newspaper described as an [...] "adamant proponent" [...] of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel; Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, described as a BDS advocate {{who took part in the}} Free Gaza Flotilla; and Michael Sfard, an attorney who, according to the newspaper, [...] "advocates international 'lawfare' against Israel". Israeli Members of Knesset were among those who voiced concern. [...] "I have my own criticism of the current government, but <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> limits, and this organization is doing tremendous damage to Israel," [...] said Kadima MK Ze'ev Bielski, a former Jewish Agency chairman. At the same time, other MK attended and spoke at the conference, including Daniel Ben-Simon (Labor), Yoel Hasson (Kadima), Amir Peretz (Labor), Nachman Shai (Kadima), and Orit Zuaretz (Kadima).|$|E
2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon list several {{disadvantages}} {{of the union}} organizing model, with the most critical being that the model is very [...] "resource-intensive," [...] {{in terms of both}} people and money. Since the organizing model is, at its core, about people, rather than services, it cannot be effective without people to both implement it and carry it out. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon talk about [...] "...instances of a lack of support or even opposition to organizing within unions." [...] Because the organizing model is so dependent upon worker motivation and action, if the workers themselves oppose the implementation of the organizing model, it cannot be effective. Fletcher and Hurd suggest that even if members are not resistant to adoption of the organizing model, they still {{have to learn how to}} perform tasks previously handled by organizers, and <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enough active members to facilitate this kind of action. This clear dependence on the support and actions of the workers is a disadvantage of the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, which, for the most part, does not require worker support or demand worker action. According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, [...] "Employers are often resistant." [...] Unions that have to deal with this problem would very clearly have a hard time using the organizing model, as it could antagonize the employer even further and erode any previously existing relationship between the employer and the union.|$|E
