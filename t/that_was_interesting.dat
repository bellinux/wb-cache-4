25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were wrong <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting.</b>|$|E

We went to the rainforest and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting.</b> Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E

[...] To solve his dilemma, Gunn chose to have Ronan kill [...] "The Other", Thanos' vizier, saying, [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting,</b> because we’ve had the Other, who’s obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki, and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him. So that I liked, but even that was sort of difficult, because it played as funnier when I first wrote it, and the humor didn’t work so much." ...|$|E

It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second Emmy Award for Best Actress. [...] Her daughter, Isabella, described Bergman's surprise at being offered the part and the producer {{trying to explain to}} her, [...] "People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people." [...] Isabella adds, [...] "Now <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> to Mother."

In 2012, he starred in The Hunt, for which he won the Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film Festival. He played a schoolteacher wrongly accused of child molestation, earning {{nominations}} for the European Film Award for Best Actor and the London Film Critics Circle Award for Actor of the Year for his performance. The same year he starred in the Oscar-nominated historical drama A Royal Affair taking {{the role of the}} 18th century physician Johann Friedrich Struensee who had an affair with Queen Caroline Mathilda while treating the mentally ill Danish monarch, Christian VII. The movie was one of the highest budget Danish films of all time largely due to its extravagant costumes and was well received by critics. Mikkelsen said of his role, [...] "I was surprised how emotional I got reading this, especially for a period drama. And it was full of dilemma – he's full of love for both the king and the queen, but then he remains political, starts spinning his tunnel vision, {{and all of a sudden}} he's doing the exact same things he hated all the other courtiers for doing, and I thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting,</b> and very human." ...|$|E

Ron Entwistle is co-writer and co-producer of [...] "Weird", which Duff said is [...] "about someone that she's still obsessed with. And everything he does is like he says this, but he does this ... She's not really sure who he is or what he does, but she likes it." [...] Kevin De Clue contributed to [...] "The Last Song" [...] and [...] "Mr. James Dean" [...] (both co-produced by Haylie), which Duff has named her favorite track on the album and described as [...] "very funny"; in the song, she tells an ex-boyfriend that he'll [...] "never be James Dean". Duff neither confirmed nor denied whether the song was about fellow singer Aaron Carter, and she said [...] "it was definitely an experience that I went through <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> and I {{learned a lot from}} that time in my life." [...] In [...] "Hide Away", co-produced and co-written by Shaun Shankel, Duff discusses a relationship that isn't working because she is in a position where her life is [...] "figuratively under the microscope". Diane Warren wrote [...] "I Am", an empowerment song in which Duff lists positive and negative aspects about herself; she has said it is about being comfortable [...] "with all those feelings ... being who you are".

60|$|Her {{visit to}} the Enchantress had perhaps had {{something}} to do with these disturbing feelings, but not, she argued, because she was sentimentally attracted by her rescuer.

60|$|During that period, however, much <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> and {{encouraging}} occurred to comfort {{the heart of}} the native missionary and the sorrowing Marie Zeppa. In the first place they received several visits from the mission-vessel, with small supplies of such luxuries as sugar, tea, and coffee for the body, and, for the spirit, a few bundles of tracts and books printed in the native tongue, among which, you may be sure, were many copies of the Book of books, the blessed Bible. Carpenters' and smiths' tools were also brought to them, so that they not only carried on their house-building and other operations with greater ease than heretofore, but even essayed the building of small boats with considerable success.|$|E

She walked very fast, and the effect of people passing in the opposite direction was to produce a queer dizziness both in her head and in Ralph's, which set their bodies far apart.
