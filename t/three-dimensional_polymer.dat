30|$|Dendrimers are <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>polymers</b> with spherical, highly {{branched}} structures. Frequently used dendrimers are polyamines, polyamides, or polyesters.

The primary amine groups promote DNA cellular uptake because of their participation in DNA binding but the buried tertiary amino groups act as a proto-sponge in endosomes and enhance the release of DNA into the cytoplasm. The studies show that with increasing the size and diameter, dendrimers enhance transfection efficiency [39, 40]. Recently, nitrogen-core poly(propyl ether imine) (PETIM) dendrimer DNA complexes have been investigated and results showed low toxicities and efficient gene delivery vector properties.
