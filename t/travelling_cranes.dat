2500|$|The wharf {{narrowly}} escaped destruction {{during the}} Second World War when its southern neighbour, Nicholson's Wharf, was flattened by a V-1 flying bomb. A regular passenger and cargo service between the wharf and the Canary Islands was maintained {{for a number}} of years after the war by the 10,123-ton MV Monte Ulia and its 7,723-ton sister ship MV Monte Urquiola, operated by Naviera Aznar SA. Such vessels were among the largest merchant ships ever to visit the Pool of London. Writing in 1963, James Harold Bird observed how [...] "during his lunch-hour the pale-faced London office worker can lean on the downstream parapet of London Bridge and watch Canary Island produce being unloaded to New Fresh Wharf below from vessels up to 500 feet long and delivered to a ten-storey warehouse." [...] The warehouse was constructed in 1953 and provided four million cubic feet of storage space. By this time the wharf had five <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> and two conveyors, capable of transporting loads of up to five tons. Its river frontage measured [...]|$|E

50|$|Andrew Betts Brown MICE MINA (1841-1906) was a Scottish {{engineer}} and inventor.

50|$|In 1910 he {{designed}} {{a new system}} of floor construction, and in 1913 {{he designed}} adjustable beam forms, which were reinforced concrete beams for electric <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> to run on (1913).|$|E
50|$|When the {{locomotive}} arrived in Durban, the railway {{had already been}} in use for some time, but until then the railway trucks were hauled by oxen. The Natal Railway's initial rolling stock consisted of six to eight trucks, two <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> and one passenger coach.|$|E

Calculations are presented as diagrams, showing the change of loading and frequency of eigentones from inflexibility of muff. As a result these calculations bring about a possibility of application of resilient muff in the mechanism of movement of <b>travelling</b> <b>crane.</b> When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R

50|$|Between 1876 and 1878 a new works, Vulcan Foundry, was {{developed}} beside the Midland Railway mainline. The site covered {{three and a}} half acres, the foundry shop was 180 ft by 62 ft.

50|$|Rather than {{transport}} girders {{from their}} base in Lyttelton, on 25 June 1906, Andersons opened a large foundry, (285 ft x 30 ft) to fabricate the steel on site. It was {{powered by a}} wood-burning boiler and steam engine, with electric lights and machines. Electric overhead <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> and a cableway (or Blondin) eased on-site transport. A water turbine drove the stone crusher and concrete mixer (adverts from the period said they used 9,000 bags of Portland Cement).|$|E

50|$|In 1874 Samuel Fielding {{died and}} his two sons, James and John Fielding, became joint junior {{partners}} with James Platt. The company was expanding rapidly at this time, building new equipment and registering patents. The firm built furnaces, hydraulic presses, <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes,</b> and machinery for processing girders. In 1874 they made a 900 ton flanging press. The firm won awards for its equipment at Philadelphia (1876), Paris (1878) and London (1880). A wide range of steam and oil engines were developed.|$|E

50|$|Before the Dublin Port {{facilities}} {{moved down}} river, {{this was the}} area of the Dublin quays where ships were loaded and unloaded. As a result, the area had a number of storage warehouses and <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes.</b> The Dublin Docklands Development Authority renewed and renovated some of the area in the early 2000s, adding walkways and cycleways {{on both sides of the}} river Liffey, including parts of the Sutton to Sandycove project. A number of buildings on the campshires were also subject to renovation early in the 21st century.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} years the Bremer Vulkan increased rapidly. By 1908 it already had an area of about 80 acres and a water frontage of 1500 meters. Six slips equipped with modern electric <b>travelling</b> <b>cranes</b> were capable of building the largest vessels of that time. With an average annual delivery of about 40000 BRT it became the greatest civilian shipbuilding company in the Deutsches Kaiserreich (German Empire), followed by Flensburger Schiffbaubetriebe in Flensburg, Tecklenborg in Bremerhaven and Vulcan Stettin in Stettin. The number of co-workers had increased from about 60 at the beginning up to about 3300 in 1912.|$|E
