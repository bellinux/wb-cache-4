40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} of the performance of two active desiccant cooling systems that were installed as pilot systems in two locations [...] a college dormitory and a research laboratory [...] during the fall of 1999. The laboratory system was assembled in the field from commercially available Trane air-handling modules combined with a standard <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> recovery <b>module</b> and a customized active desiccant wheel, both produced by SEMCO. The dormitory system was a factory-built, integrated system produced by SEMCO that included both active desiccant and sensible-only recovery wheels, a direct-fired gas regeneration section, and a pre-piped Trane heat pump condensing section. Both systems were equipped with direct digital control systems, complete with full instrumentation and remote monitoring capabilities. This report includes detailed descriptions of these two systems, installation details, samples of actual performance, and estimations of the energy savings realized. These pilot sites represent a continuation of previous active desiccant product development research (Fischer, Hallstrom, and Sand 2000; Fischer 2000). Both systems performed as anticipated, were reliable, and required minimal maintenance. The dehumidification/total-energy-recovery hybrid approach was particularly effective in all respects. System performance showed remarkable improvement in latent load handling capability and operating efficiency compared with the original conventional cooling system and with the conventional system that remained in another, identical wing of the facility. The dehumidification capacity of the pilot systems was very high, the cost of operation was very low, and the system was cost-effective, offering a simple payback for these retrofit installations of approximately 5 to 6 years. Most important, the dormitory system resolved numerous indoor air quality problems in the dormitory by providing effective humidity control and increased, continuous ventilation air...|$|R

40|$|The {{computation}} of orbits can be {{done more}} efficiently {{by the use of}} any of several new formulations of the perturbed two body problem which consider the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> of the orbital system as one of the dependent variables. The <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> is the osculating two body energy plus the potential energy due to perturbing masses. The use of the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> as the dependent variable instead of the two body energy is a relatively new idea. The advantage of using <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> arises {{from the fact that the}} more perturbing potential energy that is accounted for in the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> variable, the more nearly constant is the <b>total</b> <b>energy.</b> In fact, except for dissipative forces such as drag, the only reason for the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> not being constant is the rotation or revolution of the perturbing mass.

30|$|Thus, the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> and the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> density can be obtained. These {{results show}} that the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> density for both models # 1 and # 2 are 1.147 and 1.141, which are about 1 and 0.4 % higher than the rest models, respectively. For model # 1, the higher surface area, and thus the higher surface energy, {{contributes}} to the higher <b>total</b> <b>energy.</b> This phenomenon has been observed before during the synchrotron radiation-based grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering measurement [41], in which the stabilization of the prism structure is attributed to the strain-dependence of the { 105 } surface energy. And our FEM results seem to support this in terms of <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> density analysis. As for model # 2, although the edge energy only takes up about 1 % of the <b>total</b> <b>energy,</b> the much higher edge energy still {{plays a key role in}} the comparison of <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> as discussed before [17], which rules out the possibility to form the enlarged pyramids on the patterned substrate. The <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> density difference exhibited above is quite small. Nevertheless, this is not uncommon that a small <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> difference in the order of 1 % may lead to the onset of the energetically preferential geometry [19, 27], so long as the quasi equilibrium growth condition is fulfilled. The rather low deposition rate of 0.12  Å/s and medium temperature of 650  °C during our MBE growth exactly provide the favorite condition which enabled the thermodynamics the dominating driven force for the observed phenomena.|$|R

The self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, {{widely used}} for {{computing}} the ground state {{energy and the}} corresponding single particle wave functions associated with a many-electron atomistic system, is viewed in this paper as an optimization procedure that minimizes the Kohn– Sham (KS) <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> indirectly by minimizing a sequence of quadratic surrogate functions. We point out the similarity and difference between the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> and the surrogate, and show how the SCF iteration can fail when the minimizer of the surrogate produces {{an increase in the}} KS <b>total</b> <b>energy.</b> A trust region technique is introduced as a way to restrict the update of the wave functions within a small neighborhood of an approximate solution at which the gradient of the <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> agrees with that of the surrogate. The use of trust regions in SCF is not new. However, it has been observed that directly applying a trust region-based SCF (TRSCF) to the KS <b>total</b> <b>energy</b> often leads to slow convergence. We propose to use TRSCF within a direct constrained minimization (DCM) algorithm we developed in [J. Comput. Phys., 217 (2006), pp. 709 – 721].

In order {{to ease the}} analysis of the energy usage of proposed network protocols, this paper proposes an <b>energy</b> <b>module,</b> implemented in OPNET, to determine the energy consumption over time during network simulation.
