5|$|In {{writing the}} book that would become Washington: A Life, Chernow made {{extensive}} use of the archival evidence left by Washington's meticulous record-keeping. These documents included recently discovered written correspondence, maps, and images from the Papers of George Washington, made available by a University of Virginia research project, which began in 1968. Washington: A Life took six years to complete, {{the first four years}} of which were spent purely on research. In June 2009, {{near the end of his}} work on the book, Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places. He was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> read for the following months, and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript.|$|E
25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that it was very difficult <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that can help us understand the world.|$|E
25|$|After {{the turmoil}} in 473 BC, which {{was caused by the}} {{blockage}} of an agrarian law three years before and the death of a tribune who attempted to bring to justice former consuls, there was more unrest among the Roman people. The consul Titus Quinctius became a peacemaker, unlike Appius who strongly opposed the tribunes. Titus Quinctius barely managed to calm the crowd by adopting a more conciliatory approach. He forced Appius to retreat into the Curia Hostilia. There the senators urged Appius to abandon his intransigent attitude because it could lead to serious civil unrest. Isolated and deprived of political support, Appius was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> permit the vote. The law, Lex Publilia Voleronis, was finally proclaimed.|$|E

6000|$|He {{listened to}} this respectfully; then he answered, {{with a little}} {{vibration}} of the voice, [...] "I should be very sorry <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> dishonorable. <b>But</b> I don't see why it is dishonorable to say that your cousin is frivolous." ...|$|R
25|$|During the War of 1812, Key, {{accompanied}} by the British Prisoner Exchange Agent Colonel John Stuart Skinner, dined aboard the British ship HMS Tonnant as the guests of three British officers: Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane, Rear Admiral George Cockburn, and Major General Robert Ross. Skinner and Key were there to negotiate the release of prisoners, {{one of whom was}} Dr.William Beanes, a resident of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, who had been arrested after jailing marauding British troops who were looting local farms. Skinner, Key, and Beanes were not allowed to return to their own sloop because they had become familiar with the strength and position of the British units and with the British intent to attack Baltimore. Thus, Key was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> watch the bombarding of the American forces at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore on the night of September 1314,1814.|$|E
25|$|Cranmer {{assigned}} Ridley {{to perform}} the consecration, and Ridley refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> follow {{the form of the}} ordinal as it had been prescribed by Parliament. Ridley, it seems likely, had some particular objection to Hooper. It has been suggested that Henrician exiles like Hooper, who had experienced some of the more radically reformed churches on the continent, were at odds with English clergy who had accepted and never left the established church. John Henry Primus also notes that on 24 July 1550, the day after receiving instructions for Hooper's unique consecration, the church of the Austin Friars in London had been granted to Jan Laski for use as a Stranger church. This was to be a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees, a church with forms and practices that had taken reforms much further than Ridley would have liked. This development—the use of a London church virtually outside Ridley's jurisdiction—was one that Hooper had had a hand in.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{just over}} a week before Tyrone's Ulster final {{appearance}} against Down, Canavan's father, Seán, died. It {{came as a shock}} to Canavan, who had thought his father (who was already in hospital) was getting better. He decided to play in the match, stating that he knew, subconsciously [...] " [...] was going to be playing in the Ulster final all along and Daddy certainly wouldn't have wanted [...] <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> play." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the sixth}} and seventh seasons saw Daenerys, Sansa and Cersei assume ruling positions, Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post noted that the series {{could be seen as}} a [...] "long-arc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain power"—namely, that their past leaves them too broken <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> commit brutal acts in their own turn, and that their {{personal}} liberation does not effect the social change needed to protect others from suffering.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle's [...] "electric" [...] {{direction}} [...] "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" [...] {{and praised}} Fassbender in the role, who [...] "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [...] he fully delivers {{the essentials of}} how {{we have come to}} perceive the man." [...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie." [...] Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives [...] "a stunning knockout" [...] performance as Jobs in a film that is [...] "a kind of talk opera", which to some might seem to be [...] "Sorkin overkill but {{the same could be said}} for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August of 2017, University Chancellor Robert Jones {{made the}} {{decision}} to ban the school's [...] "War Chant", in response to critic claims that said the music stereotyped Native Americans and prolonged the divisive debate over Chief Illiniwek. [...] ""Debating it was not going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> kind of re-initiate a lot of the agony and the angst that have been a cancer that has been eating away at this university for more than a decade," [...] Jones said of the closed-session ruling.|$|E
60|$|That night Lemuel told Mrs. Harmon {{that she}} must not expect him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> thenceforward <b>but</b> look after the {{accounts}} and the general management; she must get a head-waiter, and a boy to run the elevator. She consented to this, as she would have consented to almost anything else that he proposed.|$|R
6000|$|Haney smiled. [...] "Did ye order him around? I niver chanced <b>to</b> hear ye <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> ask him questions. 'Lucius, will ye do this?' 'Lucius, won't ye do that?'" ...|$|R

2500|$|Ken Kesey told an {{interviewer}} of this notion of a fool. [...] "That fool of Shakespeare's, the actor Robert Armin, became so popular that finally Shakespeare wrote him out of Henry IV. In a book called A Nest of Ninnies, Armin wrote {{about the difference between}} a fool artificial and a fool natural. And the way Armin defines the two is important: the character Jack Oates is a true fool natural. He never stops being a fool to save himself; he never tries <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> anger his master, Sir William. A fool artificial is always trying to please; he’s a lackey." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{commander}} of the 50th Tennessee emerged from the woods ahead of his skirmishers, and his heart sank. [...] To his right, a line of blue stretched {{as far as he}} could see. [...] To the left, he could hear Logan's two reserve regiments moving past his flank. [...] General Gregg had made a grave miscalculation. [...] The federal infantry brigade he had been ordered to rout from the field had somehow turned into an entire federal division. [...] The Confederate force withdrew across the creek with haste, and for a moment was too stunned <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> stand in formation waiting for orders.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, McPherson {{began to}} extend his right flank beyond the Confederate hilltop. [...] The {{position}} having been turned and his routed units reasonably reformed, Gregg ordered a withdrawal through Raymond towards Jackson. [...] Here, the Federal artillery finally made its mark in the battle, pounding the Confederate ranks as Gregg continued the delaying action to allow his battered units to withdraw. [...] As his disorganized force came scrambling over fences and through yards in Raymond, they were met by the 3rd Kentucky Mounted Infantry and 800 cavalry {{under the command of}} Wirt Adams, the leading elements of reinforcements headed to Raymond from all over the Confederacy. [...] Help had arrived too late <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> provide cavalry rear guard protection to General Gregg's spent force.|$|E
50|$|The {{first issue}} opens with Julie Power apologizing to Phil Urich {{on her cell}} phone; Phil tries to {{convince}} her not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> rash <b>but</b> fails: Julie steps off a tall building, free falls, and then flies into the air. Shortly afterwards, both Phil and Mickey Musashi discuss Julie's actions and plan their next move.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the day of}} the shooting, a {{grandfather}} of one of the murdered Amish girls was heard warning some young relatives not to hate the killer, saying, [...] "We must not think evil of this man." [...] Another Amish father noted, [...] "He had a mother and a wife and a soul and now he's standing before a just God." [...] Jack Meyer, a member of the Brethren community living near the Amish in Lancaster County, explained: [...] "I don't think there's anybody here that wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> forgive and not only reach out to those who have suffered a loss in that way but {{to reach out to the}} family of the man who committed these acts." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2011, Kiss began {{recording}} {{a new album}} due for release later in the year. Simmons stated, the album [...] "is gonna be the next step to Sonic Boom. Very similar– straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, no nothing, just rock." [...] The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: [...] "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>But</b> analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible. You need tubes, electricity and thick wood to make that thick sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1799, Byron {{entered the}} school of William Glennie, an Aberdonian in Dulwich. Glennie was Byron's first [...] "serious teacher", but also one with whom Catherine Gordon would {{constantly}} squabble, especially over the control of her son's schedule. Catherine's actions alienated her from both Glennie and Lord Carlisle, with Byron unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> observe. Regardless of his suffering, Byron was able to perform his [...] "first dash into poetry" [...] in 1800; he wrote a love poem in honour of his cousin, Margaret Parker, [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} of evanescent beings"., and she would inspire another poem two years later when she {{died at the age of}} 15. Byron also refused to let his lameness prevent him from participating in any of the usual physical activities that schoolboys engage in, and on one occasion threw his leg brace into a pond in defiance.|$|E
30|$|Three Honda cars, one {{conventional}} (the Civic 2.0) and two hybrids (the Civic IMA and the Civic Hybrid), {{equipped to}} collect emissions {{as well as}} the engine and vehicle working parameters were driven three times by twenty drivers on the same urban route. Drivers were asked to drive normally and not requested <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> special <b>but</b> <b>to</b> scrupulously follow the given itinerary.|$|R

2500|$|Lodi {{returned}} to on 13 December. At some point Lieutenant de vaisseau [...] M. Pierre Isaac Taupier replaced Lafosse. Willaumez then {{sent her to}} take up a station below Fort Bizoton. Next, he had Lodi take 100 men to Léogâne, to clear the rebels from the shore front. Lodi arrived too late <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> immediately, <b>but</b> with the arrival of further reinforcements, the rebels were dispersed.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 August the Soviet Central Front resumed its {{offensive}} against Army Group Centre striking the 9th at Karachev and the 2nd German Armies at Sevsk {{and east of}} Klintsy securing a deep penetration. This eventually forced Kluge and Manstein to ask permission to withdraw to more secure defensive positions. Retreat to the Dnepr River was now inevitable the only question, would this happen {{at a time of}} their choosing or be a headlong flight.The constant fighting never allowed Hitler to build up a reserve large enough to regain the upper hand in the east. Employing the peculiar rippling effect that marked its offensives, the Red Army, thwarted in one place, had shifted to others. For {{the first time in the}} war it had the full strategic initiative, and it grasped it jealously without regard for economy of effort, tactical sophistication, or the danger of overreaching itself. The failure of [...] "Zitadel" [...] doomed the Germans to the loss of operational initiative on the Eastern Front without any hope of regaining it, although Hitler seems to have been unaware or unwilling to recognizing this reality. The terrible losses in manpower that the Germans suffered in July and August were ultimately fatal and left the armies of Army Group South and Centre too weak <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> delay the inevitable. Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev marked the first time in the war that the Germans were not able to defeat a major Soviet offensive during the summer months and regain their lost ground and the strategic initiative.|$|E
2500|$|The Diponegoro Division, {{according}} to Anderson and McVey, comprised {{a greater percentage}} of ethnic Javanese people than other units in the Indonesian Army. Compared to neighboring West Java and East Java, the region of Central Java, where the Diponegoro Division was headquartered, experienced a more traditional culture. Because the region [...] "has been for centuries the seat of political power in Java", residents believed that its position [...] "has been usurped by Djakarta". This inequality resulted in a hostility between officers who held traditional Javanese values and the revolutionary movement in high esteem and officers of the Army General Staff who were more [...] "intellectual" [...] and educated in the ways of the Dutch. Anderson and McVey observed that the more traditional officers believed [...] "soldiering itself is less a matter of techniques and skills, than the development of moral and spiritual faculties through a kind of modernized asceticism". Officers of the Diponegoro Division had a number of sympathizers throughout several military branches inside and outside the capital city, including Lieutenant Colonel Untung Syamsuri of the presidential guard. Fueled by rumors that members of the General Staff had been working with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, a group of officers from the Diponegoro Division plotted to conduct a series of raids to kidnap members of the General Staff to either be held as hostages or killed. They believed that President Sukarno, whom Untung would warn of an impending coup by the Army General Staff, would be persuaded to support the Diponegoro coup group while the Army was [...] "too decimated in its top leadership <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> acquiesce".|$|E
