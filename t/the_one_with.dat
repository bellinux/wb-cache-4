5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category (first being the highest), with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Spanish rider Pedro Muñoz. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided {{the same way as}} the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing). Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the lowest total time.|$|E
5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis {{makes it easy to}} spot the navigator by being <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|Reed's {{leadership}} in dealmaking with Senate Republicans kept the 1956 {{version of the}} flag off Perdue's statewide referendum on the flag in 2003. The referendum was originally a two-part referendum pitting the 2001 version of the flag against the proposed version and conditional on failed ratification of a new flag considering other flags including the 1956 version. Under this format if the legislators did not approve the newly designed flag over the existing one they could have pursued other designs including <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the controversial 1956 version of the flag. Reed and a contingent of black legislators from Atlanta limited the referendum to a single vote of preference between the 2003 version and the 2001 version.|$|E

5|$|The BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award is {{an award}} given {{annually}} {{as part of}} the BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremony each December. The award is given to the coach who was considered to have made the most substantative contribution to British sport in that year. The award is decided by a panel of over 30 sporting journalists. Each panellist votes for their top two choices; their first preference is awarded two points, and their second preference is awarded one point. The winning coach is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the largest points total. In the case of a points tie, the person chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve of constant width. Additionally, among the curves of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve of constant width.|$|E
5|$|The intergiro {{classification}} {{was marked}} by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro {{is similar to that}} of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled and the person with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey. Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the lowest total time.|$|E

5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{life-cycle}} {{assessment of}} bismuth {{will focus on}} solders, {{one of the major}} uses of bismuth, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the most complete information. The average primary energy use for solders is around 200 MJ per kg, with the high-bismuth solder (58% Bi) only 20% of that value, and three low-bismuth solders (2% to 5% Bi) running very close to the average. The global warming potential averaged 10 to 14kg carbon dioxide, with the high-bismuth solder about two-thirds of that and the low-bismuth solders about average. The acidification potential for the solders is around 0.9 to 1.1kg sulfur dioxide equivalent, with the high-bismuth solder and one low-bismuth solder only one-tenth of the average and the other low-bismuth solders about average.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} mallets {{used by the}} player could also vary as well. For most occasions, only one mallet is used but for other techniques, the player could use two mallets, one in each hand. An even more {{interesting}} technique uses only one balu but requires the player to play the agung in reverse order of pitches. Called patuy, this technique and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> two mallets are normally reserved only for competition and exhibition instances.|$|E

5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus The Big Show in a singles match. The buildup to the match began on September 9, 2004 during {{an episode of}} SmackDown!, where a Lumberjack match (a standard match where non-participating wrestlers prevent contestants from fleeing the ring) was scheduled between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The match ended in a no contest when The Big Show marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process. The following week, Big Show was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle. Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it. After signing it, Angle and his associate Luther Reigns, threw Guerrero {{out of the ring}} and offered Big Show a handshake. Big Show, however, tore up Guerrero's contract and signed <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> Angle's name on it to face him at No Mercy.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{continues}} {{to pose a}} serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200million cubic meterssimilar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100km along river valleys.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his meeting}} with al-Muttaqi, al-Ikhshid {{returned}} to Egypt, leaving the field open for the ambitious Sayf al-Dawla. The Ikhshidid forces left behind in Syria were relatively weak, and the Hamdanid leader, having gained {{the support of the}} Banu Kilab, had little difficulty in capturing Aleppo on 29 October 944. He then began extending his control over the provinces of northern Syria down to Hims. Al-Ikhshid sent an army under the eunuchs Abu al-Misk Kafur and Fatik against the Hamdanid, but it was defeated near Hama and retreated back to Egypt, abandoning Damascus and Palestine to the Hamdanids. Al-Ikhshid was then forced to once again campaign in person in April 945, {{but at the same time}} he sent envoys proposing to Sayf al-Dawla an agreement along the lines of <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>with</b> Ibn Ra'iq: the Hamdanid prince would get to keep northern Syria, while al-Ikhshid would pay him an annual tribute for the possession of Palestine and Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla refused and reportedly even boasted that he would conquer Egypt itself, but al-Ikhshid held the upper hand: his agents managed to bribe several Hamdanid leaders, and he won over the citizens of Damascus, who barred their gates before the Hamdanid and opened them for al-Ikhshid. The two armies met near Qinnasrin in May, where the Hamdanids were defeated. Sayf al-Dawla fled to Raqqa, leaving his capital Aleppo to be captured by al-Ikhshid.|$|E
