The product was developed {{as a result of}} understanding the various torque contributors to the bearing such as grease, seal and internal bearing geometry. The low torque grease has been developed by various fundamentals on tribo-meter along with design of low <b>torque</b> <b>seal</b> and optimization of internal geometry to improve fuel efficiency. The company spends 1% of its turnover on R & D activities with an eye on increasing it to 2% in coming years. The department is staffed by 115 experts and the new facility built in 2006 is in active growth mode. Thanks to the effort, 12 patents applications have successfully been made last year). The research work has been split into tribology (the lubrication science), advanced materials, advanced processes, product design, virtual simulation and testing. For simulation of actual work conditions there are 35 test rigs, which include four for railways.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a new design PTFE (Polythetrafluoroethylene) radial lip seal was {{experimentally}} investigated. The {{purpose of this}} work is to compare new design seal with respect to commercial elastomer lip seal regarding their frictional <b>torque</b> and <b>seal</b> life. For this purpose, a test system has been developed. In this test system a cylinder block is placed on four load cells to monitor the frictional <b>torque</b> generated between <b>seal</b> and counter face. Seals were tested for 100000 meter sliding distance at 1 m/s, 3 m/s, 5 m/s sliding speeds.

40|$|The {{effects of}} radial force (interface) {{produced}} by interference on the static contact properties and frictional {{characteristics of a}} radial lip seal are investigated by experimentally. For this reason, a test system has been developed. In this test system, a cylinder is placed on four load cells in order to monitor the friction <b>torque</b> generated between <b>seal</b> and counter face. A group of experiments are carried out with thermoplastic polyurethane radial lip seals. Three different inner diameters (40, 39. 80 and 39. 60 mm) are selected and the seals are tested under 0. 5 and 0. 3 bar for a short period. The frictional torque was measured and compared for different inner diameters. As a result, {{it is observed that}} the amount of interference effects <b>seal</b> friction <b>torques</b> based on <b>seal</b> material and seal design in different ratios. ...|$|R

40|$|Compliant {{contacting}} filament seals such as {{brush seals}} {{are well known}} to give improved leakage performance and hence specific fuel consumption benefit compared to labyrinth seals. The design of the brush seal must be robust {{across a range of}} operating pressures, rotor speeds, and radial build-offset tolerances. Importantly the wear characteristics of the seal must be well understood to allow a secondary air system suitable for operation over the entire engine life to be designed. A test rig at the University of Oxford is described which was developed for the testing of brush seals at engine-representative speeds, pressures, and seal housing eccentricities. The test rig allows the leakage, torque, and temperature rise in the rotor to be characterized as functions of the differential pressure(s) across the seal and the speed of rotation. Tests were run on two different geometries of bristle pack with conventional, passive, and active pressure-balanced backing ring configurations. Comparison of the experimental results indicates that the hysteresis inherent in conventional brush seal design could compromise performance (due to increased leakage) or life (due to exacerbated wear) as a result of reduced compliance. The inclusion of active pressure-balanced backing rings in the seal designs are shown to alleviate the problem of bristle–backing ring friction, but this is associated with increased blow-down forces which could result in a significant seal-life penalty. The best performing seal was concluded to be the passive pressure-balanced configuration, which achieves the best compromise between leakage and <b>seal</b> <b>torque.</b> <b>Seals</b> incorporating passive pressure-balanced backing rings are also shown to have improved heat transfer performance in comparison to other design...|$|R
50|$|Mercedes used {{a system}} {{similar to the}} VW Autostick, called Hydrak. Hydrak had one major flaw: the oil supply for the <b>torque</b> {{converter}} was <b>sealed</b> within the converter itself and did not circulate via a pump, and also had no oil cooler. Idling in gear for even short periods would overheat the oil and burn up the seals in the converter, which would then need to be replaced.|$|R

In order to solve the existing problem of oil-allocating for rotating hydraulic cylinder of power chuck, a new kind of rotating hydraulic cylinder based on hydraulic slipring is suggested. The deep circular groove oil film face seal technology is applied in the hydraulic slipring for oil transmission. Taking account of the vary of viscosity, the frictional <b>torque</b> of the <b>seal</b> face is simulated in detail. The experiment data prove the preciseness of the theoretical analysis. These theories provide reference for the practical application of the rotating hydraulic cylinder...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tubular buckled inside {{wellbore}} {{section of}} oil or gas wells may cause problems such as: Casing wear/failure, Eliminates {{the transmission of}} axial load to the Bit, Drillpipe fatigue, Bit direction change, Severe drag and <b>torque,</b> Tubing <b>seal</b> failure, Connection failure. According to what mentioned above, {{it would be necessary}} to make an investigation on the effect of drag and/or torque on buckling of tubular inside horizontal wellbore (the so-called torque-drag-buckling relationship), the study depends mainly on conducting experimental tests and develop Finite Element Model, and utilize the results to predict the tubular behavior under different circumstances of torque and drag, also these results were compared and verified with some of theoretical approaches. Results obtained from this study indicates that torsion load had a little effect on buckling of tubular in horizontal section, this effect increase with decrease in pipe stiffness. Helical buckling tends to increase highly drag force, and thus eliminates transmission of axial load to the bit. Drag force tend to increase with torsion load as a result drag increase helical buckling. For prediction of helical buckling Lubinski and Woods, Gao Deli and Chen et. al provided a good agreement with one-end hinge condition, and Dellinger equation is the best for two-end hinge boundary condition...|$|R
40|$|Home canners and {{extension}} home economists have inquired frequently why much liquid is sometimes lost from glass jars of food processed in the pressure cooker. At an extension service Home Canning Research Conference held at Kansas City, December, 1946, state extension agents requested {{research on this}} home canning problem, because no published reports were available. This bulletin is a report of experiments with glass jars processed in a pressure cooker to determine (1) conditions that allow much liquid to be expelled from jars, (2) conditions that reduce liquid loss to a negligible amount, and (3) the physical conditions involved {{in the loss of}} liquid from jars. Liquid loss was considered to depend possibly upon {{some or all of the}} following factors encountered in home canning: cooker pressure, jar size, jar contents, headspace above contents in jars, type of closure and <b>seal,</b> and <b>sealing</b> <b>torque.</b> Experiments were designed to vary these factors in order to obtain information on liquid loss...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{it has been}} {{progressively}} acknowledged that reducing the specific fuel consumption and the emission of pollutants as well as improving the thrust-to-weight ratio involves extensive research on advanced sealing technologies. Amongst these, brush seals are particularly well considered for their excellent leakage performance, their low friction properties, {{and their ability to}} cope with inevitable rotor excursions during flights. This thesis presents the experimental work that has been carried on in order to characterize carbon brush seals performance in function of the bristle pack geometry and the operating conditions. The analyzed parameters are the bristle free length, the density, and the inter-platedistance. The work, performed by the ULB in collaboration with French engine manufacturer Safran Aircraft Engines, provides first, a description of the test installation that reproduces accurately the severe working conditions encountered in a bearing chamber. A total of eight samples were submitted to extensive testing, and allowed to perform a qualitative analysis of the main performance indicators of a brush seal: the leakage flow, and the <b>seal</b> <b>torque.</b> Complex phenomena acting on the bristle pack were put in evidence under the effect of differential pressure androtation speed, and oil, which fundamentally deteriorate the leakage performance of a brush seal. Subsequently, performance models were developed through empirical correlations, based on the experimental data. They predict the leakage flow and the <b>seal</b> <b>torque</b> {{as a function of the}} geometrical parameters and operating conditions. In addition, hysteresis issues were also addressed, and an IR camera helped investigating the heat generation properties of a brush seal. Brush seal samples were submitted to endurance testing, in order to highlight wear mechanisms, and study the performance degradation with the operating time. Oil plays a major part in extending brush seals operating life, despite the leakage performance degradation. Finally, the correlations developed throughout the PhD thesis were used to develop an optimization process in function of the operating conditions of a modern aero-engine. Ultimately, large savings in air consumption were put in evidence when replacing labyrinth seals by brush seals.

40|$|The {{effects of}} face coning on seal {{performance}} are evaluated with particular {{regard to the}} energy saving potential of convex conedface end seals as indicated by torque reduction. Experiments were conducted using a conventional carbon flat-face pusher-type seal, a coned-face pusher-type seal, coned-face bellows-type seal, and a modified coned-face pusher-type seal intended for dynamically unstable operation, with shaft rotation at up to 8000 rpm, pressures of up to 2758 kPa, and a petroleum-based turbine oil as lubricant. <b>Torque</b> at the <b>seal</b> interface {{is found to be}} reduced by 42 % when the standard flat-face seal is replaced by a coned seal, although the leakage of the cone-face seal was 11 times greater. Reduction of seal balance from 76. 1 to 51. 3 % resulted in an additional 44 % reduction in torque, although at the expense of excessive leakage, but did not produce unstable operation. Face temperatures were reduced by 33 - 56 C and wear was also reduced greatly on the cone face seals. Seal performance is noted to be in agreement with analytical calculations...|$|R
