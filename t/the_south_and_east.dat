5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 16th century, trade {{networks}} connecting Nablus to Damascus and Cairo were supplemented by the establishment of trading posts in the Hejaz and Gulf regions to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east,</b> {{as well as in}} the Anatolian Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands of Crete and Cyprus.

5|$|People {{from the}} {{overpopulated}} western highlands and the underdeveloped north {{are moving to}} the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment.

5|$|The {{locations}} of the station entrances are all south of 96th Street. In 2009, there was a debate over {{the placement of the}} location of the street entrances. Because 96th Street divides the neighborhoods of the Upper East Side to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>East</b> Harlem to the north, some residents of East Harlem stated that their neighborhood was not served by the Second Avenue Subway.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the railway {{dramatically}} ended Chesham's isolation.

5|$|To {{remain on}} the Arms Park site, {{additional}} space had to be found to allow safe access and to provide room for the increased capacity and improved facilities.

5|$|To {{the north}} of Edinburgh lay the marshy Nor Loch, formed in the early 15th century in the {{depression}} where Princes Street Gardens are now laid out. This natural defence was augmented by the steep slope up to {{the northern edge of}} the Old Town. Edinburgh Castle, on its rocky outcrop, defended the western approach. Walls were therefore needed primarily on <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east</b> sides of the burgh.|$|E
5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east,</b> and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, a bypass of {{downtown}} South Haven was built; the former route of US31 {{through the heart}} of the city was designated Bus. US31 at that time. After the war, the route of US31 north of Charlevoix was realigned to follow the shoreline; this section opened by the middle of 1949. The route of the highway between Holland and West Olive was changed to run on a more angular course northwesterly in 1950. A few years later, a bypass to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east</b> of Holland opened and the former route through down was redesignated as a business loop in 1954.|$|E

The 2040 Master Plan developed by OCX has a loop route around <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east</b> sides of the Kissimmee-St.Cloud area.

5|$|In {{the last}} years of the ninth century, three sub-ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred. Æthelflæd's uncle, Æthelwulf, {{controlled}} western and possibly central Mercia, while <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east</b> were ruled by Æthelfrith, the father of Æthelstan Half-King. Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. Æthelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded {{after the turn of the}} century, and Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd's chief lieutenant when Æthelred's health collapsed soon afterwards. Keynes sees Æthelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin, probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.|$|E

5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) at Big Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east,</b> {{the other to the}} west.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1October Valckenier {{received}} reports that a crowd of a thousand Chinese had gathered outside the gate, angered by his statements at the emergency meeting five days earlier. This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> <b>east</b> sides of the city, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
5|$|Palatial squares were {{developed}} for the prosperous middle classes.
