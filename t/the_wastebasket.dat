2500|$|Another {{scene that}} was in {{an earlier version of}} the script had young George visiting his father at his work. After George tells off Mr. Potter and closes the door, he {{considers}} asking Uncle Billy about his drugstore dilemma. Billy is talking on the phone to the bank examiner, and lights his cigar and throws his match in <b>the</b> <b>wastebasket.</b> This scene explains that Tilly (short for Matilda) and Eustace are both his cousins (not Billy's kids though), and Tilly is on the phone with her friend Martha and says, [...] "Potter's here, the bank examiner's coming. It's a day of judgment." [...] As George is about to interrupt Tilly on the phone, Billy cries for help and Tilly runs in and puts the fire out with a pot of coffee. George decides he is probably better off dealing with the situation by himself.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Lisa is {{assigned}} to write a report on what Springfield will look like in the year 2059. When she discovers online reports about soap for drinks instead of water, a world war over a tiny drop of oil, a parking lot yet to be filled forever and the last polar bear committing suicide by hanging himself, she is filled with anxiety and depression and terrifies her classmates with her dark visions of the oceans rising from global warming, turning humanity and the lowlands into a desert and darkness falling upon Nineveh. Homer and Marge take her to a psychiatrist, who prescribes Lisa [...] "happy pills" [...] known as [...] "Ignorital". Lisa is initially skeptical, but after taking her first pill she loses touch with her problems and sees pollution (as well as everything else) as smiley faces. In her love-induced stupor, she nearly kisses a running fan held by Maggie, until Marge finally intervenes by deciding that she wants Lisa back to normal, and should not take the pills anymore. She tosses them in <b>the</b> <b>wastebasket,</b> where they are promptly eaten by Santa's Little Helper. [...] When Maggie (most likely doing it intentionally) holds the fan up to him, he (off screen) licks the fan himself.|$|E

He campaigned on a nationalist platform, arguing for an enlarged Self-Defence Force, to amend Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution (which outlawed war as a means to settling international disputes), and to revive Japanese patriotism, especially in reverence for the Emperor. [...] He entered the Diet of Japan {{as a member of the}} House of Representatives for the Democratic Party.

40|$|Graduation Date: 1973 The {{process of}} {{biological}} nitrogen fixation involves the enzymic reduction of atmospheric nitrogen (N₂) to ammonia (NH₃). The enzyme which catalyzes this reduction, nitrogenase, does not exhibit {{a high degree of}} substrate specificity. It also catalyzes the reduction of acetylene (C₂ 2 H₂) to ethylene (C₂H₄). The reduction of C₂H₂ to C₂H₄ coupled with gas chromatography has been widely used as a method of measuring nitrogenase activity. In this investigation, the acetylene reduction assay was adapted for the measurement of nitrogenase activity of intact nodulated cultures of legumes. An advantage of the method is that cultures may be assayed for nitrogenase activity in situ without serious damage to the plants. Entire cultures were placed in polyethylene wastebaskets and then were exposed to acetylene after sealing <b>the</b> <b>wastebaskets</b> with plastic lids. Time course experiments showed that rates of acetylene reduction were linear for periods of at least two hours. The correlation coefficient between rates of acetylene reduction and nodule fresh weight was 0. 79. Acetylene reduction rates of either intact nodulated plants in Per lite or nodulated root systems removed from the Per lite were approximately 40...|$|R

500|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, Acrocanthosaurus and most other large theropods were known from only fragmentary remains, leading to highly {{variable}} classifications for this genus. J.
