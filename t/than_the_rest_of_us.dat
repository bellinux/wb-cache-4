500|$|Since the {{departure}} of founder member Barrett in 1968, the burden of lyrical composition had fallen mostly on Waters. He is therefore credited {{as the author of}} the album's lyrics, making The Dark Side of the Moon the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited to him alone. [...] The band were so confident {{of the quality of the}} words that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve. [...] "Roger's concerns in it are not out of date," [...] remarked Gilmour on the album's twentieth anniversary. [...] "He did a fantastic job with those words. Then, Roger was always more verbal <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> who had no great confidence in our lyric-writing. Probably, in hindsight, we should have stuck at it: the roots of our problems were being set back then. But we all got the credit and money that we were happy with." ...|$|E
500|$|The Fifth Elegy {{is largely}} {{inspired}} by Pablo Picasso's 1905 Rose Period painting, Les Saltimbanques ("The Acrobats", {{also known as}} [...] "The Family of Saltimbanques") in which Picasso depicts six figures pictured [...] "in {{the middle of a}} desert landscape and it is impossible to say whether they are arriving or departing, beginning or ending their performance." [...] Rilke depicted the six artists about to begin their performance, and that they were used as a symbol of [...] "human activity... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> whose fleetingness was lamented." [...] Further, Rilke in the poem described these figures as standing on a [...] "threadbare carpet" [...] to suggest [...] "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will... before their 'pure too-little' had passed into 'empty too-much.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesnâ€™t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.|$|E
2500|$|Head's {{unwillingness to}} be wrong was not always of benefit to him. One day a fellow of his, William Bullock, decided to test the extent of Head's 'omnipotence'. Asking the doctor at lunch whether he had read Hagenheimer's new book on {{locomotor}} ataxia. Head replied he had only had time to glance at it. Bullock commented, [...] "Well, you have done better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> There is no such book." [...] While this experience would appear more 'uncomfortable' than harmful, Head's need to be certain did prove a hindrance when his sensations were being tested by Rivers in their 'Human Experiment in Nerve Division'. As is written in the report, if Head concentrated too closely on the task, his anxieties about being right tended to make him give the wrong answer. It was only when he forgot completely about the experiment that he managed to be precise about his sensations.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{considered}} the possibility {{at the end of}} the second season, Cleese left the Flying Circus {{at the end of the}} third. He later explained that he felt he no longer had anything fresh to offer the show, and claimed that only two Cleese- and Chapman-penned sketches in the third series ("Dennis Moore" [...] and the [...] "Cheese Shop") were truly original, and that the others were bits and pieces from previous work cobbled together in slightly different contexts. He was also finding Chapman, who was at that point in the full throes of alcoholism, difficult to work with. According to an interview with Idle, [...] "It was on an Air Canada flight on the way to Toronto, when John (Cleese) turned to all of us and said 'I want out.' Why? I don't know. He gets bored more easily <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> He's a difficult man, not easy to be friendly with. He's so funny because he never wanted to be liked. That gives him a certain fascinating, arrogant freedom." ...|$|E
