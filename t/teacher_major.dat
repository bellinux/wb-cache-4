Although the new projects afe different in varying degrees from each olher, they differ most from traditional practices. This suggests. in turn, that college scienee courses for clcmcntary school teachers ought to be re-examined. Thc developers of thc new elementary ~cience curriculums have con:otidered, in one way or another, the question of how science should be leamed. Tbe problem has been cxamincd from tbrec perspcc-tives: tbe nature of tbe cbild, tbe char-ader of. science, and thc need for a tcaeb-ing style compatible with botb. There is as mucb coneern with lhe cognilive and affective devclopment of tbe cbild as tbere is witb bis knowing science. In otber words, how can we establish a broader base in the elementary school for provid-ing an education through science as weil as an edueation in science. Tbere are obvious diffcrences in degrees of emphasis among tbe curriculum projects on these positions, but none bave polarized. If scienee teaehing is to foster tbe intel-lectual growth of childrcn, there must be an emphasis upon developing: (I) obser-vational skills; (2) processes of investiga-tion; (3) systema 1 ic thinking; and (4) concept rormation. As pupils progress in ability to observe, to inquire, to think critically, and to form concepts, they are helped to find explanations by consider-ing such "ordering schemes " as inter-action, symmt:try, equilibrium, relativity, and invariance, among others.
