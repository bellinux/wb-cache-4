5|$|Many {{pictures}} {{depict the}} countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams. A particular {{feature is the}} use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. <b>The</b> <b>muted</b> or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} half of the eighteenth century there had been an {{increasing}} need for transport to exploit the coal reserves at Ashby Wolds and lime from the quarries north of Ashby-de-la-Zouch. The first proposal was for a canal running from Burton-on-Trent on the upper River Trent to Marston on the Coventry Canal. A second suggestion was for a canal from Ashby Wolds to the Coventry Canal at Griff. Both proposals were made in December 1781. The first was opposed by the Coventry company, though the second was not. Robert Whitworth had estimated the cost of the project at £46,396, but the scheme was dropped a year later. William Jessop proposed a canal and tramway between Breedon and the Trent, with a connecting link to the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1787, which also came to nothing. A proposal in 1790 was well received at the time, but opposition afterwards prevented a bill being submitted to Parliament. Another proposal for a canal northwards to the Trent at Burton was actively discussed between 1791 and 1793. There was wide support for a canal to Griff in 1792, but <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> support of Penn Assheton Curzon, a local landowner and Member of Parliament, led to it being dropped.|$|E
500|$|Potter {{declared}} the tale her next favorite to The Tailor of Gloucester. The pictures {{are some of}} the most beautiful Potter ever created, especially the profusions of flowers in the doorways and garden plots. [...] The colors in the illustrations are not <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> browns and greens the reader expects in a Potter illustration, nor are they the contrasting colors such as <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> reds and blues Potter uses occasionally to give her illustrations a splash of color. Instead, the colors are bright oranges, violets, and yellows seldom seen in her other books. Even Ribby's lilac dress and Duchess's black mane illustrate Potter's concern for color in this book.|$|E
500|$|... "On 'Gorgeous,' {{he treats}} his {{distorted}} vocals {{as if they}} were another instrument to be blended seamlessly into the mix alongside <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> electric guitar-riff. He spits: Penitentiary chances, the devil dances / and eventually answers to the call of autumn / all them fallin’, for the love of ballin’ / get caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin. This track is an excellent microcosm of the album because it exemplifies the pinnacle of Ye’s visionary talent.” ...|$|E

500|$|It is {{possible}} to see {{the degree to which}} the technique allowed Bouts, in the words of art historian Susan Jones, to [...] " [...] sophistication... to create both fine linear detail and subtle tonal transitions." [...] Jones notes that the sky would have appeared with the same clear and pale blue that is still intact in a narrow strip along the top of the work, which has been protected from light and dirt by a frame. In its current condition <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> landscape appears to echo the sorrow of the mourning figures.|$|E
500|$|Reporting from Cannes, The Guardians Peter Bradshaw {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "bizarre and lugubrious, but mesmeric", and praised <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> performance of Agi Szirtes {{in the role of}} Brown's wife as [...] "strangely compelling". Reviewing the film following its theatrical release, he found the dubbed dialogue affected and odd, the score doom-laden, the occasional humour mordant, and the cinematography mesmerising, remarking that net effect was [...] "unsettling, sometimes absurd, sometimes stunning". Ed Gonzalez of The Village Voice concluded that the film [...] "stands as an example of style for the sake of pure and intense but dispassionate style".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his 1950s productions, several of Cartier's later works have also been regarded as influential. His 1962 production of Wuthering Heights was praised by Dennis Potter, then a television critic, who wrote in the Daily Herald newspaper that the production [...] "was like a thunderstorm on the flat, dreary plains of the week's television... The howl of the wind against the windows, <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> pain of Claire Bloom as the wretched Cathy, and the hunted misery of Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, made this a more than adequate offering of a great work." [...] While Screenonline states that Lee Oswald—Assassin (1966) [...] "could be argued [...] of historical interest only", due to its basis in the flawed Warren Commission report, The Times praised it as being [...] "possibly the first drama-documentary".|$|E

500|$|Changeling was {{director}} of photography Tom Stern's sixth film with Eastwood. Despite <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> palette, the film is more colorful than some previous Stern–Eastwood collaborations. Stern referenced a large book of period images. He attempted to evoke Conrad Hall's work on Depression-set film The Day of the Locust, as well as match {{what he called the}} [...] "leanness" [...] of Mystic Rivers look. Stern said the challenge was to make Changeling as simple as possible to shoot. To focus more on Jolie's performance, he tended to avoid the use of fill lighting. Eastwood did not want the flashbacks to Northcott's ranch to be too much like a horror film—he said the focus of the scene was the effect of the crimes on Sanford Clark—so he avoided graphic imagery in favor of casting the murders in shadow.|$|E
500|$|The speech {{received}} [...] "relatively little {{coverage from}} the media", Time magazine claimed 20 years later. John Kornblum, senior US diplomat in Berlin {{at the time}} of Reagan's speech, and US Ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001, said [...] " [...] wasn't really elevated to its current status until 1989, after the wall came down." [...] <b>The</b> <b>muted</b> response in the Western media contrasted with the reaction from the East: East German Politburo member Günter Schabowski considered the speech to be [...] "absurd", and the Soviet press agency TASS accused Reagan of giving an [...] "openly provocative, war-mongering speech." [...] Ironically, it was Schabowski who {{two and a half years}} later, on the 9th November 1989, became the person to open the wall by providing a slightly mistaken answer on a press conference about changes in travel regulations for East German citizens.|$|E
500|$|Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore, one of Denmark's {{most popular}} works, was painted in 1892. It shows Marie {{standing}} on the beach with Rap by her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea. She is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under {{the light of the}} setting sun. The painting is one of the works in which Krøyer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called [...] "l'heure bleue" [...] (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a blue tint over the landscape. The Symbolists believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, but the horizon rises above her head, emphasizing her radiance against <b>the</b> <b>muted,</b> nearly monochrome background.|$|E

50|$|Like many {{animated}} series {{created by}} Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a studio-created laugh track, and indeed, {{it was one}} of the first such productions to do so. Syndicated versions on Cartoon Network and Boomerang have <b>the</b> track <b>muted.</b>|$|R
500|$|Like in the song, in {{the music}} video Björk is {{depicted}} as [...] "Mother Oceania". The video opens with {{the surface of a}} body of water appearing yellowish and bright. Camera pans down to darker, deeper waters. Björk appears out of the dark background, singing and covered with sparkling jewels. As the second verse begins, images of jellyfish, representing the continents (her children) are thrown from Björk's hands. During the third verse they swim around and away from their mother, carried by the currents, which move in time with the song. In the bridge section, new sea flowers, with brilliant colors, emerge from the background, in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> and darker colors of previous scenes. As the fifth verse continues, the camera pans back up to the much lighter surface, not seen {{since the beginning of the}} video. All sorts of marine life are swimming about the surface. Shortly after the sixth verse begins, Bjork is shown in deep, dark water. Several seconds later, the lighter surface of the water is shown without her. When she begins to sing [...] "Your sweat is salty", a somewhat rapid alternation of images ensues: the light surface is shown for one second, followed by Björk singing in the deep water; these scenes alternate until she stops singing during the coda. Björk's vocal repetition ceases at the same time the visual alternation stops. The surface scene recedes, and Björk in the deep water comes to the fore, slowing. At the end of the video, she stands and smiles.|$|E
2500|$|On {{more formal}} outings the coat was worn {{with a pair}} of {{cashmere}} striped morning trousers: (cashmere stripes refers to <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> design in black, silver and charcoal grey, not the fibres of the cloth.) However, trousers of muted checks were also worn in slightly more informal situations. [...] In keeping with the rules set for morning dress, trousers matching the coat were considered a somewhat less formal alternative.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} doleful tone, Gunsmoke was {{distinct}} from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, {{and due to}} the outstanding sound effects, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered, giving the show a spacious feel. John Dunning wrote, [...] "The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking." ...|$|E
50|$|Calopteryx is a genus {{of large}} damselflies {{belonging}} to the family Calopterygidae.

In both sexes, there is no pterostigma.|$|R

2500|$|Kid A {{surprised}} listeners who expected more of {{the rock}} music of Radiohead's earlier albums. Months before its release, Melody Maker wrote: [...] "If there's one band that promises to return rock to us, it's Radiohead." [...] After it had been played for critics, the Guardian wrote: [...] "The first time you hear Kid A... you'll probably scratch your head and think, huh? What are they on about? For starters, why are the guitars only on three songs? What's with all <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> electronic hums, pulses and tones? And why is Thom Yorke's voice completely indistinguishable {{for most of the}} time?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{movement}} is in 5/4 time and marked andante, un poco mosso. The slow movement features solos by the English horn, flute, and E-flat clarinet. The piece, which tries to emulate a flier at night, {{is based on}} a slow ostinato 5/4 rhythm that is first played by <b>the</b> <b>muted</b> cellos and basses. The English horn enters over the accompaniment to perform a [...] "lonely" [...] melody in 4/4 time. The juxtaposition of time signatures creates an oscillating rhythmic counterpoint that helps propel the movement forward. The second {{movement is}} the shortest movement in the work, lasting around seven minutes. The work was later revised and edited to stand alone as Night Flight, a tone poem for orchestra.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{works for}} the theater were a score for Euripides' The Bacchae (2009, {{directed}} by JoAnne Akalaitis), and Kepler (2009), yet another operatic biography of a scientist or explorer. The opera {{is based on the}} life of 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler, against the background of the Thirty Years' War, with a libretto compiled from Kepler's texts and poems by his contemporary Andreas Gryphius. It is Glass's first opera in German, and was premiered by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and Dennis Russell Davies in September 2009. LA Times critic Mark Swed and others described the work as [...] "oratorio-like"; Swed pointed out the work is Glass's [...] "most chromatic, complex, psychological score" [...] and [...] "the orchestra dominates (...) I was struck by <b>the</b> <b>muted,</b> glowing colors, the character of many orchestral solos and the poignant emphasis on bass instruments".|$|E
50|$|In 1964, Elektra Records {{produced}} a compilation album of various artists entitled, The Blues Project, which featured several white musicians from the Greenwich Village area who played acoustic blues {{music in the}} style of black musicians. One of the featured artists on the album was a young guitarist named Danny Kalb, who was paid $75 for his two songs. Not long after the album's release, however, Kalb gave up his acoustic guitar for an electric one. The Beatles' arrival in the United States earlier in <b>the</b> year <b>muted</b> <b>the</b> folk and acoustic blues movement that had swept the US in the early 1960s.|$|R
