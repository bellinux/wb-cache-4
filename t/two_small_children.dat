By 1906, {{he was in a}} {{position}} to buy his own small farm, where he grew chickpeas. The next year was tragic for Obregón as his wife and two of his children died, leaving him a widower with <b>two</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> who were henceforth raised by his three older sisters. In 1909, Obregón invented a chickpea harvester and soon founded a company to manufacture these harvesters, complete with a modern assembly line.

Immediately following the escape, McFarlane and other prisoners commandeered a remote farmhouse near Dromore, County Down, and held the family inside hostage. Although he took a map and compass, and other items from the premises, none of the family members, which included <b>two</b> <b>small</b> <b>children</b> and a baby, were harmed. He and the other former escapees made their way across the Irish border and went on the run.|$|E

25|$|She was 28, {{six years}} older than Crosby, with <b>two</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> and married. No matter what Crosby tried, Polly would not divorce Richard and marry him. Crosby took a job in Boston at the Shawmut National Bank, a job he disliked, and took the train to visit Polly in New York. In May 1921, when Polly would not respond to his demands, Crosby {{threatened}} suicide if Polly did not marry him. Polly's husband Richard Peabody {{was in and out}} of sanitariums several times fighting alcoholism. In June 1921, she formally separated from him. Later that winter, Polly accepted weekend visits from Crosby, who would take the midnight train home to Boston afterward. In December, Polly's husband Richard offered to divorce her, and in February 1922, their marriage was legally ended.|$|E
25|$|The second arc called The Underground Empire Yomi Arc {{appeared}} in Weekly Shōnen Magazine (Kodansha) alongside {{the release of}} the film version. The story is highly influenced by Edgar Rice Burroughs' Earth's Core series, including an expedition {{to the center of the}} Earth with a drill tank and a reptile race who can use telepathy and grow wings. The story ends with the final battle against Black Ghost. In the final scene, 009 and 002 fall into Earth's atmosphere and are seen as a shooting star by <b>two</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> one who wishes for a toy gun the other for world peace (a scene reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's Kaleidoscope). This point was the intended finish for the series; however popular demand necessitated the two heroes be rescued. As such, 001 was able at the last minute of using his telekinetic powers to retrieve 002 and 009 from their plummet before death.|$|E

The scene pans out, and has Amuro exit her home (which is near a flower bouquet stand) with her friends surprising her on her birthday. After taking selfies, Amuro and two female bake-up dancers dance to the remaining part of the chorus. Amuro runs to a dressing room and picks out a pink mini-dress.

Amuro and the back-up dancers perform during the last chorus, with the camera zooming out; the final scene has everyone putting their hands up, as the locations Amuro visited are circulated around a circle stage.|$|E

25|$|Five {{days after}} the wedding, Jim {{received}} his draft notice. He was sent to France and became part of a military touring group that entertained the armed forces after World War I. When Jim came home from France, he and Marian decided to try their luck with a vaudeville act. They had two children, Kathryn Therese Jordan (1920–2007) and James Carroll Jordan (1923–1998), both born in Peoria. Marian returned home {{for the birth of}} Kathryn but went back to performing with Jim, leaving her daughter with Jim's parents. After Jim Jr. was born in 1923, Marian stayed with the children for a time, while Jim performed as a solo act. Marian and the children joined him on the road for a short time, but the couple had to admit defeat when they found themselves in Lincoln, Illinois in 1923 with <b>two</b> <b>small</b> <b>children</b> and no funds. The couple's parents had to wire them money for their return to Peoria. Jim went to work at a local department store but still felt the attraction of being in show business. He and Marian went back into vaudeville.|$|E
25|$|Conspiring {{with his}} mentor Gilliam and second-in-command Edgar, Curtis Everett plans {{to lead the}} tail {{passengers}} in a revolt that will take {{them all the way}} up to the engine. Mason and armed guards come to take <b>two</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed, taking the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu and his clairvoyant daughter Yona from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder under Mason's orders; after a bloody battle Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya, Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey continue on with her as a hostage.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{two groups}} sent north led by Wilson Zimba was to attack the {{headquarters}} of the Magomero estate, which also stored rifles for part of the Nyasaland Volunteer Reserve. The other group under Jonathon Chigwinya was to attack the Mwanje plantation, a part of the Magomero estate some distance from the headquarters. There would normally have been three European men at the headquarters, William Jervis Livingstone, his assistant Duncan MacCormick (also from the Isle of Lismore) and J T Roach, the Australian estate engineer. But this night Roach was absent. There were also four European women and five children there. Zimba’s men surrounded Livingstone’s house and waited until the family retired for the night at around 9 pm, when several of them broke in, attacked Livingstone with spears and severely wounded him while he attempted to defend himself, using his rifle as a club. He was apparently still alive when he was decapitated with an axe in front of his wife and <b>two</b> <b>small</b> <b>children</b> in their family bedroom. Duncan MacCormick lived alone in a small cottage a few hundred yards from Livingstone's main estate house. His cottage was not surrounded before the attack on Livingstone, but when MacCormick became aware of the commotion, he ran to investigate without arming himself with his rifle and was speared to death. Roach’s house was attacked after the deaths of Livingstone and MacCormick. When he was found to be absent, two rifles and ammunition he kept there were taken. The whole attack on the headquarters was over by 9.30 pm.|$|E

The wing planform remained the same (constant 64" [...] chord from centerline to 100 in out, then straight taper to 44" [...] chord at 208 inches from centerline), but the semi-Fowler flaps (slotted, rear-moving) were extended outboard, from Wing Station 100 to Wing Station 122, which allowed a lower landing speed (FAA certification regulations state that a single-engined aircraft must have a flaps-down, power-off stall speed no greater than 70 miles/hour). To compensate for the reduced aileron span, the aileron profile was changed and its chord enlarged.
