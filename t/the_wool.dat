5|$|During the Middle Ages {{sheep farming}} for <b>the</b> <b>wool</b> trade came to {{dominate}} the economy of Exmoor. <b>The</b> <b>wool</b> was spun into thread on isolated farms and collected by merchants to be woven, fulled, dyed and finished in thriving towns such as Dunster. The land started to be enclosed and from the 17th century onwards larger estates developed, leading to establishment of areas of large regular shaped fields. During this period a Royal Forest and hunting ground was established, administered by the Warden. The Royal Forest was sold off in 1818.|$|E

On July 16 of that year the palace of <b>the</b> <b>wool</b> guild caught fire and everything from the ground floor up was destroyed, prompting <b>the</b> <b>wool</b> guild to reconstruct a new palatial residence on a larger scale and with stone vaults leading up to the roof.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the front}} matter and Chapter 1 of my PhD thesis Understanding <b>the</b> World <b>Wool</b> Market: Trade, Productivity and Grower Incomes, UWA, 2006. The full thesis is {{available}} as Discussion Papers 06. 19 to 06. 24. The core {{objective of this}} thesis is summarised by its title: “Understanding <b>the</b> World <b>Wool</b> Market: Trade, Productivity and Grower Incomes”. Thus, we wish to aid understanding of the economic mechanisms by which <b>the</b> world <b>wool</b> market operates. In doing so, we analyse two issues – trade and productivity – and their effect on, inter alia, grower incomes. To achieve the objective, we develop a novel analytical framework, or model. The model combines two long and rich modelling traditions: the partial-equilibrium commodity-specific approach and the computable-general-equilibrium approach. The result is a model that represents <b>the</b> world <b>wool</b> market in detail, tracking the production of greasy wool through five off-farm production stages ending in <b>the</b> production of <b>wool</b> garments. ...|$|R
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'.

40|$|Homogeneity of {{the primary}} layer in mineral wool {{production}} process is required for high quality products. State-of-the-art measurement techniques {{for the evaluation of}} primary layer homogeneity are very slow and can only be applied after the product is manufactured. We present here a method that enables on-line monitoring and control and is based on experimental modeling using neural networks. The experimental method is based on image acquisition and image processing of <b>the</b> mineral <b>wool</b> primary layer structure. As a estimator of <b>the</b> mineral <b>wool</b> primary layer structure and quality, the weight of <b>the</b> primary <b>wool</b> layer is used, measured by an on- line weighting device in four locations of the conveyor belt. The instrumentation of on- line weighting device was upgraded for {{the purpose of the present}} experiment and enabled high speed acquisition of all measurement channels. The structure of <b>the</b> mineral <b>wool</b> primary layer was measured by visualization of the modified entrance to the on- line balance using a CCD camera. All data channels were simultaneously sampled. Radial basis neural networks are used for prediction. The structure of <b>the</b> mineral <b>wool</b> primary layer is predicted on the basis of experimentally provided weights data. The learning set consists of weights- images pairs. The prediction of <b>the</b> mineral <b>wool</b> primary layer structure consists of providing only weights. A good agreement between statistical properties of measured and modeled structures of <b>the</b> primary <b>wool</b> layer like spatial homogeneity of <b>the</b> primary mineral <b>wool</b> layer thickness, is shown. The results of the study confirm that the time- delayed vector of weights bears enough information for the monitoring of the production process. The modeling of primary mineral wool structure is of lesser quality due to high dimensionality of the modeled variable...|$|R
