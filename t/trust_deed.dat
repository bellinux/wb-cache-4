25|$|Constant {{court cases}} against Him: Swamiji {{had to face}} many court cases filed against him.

This meant that anybody could find any small fault in the {{execution}} of developmental programs under the trust and the blame would fall on him. Swamiji came clean in all these court cases.

25|$|After {{the union}} of 1900, the United Presbyterian Church and the {{continuing}} Free Church not only contested {{the legacy of the}} Free Church of 1843–1900, but also claimed its assets. After attempts at agreement failed, the matter ended in the Scottish courts. The litigation was initially decided in favour of the Free Church by the House of Lords in 1904, on the basis that {{in the absence of a}} power to change fundamental doctrines in the <b>trust</b> <b>deed,</b> a dissenting minority retains the property. As it was not possible for the Free Church to utilise all the property, Parliament intervened, generally securing for the church the congregational property she could effectively use plus a significant share of central assets.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} the Administration follows the {{detailed}} rules made by Swami Vivekananda {{when he was the}} General President of Ramakrishna Mission. These rules were formed when the monastic brothers in 1898 wished that there should be specific rules for the work of the Ramakrishna Mission (as the Ramakrishna Movement is commonly known). They were dictated by Swami Vivekananda to Swami Suddhananda, between 1898 and 1899, and has been accepted as the consensus of the opinion of all the monks of the Ramakrishna Mission then, consisting of all the disciples of Sri Ramakrishna and their disciples. Later for clear and formal legal confirmation of these rules, a <b>Trust</b> <b>Deed</b> was registered by Swami Vivekananda and many of the other disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, during 1899 – 1901.|$|E
25|$|Express trust: An {{express trust}} arises where a settlor {{deliberately}} and consciously decides {{to create a}} trust, over their assets, either now, or upon his or her later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a <b>trust</b> <b>deed.</b> Almost all trusts {{dealt with in the}} trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an express trust to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value, or is real estate.|$|E

25|$|The founders' {{financial}} and legal structure, {{adapted from the}} model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint stock corporation managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the <b>trust</b> <b>deed,</b> the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, {{but this was not}} evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model {{and the way in which}} plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Calvin Hoffman, {{author of}} The Man Who Was Shakespeare (1955), died in 1988, still {{absolutely}} convinced that Marlowe was the true author of Shakespeare's works. Anxious that the theory should not die with him, he left a substantial sum of money with the King's School, Canterbury—where Marlowe went as a boy—for them to administer an annual essay competition on this subject. The <b>Trust</b> <b>Deed</b> stipulated that the winning essay should be the one:...which {{in the opinion of}} the King's School most convincingly authoritatively and informatively examines and discusses in depth the life and works of Christopher Marlowe and the authorship of the plays and poems now commonly attributed to William Shakespeare with particular regard to the possibility that Christopher Marlowe wrote some or all of those poems and plays or made some inspirational creative or compositional contributions towards the authorship of them. (Emphasis added)The adjudication of the prize, which is of several thousand pounds (UK), has always been delegated to an eminent professional Shakespearian scholar and, despite Hoffman's clear intentions, the winning essay has seldom espoused the Marlovian cause, the prize having usually gone to essays along entirely orthodox lines.|$|E

500|$|After the Admiral's {{death in}} March 1867, the estate passed to his son, George Arthur Ferguson, {{the sixth and}} final laird. He served in the Grenadier Guards and {{eventually}} became a captain. He married Nina Maria Hood, the eldest daughter of Alexander Nelson Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport, in February 1861. Later that year Captain Ferguson was posted to Canada, where {{he was promoted to}} Lieutenant Colonel and where his first two sons, Arthur and Francis William, were born. His eldest son, Arthur, became Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland. Returning to Britain in 1864, the family had a nomadic lifestyle, but the sixth laird and his wife were extravagant and habitual gamblers. In June 1909, a <b>trust</b> <b>deed</b> was registered, and what remained of the estate was put on the market. After large parts of the land had been sold under the ownership of the sixth laird the estate was listed by Bateman in 1883 as being just over [...] with an income of £19,938; at the height of its development the estate had occupied , and was valued at £30 million.|$|E
500|$|The Lord Chamberlain, a {{supporter}} of O'Reilly, refused a performing licence to Taylor. The theatre opened on 26 March 1791 with a private performance of song and dance entertainment, but {{was not allowed to}} open to the public. The new theatre was heavily indebted and spanned separate plots of land that were leased to Taylor by four different owners on differing terms of revision. As a later manager of the theatre wrote, [...] "In the history of property, there has probably been no parallel instance wherein the legal labyrinth has been so difficult to thread." [...] Meetings were held at Carlton House and Bedford House attempting to reconcile the parties. On 24 August 1792 a General Opera <b>Trust</b> <b>Deed</b> was signed by the parties. The general management of the theatre was to be entrusted to a committee of noblemen, appointed by the Prince of Wales, who would then appoint a general manager. Funds would be disbursed from the profits to compensate the creditors of both the King's Theatre and the Pantheon. The committee never met, and management devolved to Taylor.|$|E
500|$|For Rhodes, the {{agreement}} Moffat had made with Lobengula was crucial as it bought time {{that allowed him}} to devote the necessary attention to the final amalgamation of the South African diamond interests. A possible way out of the situation for Lobengula was to lead another Matabele migration across the Zambezi, but Rhodes hoped to keep the king where he was for the moment as a buffer against Boer expansion. In March 1888, Rhodes bought out the company of his last competitor, the circus showman turned diamond millionaire Barney Barnato, to form De Beers Consolidated Mines, a sprawling national monopoly that controlled 90% of world diamond production. Barnato wanted to limit De Beers to mining diamonds, but Rhodes insisted {{that he was going to}} use the company to [...] "win the north": to this end, he ensured that the De Beers <b>trust</b> <b>deed</b> enabled activities far removed from mining, including banking and railway-building, the ability to annex and govern land, and the raising of armed forces. All this gave the immensely wealthy company powers not unlike those of the East India Company, which had governed India on Britain's behalf from 1757 to 1857. Through De Beers and Gold Fields of South Africa, the gold-mining firm he had recently started with Charles Rudd, Rhodes had both the capacity and the financial means to make his dream of an African empire a reality, but to make such ambitions practicable, he would first have to acquire a royal charter empowering him to take personal control of the relevant territories on Britain's behalf. To secure this royal charter, he would need to present Whitehall with a concession, signed by a native ruler, granting to Rhodes the exclusive mining rights in the lands he hoped to annex.|$|E
