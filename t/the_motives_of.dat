5|$|Even {{classical}} historians, {{who were}} writing only {{years after the}} events themselves, seem to be divided as to what <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> Spartacus were. Appian and Florus write {{that he intended to}} march on Rome itself—although this may have been no more than a reflection of Roman fears. If Spartacus did intend to march on Rome, it was a goal he must have later abandoned. Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E
5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference.

This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the rule that malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E

40|$|We {{define and}} study <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moduli stack of vector bundles of fixed rank and degree over a smooth {{projective}} curve in Voevodsky's category <b>of</b> <b>motives.</b> We prove that this motive {{can be written}} as a homotopy colimit <b>of</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> smooth projective Quot schemes of torsion quotients of sums of line bundles on the curve. When working with rational coefficients, we prove that <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stack of bundles lies in the localising tensor subcategory generated by <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curve, using Bialynicki-Birula decompositions of these Quot schemes.

40|$|The {{submitted}} {{doctoral thesis}} examines the function and performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> a snake in four selected texts about {{artists of the}} German romantic period and perceives the snake as an attribute reflecting {{the problems of the}} artistic existence and a way to the artistic work, possibly of the artistic work at all. When interpreting <b>the</b> single <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snake, three-phase procedure as applied by Erwin Panofsky in description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> in <b>the</b> pictures has been chosen by analogy for literary texts. The interpretation is based on the structural position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snake in the text and its performance in the text. Subsequently, the principal role is revelation of contexts which updates <b>the</b> given <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snake - in particular they are biblical snakes, mythical snakes and a serpentine line as a line of beauty which was the subject of the period aesthetic discourse. <b>The</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snake in the texts is given primarily by the mutual interaction of theme contexts which is in the single texts realized by various ways. <b>The</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snake as formed in the single interpreted texts is a highly complex <b>motive</b> in all <b>the</b> cases.

5|$|Alexei Stukov was {{the vice}} admiral and second-in-command of the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary force. He first appears in Brood War, voiced by Cástulo Guerra; he later reappears {{as one of}} Kerrigan's lieutenants in the Zerg Swarm in Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void, voiced by Victor Brandt. A man of Russian descent, his {{military}} career primarily revolves around secret research, though he is also noted as an excellent tactician. A close friend of DuGalle, Stukov will debate situations with the admiral but will subordinate himself to his friend's higher rank. Stukov becomes suspicious of <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> Samir Duran after the latter convinces DuGalle to destroy the psi disruptor. Believing the device to be the UED's best hope to conquer the Zerg, Stukov instead takes the psi disruptor to Braxis but is tracked down and shot dead by Duran. With his dying breaths, Stukov convinces DuGalle that Duran is a traitor {{and to keep the}} psi disruptor running for the UED's assault on the Zerg homeworld of Char. Stukov's body is given a full funeral and UED propaganda portrays Stukov as a hero, claiming he died in combat on Char.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> road in modern and postmodern philosophy, {{especially in the}} works <b>of</b> Martin Heidegger. <b>The</b> <b>motive</b> is used metaphorically since antiquity, both in philosophical and literary works. First I characterize the hermeneutic approach to <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> road and then the intersections between literature and philosophy which are important in Heideggerian poetical thinking. The reflection on hermeneutics refers to Heidegger‟s early works from the „hermeneutic phenomenology‟ phase. In his later works <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> road {{can be interpreted as}} one of the most important and fundamental elements of non-metaphysical philosophy which is called the philosophy of another beginning.

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. <b>The</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> the conspirators were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of the conspirators were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Fenix is a praetor {{within the}} {{military}} of the Khalai. Bill Roper voices Fenix in both StarCraft and Brood War. A templar and {{an old friend of}} Tassadar's, Fenix is a powerful and cunning leader, but remains distrustful towards <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> the ruling judicator caste. Under the command of Aldaris, Fenix helps defend Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but eventually falls in the battle of Antioch when his position is overwhelmed by Zerg and his psi-blades lose power. Nevertheless, Fenix is retrieved and integrated into a dragoon, a mechanical fire support unit designed to allow incapacitated warriors to continue military service. Fenix allies his templar forces with Tassadar's upon the schism between Tassadar and the Protoss government, later leading a task force against the Overmind's outer defenses, facilitating Zeratul's assassination of a number of cerebrates and ultimately the death of the Overmind itself. Over this time, Fenix develops a strong friendship with Tassadar's Terran companion Jim Raynor.|$|E
5|$|For <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> Bardanes himself, the {{situation}} is less clear. According to the Byzantine chroniclers, he accepted the acclamation only reluctantly, after vainly entreating the soldiers {{to allow him to}} leave. According to another story however, before his revolt, Bardanes, accompanied by his three principal associates, Thomas the Slav, Leo the Armenian and Michael the Amorian visited a holy man at Philomelion to learn of the prospects for the uprising. The monk correctly prophesied that his rebellion would fail, that Thomas too would begin a revolt, and that Leo and Michael would reign as emperors. Although possibly a later invention, this story may suggest that Bardanes planned his revolt beforehand. Aside from any personal ambition, Bardanes was {{also a member of the}} landed aristocracy and a devoted iconophile who supported Empress Irene's regime. He has therefore also been seen as the representative of the opposition by the traditional elites to Nikephoros's policies, both in the confessional area, where the Emperor maintained a carefully neutral stance towards both iconoclasts and iconophiles, and in the socio-financial sphere, where new taxes on landed property and the expropriation of ecclesiastical estates hurt their interests. Historian Warren Treadgold further suggested that the revolt was a reaction against Nikephoros's usurpation and aimed, at least ostensibly, at the restoration of Irene. Her death, however, at Lesbos on 8 August deprived the rebels of any claim to legitimacy.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall bowled {{a series}} of short balls. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman {{attempted}} to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect {{the ball into the}} leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of <b>the</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For {{a series of}} accurate overs from Ernie Toshack, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>motives</b> <b>of</b> {{the nobility}} are {{somewhat}} clearer {{than those of}} the peasants; greed was apparently not a major factor. It is commonly assumed, for example by Runciman as mentioned above, that only younger members of a family went on crusade, looking for wealth and adventure elsewhere, as they had no prospects for advancement at home. Riley-Smith has shown that this was not always the case. The crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense. For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the Duchy of Normandy to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church. According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence. Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother Eustace III, Count of Boulogne, are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives. Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the Siege of Antioch, taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.|$|E

Various types of confrontation of dream and reality in Dostoyevsky's prosaic texts are presented and the functions which dreams as a literary device fulfil are introduced. The closing chapter of the thesis regards <b>the</b> <b>motive</b> <b>of</b> dream as part of the artistic- philosophical intent of the writer and proposes a possible interpretation of its role in the achieving this intention...|$|R
