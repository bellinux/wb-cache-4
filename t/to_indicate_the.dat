5|$|Another set (set B) is used <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> {{person of}} {{subjects}} of transitive verbs (and in some languages, such as Yucatec, also {{the subjects of}} intransitive verbs, {{but only in the}} incompletive aspects), and also the possessors of nouns (including relational nouns).|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{have two}} sets of affixes that are attached to a verb <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> person of its arguments. One set (often referred to in Mayan grammars as set A) indicates the person of subjects of intransitive verbs, and of objects of transitive verbs. They {{can also be used}} with adjective or noun predicates <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> subject.|$|E

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> route to the exit.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> safest area.|$|E

5|$|Evaporation-condensation {{involves}} atoms “evaporating” {{from the}} cluster onto a terrace accompanied by “condensation” of terrace adatoms onto the cluster {{leading to a}} change in the cluster’s center of mass. While figure 10 appears <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> same atom evaporating from and condensing on the cluster, it may in fact be a different atom condensing from the 2D gas.|$|E
5|$|In {{alternative}} fashion, the (S) and (R) designators {{are used}} <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> absolute stereochemistry. Almost {{all of the}} amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine has its side chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the R/S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority, whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning {{takes place at}} any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn. Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> correct time of the year, dawn or dusk <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.|$|E

5000|$|In amateur radio transmissions, the {{transmitting}} station's {{call sign}} {{followed by the}} word [...] "clear" [...] is used <b>to</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> sending station is done transmitting and leaving the airways, i.e. turning off the radio.|$|R

5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E
5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} charging connector, {{has been replaced}} with USB-C charging. Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s field of view <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power. The Macintosh startup chime {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting {{the history}} of Strasbourg and of France, the palace has been owned {{successively}} by the nobility, the municipality, the monarchy, the state, the university, and the municipality again. Its architectural conception and its iconography were intended <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> return of Roman Catholicism to the city, which had been dominated by Protestantism for the previous two centuries. Thus the prelate's apartments face the cathedral, to the north, {{and many of the}} statues, reliefs and paintings reflect the Catholic dogma.|$|E

5|$|The 17th century Yarn Market is {{a market}} cross which was {{probably}} built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain {{the importance of the}} village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain. The building contains a hole in one of the roof beams, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War. A bell at the top was rung <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> start of trading.|$|E
5|$|The Tour organisers did {{not make}} many changes the rules or route for the next race, because they {{had worked in the}} 1906 Tour de France.

The flamme rouge that was introduced in 1906 <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> final kilometre of a stage was kept and is still in use.|$|E
5|$|The possessive determiners (analogous to English my, his, etc.) {{are used}} <b>to</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>the</b> {{possessor}} of the noun they determine.

While the English language distinguishes between masculine and feminine singular possessors (his vs. her), late Quenya generally does not.|$|E
