30|$|Extensive {{work has}} been carried out on dilute nitrides, and the {{demonstration}} of dilute nitride-based LEDs, lasers [10 – 12] and solar cell devices [13] has already been achieved. In a recently published study [14], we observed several oscillations in the current-voltage (I V) characteristics of p-i-n GaInNAs/GaAs multiple quantum well (MQW) structures at low temperature under illumination. By performing the experiment at different photon wavelengths, it was established that the optical transitions in GaInNAs quantum wells were the origin of these oscillations. In this paper, we further investigate the oscillations by studying at the photoluminescence under bias. These results give a more complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms such as thermal escape, <b>trapping,</b> <b>recombination</b> and charge accumulation.|$|E
40|$|Hematite is {{currently}} {{considered one of}} the most promising materials for the conversion and storage of solar energy via the photoelectrolysis of water. Whilst there has been extensive research and much progress in the development of hematite structures with enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity, relatively limited information has been available until recently concerning the dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers in hematite and their impact upon the efficiency of water photoelectrolysis. In this perspective we present an overview of our recent studies of the dynamics of photoinduced charge carrier processes in hematite, derived primarily from transient absorption spectroscopy of nanostructured photoanodes. The relationship between PEC activity and transient measurements are discussed in terms of a phenomenological model which rationalizes the observations and in particular the impact of external potential bias on the relative rates of charge carrier <b>trapping,</b> <b>recombination</b> and interfacial transfer in hematite photoanodes for water oxidation...|$|E

40|$|We present new {{high-resolution}} {{measurements of}} transient time-domain photoconductivity in ErAs:InGaAs superlattice nanocomposites intended for THz photoconductive switches and photomixers using a pure optical pump-probe method. We developed a model, using separate photocarrier <b>trapping,</b> <b>recombination,</b> and thermal reactivation processes, which very accurately fits the measurements. The measured material structures all exhibit a slow secondary decay process, which {{is attributed to}} thermal reactivation of the trapped carriers, either into the conduction band, or into high-energy defect states. We examined the influence of superlattice structure, dopants, DC bias, and temperature. Analysis shows {{that all of the}} THz energy produced by the photocarrier trapping and decay processes are at frequencies less than 1 THz, while the reactivation process only serves to create {{a large portion of the}} bias power dissipated. Energy higher than 1 THz must be created by a fast generation process or band-filling saturation. This allows pulsed THz generation even from a long-lifetime material. Pure optical pump-probe measurements are necessary to expose slow material processes, and eliminate the influence of electrical terminals and THz antennas. These measurements and modeling of THz photoconductive devices are necessary in order to optimize the output spectrum and power. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of multiple donors into the bulk-heterojunction layer of organic polymer solar cells (PSCs) {{has been demonstrated}} as a practical and elegant strategy to improve photovoltaics performance.

Here, a new Förster resonance energy transfer-based design is shown utilizing the synergistic nature of three light active donors (two small molecules and a high-performance donor–acceptor polymer) with a fullerene acceptor to create highly efficient quaternary PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10. 7 %. Within this quaternary architecture, it is revealed that the addition of small molecules in low concentrations broadens the absorption bandwidth, induces cocrystalline molecular conformations, and promotes rapid (picosecond) energy transfer processes.

In [1, 2], where the transport of charge carriers (СС) in the heated polycrystalline semiconductor structures in terms of their interaction with recombination centers associated with deep impurity states in the grain boundaries (GB) was found an abrupt change in the mobility and carrier concentration, which occurs in the temperature range 300 ÷ 800 K. as a result, the total concentration of CC, as it turns out, is determined by the concentration of CC <b>trapped</b> <b>recombination</b> centers (RC) caused by impurity states and defects in the GB, the total size of the combined layer which two adjacent grains of the polycrystalline silicon (PS) according to [3] is within ~ 7 nm.

40|$|The {{thermoluminescence}} {{spectra of}} rare earth doped materials after X-ray irradiation typically {{vary with the}} glow peak temperature. Additionally, there are many examples where, for the same dopant ion, the expected component emission lines peak, but at different temperatures. This unusual behaviour is {{discussed in terms of}} changes in proximity of coupling between <b>trapping</b> and <b>recombination</b> sites. Changes in the energy barriers for recombination influence alternative routes for charge transfer to rare earth sites which can involve different higher energy states of the rare earth dopants. Proposed mechanisms include selective tunnelling, or barrier crossing, in addition to normal charge transfer from remote trapping sites. The model successfully describes numerous examples in terms of the energy scheme for the rare earth ions. Whilst the standard emission lines are recorded in the glow curve spectra they do not always occur at the same temperature, and, even for the same rare earth dopant, they can differ by as much as 30 °C. These wavelength dependent variations in peak temperature not only offer information on the proximity of <b>trap</b> and <b>recombination</b> sites, but also introduce issues in conventional activation energy analysis when recording is with polychromatic light. The concepts are relevant for related types of measurement, such as optically stimulated thermoluminescence...|$|R

Firstly, we investigated the optical {{properties of the}} neat thin films of BN, DSB, and DCJTB, including absorbance and PL spectra. Energy transfer is confirmed by the large overlap between the PL spectrum of BN and the absorption spectra of DSB and DCJTB. Then, we fabricated hybrid-conjugated polymer films by doping DSB and DCJTB into BN, and their optical characteristics were obtained. Moreover, the cascade energy transfer mechanism in these co-doped films was studied. In addition, we inserted the hybrid thin film into organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) serving as the light-emitting layer to further explore the effect of cascade energy transfer in the co-doped system. The {{results show that the}} DSB molecule acts as both an interstitial molecule and an energy delivery medium, playing {{an important role in the}} cascade Förster energy transfer system. The electroluminescence (EL) spectra exhibit no BN’s characteristic peaks, but mainly DCJTB’s.

40|$|Excitation {{correlation}} photoluminescence ECPL {{measurements are}} often analyzed in the approximation {{of a cross}} correlation of charge carrier populations generated by the two delayed pulses. In semiconductors, this approach is valid for a linear non radiative recombination path, but not for a non linear recombination rate as in the general Shockley Read Hall recombination scenario. Here, {{the evolution of the}} ECPL signal was studied for deep <b>trap</b> <b>recombination</b> following Shockley Read Hall statistics. Analytic solutions can be obtained for a fast minority trapping regime and steady state recombination. For the steady state case, our results show that the quadratic radiative term plays only a minor role, and that the shape of the measured signal is mostly determined by the non linearity of the recombination itself. We find that measurements with unbalanced intense pump and probe pulses can directly provide information about the dominant non radiative recombination mechanism. The signal traces follow the charge carrier concentrations, despite the complex origins of the signal, thus showing that ECPL can be applied to study charge carrier dynamics in semiconductors without requiring elaborate calculations.
