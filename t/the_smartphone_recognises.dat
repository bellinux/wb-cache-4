40|$|Smartphone {{capabilities}} {{have been}} increasing {{in the last}} years, and many applications have been developed {{in order to take}} advantage of these capabilities. Smartphone users, knowing that there are lots of applications to ease many daily tasks, or simply to have some fun, typically have <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> close by. One of the capabilities that have been explored is the detection of the physical state of <b>the</b> <b>smartphone,</b> through inertial sensors embedded in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone.</b> <b>The</b> smart-phone can detect its own orientation and even detect if it is being moved through sensors like the accelerometer, linear acceleration sensor or the gyroscope. Given that <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> can detect its own physical state and the fact that users often have their <b>smartphone</b> close by, <b>the</b> opportunity of developing a new natural and intuitive way of interacting with <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> arises, and this opportunity is related with gestures. Using the embedded accelerometer, linear acceleration sensor or gyroscope, <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> can detect if the user made some movement with the hand that is holding <b>the</b> <b>smartphone.</b> <b>The</b> objective of this Dissertation is to develop a software framework to be used in Android applications to render the applications capable of detecting gestures that the user makes with the hand that is holding <b>the</b> <b>smartphone,</b> sparing an Android developer th...|$|R

50|$|<b>Smartphones</b> with <b>the</b> Earthquake Network {{application}} installed are nodes of {{the sensor}} network of the Earthquake Network project. When a smartphone {{is not in}} use and it is connected to a source of power, the application switches on the accelerometer in order to read <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> acceleration. If a threshold is exceeded, <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> sends a signal to a central server. The server collects the signals sent by all <b>the</b> <b>smartphones</b> and, thanks to a statistical algorithm, it decides in real time whether an earthquake is likely occurring. If an earthquake is detected, the server instantly notifies all <b>the</b> <b>smartphones</b> with <b>the</b> application installed. An alarm goes off when the notification is received, and <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> owner can take cover.|$|R

The findings of this thesis indicate that the majority of the informants use their smartphones in a way that fit into their lives.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} twofold: 1) To investigate an impact of software quality attributes of a learning management system (LMS) on students' satisfaction in both the personal computer and <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> settings; 2) To examine whether LMS quality factors have different impacts in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> context and <b>the</b> PC context. We explore five quality attributes of LMS (capability, usability, performance, reliability and documentation). Data from a survey of 193 students were analysed using ordered logit regression. Findings showed that while only usability and reliability significantly affected user satisfaction in the PC context; all the quality attributes except documentation had a significant influence on user satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> setting. We also found that reliability was twice as important to user satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> context as in the PC context. The results imply that LMS quality attributes have different impacts on students' satisfaction in <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> context from <b>the</b> PC context. open 0...|$|R

50|$|Recently, a <b>smartphone</b> {{prototype}} using <b>the</b> {{benefits of}} cartilage conduction has been manufactured by ROHM Co., Ltd.

Furthermore, the {{sound pressure level}} can be easily modified by adjusting the physical pressure level of <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> pressed against <b>the</b> outer ear. Importantly, the cartilage vibration, which is a sound source, can be heard only by oneself but not by others because sound from cartilage vibration cannot be leaked outside. This makes talking in public easy.

By getting these answers we could analyse them with our hypothesis, which we in advance had made before the survey and focus group. We use this analysis with our theories, Maslow and Bourdieu, to get a broader knowledge of people's usage of <b>the</b> <b>smartphone</b> and why they use it frequently.
