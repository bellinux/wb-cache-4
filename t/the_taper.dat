5|$|Taper was not Levin's {{only work}} for The Spectator. He wrote {{on a wide}} range of subjects, from a {{campaign}} for the release of three Arabs imprisoned by the British authorities, to supporting publication of the banned novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, and denunciation of the retired Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard. The last led to a secret meeting of more than 20 senior judges to see whether Levin could be prosecuted for criminal libel; there was no prosecution, and his accusations about Goddard's vindictiveness, deceit and bias have relatively recently been claimed to have been justified. In 1959, Gilmour, while remaining as proprietor, stepped down as editor and was succeeded by his deputy, Brian Inglis; Levin took over from Inglis as assistant editor. Later in that year, after the general election victory of another of his bêtes noires, Harold Macmillan, Levin gave up <b>the</b> <b>Taper</b> column, professing himself to be in despair.|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} a vascular overflow graft or cannula to a heart pump. A pump pipe outlet {{is provided with}} an external tapered surface which receives {{the end of a}} compressible connula. An annular compression ring with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> internal surface in a facing relationship to <b>the</b> external <b>tapered</b> surface. <b>The</b> angle of inclination of <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> surfaces is converging such that the spacing between <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> surfaces decreases from one end of <b>the</b> external <b>tapered</b> surface to <b>the</b> other end thereby providing a clamping action of <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> surface on a cannula which increases {{as a function of the}} length of cannula segment between <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> surfaces. <b>The</b> annular compression ring is disposed within a tubular locking nut which threadedly couples to the pump and provides a compression force for urging the annular ring onto the cannula between <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> surfaces. <b>The</b> nut has a threaded connection to the pump body. The threaded coupling to the pump body provides a compression force for the annular ring. The annular ring has an annular enclosure space in which excess cannula material from the compression between <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> surfaces to "bunch up" in the space and serve as an enlarged annular ring segment to assist holding the cannula in place. The clamped cannula provides a seamless joint connection to the pump pipe outlet where the clamping force is uniformly applied to the cannula because of self alignment of <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> surfaces. <b>The</b> nut can be easily disconnected to replace the pump if necessary...|$|R

This method can estimate <b>the</b> <b>tapering</b> results, i. e., the shape of <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> fibers, based on arbitrary moving parameters of the large-zone furnace and the fiber holders.

25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} <b>the</b> <b>taper</b> as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but <b>the</b> <b>taper</b> {{is more complex than}} a truncated cone. The head joint is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|E
25|$|The wooden, cantilever, two-spar {{wing of the}} U 7 {{was almost}} {{trapezoidal}} in plan, with sweep on the leading edge, out to ellipsoidal tips. It also thinned outwards in section with most of <b>the</b> <b>taper</b> on the upper surface, giving some anhedral. Short ailerons extended to the tips. The wing was mounted over the fuselage on six streamlined steel struts; two upright tripods ran from the forward spar to points on the upper and mid fuselage and two inverted V-struts joined the rear spar to the upper fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The blade is {{connected}} to a long cylindrical cane handle, {{similar to that of}} a mid-20th-century tennis racquet, by means of a splice. The handle is usually covered with a rubber grip. Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a tapered splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson, a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel. Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break {{at the corner of the}} join. <b>The</b> <b>taper</b> provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat's blade to the handle and avoids this problem.|$|E
40|$|A tapered silica {{optical fiber}} (SOF) coated with {{graphene}} oxide is proposed and demonstrated as a humidity sensor. In {{order to reduce}} the diameter of the optical fiber from 125  µm to 26. 9  µm as the sensing region, the flame-brushing technique was used to <b>taper</b> <b>the</b> fiber with <b>the</b> <b>tapering</b> length is about 30  mm. To increase the optical sensitivity, <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> region was coated with graphene oxide, which will interact with the changes of humidity and affect the evanescent field in <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> region. In this work, the proposed optical sensor works in the range of the humidity from 40 % to 60 %. The comparison was made between uncoated <b>tapered</b> fiber with <b>the</b> graphene oxide coated optical fiber and the experimental works reveal that <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> fiber coated with graphene oxide gave better result compared to bare tapered optical fiber.

40|$|We {{report what}} is to our {{knowledge}} the first operation of a planar dielectric tapered-waveguide laser. The waveguide laser is fabricated by potassium-ion exchange in Nd 3 + -doped BK 7 glass and consists of a single-mode channel waveguide of a few micrometers' width followed by a linear taper up to a broad region with a width of 180 µm. A slope efficiency of 42 % is found both in <b>the</b> <b>tapers</b> and in standard channel waveguides fabricated upon the same substrate, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>tapers</b> and <b>the</b> channels have similar internal losses; hence the low-loss nature of <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> beam expansion. <b>The</b> output from either end of <b>the</b> <b>tapered</b> structure {{is found to be}} nearly diffraction limited...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} rate of two-photon {{absorption}} in tapered optical fibers with diameters less than the wavelength of the incident light.

500|$|The {{framing of}} the house is unusual because it has [...] "longitudinal summer beams {{extending}} from the end girts to the chimney girts in both the hall and the parlor. Corner and intermediate posts are flared in gunstock pattern. The walls are sheathed with vertical planking except in the attic gables, where the planks are laid horizontally, alternating <b>the</b> <b>taper.</b> Framing is cased in the parlor and exposed in the hall, where the summers are adzed and roughly chamfered." [...] The attic construction is conventional with equally spaced rafters that have mortise and tenon joints at the ridge. This type of construction indicates that the conventional principal rafter or purlin framing may not have been used in Ledyard during that time.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the pier, Birnbeck Island could be accessed by a natural causeway at low tide. A proposal was made in 1845 to connect Birnbeck Island to the mainland at the western end of Worlebury Hill. Work commenced on a suspension bridge two years later under a design by James Dredge, architect of the Victoria Bridge in Bath. He patented <b>the</b> <b>taper</b> principle based on using chains rather than cables, as is more common in suspension bridges. Dredge's bridge design was considered [...] "a very significant yet relatively short-lived phase in suspension bridge development". During a strike by stonemasons, what little had been built was damaged during a storm, bringing about the end to the suspension bridge scheme.|$|E
