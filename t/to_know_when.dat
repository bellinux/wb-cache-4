5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{draw that}} {{determined}} the semi-final running order {{was held on}} 25 January 2012 at the Buta Palace. The participating countries, excluding the automatic finalists (Azerbaijan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), were split into six pots, based upon how those countries voted in past contests. From these pots, half (or as close to half as possible) competed in the first semi-final on 22 May 2012. The other half in that particular pot competed in the second semi-final on 24 May 2012. This draw also acted as an approximate running order, {{in order for the}} delegations from the countries <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> their rehearsals would commence and determine which semi-final the automatic finalists would be allowed to vote in.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} from the ice caused Endurance to start to take on water. To prevent the ship from flooding McNish built a cofferdam, caulking it with strips of blankets and nailing strips over the seams, standing for hours up to his waist in freezing water as he worked. He could not prevent the {{pressure from}} the ice crushing the ship though and was experienced enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> to stop trying. Once the ship had been destroyed he {{was put in charge}} of rescuing the stores from what had been The Ritz. With McNish in charge it took only a couple of hours to open the deck far enough to retrieve a good quantity of provisions.|$|E

5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said that it is important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> to end a story, {{that he did not want}} the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} is important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> to end a story, {{that he did not want}} the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ranged {{weapons are}} based on real {{firearms}} {{with the exception of}} a Yithian directed-energy weapon introduced at the end of the game. The player character can also perform a melee attack with a crowbar or with a gun if all ammunition for it has been used up. The game features a realistic combat system: due to lack of HUD, the player has to count shots manually <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> the gun goes empty. There is also no artificial on-screen targeting reticle; instead, the player must aim through the iron sights on the weapons themselves, but sustained aiming tires the character and drops accuracy. The shooting system is unique in that fired rounds go exactly where the gun's barrel is pointing. For example, if the player character readies a reloaded weapon and the player pulls the trigger before the character animation has finished, the round will be discharged in the direction the gun was pointing when the shot was fired.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{advantages}} of the projective space compared with affine space (e.g., Pn(R) vs. An(R)).

(Very) ample line bundles are designed to tackle this question.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the county}} lies between the Hackensack and Hudson Rivers on {{geographically}} long narrow peninsula, (sometimes called Bergen Neck), that is a contiguous urban area where it's often difficult <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> one's crossed a civic boundary.

Numerous cuts for rail and vehicular traffic cross Bergen Hill.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{instrument}} was to standardise the measurement {{of time and the}} calendar. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24‑hour) day was measured from the moment of dawn, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was also important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> the vernal equinox occurred, to provide the correct date for Easter.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} EastEnders {{popularity}} {{is that after}} episodes, electricity use in the United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin boiling water for tea, a phenomenon known as TV pickup. Over five minutes, power demand rises by three GW, the equivalent of 1.5 to 1.75 million teakettles. National Grid personnel watch the show <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge, asking for additional power from France if necessary.|$|E

25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so often, that he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> to remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, a {{study by}} the USAF's Scientific Advisory Board {{identified}} several improvements for operating the Reaper in contested airspace; adding readily available sensors, weapons, and threat detection and countermeasures could increase situational awareness and enable riskier deployments. Suggestions included a radar warning receiver (RWR) <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> it's being targeted, air-to-air and miniature air-to-ground weapons, manned-unmanned teaming, multi-UAV control, automatic take-offs and landings, and precision navigation and timing systems to fly in GPS-denied areas. Another idea was redesigned ground control stations with user-friendly video game-like controllers and touchscreen maps to access data without overwhelming operators.|$|E
25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will come a time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E
