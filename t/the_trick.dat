If the second player has {{one or more}} cards of higher value of the same suit as this card, one of them must be played, and the second player wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played; in this case, the second player loses <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> If the second player {{does not have any}} cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played; the second player wins <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played, and the second player loses <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2002, Angel spent 24 hours {{shackled}} underwater {{in a phone}} booth-sized {{water torture}} cell near the WWE entertainment store in New York's Times Square, WWE corporation being {{the owners of the}} World Underground Theatre where Angel had been performing his stage show. To prepare for <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> he practiced in a neighbor's backyard swimming pool next to his mother's house in East Meadow, New York. Prior to the performance he had only managed to spend 12 consecutive hours in the water. He fasted for 24 hours before the performance {{to make it through the}} period without need to exit and use the washroom. During <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> he went through 16 oxygen tanks. After <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> he was required to remove his own shackles and chains before exiting the water. Within an hour, his skin began to react substantially to the water.|$|E

5|$|A season {{highlight}} was {{the final}} game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before the game, both teams were undefeated and Stanford had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. Late in the game, California was leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure the game was over, began substituting regular players. Warner {{seized the opportunity to}} combine passing with <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> plays for which he was known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), and Stanford made a comeback. The game ended in a 20–20 tie.|$|E
5|$|Alston went undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft. He {{was signed}} by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in May 2003.

5|$|In the show, Angel {{revealed}} the secrets behind {{some of his}} illusions to the audience. This included the Lord of Illusions trick, where he revealed {{that he had the}} swords in a preset order so that he could avoid them.

5|$|The joke {{became an}} {{international}} sensation when publications from Europe, Hong Kong {{and other countries}} reprinted <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> without verifying it or asking EGMs permission. A Hong Kong comic based on Street Fighter II by Jademan Comics altered their story to include the character.

5|$|When {{all four}} cards of <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> {{are on the}} table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards {{of the other two}} suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> into their baza. The rules for the {{declarations}} are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt {{at the start of the}} next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands.|$|E

5|$|Across the Way is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead of Sparks. The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger {{asleep in his}} bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water balanced on the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> takes the first card from the stock, and the loser the second; thus, until the stock runs out, they each hold ten cards {{at the start}} of every trick. When the trump card {{at the bottom of the}} deck is {{superior}} to a 7 (Ace, Three, King, Knight, or Knave), the player that holds the 7 of the trump suit is able to exchange it for any of these. The 7, and cards of lesser value (6, 5, and 4), can later be exchanged only by a 2. The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards are left in the stock.|$|E

5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. <b>The</b> <b>trick</b> was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become a concern for the police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with North Carolina in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second down and 11 on the Tech 14-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Keldorf completed a 14-yard pass to Barnes for a touchdown. The extra point was good, and the Tar Heels extended their lead to 353 with 14:55 remaining in the game. North Carolina's kickoff was returned to the Tech 34-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began the first full drive of the fourth quarter. Tech's first play of the drive was a trick reverse to Scales, who gained 29 yards and a first down on <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> play. After an incomplete pass by Sorensen from the Carolina 37-yard line, Pegues rushed for four yards, then the Hokies were stopped for no gain on third down. Tech attempted to convert the fourth down, but Sorensen's pass fell incomplete and Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs with 12:39 remaining.|$|E

5|$|The scene {{changes to}} the court of Giuki, the Niblung king. Giuki's {{daughter}} Gudrun has a dream in which she encounters a beautiful but ominous falcon and takes it to her breast. Anxious to learn the meaning of the dream she rides to visit Brynhild, who tells her that she will marry a king, but that her life will be darkened by war and death. Gudrun returns home. Sigurd revisits Brynhild and they again declare their love for each other. He then rides to the Niblung court, where he joins them in making war on the Southland, winning great glory for himself. The witch Grimhild, Gudrun's mother, gives Sigurd a potion that makes him fall in love with Gudrun. Completely under her spell, he marries her and sets out to win Brynhild for Gudrun's brother Gunnar. Visiting Brynhild again, this time magically disguised as Gunnar, and again penetrating the fire that surrounds her, he reminds her that she is promised to whoever can overcome the supernatural fire, and so deceives her into reluctantly vowing to marry Gunnar. Brynhild goes to the Niblung land and carries out her promise. She is distraught at this tragic outcome, and doubly so when Gudrun spitefully tells her of <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> by which Sigurd deceived her into an unwanted wedding. Brynhild now urges Gunnar and his brothers Hogni and Guttorm to kill Sigurd. Guttorm murders Sigurd as he lies in bed, but the dying Sigurd throws his sword and kills Guttorm as he leaves. Brynhild, filled with remorse, commits suicide so that she and Sigurd can be burned on a single funeral pyre.|$|E
