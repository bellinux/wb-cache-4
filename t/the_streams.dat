40|$|Streaming is an {{important}} paradigm for handling data sets that are too large to fit in main memory. In <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> computational model, algorithms are restricted to using much less space than {{they would need to}} store the input. The massive data set is accessed in a sequential fashion and, therefore, {{can be viewed as a}} stream of data elements. The order of the data elements in <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> is not controlled by the algorithm. There are three important resources considered in <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> model: <b>the</b> size of the workspace, the number of passes that the algorithm makes over <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> and <b>the</b> time to process each data element in <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b> In this thesis, we study computational-geometry problems and graph problems in <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> model. We design algorithms for computing diameter in <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> and <b>the</b> sliding-window models and prove some corresponding lower bounds. The sliding-window model is a variation of <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> model in which only more recent data elements in <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> are considered. Previously, work in <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> model has focused on algorithms that use polylog space. For graph problems, this restriction is too strong.

50|$|The Little Sac {{headwaters}} {{start with}} an intermittent stream just north of Strafford in eastern Greene County. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> passes under Missouri Route 125 just downstream from its source. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> flows westward and just after passing under U.

5|$|Adams is {{the source}} of the {{headwaters}} for two major rivers, the Lewis River and White Salmon River.

5|$|All {{but four}} of <b>the</b> <b>streams</b> lie within the large basin of the Columbia River, {{although}} the river {{itself does not}} flow through Idaho. Consequently, the predominant direction of the state's streamflow is northwest towards the Columbia River and its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. The only other major drainage basin in Idaho is the Great Salt Lake watershed in the state's southeastern corner, {{which is part of}} the Great Basin and has no outlet to the ocean. The Bear River, the second-longest stream, is within this watershed, along with the Malad River, Deep Creek, and the Logan River.|$|E
5|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>streams</b> in the Nescopeck Creek are {{considered}} sub-optimal habitats and {{rated on a}} scale of 1 to 240. The most optimal water habitat in the watershed is a site along Nescopeck Creek, with a rating of 184. The least optimal water habitats in the watershed are two sites along Black Creek.

50|$|Where {{a stream}} is {{following}} a straight course the slower boundary layer {{along the floor}} of <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> is also following the same straight course.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow trees were planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in <b>the</b> <b>streams,</b> and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E

5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block {{and the resulting}} accelerated uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. <b>The</b> <b>streams</b> consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E

5000|$|One {{key feature}} of the Doub Farm is an unnamed {{intermittent}} stream that flows through the property roughly from north to south, passing close {{in front of the}} house and barn. <b>The</b> <b>stream's</b> hydrology reflects <b>the</b> karst topography of <b>the</b> region. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> is a [...] "losing" [...] stream, with flow being fed by multiple springs emerging from limestone outcrops on the Doub Farm but then losing flow as <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> passes farther from <b>the</b> springs. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> and adjoining wetlands are typically dry in mid summer and fall with streamflow returning with heavier rain and snowmelt events in winter. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> typically dries out by later June or July. While flowing, <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> and its wetlands attract enormous numbers of Canada geese and occasional great blue herons and American egrets. Great blue herons frequent <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> as it dries down in late spring and large numbers of carp become entrapped in isolated pools of remnant water. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> flow is much lower than expected for its watershed of more than 1200 acres north of the Doub Farm. Much of the runoff from the watershed likely flows through underground channels interspersed in the limestone rather than on the surface in <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b> <b>The</b> floodplain associated with <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> is however quite broad and episodically carries torrents of rushing waters expected only from much larger streams.
