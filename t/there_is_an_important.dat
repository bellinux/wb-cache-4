5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{electric}} field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges {{in a similar manner}} to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.|$|E
5|$|While <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> need to {{link the}} economic, cultural, and {{ecological}} imperatives of development {{in the context of}} tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E

50|$|Both {{countries}} are full {{members of the}} Union for the Mediterranean. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> Italian community living in Tunisia before the independence.|$|R
50|$|In 1837, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> peasant revolt in Nose, in {{the context}} of theTenpō famine (1833-1839), some months after Ōshio Heihachirō’s riot.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{distinction}} to draw between concretions and nodules. Concretions {{are formed}} from mineral precipitation around {{some kind of}} nucleus while a nodule is a replacement body.|$|E
25|$|In Romania, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> Hungarian {{minority}} (according to 2011 census, {{the number}} of Hungarians throughout the Romanian territory is of 1.27 million inhabitants representing 6.7% of the total population) of which some 600,000 people (3.15% of total population) are reformed, belonging to the Reformed Church in Romania.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid (Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid) is an 8-hectare {{botanical garden}} {{located in the}} Plaza de Murillo, next to the Prado Museum. It was an 18th-century {{creation}} by Carlos III and it {{was used as a}} base for the plant species being collected across the globe. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> research facility that started life as a base to develop herbal remedies and to house the species collected from the new-world trips, today it is dedicated to maintaining Europe's ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> used to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> shoemaking {{industry}} {{which is}} now almost extinct. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> also <b>an</b> <b>important</b> glass making industry.|$|R
50|$|For centuries <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> boat {{trade to}} carry produce {{to and from}} the port of New Ross. It went into decline {{at the end of the}} 18th century.|$|R
50|$|The canal was {{retained}} in operation from Sandplace to Looe, as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> quay at Sandplace, {{but it is}} likely that the higher part of the canal became disused immediately.|$|R
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{evolution}} of coin shape (round to square) and material (from gold to silver to brass) across the territories and the periods, and from Greek type to Indian type {{over a period}} of nearly 3 centuries. Also, the quality of coinage illustration decreases down to the 1st century CE. Coinage evolution is an important point of Indo-Greek history, and actually {{one of the most important}} since most of these kings are only known by their coins, and their chronology is mainly established by the {{evolution of}} the coin types.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{phase in}} {{development}} when song learning is best accomplished. This phase {{is called the}} ‘sensitive period’ {{and the amount of}} change that a songbird experiences in adulthood varies by species. Young birds have a production phase after a listening phase of development. The production of song is called ‘subsong’ where vocalizations resemble that of an adult as time passes. Memory for songs is able to form before the period where learning to sing occurs. Social interaction is important in vocal learning where non-singing females can even influence an infant through feedback.|$|E
25|$|There are 60 towns {{from the}} area of Cottbus {{belonging}} to this region, {{where most of the}} older people over 60 but few young people and children can speak the Lower Sorbian language; the local variant often incorporates many words taken from the German language, and in conversations with the younger generation, German is generally preferred. Some primary schools in the region teach bilingually, and in Cottbus <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> Gymnasium whose main medium of instruction is Lower Sorbian. The region is predominantly Protestant, again highly devastated by the brown coal mining industry. The biggest tourist attraction of the region and in the whole Lusatia are the marshlands, with many Spreewald/Błóta canals, picturesque broads of the Spree.|$|E
50|$|A notable local in {{this period}} was Évrard, {{who lived in the}} 9th century and participated in many of the day's {{political}} and military affairs. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> Battle of Lille in 1054.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> Scandinavian and Wendish {{settlement}} in the area near the present town now known as Altes Lager Menzlin. Anklam proper began as an associated Wendish fortress.|$|R
50|$|Cape Sudest <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cape in Papua New Guinea, next to Oro Bay. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> U.S {{military}} base there in World War II. It was situated in Oro Province, {{about a mile}} south of Harigo.|$|R
25|$|Some {{opponents of}} ABC contend that since only few models—subjectively chosen and {{probably}} all wrong—can be realistically considered, ABC analyses provide only limited insight. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> distinction between identifying a plausible null hypothesis and assessing the relative fit of alternative hypotheses. Since useful null hypotheses, that potentially hold true, can extremely seldom be put {{forward in the}} context of complex models, predictive ability of statistical models as explanations of complex phenomena is far more important than the test of a statistical null hypothesis in this context. It is also common to average over the investigated models, weighted based on their relative plausibility, to infer model features (e.g., parameter values) and to make predictions.|$|E
25|$|The double {{jeopardy}} rule {{means that a}} person cannot be tried more than once for the same offence. It is an important safeguard to acquitted defendants, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> general public interest in ensuring {{that those who have}} committed serious crimes are convicted of them. The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report recognised that the rule is capable of causing grave injustice to victims and the community in certain cases where compelling fresh evidence has come to light after an acquittal. It called for a change in the law to be considered, and we have accepted that such a change is appropriate. The European Convention on Human Rights (Article 4(2) of Protocol 7) explicitly recognises the importance of being able to re-open cases where new evidence comes to light.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the area}} is former shallow lake with {{remaining}} open water, wetlands and canals. Much of the surface water is saline due to the high mineral content of the soil and lack of natural outflow. The Lago de los Reyes Aztecas (Lake of the Aztec Kings) is a lake that covers 1.9 hectares and connects to the large network of canals and chinampas of the borough. It hosts about twenty five species of migratory birds including ducks and storks along with various fish, amphibians and reptiles. It {{is the most important}} tourist attraction of the borough with docks and trajinera boats. The main docks in Tlahuac do not have a large number of boats or restaurants as in Xochimilco. It is still possible to see small natural islands as well as natural vegetation in much {{of the area}} with chinampas still growing foodstuffs such as broccoli, chard, beets, chili peppers, peas, fava beans and corn. There are four main canals: Chalco, Guadalupano, Atecuyuac and Amecameca. The first two are important as sources of water for the chinampas of the borough and as a tourist attraction. There are also other smaller canals which serve as irrigation. On the border with the State of Mexico, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> ecological reserve lake area called the Cieniega de Tláhuac. There is also an artificial lake at the Bosque de Tláhuac. Los Humedales wetlands is an ecological reserve which covers between 400 and 800 hectares depending on whether it is the rainy or dry season, a remnant of Lake Chalco. It {{is one of the few}} wetlands left in the Valley of Mexico and host a large number of migratory birds. It is also home to species called pocket gophers, skunks, squirrels, snakes and bats.|$|E
2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> musical life in Prince-Bishopric of Liège {{since the}} beginning. Between 1370 and 1468 flourished {{a school of}} music in Liège, with Johannes Brassart, [...] Johannes de Sarto and firstly Johannes Ciconia, the third Master of Ars Nova.|$|R
50|$|The Olmec-vixtoti Culture {{became the}} cuexteca or Huastec culture. In {{relation}} to the Maya and Toltec societies, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> influence on the site sculptures. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> another version that says that the sculptural style corresponds to a Toltec occupation.|$|R
50|$|Between the 1960s and {{the late}} 1980s, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> {{influence}} of Uruguayan humorists. Ricardo Espalter, Enrique Almada, Raimundo Soto, Eduardo D'Angelo, Julio Frade, Berugo Carámbula, Henny Trayles and Gabriela Acher were active in many television programs, such as Jaujarana, Hupumorpo, Comicolor, Híperhumor.|$|R
500|$|Angkor Wat lies [...] {{north of}} the modern town of Siem Reap, and a short {{distance}} south and slightly east of the previous capital, which was centred at Baphuon. In an area of Cambodia where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> group of ancient structures, it is the southernmost of Angkor's main sites.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard {{consistently}} {{advocated for}} {{abolition of the}} subpoena power, court attendance, contempt of court powers, coerced testimony of witnesses, compulsory jury duty, and the bail system, arguing that all these functions of the judiciary were violations of natural rights and American common law. He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted {{he or she should}} not be held in prison or jails, writing [...] "except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red-handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists, it is impossible to justify any imprisonment before conviction, let alone before trial. And even when someone is caught red-handed, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest: subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else. If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law, then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression. The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him, and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction—all should be subject to the universal law." [...] Rothbard argued that police who make wrongful arrests or indictments should be charged with kidnapping.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Columbus {{wrote his}} own account of his fourth voyage, as did his son Ferdinand, who {{travelled}} with him. Bishop Cristóbal de Pedraza wrote a Relación that he dated 18 May 1539; it described the unsettled conditions in the newly established province. Gonzalo de Alvarado produced his Probanza on 19 July 1555, also describing the general instability of the region {{of what is now}} western Honduras. Hernán Cortés described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his [...] Bernal Díaz del Castillo described Cortes' expedition to Honduras in his Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España ("True history of the conquest of New Spain"), which he completed some 40 years after the campaigns it describes. Chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés' Historia general y natural de las Indias, isla y tierra firme del Mar Océano ("General and Natural History of the Indies, island and mainland of the Ocean Sea") gives a detailed account of the events in Honduras to 1536, as does Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas in his Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas i tierra firme del Mar Océano ("General History of the Deeds of the Castillians in the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea"). As well as the accounts of the chroniclers, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> body of legal documents, probanzas de mérito (proofs of merit), dispatches and other records stored in the Archivo General de las Indias in Seville, Spain, and in the Archivo General de Centroamérica in Guatemala City. These include a great body letters and documents pertaining to the lawsuits between Pedro de Alvarado and Francisco de Montejo, dating to 1539–1541. Francisco de Montejo's letter to the king of Spain, dated 10 June 1539, includes an account of the siege of the Peñol de Cerquín, the subsequent conquest of Comayagua, and the battle of Tenampua.|$|E
