5|$|He was {{the only}} Republican senator <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the Freedom to Farm Act in 1996, saying that it catered to special {{interests}} rather than representing true reform of farm subsidies policy. He {{was one of only}} five senators <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the Telecommunications Act of 1996, {{on the grounds that it}} put the economic interests of corporations ahead of those of consumers.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Mayor William Hale Thompson, a {{flamboyant}} Republican, {{invoked the}} riot in a misleading pamphlet urging African Americans <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the Republican nominee, Rep Ruth Hanna McCormick, in the United States Senate race for her late husband's seat. She was {{the widow of}} Sen. Joseph Medill McCormick {{as well as the}} sister-in-law of Chicago Tribune publisher Robert Rutherford McCormick. The McCormicks were a powerful Chicago family whom Thompson opposed.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{he became}} the longest-serving senator from Oregon, surpassing the record of 9,726days in office {{previously}} held by Charles McNary. In 1995, Hatfield was the only Republican in the Senate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the proposed balanced budget amendment, and was the deciding vote that prevented {{the passage of the}} bill. In 1996 the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, a group he served on previously, granted him their Distinguished Service Award.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, she co-authored the Senate {{version of}} a statewide {{workplace}} nondiscrimination bill, co-authored inclusive insurance nondiscrimination legislation, and {{she was one of}} only two senators <b>to</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> an anti-trans marriage bill.|$|R
5000|$|Herseth Sandlin <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the Affordable Health Care for America Act. In regards <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> Healthcare Reform, {{she said}} she would [...] "not vote for the Senate bill as is” and that she would [...] "not vote for a package of changes that would go through the {{reconciliation}} process.” ...|$|R
50|$|Dole's slim {{victory in}} the state made Colorado {{one of only three}} states (along with Georgia and Montana) <b>to</b> flip from <b>voting</b> for Clinton in 1992 <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> him in 1996, even as Clinton {{increased}} his national margin of victory by nearly 3 points.|$|R
5|$|In Opposition, Thatcher {{wanted to}} prevent the {{creation}} of a Scottish assembly. She instructed Conservative MPs <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was successfully defeated, and then when new Bills were proposed she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on devolution.|$|E
5|$|Morrissey is {{a lifelong}} Liverpool FC fan, {{having grown up in}} the city. He is also a {{supporter}} of the Labour Party, as well as being a patron of the human rights organisation Reprieve. In August 2014, Morrissey was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian asking people in Scotland <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue.|$|E
5|$|On the AEC from 1949 to 1954, Smyth argued unsuccessfully {{against a}} crash course to develop the {{hydrogen}} bomb and in favor of international control of nuclear weapons. He was the sole {{member of the commission}} <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> stripping J. Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance. As IAEA ambassador from 1961 to 1970 he {{played an important role in}} the realization of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E

5000|$|A {{proposal}} to re-institute commercial whaling, {{which would have}} required a three quarters majority <b>to</b> carry the <b>vote,</b> was defeated 29 <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> 23 <b>against</b> (<b>Vote</b> held on 21 June 2005) ...|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley Mayne, a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. Mayne was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. Mayne, however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated Mayne in a 1974 rematch.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice John Roberts {{administered}} {{the oath of}} office to Obama. Michelle Obama held the Bible, which was used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration, as Barack Obama placed his hand on the Bible and recited the presidential oath. Nearly four years earlier, then-Senator Obama had been one of 22 Senators <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> Roberts during Roberts' Supreme Court nomination; the inauguration marked the first time a Chief Justice {{administered the}} oath to a President-elect who had previously voted against the Chief Justice's confirmation.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term, Cleveland {{successfully}} nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first, Lucius Q.C. Lamar, {{was a former}} Mississippi Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When William Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the Confederacy two decades earlier caused many Republicans <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.|$|E
50|$|Resolution 670, {{the ninth}} to condemn Iraq for its {{invasion}} of Kuwait, {{was approved by}} 14 <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> one <b>vote</b> <b>against,</b> from Cuba, and no abstentions.|$|R
50|$|The {{bill had}} its first reading debate on 7 December 2005, and {{subsequently}} failed 47 <b>votes</b> in favour <b>to</b> 73 <b>votes</b> <b>against.</b>|$|R
40|$|Robert E. Lloyd says in {{his opinion}} piece that the library has nothing to {{consider}} but its budget. He said that he <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the budget {{for the same reason}} that he has <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> all money issues, high taxes. Lloyd says that everyone that he has talked <b>to</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the budget because of high taxes, and that it had nothing to do with Playboy. He then ends by saying that radical groups have tried to use tax issues for their own purpose throughout history and that is has never worked...|$|R
5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible for Democrats to win.|$|E
5|$|Ohio {{asserted}} that the boundary was firmly established in its constitution and thus Michigan's citizens were simply intruders; the state government refused to negotiate the issue with the Michigan Territory. The Ohio Congressional delegation was active in blocking Michigan from attaining statehood, lobbying other states <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> Michigan. In January 1835, frustrated by the political stalemate, Michigan's acting territorial Governor Stevens T. Mason called for a constitutional convention {{to be held in}} May of that year despite Congress' refusal to approve an enabling act authorizing such a state constitution.|$|E
5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His {{original}} proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E
50|$|In {{the recent}} election, Simon Strelchik {{achieved}} a vote increase of 25%, <b>to</b> 4405 <b>votes,</b> <b>against</b> Liberal Susan Kadis and Conservative Anthony Reale.|$|R

5000|$|... "I have {{maintained}} my independence {{and have not}} been afraid to go against the ‘powers-that-be' in state government, especially when it came <b>to</b> <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> the legislative pay raise. I was so dead set against the pay raise that I actually signed an affidavit declining {{the increase in the}} event the legislation was eventually signed into law by the governor," [...] said Richard.|$|R
5|$|However, Wilson defends House when House's {{career is}} in jeopardy, after billionaire {{entrepreneur}} and then chairman of Princeton-Plainsboro's Board Edward Vogler (Chi McBride) proposes a motion for House's dismissal. Wilson {{is the only}} one <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the motion. In response, Vogler proposes and succeeds in obtaining Wilson's dismissal, but Wilson is soon reinstated thanks to Cuddy after she convinces the board that Vogler is the real threat to the hospital and his money is not worth his business-obsessed mindset. In a late Season episode it is revealed that Wilson suffers from clinical depression and takes medication. Wilson is also seen to write with his left hand, a trait he shares with Cuddy and Foreman, but when he performs detailed medical work, such as injections or incisions, or gesticulates while speaking, appears to be right-handed in general, suggesting he may be ambidextrous.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the decline in Klan membership, in 1926, Evans organized a Klan parade in Washington, D.C., hoping that a large turnout would demonstrate the Klan's power. About 30,000 members attended, making it the largest parade in the group's history. Evans was disappointed, however, as he had expected double the attendance and the march did not stanch the drop in membership. That year, Evans attempted to rally U.S. senators <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> a bill supporting a proposed world court. He was unsuccessful, however, and several Klan-backed senators followed Calvin Coolidge and supported the bill. In 1928, Evans opposed the candidacy of the New York Democratic governor Al Smith for president, emphasizing the threat of Smith's Catholic faith. After the Republican Herbert Hoover won the election, Evans boldly claimed responsibility for Smith's loss; {{but most of the}} solidly Democratic South had rejected Hoover and voted for Smith against the Klan's advice.|$|E
5|$|Limited to {{two terms}} as governor, Hatfield {{announced}} his candidacy in the 1966 U.S. Senate election {{for the seat}} vacated by the retiring Maurine Neuberger. During the Vietnam War, and during an election year, {{he was the only}} person <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> a resolution by a governors' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966. At that time the war was supported by 75percent of the public, and was also supported by Hatfield's opponent in the November election. He won the primary election with 178,782 votes compared to a combined 56,760votes for three opponents. Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman Robert Duncan in the election. In order to finish his term as governor, which ended on January 9, 1967, he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3.|$|E
50|$|Barclay {{was named}} by Conservative Home {{as one of}} a {{minority}} of loyal Conservative backbench MPs not <b>to</b> have <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the government in any significant rebellions.|$|R
50|$|For some {{undeclared}} reason, Lebas did {{not take}} part <b>to</b> the <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> the constitutional change that established an authoritarian regime under the government of Marshal Philippe Pétain.|$|R
50|$|On 12 January 2005 the European Parliament voted {{a legally}} {{non-binding}} resolution {{in support of}} the Constitution by 500 <b>votes</b> in favour <b>to</b> 137 <b>votes</b> <b>against,</b> with 40 abstentions.|$|R
5|$|Mitchell {{proved to}} be an {{energetic}} and effective constituency member. He also served for a year as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland. However, it became apparent that he was not likely to progress as a minister. His main political interest was the British Army and he was frequently critical of the Army’s leadership. For example, in August 1970 he was quoted as having referred to ”… those bastards in Whitehall”. He gravitated towards {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party. He opposed British membership of the European Community, Rhodesian sanctions, and the arms embargo on Israel. He became a prominent member of both the Monday Club and the Anglo-Rhodesian Society. Mitchell became known as a maverick MP and was one of 39 Conservative rebels who defied the Party whip <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> British entry to the EEC in the Commons vote on 28 October 1971.|$|E
5|$|Turnbull's {{willingness}} {{to negotiate with}} the government was met with opposition from some Coalition MPs. By September 2009, The Australian was reporting that only 12 of the 59 Liberal backbenchers supported negotiations. On 18 October 2009, Turnbull fronted a meeting of Coalition MPs with a proposal to negotiate amendments to the government's ETS. This meeting supported his proposal, in what was seen as a test of Turnbull's leadership. However, there was speculation that a number of Coalition Senators would defy Turnbull and cross the floor of the Senate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> any ETS legislation. The ETS opponents argued that it would be premature for Parliament to pass ETS legislation before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} {{convention}} in 1792, a committee composed of Garrard, Ambrose Dudley, and Augustine Eastin {{reported to the}} Elkhorn Baptist Association in favor of forbidding slavery in the constitution then being drafted for the new state. Slavery was {{a major issue in}} the 1792 convention that finalized the document. Delegate David Rice, a Presbyterian minister, was the leading voice against the inclusion of slavery protections in the new constitution, while George Nicholas argued most strenuously in favor of them. Garrard encouraged his fellow ministers and Baptists <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> its inclusion. The motion to delete Article 9 of the proposed document, which protected the rights of slave owners, failed by a vote of 1626. Each of the seven Christian ministers who served as delegates to the convention (including Garrard) voted in favor of deleting the article. Five Baptist laymen defied Garrard's instructions and voted to retain Article 9; their votes provided the necessary margin for its inclusion. Historian Lowell H. Harrison wrote that the anti-slavery votes of the ministers may have accounted for the adoption of a provision that forbade ministers from serving in the Kentucky General Assembly. Garrard and the other ministers apparently expressed no dissent against this provision.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 Harris {{was named}} by Conservative Home {{as one of}} a {{minority}} of loyal Conservative backbench MPs not <b>to</b> have <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> the government in any significant rebellions.|$|R
