5|$|Collection of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> for culinary use {{has also}} been {{documented}} in Nepal. However, the Nepalese do not consider it a choice mushroom for eating; of the three grades given to edible mushrooms, it was given the worst. Again, unlike other mushrooms, no medicinal use was reported. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{has also been}} the only non-morel species exported from Nepal for culinary use.|$|E
5|$|Mycena haematopus can be parasitized by Spinellus fusiger, another fungal species {{which gives}} <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> a strikingly hairy appearance.|$|E
5|$|Takahashi {{suggests}} that <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> is best {{classified in the}} section Mycena of the genus Mycena, as defined by Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recoverable}} edible fungi are the agaric [...] ("virno"), <b>the</b> field <b>mushroom</b> ("petranùgliu"), <b>the</b> craterellus ("scardarella"), chanterelle ("gaglinella"), <b>the</b> honey <b>mushroom</b> ("chiuìttu"), <b>the</b> cauliflower <b>mushroom</b> ("retélla"), <b>the</b> parasol <b>mushroom,</b> <b>the</b> Caesar's <b>mushroom,</b> <b>the</b> {{penny bun}} or boletus edulis and others not {{picked up by}} the inhabitants.|$|R
5000|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> hold {{a lot of}} water, {{they are}} often {{prepared}} using a [...] "dry sauté" [...] method: after cleaning, <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are sliced {{and put in a}} covered pan over high heat with no oil or butter. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> then release much of their water, which can be allowed to boil off or be poured off and used as a stock. Many people often cook <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> with butter because it [...] "sweetens" [...] them.|$|R
25|$|The yellow {{color of}} <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> is from {{alkaloids}} known as birnbaumins; whether these compounds {{are responsible for}} <b>the</b> <b>mushroom's</b> toxicity is unknown.|$|R
5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, pungent, fruity smell. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> is poisonous, {{containing}} muscarine compounds. Consumption of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{could lead}} to a number of physiological effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Various {{parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> display {{characteristic}} color reactions to chemical tests {{commonly used in}} mushroom identification. The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with {{the application of a}} drop of potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with a drop of FeSO4, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mold-like fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum. Infection {{results in}} {{necrosis}} of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> tissue, {{and a yellow}} color caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia (single-celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores).|$|E
50|$|The {{children}} also {{take care of}} several <b>mushroom</b> huts. <b>The</b> children harvest the crop before washing, weighing and distributing <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> to <b>the</b> Central Purchasing department. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> are also sold at local food markets.|$|R
25|$|Another {{theme is}} a kind of {{military}} racism, or species-ism. <b>The</b> <b>Mushrooms</b> are clearly described as different, although they would seem to be human, to some extent. However, when it comes to battle, <b>the</b> <b>Mushrooms</b> are treated like non-humans or animals—alien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises no questions of conscience. The Minnipins feel no pity for their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from <b>the</b> <b>Mushrooms</b> as they are killed.|$|R
5000|$|These are {{singular}} songs. Berry picking songs describe {{young girls}} picking berries, meeting boys and their conversations. Mushroom gathering songs can be humorous, making {{light of the}} process of gathering and cooking <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms,</b> describing <b>the</b> [...] "war" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>mushrooms</b> or their [...] "weddings." ...|$|R
5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with <b>the</b> <b>mushroom,</b> then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The toxic effect {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{symptoms}} of poisoning appear within {{three hours of}} ingestion of <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> as visual hallucinations, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. Severe cases involving coma, convulsions, or death are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, Swiss {{physician}} René Flammer {{discovered an}} antigen within <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body's immune cells to consider its own {{red blood cells}} as foreign and attack them. Despite this, {{it was not until}} 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P.involutus, and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998. The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms. Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> {{for a long period of}} time, sometimes for many years, and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions. The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as a hypersensitivity reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is caused not by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in <b>the</b> <b>mushroom.</b> The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum. In the course of subsequent meals, antigen-antibody complexes are formed; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown.|$|E

50|$|The cuplike to convex fruit {{bodies of}} the fungus are 0.2 to 0.6 cm in diameter, and grayish-blue to grayish-black in color. The dry cap surface is covered with small, fine hairs. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> have no stem, and have a firm but {{gelatinous}} flesh. <b>The</b> <b>mushrooms</b> produce a white spore print.|$|R
5|$|Like {{those of}} many other species of Marasmius, the fruit bodies of M.rotula can desiccate and shrivel in dry periods, then revive when {{sufficient}} moisture is available again {{in the form of}} rain or high humidity. Gilliam's study demonstrated that revived fruit bodies were capable of discharging spores over a period of at least three weeks, whereas previous studies using similar methods with other Agaricomycetes showed spore discharge occurred over a shorter period of up to six days after revival. The potential for sustained spore production and discharge {{may be due to the}} growth of new basidioles (immature basidia) during periods of growth, which then complete maturation when <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> revives. This may also explain why the gills become thicker as <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> matures.|$|E
5|$|Mycena clariviolacea {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, Japan. Fruit bodies are found growing solitary or scattered, on dead fallen twigs in forests that are {{dominated}} by oak and chinquapin trees. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> fruits from June to September.|$|E
5|$|Mycena mustea {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, Japan. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> is found growing solitary to {{scattered}} on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests {{dominated by the}} hornbeam carpinus (Carpinus tschonoskii) and the Chinese evergreen oak (Quercus myrsinaefolia).|$|E

5|$|Mycena nidificata {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, Japan. <b>The</b> <b>mushroom</b> is found growing solitary or scattered, on dead fallen twigs in forests {{dominated}} by the oak species Quercus castanopsis. Fruiting occurs from May to September.|$|E
5|$|Pholiota flammans fruit bodies bear no {{distinctive}} {{smell and}} taste mild to slightly bitter. Opinions are divided as to its edibility, however, as some authors regard <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> as inedible, while others consider it edible or of unknown edibility.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make <b>the</b> <b>mushroom</b> nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E
