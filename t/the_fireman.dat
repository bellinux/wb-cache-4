5|$|On February 19, 1904, a Baltimore and Ohio train accidentally {{crossed the}} Big Four Bridge, due to {{engineer}} Dick Foreman falling asleep and going {{the wrong way}} at Otisco, Indiana. <b>The</b> <b>fireman</b> kept shoveling coal and did not pay attention. It was the conductor that finally noticed the error midway across the Big Four Bridge. The wayward train had to back {{up all the way}} back to Otisco.|$|E

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving <b>the</b> <b>fireman</b> to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 2015, Black 5 steam {{locomotive}} 45231 Sherwood Forester was working a WCRC special through Doncaster {{when it was}} noticed that its TPWS had been isolated by <b>the</b> <b>fireman.</b> As a result, in November 2015 a further prohibition notice was issued to WCRC by the ORR, suspending further steam services operated by them. It was reported that locomotives would need to have their TPWS modified to prevent the crew {{from being able to}} isolate it, before this suspension could be lifted.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and fireman, thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to <b>the</b> <b>fireman,</b> a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

5|$|Each {{station was}} {{built as a}} one-storey {{building}} around a square courtyard. The side adjacent to the railway line was left open, and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side. Other than the brick platform faces, chimneys and foundations, the stations were built entirely of wood. Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners, a first class and an ordinary refreshment room, {{and a set of}} apartments for LNC staff. The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed (permitted to sell alcohol). The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London, and on at least one occasion (on 12 January 1867) the driver became so drunk that <b>the</b> <b>fireman</b> had to drive the train back to London. This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch, provided they drank no more than one pint of beer.|$|E
5|$|Memory Almost Full is {{the fourteenth}} solo studio album by Paul McCartney, {{discounting}} his Wings-and-Beatles-era discography, his orchestral works and his output as <b>the</b> <b>Fireman.</b> It {{was released in}} the United Kingdom on 4 June 2007 and in the United States a day later. The album was the first release on Starbucks' Hear Music label. It was produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios, Henson Recording Studios, AIR Studios, Hog Hill Mill Studios and RAK Studios between October 2003, and from 2006 to February 2007. In between the 2003 and 2006 sessions, McCartney was working on another studio album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard (2005), with producer Nigel Godrich.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by <b>the</b> <b>fireman</b> from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E

5|$|One {{member of}} the Lord Nelson class was {{involved}} in {{what could have been}} a major accident on 23 January 1930. This entailed the leading driving wheels jumping off the track, though the locomotive ran for many yards before they re-railed themselves over a point. No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing <b>the</b> <b>fireman</b> and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed. No. 30854 Howard of Effingham was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was derailed by trap points at , Hampshire on 20 July 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either <b>the</b> <b>fireman</b> to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{versions}} of <b>the</b> <b>firemans</b> carry takeover used in professional wrestling. The first is borrowed from amateur wrestling and sees the wrestler kneel {{down on one knee}} and simultaneously grabs hold of one the opponents thighs with one arm and one of the opponents arms with his other arm. He then pulls the opponent on his shoulders and then rises up slightly, using the motion to push the opponent off his shoulders, flipping him to the mat on to his back. The other closely resembles a Death Valley driver. The wrestler performs <b>the</b> <b>firemans</b> carry from a standing position, then tosses the opponent off his shoulders as he drops down to his knees causing the opponent to land on his back. The standing variant is a higher impact version of the move because of the wrestler falling from a greater height, and is a move closely associated with John Cena through his use of it as his finishing maneuver, which he calls the Attitude Adjustment." ...|$|R
