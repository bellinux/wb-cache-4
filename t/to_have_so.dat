5|$|With {{the trilogy}} complete, Puccini {{had to decide}} on {{a place for the}} premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini {{received}} an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere could take place at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. Gianni Schicchi proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.|$|E

The former was based on the Di 4 and had twice the power of the Di 3. The Di 8 was slightly more powerful than the Di 3, and were intended for freight trains. Both series were put into service in 1996, but the Di 6 proved <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many technical problems that they were returned to Siemens in 1998. The Di 3 units had been set aside and some had been scrapped, but the return of the Di 6 forced NSB to put the units back into service.|$|E

500|$|USB device {{communication}} {{is based on}} pipes (logical channels). A pipe is a connection from the host controller to a logical entity, found on a device, and named an endpoint. Because pipes correspond 1-to-1 to endpoints, the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. A USB device could have up to 32 endpoints (16 IN, 16 OUT), though it is rare <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many. An endpoint is defined and numbered by the device during initialization (the period after physical connection called [...] "enumeration") and so is relatively permanent, whereas a pipe may be opened and closed.|$|E
500|$|The unused {{scenario}} Tomie {{had written}} for the original version {{was included in the}} Nintendo DS version {{in the form of a}} bonus dungeon, playable after completion of the main game.

The developers considered using smaller Tainted Insects, but eventually decided to change the nest into a path with insects appearing every ten floors, and renamed the dungeon [...] "The Tainted Path".|$|E

Gosling portrayed a Hollywood stunt {{performer}} who moonlights as a getaway driver and he has described the film as a [...] "violent John Hughes movie": [...] "I always thought if Pretty in Pink had head-smashing it would be perfect". Roger Ebert compared Gosling to Steve McQueen and stated that he [...] "embodies presence and sincerity ... he has shown a gift for finding arresting, powerful characters [...] can achieve just about anything. Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal pondered [...] "the ongoing mystery of how he manages <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> much impact with so little apparent effort. It's irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando." [...] The film was a box office success, grossing $70 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{her career}} in musical theater, Lopez re-entered the music scene upon her {{portrayal}} of the title role in the Selena biopic {{of the same name}} (1997). The role inspired her to launch a career in music; critics deemed it risky, noting that if she was unsuccessful in doing so, it would be an embarrassment and could damage her career. During the production of her debut album, On the 6 (1999), Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the premise of having an already established name in the entertainment industry; her goal for the album was to prove she had musical talent. The success of her debut single [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] and On the 6 came as a surprise to critics; their release made the [...] "popular actor even more popular", with both the music industry and the public becoming intrigued by [...] "this woman who seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many different talents".|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it [...] "one {{of the best}} police movies in recent years, a virtuoso fusion of {{performances}} and often startling action", {{and went on to}} name the film the fourth best of 2012. Film critic James Berardinelli described End of Watch as [...] "satisfying and emotionally potent ... a good, gritty drama of the sort that seems increasingly rare within the thriller genre", giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. Olly Richards, writing for Empire, gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and summarized it as [...] "a collection of cop-movie clichés but presented with sufficient flair and strong performances that the ride is enough, even if its on rails". While New York Bilge Ebiri found the film largely unrealistic and Ayer's direction [...] "serviceable at best", he wrote that [...] "Ayer and his cast appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> convincingly nailed the way these characters talk and act that you might not even notice the film slipping from workaday grit into out-and-out myth." ...|$|E
500|$|Judge John Deed {{presents}} a fictionalised {{version of the}} English legal system. The British Film Institute's Screenonline notes that [...] "Almost every week, Deed is seen presiding over cases being prosecuted by his ex-wife or defended by his on-off girlfriend (with occasionally help from his daughter)", highlighting how unlikely {{it would be for}} a real judge <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many conflicts of interest in his court. It also notes that Deed's faults, such as his affairs with his therapist and with Francesca Rochester, prevent him from being [...] "a completely idealised heroic figure", and the fact that because all of his family and friends practise law, he is firmly entrenched in the legal system that he is constantly fighting against. Deed has been accused of hypocrisy, particularly for using his connections to bail Charlie after she destroyed GM crops in [...] "Exacting Justice". There is a belief in some legal circles that, although Judge John Deed is arguably the most unrealistic of contemporary legal dramas, viewers see Deed as an aspirational character taking on a corrupt establishment. Despite being picked apart by legal professionals, the cast and Newman were invited to the annual dinner of the Association of Women Barristers in 2006 as part of a drive to raise the profile and attract new members to the group.|$|E
500|$|Lopez's debut single, [...] "If You Had My Love", was {{released}} in May 1999. The song reached the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated June 12, 1999, dethroning Ricky Martin's [...] "Livin' La Vida Loca" [...] as the number-one song in the country. The song stayed atop the Billboard Hot 100 {{for a period of}} a month and remained in the top ten until September 1999. [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] was also a success internationally; topping the charts in countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The song also peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten of seven other countries. [...] "No Me Ames", a duet with American recording artist Marc Anthony {{was released}} as a B-side to [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] and as the album's second single. The song was promoted by Sony Discos, who released a salsa and a ballad version of the song on their respective radio formats. The success of [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] and On the 6 came as a surprise to critics; their release made the [...] "popular actor even more popular". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by [...] "this woman who seemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many different talents".

500|$|In early May 1793, Custine {{designed}} {{a plan to}} cut off a body of the Coalition force that had ventured {{too far from the}} main force at Mainz. However, since he was about to take command of the Army of the North, he delegated some of the responsibility for this plan to Houchard (another ill-fated general destined for the guillotine), instructing him to attack Limbourg with the Army of the Moselle. The garrison at Landau was to make several feints to distract the Prussian troops. Custine also created and distributed a false report that the cavalry of the Army of the Moselle had arrived, and that they had also been reinforced by part of the artillery from Strasbourg. General Féry, who commanded an 40 battalions, was to throw himself on the Prussians until he heard that the principal engagement by Rheinzabern had begun. Custine left with his troops in the evening; several delays prevented him from arriving until five in the morning, but Landremont engaged the Austrian army in the meanwhile and prevented them from advancing until Custine arrived and charged the Austrian post with two divisions of dragoons. Unfortunately, a battalion of French mistook Custine's dragoons for the enemy, and fired upon them with great accuracy. Any attempt to rally the battalion met with additional discharges. The commander, who apparently had no control over his troops, was denounced by both the representatives and his troops, and was arrested, but shot himself. Custine was disgusted with the affair: [...] "This day, which ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> memorable, terminated by the taking of one piece of cannon and a very great number of prisoners." [...] Custine was recalled to Paris on 15 July.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} {{and again in the}} fall of 1933, German-Japanese {{relations}} were badly troubled when the SA took to beating up Asians studying at German universities, which led to a number of complaints to the Auswärtiges Amt from both the Japanese and Chinese governments that their nationals studying at German universities were not safe. Both the Japanese ambassador to Germany and the Chinese minister handed numerous notes of protest in 1933 to Prince Bernard von Bülow, the State Secretary at the Auswärtiges Amt (who {{should not be confused with}} his uncle of the same name who served as Chancellor in 1900–09), complaining about [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] propaganda in German newspapers, reports that the German government was planning on banning interracial marriage and sex, and almost all of the Chinese and Japanese students studying in Germany had been beaten up by the SA. A frustrated Bülow sent a memo to his superior, the Foreign Minister, Baron Konstantin von Neurath, asking if anything could be done to stop the SA from beating up Asians in Germany, saying he was tired of taking almost daily complaints from Japanese and Chinese diplomats about their nationals' being assaulted by the SA. In October 1933, the Japanese government warned its nationals not to visit Germany, saying the country was unsafe for Asians to be in, and in November 1933, the Chinese government issued a similar warning to its citizens not to visit Germany. Neurath persuaded Hitler to order the SA to stop beating up Asians, pointing out that Chiang Kai-shek was threatening to expel the German military mission to China and replace it with a French military mission if the assaults continued. In regards to Japan, Neurath noted it was advantageous <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many scions of the Japanese elite studying at German universities, arguing that was an incalculable advantage to Germany in the long run. In November 1933, Hitler ordered the SA not to assault Asians in Germany anymore. At this time, Germany had much closer relations with China, to which a German military mission was attached to train the National Revolutionary Army than it did with Japan, and it was the complaints of the Chinese minister rather than the Japanese ambassador that were taken more seriously by the Auswärtiges Amt. At the same time, as the German military mission to China continued to grow together with German arms sales to China, which caused a number of Japanese complaints.|$|E

2500|$|Melbourne {{launched}} her boats {{almost immediately}} after the collision to recover survivors, and the carrier's wardroom and C Hangar were prepared for casualties.

Another 36 were recovered by Air Sprite and transported ashore. Sea searches continued until 12 February, and aircraft made occasional passes over the area until 14 February, looking for bodies.|$|E
