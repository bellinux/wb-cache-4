However, the Court determined that the ICWA does not defer to state law, and the trial court properly determined that the ICWA grants Indian fathers greater rights than state law.|$|E

5|$|Meat, {{mainly from}} farmed animals, {{is a major}} source of dietary protein around the world, {{averaging}} about 8% of man's energy intake. The actual types eaten depend on local preferences, availability, cost and other factors, with cattle, sheep, pigs and goats being the main species involved. Cattle generally produce a single offspring annually which <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year to mature; sheep and goats often have twins and these are ready for slaughter in less than a year; pigs are more prolific, producing more than one litter of up to about 11 piglets each year. Horses, donkeys, deer, buffalo, llamas, alpacas, guanacos and vicunas are farmed for meat in various regions. Some desirable traits of animals raised for meat include fecundity, hardiness, fast growth rate, ease of management and high food conversion efficiency. About half of the world's meat is produced from animals grazing on open ranges or on enclosed pastures, the other half being produced intensively in various factory-farming systems; these are mostly cows, pigs or poultry, and often reared indoors, typically at high densities.|$|E

This study examined grade experience differences for online NP students who <b>took</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> OCCPQ, compared to those who did not <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> OCCPQ.

If a not out batsman is not ready after a break in play, they can also be given out timed out on appeal. In the case of extremely long delays, the umpires may forfeit the match to either team. So far this method of taking a wicket has never been employed in the history of Test cricket.|$|E

25|$|The tunnel {{was opened}} on 13 March 1988, having cost {{a total of}} ¥538.4billion (US$3.6 billion) to construct. Once the tunnel was completed, all railway {{transport}} between Honshu and Hokkaido used it. However, for passenger transport, 90% of people use air due to the speed and cost. For example, to travel between Tokyo and Sapporo by train <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> nine hours, with several transfers. By air, the journey is three hours and thirty minutes, including airport access times. Deregulation and competition in Japanese domestic air travel has brought down prices on the Tokyo-Sapporo route, making rail more expensive in comparison.|$|E

500|$|The {{committee}} that selected the touring party was Bradman, Jack Ryder and Chappie Dwyer. They held their final meeting on Wednesday 11 February and announced {{the team that}} day. [...] The team was chosen with a dual emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling. This was {{in large part because}} England had agreed to make a new ball available after 55 six-ball overs in the Tests; a new ball was generally taken after every 200 runs, which usually <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 55 overs to accumulate, the rule change meant that a new ball was more frequently available. A new ball is more helpful to fast bowling, so this move favoured the team with the better pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E
500|$|The Voigt-Kampff {{machine is}} a fictional {{interrogation}} tool, originating from the novel. The Voigt-Kampff is a polygraph-like machine used by blade runners {{to determine whether}} an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement {{in response to questions}} dealing with empathy. (Tyrell states: [...] "Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary dilation of the iris?") In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes [...] "six or seven" [...] questions to make a determination. In the film it <b>takes</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.|$|E
