The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the <b>truncation</b> <b>error</b> terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{errors in}} idealised discrete element method (DEM) simulations are investigated analytically by comparing energy balances applied {{at the beginning}} and end of one time-step. This study focuses on the second-order velocity-Verlet integration scheme due to its widespread implementation in DEM codes. The commercial DEM software PFC 2 D was used to verify the correctness of key results. The <b>truncation</b> <b>errors,</b> which are larger than the round-off errors by orders of magnitude, have a superlinear relationship with both the simulation time-step and the interparticle collision speed.

Increasing the polydispersity in a simulation by including smaller particles necessitates choosing a smaller time-step to maintain simulation stability and reduces the <b>truncation</b> <b>errors</b> in most cases. The <b>truncation</b> <b>errors</b> are increased by the dissipation of energy by frictional sliding or by the inclusion of damping in the system.
