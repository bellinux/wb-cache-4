5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf and blind West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf and blind in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for <b>the</b> <b>blind.</b> Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for <b>the</b> <b>blind.</b> He and other educated blind people staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from <b>The</b> <b>Blind</b> Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her gingerbread house when <b>The</b> <b>Blind</b> Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing <b>The</b> <b>Blind</b> Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. <b>The</b> <b>Blind</b> Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they may pose a risk to <b>the</b> <b>blind,</b> small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have {{only one or two}} seconds, depending on the context, to audibly detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds.

5000|$|There {{are three}} common options {{for dealing with}} a player in <b>the</b> <b>blinds</b> who must also pay <b>the</b> kill <b>blind.</b> First, they may pay only <b>the</b> kill <b>blind</b> and their {{scheduled}} blind is not posted. Second, the player {{may be required to}} post both their scheduled <b>blind</b> and <b>the</b> kill <b>blind</b> for that hand, with only <b>the</b> kill <b>blind</b> being [...] "live" [...] for determining that player's bet amount (this method adds an extra element of risk to the player [...] "under the gun"). Lastly, the player may post their kill blind in this hand, and then [...] "owe" [...] their scheduled <b>blind</b> in <b>the</b> next hand when they no longer have to post <b>the</b> kill <b>blind,</b> similar to <b>the</b> moving button rule of blinds busting out. This can cause a shifting of all blinds to a player who triggered a kill while [...] "under the gun"; the player would first post <b>the</b> kill <b>blind</b> when <b>the</b> big <b>blind</b> was due, then in the next hand (assuming they didn't have to pay <b>the</b> kill <b>blind</b> again) they would pay their big <b>blind</b> instead of <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> that is now due. On the third hand, with the player on the button, <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> would be paid and the player is now [...] "caught up".|$|R
50|$|The normal {{rules for}} {{positioning}} <b>the</b> <b>blinds</b> {{do not apply}} when {{there are only two}} players at the table. The player on the button is always due <b>the</b> small <b>blind,</b> and <b>the</b> other player must pay <b>the</b> big <b>blind.</b> <b>The</b> player on the button is therefore the first to act before the flop, but last to act for all remaining betting rounds.|$|R

50|$|There can be some {{confusion}} about <b>the</b> small <b>blind.</b> Some (usually home) games treat <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> as dead {{money that is}} pulled into the center pot. In a $10/$25 pot limit game, <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> puts $10 into the pot before the cards are dealt. Using the dead money reasoning, <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> would put another $25 into the pot to call <b>the</b> big <b>blind,</b> {{for a total of}} $35. <b>The</b> big <b>blind</b> might then check for $25, which would enable that player to win out of proportion to their wager.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, the [...] "big blind" [...] {{is equal}} to the minimum bet. The [...] "small blind" [...] is {{normally}} half <b>the</b> big <b>blind.</b> In cases where posting exactly half <b>the</b> big <b>blind</b> is impractical due to <b>the</b> big <b>blind</b> being some odd-valued denomination, <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> is rounded (usually down) to the nearest practical value. For example, if <b>the</b> big <b>blind</b> in a live table game is $3, then <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> will usually be $1 or $2 since most casinos do not distribute large quantities of $0.50 poker chips.|$|R
50|$|Some cardrooms require {{players in}} <b>the</b> big <b>blind</b> {{position}} {{to have at}} least enough chips to cover <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> (and ante if applicable) in order to be dealt in. In cash games with such a rule, any player in <b>the</b> big <b>blind</b> with insufficient chips to cover <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> will not be dealt in unless they re-buy. In tournaments with such a rule, any player in <b>the</b> big <b>blind</b> with insufficient chips to cover <b>the</b> small <b>blind</b> will be eliminated with their remaining chips being removed from play.|$|R
