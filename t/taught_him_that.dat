5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E

However, he gives up his life in the end and gets put down by lethal injection, which kickstarts the whole revolt.|$|R
5|$|Legend of Mana was {{designed}} as a 2D game, despite the PlayStation's 3D-focus, as the console could not handle the full 3D world Ishii envisioned where one could interact with natural shaped objects. Kawazu initially let Ishii have a relaxed schedule and budget, as Ishii had a great number of ideas he wanted in the game, but when the project began to get out of control and out of time Kawazu tightened down the rest of the development schedule and convinced the Square executives to delay the game by two months—even though it had already been announced to the public—to allow it to be completed as Ishii envisioned. Kawazu has said that this experience <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> his true skill in game development lay in working as a producer.|$|E
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E

5000|$|The song is a {{moderate}} up-tempo mostly accompanied by electric guitar and fiddle. Its narrator {{is a young}} man who was accused of stealing candy in a store when he was 10 years old.

I have <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> all <b>that</b> I could, so far; and {{convinced}} myself {{that it would be}} the best. The boy loves me, and is happy: he would be miserable among strangers, who would laugh at his English, and would make him unhappy." ...|$|R
50|$|Alexander's {{interest}} in music started when {{a family friend}} he knew only as Otis <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> enough <b>that</b> when Otis left his guitar as a gift at Alexander's home, he was able {{pick it up and}} play. Alexander concentrated on singing as a teenager and later developed his guitar playing. His early influences were blues, country music, and rock and roll, including the blues keyboardist Rosco Gordon and the rock-and-roll artists Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley.|$|R
25|$|It {{is quite}} obvious from {{a review of}} Schreiner's conduct through {{the latter half of}} 1899 that he was entirely mistaken in his view of the Transvaal situation. He {{demonstrated}} the same inability to understand the uitlanders' grievances, the same futile belief in the eventual fairness of President Kruger as premier of Cape Colony as he had shown when giving evidence before the British South Africa Select Committee into the causes of the Jameson Raid. Experience should have <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> President Kruger was beyond any appeal to reason, and that the protestations of President Steyn were insincere.|$|E
25|$|His {{experience}} at Seminara <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> more was required on the battlefield. The battle was lost primarily because Ferdinand, ignoring de Córdoba's advice, persisted in fighting a pitched battle with their more lightly equipped troops. In the open field, the loose formation and short swords of the Spanish infantry {{put them at}} a disadvantage against a charge of heavy cavalry and pikemen. De Córdoba introduced a closer formation, dividing the Spanish infantry among the central body of pikemen and shooting wings. Known as a colunella, it was the original pike and shot formation. The French were expelled by 1498 without another battle, and he returned home.|$|E
500|$|Madgwick {{was born}} on 10 May 1905 in North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. He was the second of three sons of Australian-born parents Richard Charlton Madgwick and Annie Jane Elston. Madgwick's father was a tram-driver in Sydney and his mother a dressmaker. Both were active members of an Anglican church. Madgwick stated later that his parents <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "all {{men and women were}} sacred, and poverty and {{injustice}} were in some way contrary to God's teaching." [...] Madgwick described the most important things in his young life as family, church, and school.|$|E

I have <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> all <b>that</b> I know myself, and he can take a lunar, or work his reckoning out from a star observation, as accurately as I could do it myself.” ...|$|R
60|$|One truth, therefore, which Edward's {{blindness}} had <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> was, <b>that</b> {{his mind}} and soul could dispense {{with the assistance of}} his eyes. Doubtless, however, he would have found this lesson far more difficult to learn {{had it not been for}} the affection of those around him. His parents, and George and Emily, aided him to bear his misfortune; if possible, they would have lent him their own eyes. And this, too, was a good lesson for <b>him.</b> It <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> how dependent on one another God has ordained us to be, insomuch that all the necessities of mankind should incite them to mutual love.|$|R
5000|$|Teahan {{was born}} in 1905 at Glountane, South County Kerry, Ireland. His father {{died when he was}} very young. His mother was a popular singer, while his {{extended}} family contained many musicians who played at dances in the neighbourhood. Among his neighbours were eminent musicians Padraig O'Keeffe, who <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> music at Glountane School, and Johnny O'Leary. O'Keeffe's father, Seán, and sister Nora Carmody also <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> at <b>that</b> school. In 1928 he emigrated to the United States and settled in Chicago. Over the next few years, during the depression, he returned to Ireland, but set off again for Chicago in 1933. He started work with Illinois Central in 1936 and remained with them until he retired in 1970.|$|R

The room's occupants gasp as they realize he just annihilated {{the entire population of}} Earth except for the top of Mount Everest. Dr. Noah is not prepared to spare Bashir, and just as he is about to execute Bashir, Eddington is able to transfer the crew's patterns into the computers aboard the USS Defiant. They are then simply beamed aboard, returning to their normal selves. In the holosuite, Bashir and Garak end the program with relief: Bashir [...] "saved the day" [...] by [...] "destroying the world", Garak notes; Bashir jibes Garak that they never <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> in the Obsidian Order.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{graduated}} from the Naval Academy in June 1958; he was fifth from the bottom in class rank, 894th out of 899. [...] Despite his difficulties, McCain later wrote that he never defamed the more compelling traditions of the Academy – courage, resilience, honor, and sacrifice for one's country – and he never wavered in his desire to show his father and family that he was of the same mettle as his naval forebears. Indeed, Slew and Jack McCain had not had sterling records at the Academy themselves, finishing in the bottom third and bottom twentieth respectively. McCain realized later that the Academy had <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> [...] "to sustain my self-respect for a lifetime {{it would be necessary}} for me to have the honor of serving something greater than my self-interest", a lesson that he would need to carry him through a [...] "desperate and uncertain" [...] time a decade later.|$|E
500|$|Hergé {{wanted to}} set Tintin's first {{adventure}} in the United States in order to involve Native Americans—a people who had fascinated him since boyhood—in the story. Wallez rejected this idea, which later saw realisation as the series' third instalment, Tintin in America (1932). Instead, Wallez wanted Hergé to send Tintin to the Soviet Union, founded in 1922 by the Marxist–Leninist Bolshevik Party after seizing power in the Russian Empire during the 1917 October Revolution. The Bolsheviks greatly altered the country's society by nationalising industry and replacing a capitalist economy with a state socialist one. By the late 1920s, the Soviet Union's first leader, Vladimir Lenin, had died and been replaced by Joseph Stalin. Being both Roman Catholic and politically right-wing, Wallez was opposed to the atheist, anti-Christian, and extreme left-wing Soviet government, and wanted Tintin's first adventure to reflect this, to persuade its young readers with anti-Marxist and anti-communist ideas. Later commenting on why he produced a work of propaganda, Hergé {{said that he had}} been [...] "inspired by the atmosphere of the paper", which <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> being a Catholic meant being anti-Marxist, and since childhood he had been horrified by the Bolshevik shooting of the Romanov family in July 1918.|$|E
6000|$|Yet he {{was working}} for Him to the utmost of his power. A little boy in the {{neighbourhood}} had fallen into the fire, and lost his eyesight in consequence. The old minister took him into his house to instruct, and first <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> to repeat many chapters in the Bible, and to know it so thoroughly that when listening to readers he could correct them if they missed a word; after which he <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> Latin, so <b>that</b> an [...] "ordinary piece" [...] had become easy to him.|$|R
50|$|The first Liath Luachra {{is one of}} Fionn's foster {{mothers who}} raise him {{after the death of}} his father Cumhal at the hands of Goll mac Morna. She is a great warrior and a {{companion}} of Fionn's aunt, the druidess Bodhmall; together they raise the boy in secret in the forest of Sliabh Bladhma. Eventually Fionn's ever-spreading fame threatens to bring his father's killers to him, and his caretakers send him to find his own way. By this point they have <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> enough <b>that</b> he can survive on his own, and he goes into the king of Bantry's service.|$|R
6000|$|... "We didn't breathe, Jack; we're too old {{hands for}} that. When we saw you fall we just drew back, took a breath, and then shut our mouths, {{and went down}} for you {{just the same as}} if we'd been a groping for you under water. We got hold of you both, lifted you up, and carried you along as far as we could before we drew a breath again. You're sharp, Jack, but you don't know {{everything}} yet." [...] And Bill Haden chuckled to find that for once his practical experience <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> something <b>that</b> Jack had not learned from his books.|$|R
500|$|In {{the second}} {{statement}} she alleged that, between July and October 1984, Bamber said {{he wished he}} could [...] "get rid of them all". He had talked disparagingly about his [...] "old" [...] father and [...] "mad" [...] mother, she said, who were trying to [...] "run his life". He said his sister had nothing to live for, and that the twins were disturbed. That his parents were paying for Sheila's expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said. In discussions she said she had dismissed as [...] "idle talk", Bamber had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering the house through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger [...] "because the last phone call made would be recorded". He claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill, but he said it had <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{he would not be able}} to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{claimed that}} it was his 1940 card sketch that served as the character's concept, and which Finger {{associated}} with Veidt's portrayal. Kane hired the 17-year-old Robinson as an assistant in 1939, after he saw Robinson in a white jacket decorated with his own illustrations. Beginning as a letterer and background inker, Robinson quickly became primary artist for the newly created Batman comic book series. In a 1975 interview in The Amazing World of DC Comics, Robinson said he wanted a supreme arch-villain who could test Batman, but not a typical crime lord or gangster designed to be easily disposed. He wanted an exotic, enduring character as an ongoing source of conflict for Batman (similar to the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty), designing a diabolically sinister-but-clownish villain. Robinson was intrigued by villains; his studies at Columbia University <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> some characters are made up of contradictions, leading to the Joker's sense of humor. He said that the name came first, followed by an image of a playing card from a deck he often had at hand: [...] "I wanted somebody visually exciting. I wanted somebody that would make an indelible impression, would be bizarre, would be memorable like the Hunchback of Notre Dame or any other villains that had unique physical characters." [...] He told Finger about his concept by telephone, later providing sketches of the character and images of what would become his iconic Joker playing-card design. Finger thought the concept was incomplete, providing the image of Veidt with a ghastly, permanent rictus grin.|$|E
500|$|Storylines for a {{potential}} series had been drafted by writer Mike Bullen during production of the pilot. When production on the series began, producer Christine Langan worked with him to create detailed plots for all six episodes, also acting as a script editor to redraft Bullen's work. Many of the plots were drawn from his own life; Pete and Jenny bringing up their new baby paralleled Bullen and his wife, whose first child was born in late 1997. The scenes where Pete and Jenny attend the antenatal classes were written from Bullen's memory, {{when he and his}} wife were [...] "given callipers, forceps and a suction cup to play with". The conclusion of the fourth episode, in which Pete's father dies on the way to his grandson's christening, was suggested by Harries, whose own experience of the death of his father <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> people rarely have the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones in real life. Not all storylines were based on real life: For Karen and David's marriage guidance scenes in Episode 5, Bullen consulted the relationship support charity Relate. Actors and directors also had input into the scripts; Bullen's original script for the marriage therapy scenes ended with David shouting and apparently using a fire extinguisher as an offensive weapon. Bathurst was not convinced that was something that his character would do, as David is [...] "too much of a coward to do anything overtly" [...] and would not leave himself so [...] "exposed": ...|$|E

As {{a senior at}} Boston College, O'Neill ran for {{a seat on the}} Cambridge City Council, but lost; his first race and only electoral defeat.

2500|$|In 1951, McCullough began {{attending}} Yale University. He {{said that}} it was a [...] "privilege" [...] to study English at Yale because of faculty members such as John O'Hara, John Hersey, Robert Penn Warren, and Brendan Gill. McCullough occasionally ate lunch with the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and playwright Thornton Wilder. Wilder, says McCullough, <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> a competent writer maintains [...] "an air of freedom" [...] in the storyline, so that a reader will not anticipate the outcome, even if the book is non-fiction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{religious}} revival {{known as}} the [...] Great Awakening reached Virginia when Henry was a child. His father was staunchly Anglican, but his mother often took him to hear Presbyterian preachers. Although Henry remained a lifelong Anglican communicant, ministers such as Samuel Davies <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{it is not enough}} to save one's own soul, but one should help to save society. He also learned that oratory should reach the heart, not just persuade based on reason. His oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers, seeking to reach the people by speaking to them in their own language.|$|E
2500|$|These men {{strongly}} influenced Cousin's philosophical thought. To Laromiguière he attributes {{the lesson of}} decomposing thought, even though the reduction of it to sensation was inadequate. Royer-Collard <b>taught</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> even sensation is subject to certain internal laws and principles which it does not itself explain, which are superior to analysis and the natural patrimony of the mind. De Biran made a special study of the phenomena of the will. He taught him to distinguish in all cognitions, {{and especially in the}} simplest facts of consciousness, the voluntary activity in which our personality is truly revealed. It was through this [...] "triple discipline" [...] that Cousin's philosophical thought was first developed, and that in 1815 he began the public teaching of philosophy in the Normal School and in the faculty of letters.|$|E
