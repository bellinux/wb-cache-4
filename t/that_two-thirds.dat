5|$|Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose}} of army cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found <b>that</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
5|$|In May 1707, Governor Dudley {{organized}} {{an expedition}} to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed. In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead. In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported <b>that</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of the fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indian raids. French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out.|$|E

If the law is a byproduct of motor optimality principles, it is plausible that the very mechanism <b>that</b> produces the <b>two-thirds</b> law for the human body also produces something quite similar when controlling a vehicle.|$|R

5|$|The {{process was}} further refined by Gregory XV with his 1621 bull Aeterni Patris Filius, which {{established}} {{the requirement of}} a two-thirds majority of cardinal electors to elect a pope. The Third Lateran Council had initially set the requirement <b>that</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of the cardinals were needed to elect a pope in 1179. This requirement had varied since then, {{depending on whether the}} winning candidate was allowed to vote for himself, in which cases the required majority was two-thirds plus one vote. Aeterni Patris Filius prohibited this practice and established two-thirds as the standard needed for election. Aeterni Patris Filius did not eliminate the possibility of election by acclamation, but did require that a secret ballot take place first before a pope could be elected.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{roads were}} in poor {{condition}} when Combs became governor. The Automotive Safety Foundation found <b>that</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of Kentucky's federal roads were below standards for existing traffic demands. It further found that {{twenty percent of}} the state's major city streets were inadequate, that another fifty-five percent would soon be inadequate due to increasing traffic, and that half of the state's secondary roads were unfit for modern industrial traffic. To address these problems, Combs issued $100million in bonds to increase funding for highways, appointing Earle Clements as state highway commissioner to oversee the correction of the road issues. One of the new roads, the Mountain Parkway, which connected Combs' native Eastern Kentucky to Central Kentucky, was later renamed the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway in Combs' honor. Because of generous funding in Combs' budget, Kentucky finished its portions of the Interstate Highway System much sooner than surrounding states such as Virginia and Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present in every one of the isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean <b>that</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

5|$|Xinhua did not {{immediately}} disclose the ethnic breakdown of the dead, but journalists from The Times and The Daily Telegraph reported {{that most of the}} victims appeared to have been Han. For instance, on 10 July Xinhua stated that 137 of the dead (out of the total of 184 that was being reported at that time) were Han, 46 Uyghur, and 1 Hui. There were casualties among the rioters as well; for example, according to official accounts, a group of 12 rioters attacking civilians were shot by police. In the months following the riots, the government maintained that the majority of casualties were Han and hospitals said <b>that</b> <b>two-thirds</b> of the injured were Han, although the World Uyghur Congress claims that many Uyghurs were killed as well. According to the official count released by the Chinese government in August 2009, 134 of the 156 civilian victims were Han, 11 Hui, 10 Uyghur, and 1 Manchu. Uyghur advocates continue to question these figures, saying that the number of ethnic Uyghurs remains understated. Xinhua reported that 627 vehicles and 633 constructions were damaged.|$|E
