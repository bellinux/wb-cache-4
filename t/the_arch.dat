5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arch</b> is {{constructed}} from local stone and was originally {{topped by a}} bronze chariot pulled by six horses. Statues of nymphs poured water into carved marble basins {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> Caracalla and Julia Domna were represented on medallion busts, though these have been defaced. The monument was reconstructed by the French between 1930–34. However, the restoration is incomplete and of disputed accuracy. The inscription on the top of <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> was reconstructed from the fragments noticed by Windus in 1722, which had been scattered on {{the ground in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> {{remained}} rural {{until the early}} 20th century. A tram used to pass near <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> between 1905 and 1929. After World War II, the suburb of Fleur-de-Lys developed in the area, and it got {{its name from the}} heraldic symbols on <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> is decorated with images of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E

50|$|The London and Greenwich Railway {{directors}} originally envisaged using <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> for {{low cost}} housing, but were soon dissuaded of <b>the</b> plan. <b>The</b> <b>arches</b> are extensively used for light engineering workshops, scrap dealers, and lockups.

5|$|British Railways {{announced}} a complete rebuild of Euston that could accommodate a fully electrified West Coast Main Line in 1959. Because of the restricted layout of track and tunnels {{at the northern}} end, enlargement could be accomplished only by expanding southwards over the area occupied by the Great Hall and <b>the</b> <b>Arch.</b> Consequently, the London County Council were given notice that <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> and the Great Hall would be demolished, which was granted on the proviso that <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> would be restored and re-sited. This was financially unviable as BR estimated it would cost at least £190,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|Excavations near <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> resumed between 1994 and 1996, {{directed}} by Ronny Reich and Yaacov Billig. These have uncovered {{much of the}} debris from the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> The remains include both stairs from the staircase and stones from its rounded handrails. Some of these are still visible where they were found, at the Jerusalem Archaeological Park now occupying the site.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of Buckingham Palace, the improvement plans were revisited. The grand entrance to the park at Hyde Park Corner was designed by Decimus Burton, and was constructed in the 1820s. Burton laid out the paths and driveways and designed a series of lodges, the Screen/Gate at Hyde Park Corner (also known as the Grand Entrance or the Apsley Gate) in 1825 and the Wellington Arch, which opened in 1828. The Screen and <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> originally formed a single composition, {{designed to provide a}} monumental transition between Hyde Park and Green Park, although <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> was moved in 1883. It originally had a statue of the Duke of Wellington on top; it was moved to Aldershot in 1883 when <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> was re-sited.|$|E

5|$|South of the Temple Mount, {{excavators}} {{have uncovered}} an inscribed Roman milestone bearing {{the names of}} Vespasian and Titus, fashioned {{from one of the}} staircase handrails which stood on top of <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> This places the destruction of <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> at no later than 79CE.|$|E
5|$|The {{next thing}} {{built on the}} grounds was an eight foot arch that went from the rectory to the next future building. A statue of Saint Peter {{was placed in the}} niche over the {{keystone}} of <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> From <b>the</b> <b>arch,</b> a large stairway descends to the lower level of the grounds.|$|E
5|$|The shape, size, {{insertion}} and {{origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> can vary widely. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> usually occurs {{on both sides}} of the body; but may also occur only on one side. The muscular component of <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> varies, with some arches seen to be purely fibrous. The origin can be a direct continuation of the latissimus dorsi muscle fibres, originate with the tendinous element of the latissimus dorsi, or be a mixture of the two types originating from both the muscle and the tendon.|$|E

5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer {{corners of the}} towers are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between the towers is a deep entrance arch of six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched mouldings to <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> The tympanum of <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> contains an empty niche.|$|E
5|$|A {{roundabout}} with {{a fountain}} was later {{built on the}} site of <b>the</b> <b>arch.</b> Some arches of the aqueduct were demolished in order to widen the road and make way for this roundabout.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> through <b>arch</b> bridge usually {{consists}} of two ribs, although there are examples like <b>the</b> Hulme <b>Arch</b> Bridge of through arches with a single rib. When <b>the</b> two <b>arches</b> are built in parallel planes, the structure is a parallel rib <b>arch</b> bridge. When <b>the</b> two <b>arch</b> ribs lean together and shorten the distance between <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> near <b>the</b> top, the span is a basket handle arch bridge.|$|R

50|$|The {{music hall}} {{was built in}} the {{substantial}} two-level space formed by two of <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> of <b>the</b> undercroft of the station, and opened in 1867 as <b>The</b> <b>Arches,</b> renamed <b>the</b> Hungerford Music Hall in 1883, and in 1887 became known variously as the Charing Cross Music Hall, Gatti's under <b>the</b> <b>Arches</b> and Gatti's Charing Cross Music Hall. By 1895, the hall boasted an attached grand cafe and billiard saloon.|$|R
5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> revealed three oil lamps of a type common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E
5|$|Four stone {{courses of}} the eastern spring of <b>the</b> <b>arch,</b> {{consisting}} of a row of impost blocks and three layers of voussoirs, have survived to modern times. This remnant was first identified in 1838 by Biblical scholar Edward Robinson and now bears his name. At that time, prior to any excavations, remains of <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> were at ground level. The ancient street level lay far underground, buried by debris from destruction of structures on the Temple Mount and later fill dumped into the Tyropoeon Valley over the centuries. Robinson believed he had identified {{the eastern edge of}} a bridge that linked the Temple Compound with the Upper City which lay on the ridge to the west.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 1943, a Royal Air Force {{breakdown}} lorry {{heading to the}} airfield at Ta' Qali at night with no street light hit <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> and severely damaged its Santa Venera-facing façade. The central arch was dismantled by military personnel {{under the supervision of}} the Public Works Department about two months later. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> was completely destroyed on 12 February 1944, when a Royal Army Service Corps truck hit the remaining parts of the structure. The stone remains were supposedly stored by the British but, similar to several other historic relics, they were never retrieved by the Maltese and the whereabouts are unknown. However, the arch's two marble plaques were repossessed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{horseshoe}} <b>arch</b> (Spanish: arco de herradura /ˈarko de eraˈduɾa/), {{also called}} <b>the</b> Moorish <b>arch</b> and <b>the</b> Keyhole <b>arch,</b> is <b>the</b> emblematic <b>arch</b> of Moorish architecture. Horseshoe arches can take rounded, pointed or lobed form.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>arches</b> can be {{reinforced}} using steel trusses. Some opponents {{believe that this}} degrades the appearance of <b>the</b> <b>arches,</b> that it makes them look like dental braces. Without this support, the building would be structurally unsound.|$|R
30|$|In <b>the</b> lower <b>arch,</b> <b>the</b> plan {{involved}} mesorotation {{of teeth}} 4.6 and 4.7 associated with mesial tipping. The plan also involved alignment of <b>the</b> <b>arches</b> and retroclination {{of the upper}} incisors.|$|R

5|$|Reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>arch</b> {{began on}} 1 August 2014, but work stopped soon {{afterwards}} after {{part of the}} original arch's foundations was found. Reconstruction continued in January 2015, and it was complete by the end of November 2015. Some finishing touches were made in February 2016, including the installation of two marble plaques. <b>The</b> <b>arch</b> was inaugurated on 28 April 2016 by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and mayor of Birkirkara Joanne Debono Grech.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arch</b> {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak with the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put <b>the</b> <b>Arch</b> that would look in keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E
