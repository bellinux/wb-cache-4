500|$|The Face magazine's witness {{wrote that}} [...] "The {{accusation}} {{that this is}} a tiresome Situationist gag with a whoopee cushion pay-off belittles the K Foundation's distracted message. They are not mocking any of the artists involved in the Turner or their work so much as the whole tired institution of awards themselves....

500|$|MacDonald {{cites the}} lyrics to the first bridge – [...] "But if I seem to act unkind / It's only me, it's not my mind / That is {{confusing}} things" [...] – {{as an example of}} Harrison applying an Eastern philosophical approach to difficulties in communication, by presenting them as [...] "contradictions between different levels of being". In Laing's interpretation, the entities [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] represent, respectively, [...] "individualistic, selfish ego" [...] and [...] "the Buddhist not-self, freed from the anxieties of historical Time". In I, Me, Mine, however, Harrison states that, with hindsight, the order of [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] should be reversed, since: [...] "The mind is the thing that hops about <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do this and do that – when what we need is to lose (forget) the mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The segment {{marked the}} first time the Disney studio created a film's main {{characters}} entirely from CGI; only backgrounds, secondary, or tertiary characters had been produced using CGI beforehand. Initially Butoy asked Pixar to handle the computer graphics, but CGI artist Steve Goldberg convinced him to let Disney's own team produce it. The backgrounds were completed by hand. Originally the drain sequence included friendly rats who performed comical gags, but the team found it did not fit the mood {{of the rest of the}} segment. The drains became a more scary environment, something that Butoy said was [...] "what the music was <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do". Rain animation from Bambi (1942) was scanned into the CAPS system and digitally altered to fit into the segment. The ending was to feature the original ending with the soldier and ballerina melting in the fire, but the music was too upbeat to animate it and was changed. An excerpt of the segment was shown at the 1998 SIGGRAPH conference.|$|E

500|$|In November 2013, Feige {{said that}} [...] "in an ideal world" [...] {{releases}} each year would include one film {{based on an}} existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's [...] "a nice rhythm" [...] in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is [...] "certainly something to aim for." [...] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, [...] "I don't know that we'll keep to [...] every year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, [...] "so I {{think it would be}} fun to continue that sort of thing." [...] In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the [...] "rhythm" [...] that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like [...] "a big event or crossover series," [...] with Avengers films acting as [...] "big, giant linchpins." [...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I think if you look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E

6000|$|Expecting to see {{us again}} {{before we went to}} Taloo, the {{planters}} wished us a pleasant journey; and, on parting, very generously presented us with a pound or two of what sailors call [...] "plug" [...] tobacco; <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> cut it up into small change; the Virginian weed being the principal circulating medium on the island.|$|E
6000|$|We did so, marking its {{position}} {{by means of}} chalk. It was nearly three feet from the utmost extension of the psychic's hands, and yet, almost immediately, tapping came upon the cone keeping time to our singing.

60|$|We adored Aunt Olivia; she {{was pretty}} and merry and kind; and, above all, she had {{mastered}} to perfection the rare art of letting children alone. If we kept ourselves tolerably clean, and refrained from quarrelling or talking slang, Aunt Olivia did not worry us. Aunt Janet, on the contrary, gave us so much good advice and was so constantly <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do this or not to do the other thing, {{that we could not}} remember half her instructions, and did not try.|$|E

60|$|But Uncle Blair {{could do}} at least one thing surpassingly well. He could write letters. Such letters! By contrast, Felix and I were {{secretly}} ashamed of father's epistles. Father could talk well but, as Felix said, he couldn't write worth a cent. The letters we had received from him since his arrival in Rio de Janeiro were mere scrawls, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be good boys and not trouble Aunt Janet, incidentally adding that he was well and lonesome. Felix and I were always glad to get his letters, but we never read them aloud to an admiring circle in the orchard.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have made}} a mistake, I fear," [...] she said, with a dignity which I {{appreciated}} even in my panic, [...] "and we are very sorry for it. We were invited to spend Christmas with Mr. and Mrs. Norman Young. When we got off the train we were given a letter from them stating that they were summoned away but <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go to their house and make ourselves at home. The stationmaster told us {{that this was the}} house, so we came here. We have never been in Monkshead, so we did not know the difference. Please pardon us." ...|$|E
60|$|And it {{does not}} mean that. I suppose, that three hundred years ago (when the Bible was {{translated}} out of the Greek tongue, in which the Apostles wrote, into English), 'taking thought' meant something different from what it does now: but the plain meaning of the text, if it be put into such English as we talk now, is, 'Do not fret about the morrow. Be not anxious about the morrow.' There is no doubt at all, as any scholar can tell you, that that is the plain meaning of the word in our modern English, and that our Lord is not <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> be imprudent or idle, but not to be anxious and fretful about the morrow.|$|E

6000|$|... "Titus had {{received}} a message from Vespasian that he wished to see him," [...] the officer signified by the general said, [...] "and rode off at once, <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> follow him. We armed and mounted, {{as soon as we}} could; but Titus was well mounted, and had a considerable start. We came up to him in a valley. He was standing by the side of his dead horse. He was slightly wounded, and his dirtied armour showed that he had had a sharp fight. Close by lay a Jew, who seemed to be dead. Titus ordered him to be carried back to the camp, and cared for by his own leech. That is all I know about it." ...|$|E
60|$|These speculations were rife among us; yet not {{the less}} we {{proceeded}} {{in our daily}} occupations, and our plans, whose accomplishment demanded the lapse of many years. No voice was heard <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> hold! When foreign distresses came to be felt by us through the channels of commerce, we set ourselves to apply remedies. Subscriptions were made for the emigrants, and merchants bankrupt {{by the failure of}} trade. The English spirit awoke to its full activity, and, as it had ever done, set itself to resist the evil, and to stand in the breach which diseased nature had suffered chaos and death to make in the bounds and banks which had hitherto kept them out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything may recover," [...] he admitted. [...] "But also nothing may recover. All {{this life}} of ours which has seemed so settled and secure--isn't secure. I {{have felt that}} we were fixed here and rooted--for all our lives. Suppose {{presently}} things sweep us out of it? It's a possibility {{we may have to}} face. I feel this morning as if two enormous gates had opened in our lives, like the gates that give upon an arena, gates giving on a darkness--through which anything might come. Even death. Suppose suddenly we were to see one of those great Zeppelins in the air, or hear the thunder of guns away towards the coast. And if a messenger came upon a bicycle <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> leave everything and go inland...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because the Lord <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> {{overcome}} evil with good," [...] answered Ravonino, quietly. Then, {{wishing to}} draw attention from the subject, he inquired for the messenger who had brought news of his own escape.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, the Dean {{is a kind}} old chap,' {{answered}} Lance, off-hand; 'whenever he has <b>us</b> <b>to</b> sing at a party, he tips us all round, thanks <b>us,</b> and <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> enjoy {{ourselves in}} the supper-room, like a gentleman, as he is.' ...|$|R
