5|$|For {{many years}} there was {{confusion}} between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia).

Thus it was easy <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> B.verticillata as falling {{within the range of}} variation of this broadly defined species.

During this period, Australian minesweepers and frigates patrolled Malaysia's coastline to counter Indonesian infiltration parties travelling in small craft.

Super Mario 3D Land also utilizes optional use of the 3DS gyroscope, {{which can be used}} to control cannons and binoculars. The game also features StreetPass functionality, allowing players to exchange Mystery Boxes containing bonus items. StreetPass also gives players another Toad house so they can get items.|$|E

Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.|$|E
5|$|The glyphs {{are divided}} into three categories: in{{dependent}}, compound, and dependent (glyphs that only appear in combination with others). He sees other groupings as being arbitrary, as well as detrimental to the proper understanding of rongorongo. Contrary to other scholars who do not place importance on compound glyphs, Dietrich sees compounding as a major aspect of the system. In fact, Dietrich describes rongorongo as a network in which the characters are interwoven together through various combinations. He speculates {{that it was his}} background in graphic design that allowed him <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> this pattern, while other researchers relied too heavily on linguistics and epigraphy.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E

5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After four to six months, it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies <b>to</b> <b>perceive</b> polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E

40|$|A {{qualitative}} approach was adopted to explore parents’ {{perceptions of the}} group component of a group parenting programme, delivered by an educational psychology service in Wales. Semi-structured interviews and questionnaires were utilised in order to gather the views of seven parents who attended a group parenting programme. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were employed to explore the perceptions of twenty parents who chose not to attend the parenting programme, related <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> facilitators <b>to,</b> and barriers of, attending. Thematic analysis identified key themes related to {{the perceptions of the}} group component and <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> changes in relation to the group component. Themes were also identified related <b>to</b> the <b>perceived</b> facilitators of, and barriers to, attending a group parenting programme. Overall findings suggested that the group was perceived positively by attending parents. Findings indicated an interrelationship between group and individual factors in relation <b>to</b> <b>perceived</b> change. <b>Perceived</b> facilitators <b>to,</b> and barriers of, attendance at a parenting programme related to practical, programme and personal factors, and, factors related to proficiency of English language. Tentative suggestions are made regarding how the group component contributed <b>to</b> parents’ <b>perceived</b> changes and how EPs might apply further knowledge of psychology working within group parenting programmes...|$|R
