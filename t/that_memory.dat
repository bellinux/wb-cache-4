5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors. This {{could be achieved}} by writing an allocator that allocates extra memory in which it places debugging information.

5|$|Throughout the poems, the end {{becomes the}} {{beginning}} and things constantly repeat. This use of circular time {{is similar to the}} way Dante uses time in his Divine Comedy – Little Gidding ends with a rose garden image that {{is the same as the}} garden beginning Burnt Norton. The repetition of time affects memory and how one can travel through their own past to find permanency and the divine. Memory within the poem is similar to how St. Augustine discussed it, in <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> allows one to understand words and life. The only way to discover eternity is through memory, understanding the past, and transcending beyond time. Likewise, in the Augustinian view that Eliot shares, timeless words are connected to Christ as the Logos and how Christ calls upon mankind to join him in salvation.|$|E
5|$|Adventure {{was named}} after Colossal Cave Adventure. Robinett began {{designing}} the graphics-based game, loosely based on the text game, on a Hewlett-Packard 1611A microprocessor computer around May to June 1978. Robinett was aware early on <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> use {{was going to be}} critical: Atari 2600 cartridges had room for only 4096 bytes (4 KB) on the cartridge ROM, and 128 bytes for program variables in the 2600's RAM; in contrast, Colossal Cave Adventure took hundreds of kilobytes of memory. The final game used nearly all of the available memory (including 5% of the cartridge storage for Robinett's Easter egg), with 15 unused bytes from the ROM capacity. Robinett credits Ken Thompson, his professor at University of California Berkeley, with teaching him the skills needed to use the limited memory efficiently. Thompson had required his students to learn the C programming language; Robinett carried techniques from that language into his programming of Adventure.|$|E

5|$|Mitchell {{turned himself}} in to {{authorities}} on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges. He was arraigned on March 22 on the charges, and a warrant for his arrest in Indiana for failure to pay child support led to his incarceration in Orange County, Florida. In May 2012, Mitchell {{filed a lawsuit against}} a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false tax claim with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he suffers from headaches, insomnia, and memory loss. <b>That</b> <b>memory</b> loss was cited as a possible reason for his failing to pay child support in that case as well. His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to community service and probation. On October 29, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison. He began his sentence on December 6.|$|E
5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one that is truly able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

25|$|Among current {{educational}} psychologists, {{the cognitive}} perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, {{perhaps because it}} admits causally related mental constructs such as traits, beliefs, memories, motivations and emotions. Cognitive theories claim <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> structures determine how information is perceived, processed, stored, retrieved and forgotten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by Allan Paivio's dual coding theory. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and cognitive load theory to explain how people learn from multimedia presentations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} types of memory {{have been identified in}} humans, such as declarative memory (including episodic memory and semantic memory), working memory, spatial memory, and procedural memory. Studies done, have found <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> functions, more specifically those associated with the medial temporal lobe are especially vulnerable to age-related decline. A number of studies utilizing a variety of methods such as histological, structural imaging, functional imaging, and receptor binding have supplied converging evidence that the frontal lobes and frontal-striatal dopaminergic pathways are especially affected by age-related processes resulting in memory changes.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{ground-breaking}} work of Brenda Milner, Suzanne Corkin {{and others}} studying the amnesiac patient Henry Molaison, researchers had assumed <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> was an emergent {{property of the}} cerebral cortex or brain as a whole.

In particular, the medial temporal lobe was involved in the creation of new memories and their consolidation, but not their storage.|$|E

25|$|Brain {{damage is}} {{another factor that}} {{has been found to}} have an effect on visual memory. Memory {{impairment}} affects both novel and familiar experiences. Poor memory after damage to the brain is usually considered to result from information being lost or rendered inaccessible.

In experiments testing rats’ object recognition memory it was found <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> impairment can be the opposite, that there was a tendency to treat novel experiences as familiar. A possible solution for this impairment could be the use of a visual-restriction procedure that reduces interference.|$|E
25|$|Overall, studies {{indicate}} {{that there is an}} ability for fetal learning and memory, and through classical conditioning, habituation and exposure learning <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> can be measured. It {{is important to note that}} certain periods in fetal development allow for different learning and memory abilities, which should be taken into consideration when determining if fetal memory exists. Auditory stimuli presented in the womb can be retained and recognized (learned) into the days following birth and that learning is specific to familiar auditory stimuli. Measuring learning and memory in the fetus has only been discussed in terms of healthy pregnancies; however, many factors such as disease affect these delicate processes.|$|E
25|$|The first semi-multiple-systematic {{study of}} the {{connection}} between sleep and memory was conducted in 1924 by Jenkins and Dallenbach, for the purpose of testing Hermann Ebbinghaus' memory decay theory. Their results showed <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> retention was much better after a period of sleep compared to the same time interval spent awake. It was not until 1953, however, when sleep was delineated into rapid eye movement sleep and non-rapid eye movement sleep, that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted. As behavioral characteristics of the effects of sleep and memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis of sleep and memory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In humans, hippocampal damage {{typically}} produces temporally graded retrograde amnesia, {{with relative}} sparing of remote memories compared to recent memories. This observation {{led to the}} idea <b>that</b> as <b>memories</b> age, they are reorganized in a time-dependent manner. Here, we evaluate evidence for time-dependent memory reorganization in animal models. We conclude that, although hippocampal lesions may not always produce temporal gradients under all conditions, studies using alternate experimental approaches consistently support the idea <b>that</b> <b>memories</b> reorganize over time—becoming less dependent on the hippocampus and more dependent on a cortical network. We further speculate on the processes <b>that</b> drive <b>memory</b> reorganization such as sleep, memory reactivation, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis...|$|R
50|$|Some studies {{indicate}} <b>that</b> flashbulb <b>memories</b> are not {{more accurate than}} other types of memories. It has been reported <b>that</b> <b>memories</b> of high school graduation or early emotional experiences {{can be just as}} vivid and clear as flashbulb memories. Undergraduates recorded their three most vivid autobiographical memories. Nearly all of the memories produced were rated to be of high personal importance, but low national importance. These memories were rated as having the same level of consequentiality and surprise as memories for events of high national importance. This indicates <b>that</b> flashbulb <b>memories</b> may just be a subset of vivid memories and {{may be the result of}} a more general phenomenon.|$|R
25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes <b>that</b> <b>memory</b> in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E
25|$|Cy Twombly's {{work can}} be {{understood}} as one vast engagement with cultural memory. His paintings, drawings and sculptures on mythological subjects have come to form a significant part of <b>that</b> <b>memory.</b> Usually drawing on the most familiar gods and heroes, he restricts himself to just a few, relatively well-known episodes, as narrated by poet-historians, given visible shape by artists and repeatedly reinterpreted in the literature and visual art of later centuries.....His special medium is writing. Starting out from purely graphic marks, he developed a kind of meta-script in which abbreviated signs, hatchings, loops, numbers and the simplest of pictographs spread throughout the picture plane in a process of incessant movement, repeatedly subverted by erasures. Eventually, this metamorphosed into script itself.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the issues}} found with the distractor {{inhibition}} model, Tipper and Houghton modified the distractor inhibition model to account for long-term negative priming effects. The original inhibition account proposed that inhibition occurs only when the distractors are suppressed. The Houghton–Tipper model revised this proposition and claims that inhibition occurs during both the encoding of distractors and the retrieval of <b>that</b> <b>memory.</b> The main reason for this change is to explain the long-term negative priming and justify it using the new combined model. When a repeated distractor becomes the target, processing of this stimulus automatically retrieves {{the memory of the}} stimulus being inhibited as a distractor. This model suggests that inhibition occurs when ignoring the distractor and during the memory retrieval of the previous ignorance of the stimulus. Therefore, it incorporates the inhibition account in selective attention and the episode retrieval model.|$|E
