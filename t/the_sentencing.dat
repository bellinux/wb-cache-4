40|$|This {{research}} is a descriptive study on linguistics {{which focuses on}} the question words in Amanatun dialect of Meto language. The purposes of this research are to identify the kinds of question words and to describe how those question words are constructed. The descriptive qualitative method {{was used in this}} research. The native speakers of Amanatun dialect as the subject of the research. The instrument used was translation sentences of question words from Indonesia into Amanatun dialect. There were five techniques of data analysis: translation, codification,classification, syntactical analyses, and discussion. The findings show that there are seven kinds of question words in Amanatun dialect. They are sa(what), sekau(who), etme/esme/mbime/neome(where), leka(when), nansa/neusa(why), onme(how) and fauk (how many and how much). Saisplaced at the initial position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Sekau is placed in three positions; in initial part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> in <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and at <b>the</b> final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> <b>The</b> question of etme/esme/mbime/neome is placed at the final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Leka is placed in two positions: in the initial part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and at <b>the</b> final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> <b>The</b> question of nansa is placed at the final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Nansa cannot be placed at the final position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> While neosa is only placed at the final position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and it cannot be placed in initial position of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> There are three positions of onme; in the initial of <b>the</b> <b>sentence,</b> in <b>the</b> middle of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> and <b>the</b> final of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> Fauk is placed at the final part of <b>the</b> <b>sentence...</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{reading a}} sentence, readers will analyze {{the words and}} phrases they see and make inferences about <b>the</b> <b>sentence’s</b> {{grammatical}} structure and meaning in a process called parsing. Generally, readers will parse <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> chunks {{at a time and}} will try to interpret the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> at each interval. As readers are given more information they make an assumption of the contents and meaning of <b>the</b> whole <b>sentence.</b> With each new portion of <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> encountered, they will try to make that part make sense with <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> structures that they have already interpreted and their assumption about the rest of <b>the</b> <b>sentence.</b> <b>The</b> garden path <b>sentence</b> effect occurs when <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> has a phrase or word with an ambiguous meaning that the reader interprets in a certain way, and when they read <b>the</b> whole <b>sentence</b> there is a difference in what has been read and what was expected. The reader must then read and evaluate <b>the</b> <b>sentence</b> again to understand its meaning. <b>The</b> <b>sentence</b> may be parsed and interpreted in different ways due to the influence of pragmatics, semantics, or other factors describing the extralinguistic context.|$|R

Eberhardt befriends an Arab prisoner named Sayed, who is later executed. Slimene reveals that Comte executed Sayed {{in the hopes}} of provoking a war. Eberhardt writes to Barracund telling him everything; her story is printed as front page news. Shortly thereafter Eberhardt is viciously attacked and wounded by an Arab swordsman. Eberhardt believes that Comte is responsible for the attack. At the conclusion of <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> of her attacker to life imprisonment, the French authorities deport Eberhardt.

5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in <b>the</b> <b>sentencing.</b> For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E

In mid-November, Ranariddh returned to Cambodia, announced the formation of the Norodom Ranariddh Party (NRP) and became its president. The following month, the National Assembly expelled Ranariddh as an MP. Within days his wife, Eng Marie, sued him for adultery. Ranariddh's half-brother Chakrapong was also expelled from the party, and joined the NRP as the party's deputy president.

5|$|When {{he became}} president, {{he sent a}} bill to the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the crimes committed by the military, {{which led to the}} Trial of the Juntas and resulted in <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> of the heads of the former regime. Discontent within the military led to the mutinies of the Carapintadas, leading Alfonsín to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing Justicialist Party. He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the Contadora support group to mediate between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. He passed the first divorce law of Argentina. He initiated the Austral plan to improve the national economy, but that plan, as well as the Spring plan, failed. The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party's defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had not engaged in any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E
5|$|Within Dorchester parish {{there are}} 293 {{structures}} that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including five that are listed Grade I and sixteen that are Grade II*. The Grade I structures are the Church of St George on Fordington High Street, the Church of St Peter on High West Street, Max Gate on Syward Road, the Roman town house on Northernhay, and Shire Hall on High West Street. The Church of St George has a late-11th-century south door {{that has a}} Caen stone tympanum with a realistic carved representation of St George surrounded by soldiers, said to depict the miracle of his appearance at the Battle of Antioch. The south aisle and the north part of the porch date from the 12th century. The Church of St Peter mostly dates from 1420–21, with a 12th-century south doorway reset into it. There are many notable monuments, including two 14th-century effigies and a 14th-century tomb chest. Thomas Hardy contributed to {{the addition of the}} vestry and chancel in 1856-7. Max Gate was designed by Thomas Hardy in the Queen Anne style, and was his home until his death in 1928. It was built in 1885. The remains of the Roman house north of county hall date from the early 4th century, with later 4th-century enlargements. It has a hypocaust heating system and mosaic pavements. It is the only visible Roman town house in Britain. The current Shire Hall building was designed by Thomas Hardwick and built in Portland stone ashlar in 1797. It replaced a previous structure that had fallen into disrepair. A tablet commemorates <b>the</b> <b>sentencing</b> of the Tolpuddle Martyrs here in 1834. The building housed the Crown Court until 1955; Thomas Hardy was a magistrate here and his experience provided inspiration for his writing. The building has changed little since the 19th century, and in 2014 planning permission was granted to transform it into a heritage centre and tourist attraction, to open in 2017.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{readability}} of Japanese sentences. Experiment I was conducted in order to test the effect of the percentage of Chinese charcters and the presentation of the theme in <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> on <b>the</b> subjects' reading time. The subjects were 60 college students. On the basis of the percentage of Chinese characters in <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> and <b>the</b> presentation of the theme of <b>the</b> <b>sentences,</b> they were randomly assigned to one of the following six groups : High-theme, High-no theme, Middle-no theme, Non-theme, Non-no theme. They were asked to read <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> shown by a slide projector on a paper and the time to read <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> was recorded. For the subjects of the 'theme' groups the theme was told before they started reading <b>the</b> <b>sentences.</b> <b>The</b> reading time in the High groups was significantly shorter than that in the 'Non'groups. This suggests that the words written in Chinese characters in <b>the</b> <b>sentences</b> have facilitating effect on the readability of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>sentences.</b> No significant difference was observed between the 'theme' groups and the 'no theme' groups.
