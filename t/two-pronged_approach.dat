25|$|Syncaris pacifica is a ten-legged {{crustacean}} {{that employs}} a <b>two-pronged</b> <b>approach</b> to camouflage: {{it uses a}} technique of translucency coupled with strategically placed chromatophores, which occur internally {{as well as on}} the surface. As a result, the clustered color-producing cells combined with translucency masks the body outline and blends the organism to its subsurface environment. Consequently, an illusion is presented that S. pacifica are submerged, decaying vegetation. California freshwater shrimp move quite torpidly and are practically invisible among water column leaf and twig substrates, and among the slender, exposed, living roots of riparian vegetation along undercut stream banks.|$|E
25|$|The British Government {{developed}} a <b>two-pronged</b> <b>approach</b> to the decolonisation of dependent territories that were then {{still part of}} the British Empire. It encouraged the development of self-government {{with the aim of}} granting independence to any territory that wanted it. For those territories that wished to continue an association with the United Kingdom it would work with the democratically elected representatives to define arrangements that would permit it. In the opinion of the British Government, the position with regard to Gibraltar was complicated by provisions in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht that required the British to offer the territory to the Spanish crown if Britain were to relinquish it, which limited the options for independence. The Government of Gibraltar does not share this opinion but so far has opted to retain the link with the United Kingdom.|$|E

First, the tenet that a court must accept as true {{all of the}} allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions. ... Second, only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.

In keeping with these principles a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they {{are no more than}} conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.

40|$|This study {{sets out}} to explore the {{internal}} career orientations and the external career patterns of information technology (IT) workers in Nigeria. The theoretical framework guiding this research is that societal context (social structure and institutions) {{has an influence on}} the career orientations and career patterns exhibited by individuals (Derr and Laurent, 1989; Lam, 2000; Baruch, 2004). To date, understanding the development of mainstream career theory has focused more on individual choice and life-span development, than on the complex interplay between individuals and their environment. There appears to be a relative neglect of the influence of institutional and social structure in much of the career literature.

30|$|Technology {{assessment}} (TA) {{is defined}} as problem-oriented transdisciplinary research that aims at working out solutions for societal problems. It provides advice to those in politics, science and wider society on issues related to research, technology and innovation.

40|$|Support {{of urban}} {{agriculture}} {{can be used}} as a route to reducing urban poverty across Sub-Saharan Africa. However policy makers require more precise information on how it contributes to alleviating food insecurity and poverty problems. This study in Malawi's two main cities (Lilongwe and Blantyre) revealed two predominant ‘types’ of urban farmers: (i) low‐income, less educated, often female‐headed households, who use urban agriculture as an insurance against income losses and who can employ skilled workers to support their livestock activities; and (ii) middle‐ and high‐income, often male‐headed households, that undertake urban agriculture for personal consumption and hire significant numbers of unskilled workers. Within the low‐income group, there are some female headed‐households who are now receiving significant income from livestock programmes having been provided with initial external support from a non‐governmental organisation. Our findings suggest a need for a <b>two‐pronged</b> policy <b>approach</b> to try and improve the overall effectiveness of urban agriculture support, namely to (1) target poor women with extension and development project support; and (2) support wealthier farmers to increase the employment opportunities associated with urban agriculture.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the resistance of}} receptive language impairment (RLI) to intervention. This is especially evident where interventions aim to treat oral comprehension deficits in children in the younger school age population. Current theories of oral comprehension impairments centre on deficits in underlying linguistic knowledge and/or deficits of specific or general processing. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the nature of oral comprehension deficits in 1 child with RLI (6 : 6, female) and to tailor an intervention package to treat those specific deficits. Methodology: A <b>two-pronged</b> treatment <b>approach</b> was used, that combined both metalinguistic interventions such as Shape Coding and metacognitive interventions such as Rehearsal strategies. The child was also taught to use Comprehension Monitoring strategies. A single case study design was employed, which compared treated and untreated targets pre/post therapy; with MLU scores pre/post therapy compared as a further control measure. Results: While outcome measures showed considerable improvement in the comprehension of treated targets within sessions, statistical analysis of pre/post-therapy assessment results did not yield statistically significant results. MLU and untreated controls remained unchanged. Qualitative data showed successful use of comprehension monitoring and rehearsal strategies within sessions, but these strategies were not observed to have generalized in situations outside of therapy. Conclusion: Although findings were not statistically significant, it was clear that gains were made on treated targets and strategies within sessions. A more in-depth study is required to understand why these gains did not generalize post therapy...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is an important}} mediator of cancer metastasis and invasion, {{which is responsible for}} 90 % of cancer-related premature deaths in Canada. Synthetic triterpenoids are a class of promising anti-cancer compounds that have shown considerable efficacy in targeting various cellular functions including apoptosis, growth, inflammation and cytoprotection in both cell culture and animal tumor models. However, their effect on cell migration, an important event in metastasis, remains poorly understood. This thesis focuses on deciphering the molecular mechanisms whereby the synthetic triterpenoids affect cell migration. I observed that the imidazolide and methyl ester derivatives of the synthetic triterpenoid, 2 -cyano- 3, 12 -dioxooleana- 1, 9 -dien- 28 -oic aic acid (CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me), inhibit cell migration by disrupting microtubule dynamics. In addition, I found that these triterpenoids disrupt cell polarity by displacing proteins at the leading edge of migrating cells. Furthermore, using a <b>two-pronged</b> proteomic <b>approach</b> involving protein arrays and mass spectrometry, I identified numerous triterpenoid-binding targets involved in actin polymerization and focal adhesion maintenance. My data further revealed that triterpenoids inhibit branched actin polymerization by targeting Arp 3 in the Arp 2 / 3 complex and target GSK 3 b activity to alter focal adhesion sizes. Collectively, my studies provided novel insights on the underlying molecular mechanisms by which triterpenoids act to affect cell migration. This knowledge will be important for developing a more efficacious and specific therapeutic triterpenoid compound that targets cancer metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Stimulation of the {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} KIT by Stem Cell Factor (SCF) triggers activation of RAS and its downstream effectors. Proper KIT activation {{is essential for the}} maturation, proliferation and survival of mast cells. In addition, SCF activation of KIT is critical for recruiting mast cells to sites of infection or injury, where they release a mix of pro-inflammatory substances. RIN 3, a RAS effector and RAB 5 -directed guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), is highly expressed and enriched in human mast cells. SCF treatment of mast cells increased the amount of GTP-bound RAB 5, and the degree of RAB 5 activation correlated with the expression level of RIN 3. SCF treatment also caused the dissociation of a pre-formed complex of RIN 3 with BIN 2, a membrane bending protein. Silencing of RIN 3 increased the rate of SCF-induced KIT internalization, while persistent RIN 3 over-expression led to KIT downregulation. These observations strongly support a role for RIN 3 in coordinating the early steps in KIT endocytosis. Importantly, RIN 3 also functions as an inhibitor of mast cell migration toward SCF. Finally, we demonstrate that elevated RIN 3 levels sensitize mastocytosis cells to treatment with a KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting the value of a <b>two-pronged</b> inhibitor <b>approach</b> for this difficult to treat malignancy. These findings directly connect KIT activation with a mast cell-specific RAS effector that regulates the cellular response to SCF and provide new insight for the development of more effective mastocytosis treatments...|$|R

Although, Directive 95 / 46 include a special purposes provision for processing ‘carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purposes of artistic or literary expression’, its limited scope fails to provide for a general reconciliation of values in this area. As vividly highlighted by the recent Google Spain decision, these problems were only partially resolved in the Satamedia judgment. Proposed amendments to require Member States to effect a reconciliation between data protection and freedom of expression itself run the theoretical risk of expanding {{the scope of this}} highly discretionary clause into one of universal application. However, as this would clearly conflict with the core harmonizing aim of reform, it would almost certainly be interpreted much more restrictively, thereby fuelling existing confusions.
