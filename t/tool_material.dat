25|$|Machinability can be {{difficult}} to predict because machining has so many variables. Two sets of factors are the condition of work materials and the physical properties of work materials. The condition of the work material includes eight factors: microstructure, grain size, heat treatment, chemical composition, fabrication, hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength. Physical properties are those of the individual material groups, such as the modulus of elasticity, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and work hardening. Other important factors are operating conditions, cutting <b>tool</b> <b>material</b> and geometry, and the machining process parameters.|$|E
25|$|Machinability can {{be based}} on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting <b>tool</b> <b>material,</b> cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Development {{of a new}} {{generation}} <b>tool</b> <b>materials</b> on the basis of M 2 high speed-steel reinforced with the mixture of carbides and with their structure and mechanical properties, fill the gap in <b>tool</b> <b>materials</b> between the high-speed steels and cemented carbides. Design/methodology/approach: Powder metallurgy, powder injection moulding, sintering, sinter hardening, heat treatment, microstructure and porosity examination, X-ray analysis, TEM, bending test, hardness test. Findings: Powder injection moulding processes were used to fabricate the proposed carbide alloyed composite materials. The addition of hard particles increase hardness after heat treatment and slightly reduces the ductility of these materials. Compared with M 2 high-speed steel the bending strength of carbide alloyed composite decrease. The main advantage of the presented experimental <b>tool</b> <b>materials</b> is application of powder injection moulding to produce <b>tool</b> <b>materials</b> in a mass scale with relative low cost of production.
