5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each lifeline can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game.

In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, CBS {{tried to}} revive <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> Our World with a {{television}} pilot called Try to Remember. Anchored by veteran newscaster Charles Kuralt, Try to Remember covered August 11–17, 1969, echoing Our Worlds pilot {{coverage of the}} summer of 1969. The show aired on Thursday, June 23. Try to Remember did not get picked up as a regular series.|$|E

Full Circle, State of Decay, and Warriors' Gate trace the Doctor's adventures in E-Space; they were released in both VHS and DVD boxsets with the umbrella title The E-Space Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> {{this wave}} of pirate radio was {{influenced}} by Radio Luxembourg and American radio stations. Many followed a top 40 format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the antithesis of BBC radio at the time. Spurred on by the offshore stations, landbased pirate stations took to the air on medium wave at weekends, such as Radio Free London in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the match led to debates about <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> {{qualification}} tournaments, with the Australian manager Frank Farina and Thompson feeling that preliminary rounds should be introduced to avoid such unbalanced matches, views shared by the international footballing body FIFA. It {{eventually led to the}} introduction of a preliminary round in the Oceanian zone qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The unbalanced level of opponents also partly contributed to Australia's move to the Asian Football Confederation in 2006.|$|E

It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied.|$|E

5|$|A {{television}} series called The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries ran from 1977 to 1979 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). It initially starred 24-year-old Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy. For the first season, episodes featuring Nancy alternated with episodes featuring the Hardy Boys. The stories were new stories {{based on the}} original stories, with Nancy solving mysteries with her friends George and Ned. Beginning in the second season, <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> the series changed {{to focus more on}} the Hardy Boys, with Nancy Drew primarily appearing as a guest star in several crossover story lines; Martin left the series midway through the second season and was replaced by 19-year-old Janet Louise Johnson for the final few episodes. The series continued for a third season as The Hardy Boys Mysteries, dropping Nancy Drew completely, but the series was eventually cancelled midway through the season.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the bands}} that {{regularly}} played the university, including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, they were particularly impressed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and recruited an organist, Nick Pearne, to match <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> Arthur Brown's band. Along with two female dancers, the initial line-up was Hammill on guitar and vocals, Smith on drums, wind instruments and vocals, and Pearne on organ (though {{he did not}} initially have an instrument). According to Smith, the band initially played as a two-piece, with Smith occasionally using a typewriter as a percussion instrument; their first gig as a three-piece was in the student union, which lasted five minutes before the group's amplifiers blew up.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> Inside No. 9 {{requires}} new characters each week, {{the writers}} {{were able to}} attract actors {{who may have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, who played lead actor Tony and understudy Jim respectively, the episode starred Lyndsey Marshal as Laura, Julia Davis as Felicity, Rosie Cavaliero as Kirstie, Roger Sloman as Bill, Di Botcher as Jean, and Richard Cordery as Nick. In addition, Bruce Mackinnon provided the voice of an actor playing Malcolm in Macbeth, and Jo Stone-Fewings provided the voice of an actor playing Macduff.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, the team which has the most points is awarded the title of regular season champion. The league in the past {{generally}} takes a several week break between the regular season and postseason. As with the regular season, <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> the playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled {{the end of the}} regular season and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from the regular season will receive a home-ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink.|$|E

The club ceased to exist in 1939, when they merged with fellow amateur team Casuals to form the Corinthian-Casuals, which still plays today. <b>The</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> the FA Charity Shield changed several further times over the following decades, and in 1974 it was moved to August to become the opening match of each year's Football League season, and played between {{the winner of the}} FA Cup and the most senior league, now the Premier League.|$|E
