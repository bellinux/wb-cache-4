5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (the memory pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer <b>to</b> <b>memory</b> from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of the memory pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|Commit This <b>to</b> <b>Memory</b> is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Motion City Soundtrack. Produced by Mark Hoppus, the album was {{released}} on June 7, 2005, in the United States by Epitaph Records. Motion City Soundtrack, formed in 1997, had first found success with their debut album, I Am the Movie (2002). The band toured in the interim years, creating positive word-of-mouth. In 2004, the band joined Blink-182 {{on the road for}} a string of shows, which led to their bassist, Mark Hoppus, joining the band in the studio for his first producing effort.|$|E

5|$|In May 2008, it was {{revealed}} that a Debian developer discovered that the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack, since only 32,767 different keys were generated. The security weakness was caused by changes made in 2006 by another Debian developer in response <b>to</b> <b>memory</b> debugger warnings. The complete resolution procedure was cumbersome because patching the security hole was not enough; it involved regenerating all affected keys and certificates.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{over six}} weeks in late 2004, Commit This <b>to</b> <b>Memory</b> was created largely at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a {{suburban}} home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} frontman Justin Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. He hoped for his lyricism to better emphasize storytelling, inspired by the lyrics of Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson. Hoppus mainly worked with the band on completing song arrangements.|$|E
5|$|The EC, {{is located}} in the parahippocampal gyrus, a {{cortical}} region adjacent to the hippocampus. This gyrus conceals the hippocampus. The parahippocampal gyrus also includes the perirhinal cortex which {{plays an important role in}} the visual recognition of complex objects. There is also substantial evidence that it makes a contribution <b>to</b> <b>memory,</b> which can be distinguished from the contribution of the hippocampus. It is apparent that complete amnesia occurs only when both the hippocampus and the parahippocampus are damaged.|$|E

The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

5|$|The band joined Blink-182 for a European trek {{in early}} 2004, at the {{recommendation}} of Blink-182's bassist Mark Hoppus. Cain invited Hoppus to produce the band's sophomore album, and he accepted. In late 2004, the band continued touring internationally with Blink-182, this time in Japan. The group accumulated significant buzz, and were regarded as a must-see act on the Warped Tour 2004. The band recorded their second album, Commit This <b>to</b> <b>Memory</b> at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a suburban home converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Commit This <b>to</b> <b>Memory</b> was the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. For this album, the band also had more time and funds create the album. During the recording of the album, the band embarked on their first headlining tour, The Sub-Par Punk Who Cares Tour 2004. By the end of 2004, the band played in over 270 shows that year.|$|E

The band signed to Epitaph in 2003, which {{released}} the band's debut album, I Am the Movie. Their breakthrough album, Commit This <b>to</b> <b>Memory,</b> arrived in 2005, and their third record, Even If It Kills Me (2007), also achieved commercial success. The band briefly signed to major label Columbia for their fourth album, My Dinosaur Life (2010), and rejoined Epitaph for Go in 2012, after which Thaxton left the group {{and was replaced by}} Claudio Rivera. Their final album Panic Stations was released in 2015. In 2016, the band announced their split and the So Long, Farewell tour, for which Thaxton rejoined the band.|$|E
5|$|Thelephoric acid {{is present}} in several Hydnellum species. This compound, derived metabolically from the shikimic acid pathway, {{inhibits}} the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase, which is involved in deteriorating certain neuropeptides that are believed to contribute <b>to</b> <b>memory</b> and learning. Hydnellum caeruleum and H.concrescens have several para-terphenyl derivatives named thelephantins (specifically, variants thelephantins I–N), some of which can inhibit the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. The compounds hydnellins A and B are terphenyls found in H. suaveolens and Hydnellum geogerirum. The chemicals responsible for the fragrant anise-like aroma of H.suaveolens {{have been identified as}} coumarin and para-anisaldehyde.|$|E

There are also sight gags showing prototype equipment. In the field, however, Bond always remembers the details and takes full advantage of the tools supplied.|$|E

5|$|A {{similar story}} was {{published}} about Catherine Babington, first in her obituary, in Shelby, North Carolina, in 1886, {{then in a}} short book by her son outlining her masonic career. Hailed as the only female mason in the United States, {{she is said to}} have obtained the secrets at the age of 16 by hiding in her uncles' lodge room in Princess, Kentucky. Having lost her father at an early age, she spent much of her childhood at her grandfather's house, where she became a favourite of her uncles. They attended a lodge in an unused chapel above Catherine's school-room, which she often helped them clean. As a teenager, Catherine Sweet (Babington being her married name) attended lodge meetings for a year, hiding in the old pulpit, finally being discovered when one of her uncles returned unexpectedly for a rifle he had left in the ante-room. Being questioned by the lodge, it was discovered that she had committed much of the ritual <b>to</b> <b>memory,</b> and was, like Anderson, made a mason to swear her to secrecy, but in this instance not admitted to membership of the lodge. The sole source of the story is her son, and much of the detail remains unconfirmed. There is no account or recollection of such a lodge room in or around Princess.|$|E
