40|$|With {{advances}} in robotics, computational capabilities, and the fabrication {{of high quality}} glass slides coinciding with increased genomic information being available on public databases, microarray technology is increasingly being used in laboratories around the world. In fact, fields as varied as: toxicology, evolutionary biology, drug development and production, disease characterization, diagnostics development, cellular physiology and stress responses, and forensics have benefiting from its use. However, for many researchers not familiar with microarrays, current articles and reviews often address neither the fundamental principles behind the technology nor <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> experiments. Although, microarray technology is relatively simple, conceptually, its practice does require careful planning and detailed understanding of the limitations inherently present. Without these considerations, it can be exceedingly difficult to ascertain valuable information from microarray data. Therefore, this text aims to outline key features in microarray technology, paying particular attention to current applications as outlined in recent publications, experimental design, statistical methods, and potential uses. Furthermore, this review {{is not meant to}} be comprehensive, but rather substantive; highlighting important concepts and detailing steps necessary to conduct and interpret microarray experiments.

50|$|Most {{synchronous}} {{digital systems}} consist of cascaded banks of sequential registers with combinational logic between {{each set of}} registers. The functional requirements of the digital system are satisfied by the logic stages. Each logic stage introduces delay that affects timing performance, and the timing performance of the digital design can be evaluated relative to the timing requirements by a timing analysis. Often special consideration {{must be made to}} meet the timing requirements. For example, the global performance and local timing requirements may be satisfied bythe careful insertion of pipeline registers into equally spaced time windows to satisfy critical worst-case timing constraints. <b>The</b> <b>proper</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the clock distribution network helps ensure that critical timing requirements are satisfied and that no race conditions exist (see also clock skew).|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the gradual failure of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane {{as a result}} of long-term corrosion, four dynamic corrosion tests were conducted at different temperatures and durations. By combining tension and puncture tests, we systematically studied the variation law of tension and puncture properties of the HDPE geomembrane under different corrosion conditions. Results showed that tension and puncture failure of the HDPE geomembrane was progressive, and tensile strength in the longitudinal grain direction was evidently better than that in the transverse direction. Punctures appeared shortly after puncture force reached the puncture strength. The tensile strength of geomembrane was in inversely proportional to the corrosion time, and the impact of corrosion was more obvious in the longitudinal direction than transverse direction. As corrosion time increased, puncture strength decreased and corresponding deformation increased. As with corrosion time, the increase of corrosion temperature induced the decrease of geomembrane tensile strength. Tensile and puncture strength were extremely sensitive to temperature. Overall, residual strength had a negative correlation with corrosion time or temperature. Elongation variation increased initially and then decreased with the increase in temperature. However, it did not show significant law with corrosion time. The reduction in puncture strength and the increase in puncture deformation had positive correlations with corrosion time or temperature. The geomembrane softened under corrosion condition. The conclusion may be applicable to <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>designing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HDPE geomembrane in landfill barrier system...|$|R

Based {{on the results of}} experimental research already reported by us, criteria for <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>design</b> {{and operation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bio-toilet system were established. The establishment of operation criteria led to the formulation of an operation scheme where three main zones are distinguished: i) green zone, where the best composting performance is expected; ii) yellow zone, where biodegradation can be conducted but performance is not the most efficient; iii) other zones where operation of the bio-toilet is not recommended because odour problems and human health risks will develop, or in the worst case, biodegradation of faeces will not occur. In the design criteria, the surface area required for evaporating the water loads due to contributions of urine and faeces was determined by applying concepts of drying theory. This theory was also applied to estimate the mass and volume of dried sawdust required for dealing with the critical water loading. However, the accumulation of stabilised solids transpired to be more critical and, finally, mass and volume of dried sawdust were estimated based on this factor...|$|R
