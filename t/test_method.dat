40|$|Abstract. The civil {{engineering}} community asks for more non-destructive testing, quality control and sustainability of structures can be observed. For an economical use of non-destructive <b>testing</b> <b>methods,</b> technical information and {{knowledge about the}} capacity of existing <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> are necessary.

To ensure a better and efficient application of <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> under local conditions, performance demonstrations of non-destructive <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> have been accomplished. For this purpose, a special specimen (“LCS”) was concreted at BAM, to carry out performance <b>tests</b> of echo <b>methods.</b> The thickness of the specimen is varying and it contains different kind of faults, such as voids, honeycombs and prestressing tendons of varying quality. While the geometry and condition of the defects is well-known the performance of <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> like radar, ultrasonic, impactecho, thermography etc. can be compared.

This paper describes how effective <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> for safety requirements, which are part of a safety standard, may be developed. In order to be effective, <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> for the evaluation of products on aspects of safety must be valid, reproducible, and efficient. Various forms of <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> are discussed with regard to their effectiveness. The development of <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> for trapping hazards, which can be applied to all kinds of products, is described in a case study.

In each scenario a <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> is described, and criteria based on human factors data is added. Accident scenarios have proved to be an extremely useful link between accident data and the simulation of performance on which a <b>testing</b> <b>method</b> can be based.

25|$|The convenience, low cost, and {{mobility}} {{of this method}} distinguish it from conventional testing and are the primary reasons for its growing popularity. The method is convenient because all required sound system, power generation and distribution and data acquisition and control equipment is brought to the test site. Equipment is usually leased for each test event. There is no large investment in a facility, equipment or personnel required {{on the part of}} the customer. A diesel generator is the preferred power source, therefore providing clean on-site electrical power in a consistent configuration for connection to the MSI power distribution equipment. This removes the demand for large quantities of power from the test facility. In addition, testing can be performed at a much lower cost per test compared to the installation, operation and maintenance of a more standard high intensity reverberant acoustic chamber system. Finally, mobility allows this <b>test</b> <b>method</b> to be performed at almost any time and place in the normal test article integration and test flow. The test equipment is completely portable and no special facility or infrastructure is required.|$|E
