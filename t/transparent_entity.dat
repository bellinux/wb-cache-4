Brazil has passed legislations that recognize and protect the right to access information hold by public bodies. This paper consists of showing how Minas Gerais Court of Auditors-TCEMG- has used the technology resource to achieve its goal to become a <b>transparent</b> <b>entity,</b> always giving a quality service to society and fulfilling with its legal obligation. Using a system entitled SIAFI and its data warehouse, along with transparency portals, TCEMG is becoming an open, transparent and accountable institution. The contribution of technology is essential to reach transparency in public accounts. Always looking toward new technologies, systems and tools, TCEMG along with Information Technology is building a transparent and accountable institution...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a tool that can accurately, quickly and simply classify user traffic streams in a communications network environment. It is conjectured that the result of this traffic classification can be used at different network control levels. A neural network is a suitable engine of this tool. In high speed data communications networks, such as the proposed Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks, there are two conflicting forces. On the one hand, there is the network user, who wishes to view the network as a <b>transparent</b> <b>entity,</b> a pipe through which his data flows. On the other hand is the network provider, who wishes to maximize efficiency by connecting as many users to the network as possible. The trade-off between these two goals is the Quality of Service (QOS) that the user requires. In essence, communication networking represents a game to be played by the user and the network provider, wherein each seeks to maximize his benefits...|$|E

In order {{to understand how the}} procedure of taxation affects the sphere of business decision-making it is necessary to focus on the tax status of business losses and valorization and the effects of the double taxation of dividends. The rule of successive deduction of losses ensures the fiscally <b>transparent</b> <b>entity</b> receives a tax saving {{in the form of a}} reduction of the present value of the total paid tax. Meanwhile the corporation is handicapped because it postpones loss deductions, that is, it postpones tax saving, which directly influences the level of the present value of saved tax. The global trend of gradually moving from the classical system towards shareholder relief provision, above all in the form of a reduced withholding tax rate on dividends, has two opposing features: it simplifies the tax procedure while neglecting the distributional aims (consequences) of taxation. The analysis of a particular practical example from the Serbian tax context enables us to draw a conclusion in relation to the relative taxes paid by entrepreneurs versus enterprises. The developed countries favour fiscally transparent entities, whereas Serbia allocates tax privileges to enterprises...|$|E

Lack of immediate relief for losses leads to asymmetry of taxation, which is one of the causes of limitation functioning of the EU internal market. The comparison with other EU Member States based Czech Republic as a country with below-average possibilities of obtaining relief for losses. These include the 8 Member States have not yet adopted any national system of group taxation. Ways to get immediate relief for losses in domestic situations, including remains fiscally <b>transparent</b> <b>entities</b> in the group structure. Cross-border loss relief is available only if doing business in certain countries either by means of <b>transparent</b> <b>entities</b> or permanent establishments. This method of obtaining relief for losses is contrary to the interpretation of freedom of establishment, according to which there should be no discrimination on the basis of the legal form of business...|$|R

We claim that in spite of the similarities, shadows ought not to be considered <b>transparent</b> <b>entities.</b> The discussion has consequences both for the issue of the location of shadows, and for the conceptualization of transparency, and it provides insight into the inner complexities of the conceptual structure of visual concepts...|$|R

In a value relevance framework, we apply panel methods to a multiplicative interaction model in which the partial effects of earnings and book value on share prices are conditional on the adoption of IFRS. According to our evidence, the IFRS introduction enhanced the information content of both earnings and book value for more transparent banks. By contrast, less <b>transparent</b> <b>entities</b> did not experience significant increase in the value relevance of book value...|$|R
40|$|Various {{business}} entities {{are found}} in today's business community, however, such varieties of business entities often cause tax problems. While in one country, a hybrid entity is taxed as a corporation, it is dealt as a <b>transparent</b> <b>entity</b> in which equity holders are subjected to taxation in another country. The difference in taxation of hybrid entities {{can be used to}} international tax arbitrage. In the U. S., many regulations on tax planning using hybrid entities have been implemented, such as (i) Creating dual consolidated loss, (ii) Avoiding Subpart F rule application, (iii) Tax deferral on transferring intangible properties, (iv) Abusing foreign tax credit mechanism, (v) Obtaining benefit of tax treaty, (vi) Avoiding capital gain taxation, however, these regulations do not necessarily have enough effectiveness to prevent tax avoidance. As the U. S. experience in this area can be very instructive for Japan, this article goes over the U. S. regulations considering implications for the tax treatment on various entities in Japan. In order to tackle international tax arbitrage surrounding taxation of hybrid entities, foremost importance is each country's own effort. Likewise, developing international common understanding on this issue through effective tax treaties or thorough discussions is thought to be effective. Amid ongoing globalization of economy where more diversified business entities come into existence, fair and predictable taxation based on through investigation are highly required...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} of {{a theoretical}} taxation background of German and Dutch holding companies {{with respect to}} the Czech Republic. It analyzes different incomes generated by the holding companies and focuses on comparison of possible tax scenarios. The scope of the work extends beyond mere description and analysis of relevant taxation - it attempts to add value by comparing advantages and disadvantages of the aforesaid countries for establishing a holding company. The work has always its firm foundations in the Czech legislation and continues to scrutinize a network of international double taxation treaties and a system of European directives. The core lies in analysis of different holding structures and in analysis of different income taxation, in particular income from dividends, capital gains, interests and royalties. Additionally, the thesis touches on issues related to permanent establishments, <b>transparent</b> <b>entities</b> and beneficial owners of the entire holdings. There are three real-based examples of individuals or entities which plan on establishing a holding company either in Germany or in the Netherlands and follows their decision making process. They are (i) US based software producer, (ii) individual investor in organic farming, and (iii) investment fund with minority shares in projects [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{gathering}} of open source intelligence, such as through messages on social networking sites, weblogs, blogs or apps, demands proper checks and balances. AbstractOpen source intelligence (OSINT) is increasingly used for security and safety purposes. Even though security - and intelligence agencies and the police are using messages on social networking sites, weblogs, blogs or apps, state accountability mechanisms {{found it difficult to}} adapt to the online culture. Consider for instance the dilemma that open source information (OSINF) is frequently collected, processed, minded and stored by private companies. From a human right perspective, this gathering of OSINT demands proper checks and balances. Even though laws, regulations and policies may recognise this, it is important to review whether the gathering of OSINF online leads to new dilemmas. We conclude that state accountability should at least entail that the actual process and outcome of data collection, processing, mining and sharing is subjected to review and/or sanctions. Furthermore, it should become <b>transparent</b> which <b>entity</b> or who carries responsibility for the use of OSINT...|$|R
