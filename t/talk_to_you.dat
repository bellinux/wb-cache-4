5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed with myself when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. No one else will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> You can't keep me away from them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E

500|$|Tintin in the Congo {{has been}} criticised as {{presenting}} the Africans as naïve and primitive. In the original work, Tintin is shown at a blackboard addressing {{a class of}} African children. [...] "My dear friends," [...] he says, [...] "I am going to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> today about your fatherland: Belgium." [...] Hergé redrew this in 1946 to show a lesson in mathematics. Hergé later admitted the flaws in the original story, excusing it saying, [...] "I portrayed these Africans according to... this purely paternalistic spirit of the time." [...] Sue Buswell, who was the editor of Tintin at Methuen, summarised the perceived problems with the book in 1988 as [...] "all to do with rubbery lips and heaps of dead animals", although Thompson noted her quote may have been [...] "taken out of context".|$|E
500|$|At Casterman's prompting, Tintin in the Congo was {{subsequently}} fully re-drawn, {{and the new}} version was published in 1946. As {{a part of this}} modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and colonial rule. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about geography, he states in the 1930–31 version, [...] "My dear friends, today I'm going to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about your country: Belgium!" [...] whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a mathematics lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white [...] "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe." ...|$|E

500|$|... "My Moment" [...] is a self-empowerment {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-five seconds. It is {{composed}} in the key of E major, simply using three major chords (E, B, and A, respectively). According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV, the song [...] "is addressing all those haters who didn't necessarily get her last viral smash, [...] "Friday". Black starts singing the lyrics [...] "Weren't you {{the one who said}} that I would be nothing?/ Well, I'm about to prove you wrong/ I'm {{not the only one who}} believes in something/ My one wish is about to come true." [...] As the song goes, Black addresses her negative reception even more, singing, [...] "Haters, said I'll see you later/Can't <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> right now/I'm getting my paper". [...] "My Moment" [...] features a simple mid-tempo melody with a prominent uses of garish keyboards on its background.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{described}} by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", where Carey remembers both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. [...] "Bye Bye" [...] begins with an understated chorus, then working into the first verse, in which Carey retells her childhood, and her relationship with her father years ago: [...] "As a child there were them times / I didn't get it, but you kept me alive / I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes / And its more than saying 'I miss you' / But I'm glad we talked through / All them grown full things separation brings / You never let me know it, you never let it show". Then, the pre-chorus continues describing Carey's emotions in the present, [...] "And everyday life goes on / I wish I could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for a while", and how the loss of her father still affects her day-to-day life.|$|E
500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis.

My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E
