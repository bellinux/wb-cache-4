[...] In her speech at the event, Laura stated [...] "How ironic <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was killed in combat against his beloved America while in loyal service to his Japanese homeland... Like my father, I too have a great love for Japan and America." ...|$|E

Many have assumed {{that she had been}} tutored in the game. However, Balukas states, [...] "when they find out <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> doesn't play, many people think I must have learned the game from Frank McGown. That isn't true. I taught myself to play pool." ...|$|E
500|$|The Brin {{family lived}} in a three-room {{apartment}} in central Moscow, which they also shared with Sergey's paternal grandmother. Brin told Malseed, [...] "I've {{known for a long}} time <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> wasn't able to pursue the career he wanted", but Brin only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the United States. In 1977, after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw, Poland, Mikhail Brin announced that it was time for the family to emigrate. [...] "We cannot stay here any more", he told his wife and mother. At the conference, he was able to [...] "mingle freely with colleagues from the United States, France, England and Germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the West were not 'monsters.'" [...] He added, [...] "I was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] FT Magazines Rosie Millard, Hedren discussed Hitchcock's attitude towards her after {{she decided not to}} work for him again: [...] "He did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years." [...] Hitchcock sold her contract to Universal Studios, which dismissed her when she refused to work on one of its television shows. However, her acting career continued and she appeared in a number of film and television productions. Hedren said that while she was still under contract to Hitchcock, he turned down several film roles on her behalf, and was particularly disappointed when she heard from French director François Truffaut that he had wanted her for his film Fahrenheit 451. Truffaut's daughter Laura disputed this, telling Tony Lee Moral her mother had expressed surprise at the mention of Hedren's possible involvement in the project. Laura Truffaut was also sceptical of the story. [...] "It is extremely unlikely in my view <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> seriously entertained this project without sharing it with my mother as he was not secretive about the other actors who were considered for casting." ...|$|E
2500|$|James D. Watson {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, on April 6, 1928, as the only son of Jean (Mitchell) and James D. Watson, a {{businessman}} descended mostly from colonial English immigrants to America. His mother's father, Lauchlin Mitchell, a tailor, was from Glasgow, Scotland, and her mother, Lizzie Gleason, was the child of Irish parents from Tipperary. Raised Catholic, he later described himself as [...] "an escapee from the Catholic religion." [...] Watson said, [...] "The luckiest {{thing that ever happened}} to me was <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> didn't believe in God." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{think about}} my father being called ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, coming back from Vietnam and being called ‘boy’. So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when I {{was old enough to}} fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said I was old enough to be called a man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T so the first word out of everybody’s mouth is [...] "Mr." [...] That’s a sign of respect <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> didn’t get, that my brother didn’t get, that my mother didn’t get.|$|E

2500|$|In his memoirs, Holloway III {{complained that}} [...] "there {{has often been}} a tacit {{presumption}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{was in a position}} to advance my career as I gained seniority in the Navy. On the contrary, as a retired officer he had little or no influence over his own future, much less mine." [...] As an example of this presumption, when President Richard M. Nixon approved Holloway III's nomination to succeed Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. as chief of naval operations, Zumwalt believed that Nixon acquiesced mainly to avoid overruling the recommendation of his secretary of defense, but that, [...] "In addition, and I really think this was a factor, Mr. Nixon remembered Jimmy's father from his own period of naval service." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: [...] "The odd thing is <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{was such a}} good story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't tell me where my grandfather was buried. It was if there was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{detailed}} review of four sittings done by medium Tyler Henry, Edward and Susan Gerbic reviewed all the statements on the TV show Hollywood Medium. In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter {{felt that the}} reading was very successful. In after interviews with each sitter all four claimed that Henry had made specific statements, but after reviewing the show it showed that he had not. Each sitter misremembered the statement. One of many examples of this was when Henry during a session with celebrity Ross Matthews stated [...] "Bambi, why am I connecting to Bambi"? Matthews stated that his father who was a hunter would not shoot deer because of the movie Bambi. In the post interview, Matthews stated that [...] "it was weird that Henry knew <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would not shoot deer because of Bambi", when {{that is not what}} was said, Matthews had misremembered what Henry had said.|$|E

2500|$|A {{series of}} orchestral works {{originally}} composed for {{the concert hall}} commenced with the 3-movement Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987). This work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra and written for and in close collaboration with the violinist Paul Zukofsky and the conductor Dennis Russel Davies, who since then has encouraged the composer to write numerous orchestral pieces. The Concerto {{is dedicated to the}} memory of Glass's father: [...] "His favorite form was the violin concerto, and so I grew up listening to the Mendelssohn, the Paganini, the Brahms concertos. (...) So when I decided to write a violin concerto, I wanted to write one <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would have liked." [...] Among its multiple recordings, in 1992, the Concerto was performed and recorded by Gidon Kremer and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. This turn to orchestral music was continued with a symphonic trilogy of [...] "portraits of nature", commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra: The Light (1987), The Canyon (1988), and Itaipu (1989).|$|E
2500|$|La Toya Jackson ended her estrangement {{with the}} entire Jackson family and {{returned}} home to Hayvenhurst. Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And I think <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E

After trying to abduct his nephew Wiccan so he can assist him in finding his sister, he is stopped by {{his father and his}} other nephew, Speed. After Wiccan {{suggests}} that maybe Magneto actually did want to make up for his past, he became angry and said, [...] "Nephew the last time I allowed myself to believe <b>that.....</b> <b>My</b> <b>father</b> tried to kill me". Quicksilver prepares to fight his father but when debris from his rampage strikes his sister it is found that the Scarlet Witch there is actually a Doombot in disguise.

2500|$|Zhirinovsky has {{expressed}} {{admiration for the}} 1996 United States presidential election contender Pat Buchanan, referring positively to a comment in which Buchanan labeled the United States Congress [...] "Israeli-occupied territory." [...] Zhirinovsky said that both countries were [...] "under occupation." [...] and that [...] "to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe." [...] Buchanan strongly rejected this endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to persecuted minorities if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia's president, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: [...] "You soiled your pants {{as soon as you}} got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of: Zionists?" [...] Zhirinovsky repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published Ivan Close Your Soul in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asked, [...] "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and {{fall in love with the}} Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> left in my mother's body?" [...] Another frequently cited quote from Zhirinovsky is [...] "My mother was Russian and my father was a lawyer". Zhirinovsky later disowned the statement, after researching his father's life in Israel (where, after leaving Zhrinovsky's mother, he had immigrated in 1949 with a new wife, and worked as an agronomist in Tel Aviv). Discussing the statement, Zhirinovsky says: [...] "Journalists mocked me: for saying I was the son of a lawyer. And I am really the son of an agronomist." [...] Discussing his father, Zhirinovsky says with tears in his eyes: [...] "All my life I was looking for him. I believed that he was alive. I believed that someday he would find me... But there is a silver lining. I tried to imitate him... And I was able to achieve a certain position in life, even without the support of my father." ...|$|E
