5|$|Princes Margret Hospital, the island's only hospital, {{suffered}} {{damage to the}} roofs of the psychiatric and intensive care units. This led to heavy water damage, which also spread into <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward and damaged the electrical system. All of the patients had been evacuated before the storm arrived. Because most equipment and supplies had also been removed, the hurricane's cost to the health sector {{was limited to the}} EC$3million of structural damage.|$|E
5|$|James Paul McCartney (born 18 June 1942) and Peter Michael McCartney (born 7 January 1944) {{were both}} {{delivered}} in the Walton General Hospital in Rice Lane, Liverpool, where Mary had previously worked as a nursing sister in charge of <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward. Mary was welcomed back shortly before {{she gave birth to}} her first son by being given a bed in a private ward. Jim was not present at the birth as he was fighting a warehouse fire, but arrived at the hospital two hours later.|$|E

5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Tequila {{finds the}} last baby in <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> unit, and carries it to safety while {{fighting}} {{off the last}} of the gangsters. Alan and Tequila meet up again and are confronted by Wong, who has set bombs to blow up the building. Alan pursues Wong as Tequila escapes the hospital with the last baby, the hospital exploding around him. Outside, Wong suddenly appears holding Alan at gunpoint. After watching Wong humiliate Tequila, Alan grabs Wong's pistol. In a struggle, Alan shoots himself through the stomach giving Tequila enough time to shoot Wong dead. Later at the police station, Pang and Tequila burn Alan's police file. Alan then sails away from Hong Kong in his boat.|$|E
5|$|Alan and Tequila {{discover}} a hidden {{passage in the}} hospital leading to Wong's arsenal. They are confronted by Mad Dog, who engages them. Wong arrives {{at the hospital and}} has all the patients, police officers and staff taken hostage. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila liberate the kidnapped patients and police officers. Pang evacuates the lobby while police detective Teresa Chang (Teresa Mo) goes to <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward to organize evacuating the babies. Alan and Tequila continue fighting gangsters until they find Mad Dog. While Tequila goes to assist Chang with the babies, Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with a group of patients caught in the middle. They slowly put their guns down and offer the patients safe passage, until Wong appears and shoots them all. An enraged Mad Dog shoots Wong's gun out of his hand. Wong shoots and kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.|$|E

5|$|Ferrari {{undertook}} additional medical {{study in}} Europe and the United States, learning pioneering techniques that she {{brought back to}} Argentina. She studied urinary tract monitoring at the Medical Faculty of Paris, earning the first diploma ever given to a woman. She designed a vaginoscope, studied radiation therapy at the Curie Institute, and performed a Caesarean section at Columbia University. She was responsible for bringing these innovations back with her to Argentina and implementing them at <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> and gynecological unit she established at the Military Hospital. An ardent feminist, she established the Argentina Federation of University Women in 1936, and pushed for recognition of both {{civil and political rights}} for women. When the government of Argentina took a conservative turn in the late 1930s, she was pushed out of the hospital and later, in the early 1950s, out of teaching. She died in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} evoke {{a sense of}} calm. It was constructed with a central courtyard {{and a number of}} windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate hallways for staff and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E
5|$|This victory did not {{delay the}} workhouse's fate; {{the site was}} duly sold to the Catholic Church for Â£110,000, and {{demolition}} began in January 1931. Nevertheless, Bessie, who had been appalled by the housing conditions in the ward, helped to instigate a slum clearance campaign which slowly brought improvements. As {{a member of the}} council's Port Sanitary and Hospitals Committee, which controlled all the city's hospitals and residential homes for the elderly, Bessie discovered that the hospitals were generally verminous, drably decorated and poorly ventilated, with inadequate cooking facilities. Patients' record-keeping systems were rudimentary, with little or no communication between hospitals. She became involved in the reform, reorganisation and modernisation of many of the city's health facilities, particularly those related to mothers and children. From 1934 she was chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Maternity</b> and Child Welfare subcommittee, and in June 1936 worked with other women's groups to organise a national conference on maternity and child welfare issues.|$|E

5|$|With actor Richard Dean Anderson's {{departure}} from the show in 2005, Stargate SG-1 saw cast changes {{at the beginning of}} season 9. Ben Browder and Beau Bridges joined the main cast as Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron Mitchell and Major General Hank Landry, respectively. At the same time, the producers re-introduced Vala in a six-episode story arc to cover for <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> leave of SG-1 regular Amanda Tapping (Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter). The producer intended to use Vala's unpredictability and wildcard status to break the bigger story arc and to acquaint the audience with the new characters. Claudia Black wished to broaden her horizon in comedic acting and agreed to the recurring role, but declined the producers' offer of a permanent role for personal reasons.|$|E
5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue and Cry (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 â May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Ferrari {{was called}} to assist a {{military}} wife during childbirth at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires, which had no gynecological unit. After she proposed that one be developed, Ferrari started the facility with one bed and donated equipment and supplies. The military gazette began advertising from June of that year that gynecological services were available from Mondays to Fridays at the hospital. As military wives {{became aware of the}} services, the growth was exponential and within five years Ferrari had expanded the service to two floors that housed a maternity unit with two delivery rooms, their own sterilization facility, a recovery unit, and forty beds in private rooms. She also developed a small sealed room with purified air and an incubator, {{the first of its kind}} in Argentina. Ferrari brought the techniques she had learned abroad to Argentina. Though radiology had been performed in other parts of the world for decades, there was resistance to implementing it by professionals who had no experience with it. Ferrari insisted it should be introduced and fought against the previous practice of surgical solutions for all cases, advocating that surgery only be used when absolutely necessary. A commemoration for the 10th anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> unit was attended by the Minister of War, the Director General of Health, the Hospital Director and other senior officials, as well as by children born over the past 10 years together with their families. A commission of the Marine wives who had received service from Ferrari's unit made a substantial donation. Despite her success, the atmosphere at the hospital remained hostile. Following the 1930 coup d'Ã©tat of JosÃ© FÃ©lix Uriburu with the country's shift to a more conservative stance during the Infamous Decade, Ferrari ultimately was forced to leave the hospital in 1939.|$|E
25|$|The two ministers {{had also}} {{released}} conflicting reports over {{the conditions of}} <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward at Frere hospital, in the Eastern Cape province. Madlala-Routledge had reported that conditions at <b>the</b> <b>maternity</b> ward were a 'national disaster'. This was contradicted by Msimang, who reported that her deputy's comments were based on 'untruths', that the mortality rate at the hospital had been exaggerated, and that the infant death rates were 'in line with the national average'.|$|E
