5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt by Marge {{to win the}} money on the game show Jeopardy!, the Simpsons arrive home to find {{everyone}} in Springfield gathered on their lawn and Marge thinks they have forgiven them. However, while that is the case, they steal all of their belongings in order to cover the $15,000 debt. In the end, the family playfully fight over a tattered washcloth, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> they have left.|$|E
5|$|Credited as Lucille LeSueur, {{her first}} film was Lady of the Night in 1925, {{as the body}} double for MGM's most popular female star, Norma Shearer. She also {{appeared}} in The Circle and Pretty Ladies (both 1925), starring comedian ZaSu Pitts. This was soon followed by equally small and unbilled roles in two other 1925 successes, <b>The</b> <b>Only</b> <b>Thing</b> and The Merry Widow.|$|E

5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody and I said to Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.'

5|$|In 2002, Harvey {{called for}} Mark and Steve Waugh {{to be dropped}} from the Australian team, {{claiming}} {{that they were a}} waste of space.

5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends his life in the confines of a single room, waiting in front of a chute that kittens slide down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals. It responds by crushing the creatures, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> he is capable of doing.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away and turned to religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends {{to go to war}} in China to find death; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} on the 11th, wily Saltykov realized that Frederick was not advancing on him from Frankfurt, and changed his plans. He inverted his flanks: instead of having the left wing at the shtetl and the right at Mühlberge, he reversed his flank with the right at the shtetl. Then the Russians set fire to Kunersdorf. Within hours, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> left was the stone church and some walls. While Frederick developed his plan to outflank Saltykov by maneuvering behind him, Saltykov outfoxed him.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{realizes that}} Crump is in a {{considerable}} amount of pain and {{that the only way to}} ease the pain is to drive west. At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> to help ease the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E
5|$|Smoke was not <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> {{emitted from}} the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the water temperature of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as {{it did not seem}} to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of warm water into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the price of}} kelp, {{as a result of the}} Napoleonic Wars, was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> keeping Rùm's economy afloat. Inevitably, when the Napoleonic Wars ended, the kelp price collapsed, causing severe financial hardship. The laird himself was in additional difficulties as a result of having purchased the Isle of Muck during the peak of demand for kelp. He decided to evict the tenants, and lease the whole island to a relative, Dr Lachlan Maclean.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E
5|$|As {{the main}} attack {{developed}} on the 27th, the South Vietnamese General Assembly {{handed over the}} presidency to General Dương Văn Minh, who was sworn in the following day. It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would not be denied victory, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> for which they had striven for over 30 years. The hope that the communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E

5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history {{did not need to be}} recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} {{solstice}} meeting, the gods are finally convinced by Artemis {{to take action against}} the Titans. Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow not dead, and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he can relax, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes that he must be a son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle, Dinah faces off against her former friend, accidentally decapitating Edaniel in the process. An enraged Edrear {{attempts}} to kill her, but eventually halts when Dinah {{points out that}} he's crying for his brother, something that he's normally unable to do and that's being caused by Maphohetka's influence. Knowing that he's been compromised, Edrear stabs himself with his own sword, leaving Dinah to mourn him and share one kiss. Maphohetka, taking the opportunity, destroys Dinah's scythe (<b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> she had that could potentially kill her) and ends up mutating into a large monster. After Dinah is captured in Maphohetka's body, she happens upon the entity's core, which is Maphohetka's decayed corpse. Using Eniri's bracelet to see into the monster, she finds that {{a piece of the}} cross Maphohetka was stabbed with during her hanging is still lodged in her chest, allowing Dinah to conclude that the piece is what keeps the evil spirit anchored in the living world. Dinah removes the cross shard, causing Maphohetka to fade away.|$|E
