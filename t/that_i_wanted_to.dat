5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
25|$|He comprehended at last <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see a grisette. Then {{he showed}} me dozens of them. They were like nearly all the Frenchwomen I ever saw—homely. They had large hands, large feet, large mouths; they had pug noses as a general thing, and moustaches that not even good {{breeding}} could overlook; they combed their hair straight back without parting; they were ill-shaped, they were not winning, they were not graceful; I knew by their looks that they ate garlic and onions; and lastly and finally, to my thinking it would be base flattery to call them immoral.|$|E
500|$|I {{wanted the}} bottle to be {{something}} that could contain a dream. Solid like the bottles of yesteryear, but with a light feeling. And it comes with something special. The pendant containing the [...] "S" [...] symbolizes a charm for happiness <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> share.|$|E

500|$|The reason I {{added the}} piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed! I thought it was so stupid with that 'Ooh-ah' sound in it <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> add something to lift the track musically. I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so I was really feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> express. The shit <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Harvey has one older brother, Saul, {{and four}} nephews through him. She said in 1995 {{that she would}} love to have children, stating: [...] "I wouldn't {{consider}} it unless I was married. I would have to meet someone <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{spend the rest of my}} life with. That's the only person who I would want to be the father of my children. Maybe that will never happen. I obviously see it in a very rational way but I'd love to have children." ...|$|E

500|$|Nigel Kneale {{explained}} in a 1990s interview the background that had led him to formulate Quatermass and the other characters of the original serial in 1953. [...] "I wanted to write some strong characters, but I didn't {{want them to be}} like those horrible people in those awful American science fiction films, chewing gum and stating the obvious. Not <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something terribly 'British', but I didn't like all the flag-waving you got in those films. I tried to get real human interest in the stories, and some good humour." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There was {{a period}} where I felt like I wasn't quite being {{considered}} for the projects <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work on because maybe people were thinking. 'I'm not going to cast the girl who was in that movie for this adult project.' I've felt {{for a long time}} that this is what I want to do so I'm happy at this point to just take my time and work on projects that I feel really strongly about and the rest of the time just live my life." ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with {{a whole bunch of}} different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E

6000|$|... "Can't you understand," [...] she {{interrupted}} impatiently, [...] "that it is {{just this}} very moment, this instant, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get away?

500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something to take away from Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E
500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{became friends}} with former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988. They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend Flea (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea {{developed}} a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging {{that might have been}} the day he first played the bass riff to [...] "Nobody Weird Like Me". Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, [...] "I realized <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do that if I was in Zappa's band." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the opening}} chapter, Cartwright writes [...] "About {{five years ago}} I decided I wanted to write this book. I knew that The Simpsons would end some day. [...] I decided <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write it while the show {{was still on the}} air." [...] In an {{interview}} with Scotland on Sunday, she added [...] "I wanted to tell my story and I needed to because I get so much fan mail. People are so interested in the whole process, how it all comes together. This book does that." [...] In a 1995 interview, five years before writing the book, Cartwright remarked that she wanted to write a book and that if she did, it would be titled [...] "My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Gaga {{revealed}} on The Howard Stern Show {{that she}} was raped at age 19 by a producer twenty years older than her. During her conversation with Stern, the singer recalled, [...] "I went through some horrific things. I'm able to laugh now because I've gone {{through a lot of}} mental, physical and emotional therapy [...] I wasn't even willing to admit that anything had even happened [...] I saw him one time in a store, and I was paralyzed by fear." [...] She confirmed that the incident further inspired [...] "Swine", saying, [...] "I wrote a song called 'Swine'; the song is about rape. The song is about demoralization. The song is about rage and fury and passion, and I had a lot of pain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> release." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his 500cc Triumph Tiger 100 {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, and was thrown to the ground. Though the extent of his injuries was never disclosed, Dylan said that he broke several vertebrae in his neck. Mystery still surrounds the circumstances of the accident since no ambulance was called to the scene and Dylan was not hospitalized. Dylan's biographers have written that the crash offered Dylan the chance to escape the pressures around him. Dylan confirmed this interpretation in his autobiography: [...] "I had been in a motorcycle accident and I'd been hurt, but I recovered. Truth was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get out of the rat race." [...] Dylan withdrew from public and, apart from a few appearances, did not tour again for almost eight years.|$|E

500|$|Hill did {{not regard}} sport {{climbing}} {{to be real}} climbing and felt out of place on the professional indoor climbing World Cup circuit, so she left in 1992 {{and went back to}} traditional rock climbing. As she explained in an interview, [...] "the thing I didn't like too much towards the end was how focused it was on just indoor climbing and training. I didn't start out training on artificial walls, and that's not really ever something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do as a full-time profession". In her autobiography, she also comments on the [...] "bad sportsmanship, rule bending, and monumental egos that infested the competitions". She looked for different challenges and set herself the task of free climbing (that is, using climbing aids only to protect her from falls) The Nose, a famous route on El Capitan in Yosemite Valley.|$|E
500|$|Peter's uncle. Sheen {{admitted}} he was unfamiliar with Spider-Man other than Maguire's portrayal, and knew {{little of the}} character Ben Parker except for knowing Cliff Robertson had played the part. Sheen described his character as a surrogate father, saying, [...] "I'm dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes, with hormones changing and his getting out of hand. I {{have to give him}} the marching orders and so forth." [...] Webb said, [...] "You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet [...] He has that sense of benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, in terms of the dynamic <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> explore, vis-à-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents." [...] Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Warner Bros. had a {{deal with}} Inherit Productions, the {{production}} arm of Schwaid-Merenstein which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid (who worked for Warners Publishing) and producer Lewis Merenstein.

Merenstein first heard Morrison play at Ace Recording studio and recalled that when [...] Morrison played the song [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] for him, [...] "I started crying. It just vibrated in my soul, and I knew <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with that sound." [...] While Merenstein had been to see Morrison, [...] Schwaid had set to work on resolving Morrison's contractual [...] troubles.|$|E
