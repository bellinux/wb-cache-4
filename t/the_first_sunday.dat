5|$|Bach {{followed}} a specific structure {{for most of}} the cantatas of his chorale cantata cycle, especially the 40 he presented consecutively from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity of 1724 to Palm Sunday of 1725. In this chorale cantata format he retained the original text and melody of the chorale on which the cantata was based in the outer stanzas, typically treating the first as a chorale fantasia and the last as a four-part chorale setting, while the inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as the basis for recitatives and arias, usually with music independent of the chorale tune.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year in Leipzig, Bach {{composed}} chorale cantatas between <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity and Palm Sunday, but for Easter he returned to cantatas on more varied texts, possibly because he lost his librettist. Nine of his cantatas for consecutive occasions in the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, this one being {{the first of the}} series especially written for Bach. He had possibly commissioned them in 1724 for his first cantata cycle but not composed them at that time, because of his exceptional workload in creating the St John Passion.|$|E

5|$|In 1723, Bach was {{appointed}} as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, {{where he was}} responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. He took office {{in the middle of the}} liturgical year, on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Sunday</b> after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden for Easter Monday as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.|$|E

Paddanas (Ballad-like epics passed on through generations by word of mouth) are sung by a community of impersonators in Tulu and are usually accompanied by the rhythmic drum beats. The Bearys' unique traditions are reflected in such folk songs as kolkai (sung during kolata, a valour folk-dance during which sticks used as props), unjal pat (traditional lullaby), moilanji pat, and oppune pat (sung at weddings).
