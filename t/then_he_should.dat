5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be able to create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told him that if he wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to feel}} it for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E

25|$|In my judgment, U.S. {{involvement}} in Zaire defies justification. It {{is true that}} the U.S. has not utilized the full measure of resources available for Zaire, nor responded to Mobutu's requests for arms and ammunition. This restraint by the Administration is commendable, but if Mobutu qualifies for neither arms nor ammunition, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not qualify for any form of military assistance, lest the United States be drawn into the hapless conflict in Zaire, inch by inch.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{begin to}} arise within the Maroons when Adéwalé plots further raids against the slave trade. Bastienne objects, as de Fayet will only punish those trapped in slavery further as punishment. Adéwalé ignores her, but is horrified when he {{witnesses}} a frigate fire on an unarmed slave ship {{to prevent the}} slaves from joining the Maroons. Adéwalé boards the slave ship and manages to save a few slaves from drowning before the ship capsized with the rest. He plans retribution, but Bastienne cautions that taking revenge will weaken the Maroons' cause; if Adéwalé is to kill de Fayet, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> do so acting {{as an agent of}} justice. After assaulting the Governor's Mansion, pursuing him through the city and fighting off a local garrison, Adéwalé finally corners and kills de Fayet, who claims that slaves are incapable of self-governance and turn to armed uprising at the slightest provocation. Adéwalé points out that none of the slaves or overseers came to his aid, and instead let him die. After killing de Fayet, Adéwalé returns to say goodbye to Bastienne before returning to the Assassin Order, but pledging to use his newfound convictions to aid people who are oppressed rather than the cause of their would-be liberators.|$|E
500|$|Friedrich said, [...] "The artist should paint {{not only}} what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> also refrain from {{painting}} that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures will be like those folding screens behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead." [...] Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness {{to the presence of}} God are frequent elements in Friedrich's landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shore—a Charon-like motif—and in the poplar tree, it is referenced more directly in paintings like The Abbey in the Oakwood (1808–10), in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not until}} Wenger's arrival in October 1996 that Arsenal reemerged as a serious league competitor. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Manchester United amassed their fourth title in five seasons, whereas Arsenal {{finished}} the campaign in third – their highest position since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. During the season, Wenger commented on rule changes which permitted an extension to the league calendar: [...] "It's wrong the programme is extended so Manchester United can rest and win everything." [...] His observation irked Ferguson, who replied: [...] "He has no experience of English football. He has come here from Japan, and now he is telling everyone how to organise our football. Unless you have been in the situation and had the experience <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> keep his mouth shut, firmly shut." ...|$|E

To Bagramyan's astonishment, Budyonny {{went on to}} attempt to convince him to agree to his execution. Khrushchev remarked that the argument was sparked arbitrarily and had taken place after an [...] "abundant feast with cognac" [...] and that [...] "in those days we didn't take that kind of conversation seriously."

500|$|Gwyn's service {{during the}} Siege of Petersburg was {{noted by the}} {{commanding}} officer of the First Division, V Corps, General Charles Griffin as examples of Gwyn's [...] "gallantry", [...] "bravery" [...] and [...] "valor". Charles Griffin informed the Department of War that Gwyn should receive the rank of brigadier general, and if that was not possible <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be brevetted the rank. The Federal Government approved of the idea and issued Special Order 347 on October 14, 1864 in which James Gwyn was awarded the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from September 30, 1864, by President Abraham Lincoln. Gwyn was formally nominated by President Lincoln on December 12, 1864 and his appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 14, 1865. The First Division received word of Gwyn's promotion on October 14, and passed down to Gywn on the 17th. In a letter, Griffin wrote that Gwyn's promotion was [...] "evidence that the gallantry of our little command has been appreciated".|$|E

500|$|In 1922, Brinkley {{traveled}} to Los Angeles {{at the invitation}} of Harry Chandler, owner of the Los Angeles Times, who challenged Brinkley to transplant goat testicles into one of his editors. [...] If the operation was a success, Chandler wrote, he would make Brinkley the [...] "most famous surgeon in America", and if not <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> consider himself [...] "damned". [...] California didn't recognize Brinkley's license to practice medicine from the Eclectic Medical University, but Chandler pulled some strings and got him a 30-day permit. The operation was judged a success, and Brinkley received his promised attention in Chandler's paper, which sent many new customers Brinkley's way, including some Hollywood film stars. Brinkley was so taken with the city—and all the money it represented in the form of potential patients—that he began making plans to relocate his clinic there. [...] But his hopes were dashed when the California medical board denied his application for a permanent license to practice medicine, having found his resume [...] "riddled with lies and discrepancies" [...] (most of which were discovered and pointed out to the board by Fishbein). Brinkley returned to Kansas undaunted and began to expand his clinic in Milford.|$|E
500|$|At 06:00 on 3 February, Yeo {{discovered}} Gaspard's ships {{at anchor}} {{to the south}} of the island of Guanaboa and demanded that Gaspard come aboard Southampton with his commissioning papers, to establish under whose authority Gaspard commanded the warship. The Haitian captain refused, but sent aboard his first lieutenant with a note purported to be from Borgella, signed [...] "Borgellat, general in chief of the south of Hayti". As Borgella had no authority to commission warships, Yeo ordered the lieutenant to tell Gaspard that his ships must submit to Southampton and be taken to Port Royal, Jamaica, where their ownership could be established by the naval authorities. He would have five minutes to consider the proposal. A British officer accompanied the Haitian lieutenant back to Heureuse Réunion for Gaspard's answer, and was informed within three minutes that Gaspard had no intention of submitting to the British ship. He was also told that should Yeo be intent on fighting the Haitian ship <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> indicate it with a bow gun fired ahead of Heureuse Réunion. Returning to Southampton at 06:30, the lieutenant relayed the message and the bow gun was fired, followed a few seconds later by a full broadside from Southampton.|$|E
500|$|At the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Vijender Singh {{was beaten}} by England's Anthony Ogogo in the semi-finals. Leading 3–0 on points {{going into the}} final round, Singh was twice given a {{two-point}} penalty by Canadian referee Michael Summers, the second for coming just 20 seconds {{before the end of}} the bout, leading Ogogo to win by 4 points to 3. The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) launched an unsuccessful appeal, leaving Singh with a bronze medal. IBF Secretary General P K Muralidharan Raja said, [...] "The jury reviewed the bout and came to the conclusion that Vijender was holding his opponent and the referee was right in warning him. When the Indian team pointed out that even Ogogo was holding Vijender, the jury felt it was not the case." [...] Singh lashed out saying that the penalties were [...] "harsh and unfair. The warnings were unfair and harsh. If the referee thought I was holding Ogogo <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have penalised this guy as well. He was also holding me. It's a joke that somebody has won by scoring points just out of warnings."

500|$|On December 30, 2004, {{following}} the island being moved in [...] "There's No Place Like Home", {{the survivors of}} Oceanic Flight 815, the freighter team, and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) begin to erratically jump through time - something Faraday likens to standing on a skipping record - [...] while the Others are unaffected. The first jump takes them {{to the day when}} the Beechcraft carrying Mr. Eko's brother crashes onto the island. John Locke is shot in the leg by Ethan Rom (William Mapother), who has not yet met him and therefore does not recognize him. Meanwhile, James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway), Juliet and the freighter team head to the [...] in order to determine when they are. A second jump brings the group forward in time to after the destruction of the station, while Locke is approached by Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell), who recognizes Locke and treats his wound. He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting, and explains {{that the only way to}} stop the erratic movements through time is to bring back everyone who has left the island, and to do that Locke will have to die. Another jump brings them to the past, and they find that the Swan station is now intact. Sawyer tries to contact Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), who is inside, but Daniel asserts that the past can not be changed, and since Desmond did not know Sawyer already when they first met, Sawyer cannot be successful. No one answers, and everyone heads back to the beach. Daniel stays behind and knocks again, and Desmond emerges dressed in a hazmat suit, thus belying Daniel's original assertion. Daniel tells him that if Desmond's future self and the survivors of 815 make it off the island on the helicopter <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> go to Oxford University and find Daniel's mother, in order to help the survivors. Another jump occurs just before Daniel can give his mother's name.|$|E
2500|$|Lyttelton was {{a strong}} believer that {{blocking}} the wicket with the legs was unsportsmanlike, and battled to outlaw the manoeuvre for over thirty years, even {{going so far as}} suggesting that if the ball strikes any part of the batsman at all in front of the stumps <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be given out.
