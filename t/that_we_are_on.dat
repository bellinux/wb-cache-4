[...] "Smooth Criminal"'s {{recalled}} [...] "the popcorn-chomping manner" [...] of [...] "Thriller". The track was thought of {{as an example of}} [...] "Jackson's free-form language" [...] that keeps people [...] "aware <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the edge of several realities: the film, the dream it inspires, the waking world it illuminates". The music in [...] "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", a duet with Siedah Garrett, consisted mainly of finger snaps and timpani. [...] "Just Good Friends", a duet with Stevie Wonder, was viewed by critics as sounding good {{at the beginning of the}} song, ending with a [...] "chin-bobbing cheerfulness". [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel"'s music consisted of blues harmonies. The lyrics of [...] "Another Part of Me" [...] deal with being united, as [...] "we".|$|E

A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the Renaissance to Louis XV, were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would [...] "at once lose the feeling <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore".|$|E

2500|$|By 17 May, Rommel {{claimed to}} have taken 10,000 prisoners and {{suffered}} only 36 losses. Guderian was delighted with the fast advance, and encouraged XIX Korps {{to head for the}} channel, continuing until fuel was exhausted. Hitler worried that the German advance was moving too fast. Halder recorded in his diary on 17 May that [...] "Führer is terribly nervous. Frightened by his own success, he is afraid to take any chance and so would pull the reins on us... keeps worrying about the south flank. He rages and screams <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> the way to ruin the whole campaign." [...] Through deception and different interpretations of orders to stop from Hitler and Kleist, the front line commanders ignored Hitler's attempts to stop the westward advance to Abbeville.|$|E

25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if we look back <b>on</b> the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money.

2500|$|He {{analysed}} {{in retrospect}} that [...] "we continued to invest {{as if the}} company <b>were</b> growing strongly. <b>We</b> failed to realise <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> a slippery path…. Children were getting less and less time to play. Some of the western markets had fewer and fewer children. So play trends changed, and we failed to change. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> not making toys that were sufficiently interesting to children. We failed to innovate enough. And we had nowhere cut deep enough to right-size the company".|$|R
