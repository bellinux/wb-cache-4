30|$|Since {{our data}} provide {{information}} about the <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> {{before and after the}} reform, a difference-in-differences approach can be applied that identifies the treatment effect if the common trend assumption is valid. A number of empirical studies have used the same identification strategy for the evaluation of the effects of tuition fees on other outcomes and have proven that the introduction of tuition fees in some of the German federal states provides a reasonable institutional setting for this estimation approach (e.g., Dwenger et al. 2012; Hübner 2012; Bruckmeier and Wigger 2014; Helbig et al. 2012). However, although the change in law can be clearly considered as an exogenous treatment, students may have avoided the treatment by starting their studies in a federal state that did not charge tuition fees. In that case, the allocation of <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> would be not completely exogenous. Empirical studies indicate some changes in first-year student’s mobility behavior, but reactions are only marginal (Dwenger et al. 2012).|$|E

Twenty-one patients (24  %) in the intervention group and 27 (33  %) controls were reconnected to the ventilator within 48  h (p =  0.222). The main reasons for failure were respiratory distress (80 and 88  % in the <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> respectively), hemodynamic impairment (15 and 4  % in the <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> respectively), neurological deterioration (4  % {{in the control group}} only).

30|$|Finally, {{other kinds}} of {{experiments}} focus on the reactions of both the <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> to antigenic load. In particular, it is shown that when experimental subjects are inoculated with viruses (Gardner 2005; Ritz and Gardner 2006; Ritz et al. 2008), bacteria (Sun et al. 2001) or parasites (Kristan 2007), the treated group appears less capable of fighting external aggression than the control group.|$|E

The effect of age is the result of the definition of the <b>treatment</b> <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>groups,</b> which yields older control units. Similarly, pre-unemployment wages are higher for older agents, which is expected given the age and tenure profile of wages. The inclusion of age in the conditional difference-in-differences estimator, as done below, corrects for the observed heterogeneity.|$|R
