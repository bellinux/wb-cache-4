5|$|MGM (current {{holders of}} the rights <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs and Hannibal) {{released}} the theatrical cut of Manhunter on DVD in a pan-and-scan format in 2004. In January 2007, the same version was released by MGM in a widescreen format, {{for the first time}} on DVD, as part of The Hannibal Lecter Collection, along with The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. Manhunter was also released by itself in September 2007. The studio re-released The Hannibal Lecter Collection on Blu-ray in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} also {{nominated}} for Best Picture and Best Sound. It {{was the first}} animated film ever to be nominated for Best Picture, and remained the only animated film nominated until 2009 when the Best Picture field was widened to ten nominees, and it remains the only animated film nominated for the award when it had five nominees. It became the first musical in twelve years to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year, following All That Jazz (1979), {{and the last one}} to be nominated until Moulin Rouge! (2001), ten years later. It lost the Best Picture award <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs. With six nominations, the film currently shares the record for the most nominations for an animated film with WALL-E (2008), although, with three nominations in the Best Original Song category, Beauty and the Beasts nominations span only four categories, while WALL-Es nominations cover six individual categories.|$|E
25|$|Raimi needed $3 {{million to}} finish his film, but Universal {{was not willing to}} give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the Hannibal Lecter {{character}} which Universal needed so that they could film a sequel <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs. The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for Army of Darkness was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{inactive}} X chromosome {{does not}} express {{the majority of}} its genes, unlike the active X chromosome. This is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> of <b>the</b> Xi by repressive heterochromatin, which compacts the Xi DNA and prevents the expression of most genes.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that a silencing-inducing locus can efficiently reduce {{the expression of}} genes {{that give rise to}} transcripts partially homologous to those produced by the silencing-inducing locus (primary targets). Interestingly, the expression of genes that produce transcripts without homology <b>to</b> <b>the</b> silencing-inducing locus (secondary targets) can also be decreased dramatically via transitive RNA silencing. This phenomenon requires primary target RNAs that contain sequences homologous to secondary target RNAs. Sequences upstream from <b>the</b> region homologous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> inducer in <b>the</b> primary target transcripts give rise to approximately 22 -nucleotide small RNAs, coinciding with <b>the</b> region homologous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> secondary target. The presence of these small RNAs corresponds with reduced expression of the secondary target whose transcripts are not homologous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> inducer. <b>The</b> data suggest that in transgenic plants, targets of RNA silencing are involved in the expansion of the pool of functional small interfering RNAs. Furthermore, methylation of target genes in sequences without homology <b>to</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>silencing</b> inducer indicates not only that RNA silencing can expand across target RNAs but also that methylation can spread along target genes...|$|R

500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it."

Every time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E

50|$|However, {{methylation}} is not {{the only}} process involved in preventing the expression of the maternal Ube3a-ATS.

For example, when MECP2 is knocked out, such as in Rett Syndrome patients, Ube3a-ATS is biallelically expressed, decreasing expression of Ube3a from the maternal allele.|$|R

500|$|Dino De Laurentiis {{produced}} Michael Mann's film Manhunter in 1986, {{based on}} Harris's 1981 novel Red Dragon, featuring the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter, played by Brian Cox. De Laurentiis {{did not like}} Mann's film: [...] "Manhunter was no good... it was not Red Dragon," [...] he said. De Laurentiis and his wife Martha (also his co-producer) had no direct involvement in The Silence of the Lambs, a decision De Laurentiis came to regret. They did, however, own {{the rights to the}} Lecter character and reportedly allowed Orion Pictures, which produced The Silence of the Lambs, to use the character of Lecter for free, not wishing to be [...] "greedy". When The Silence of the Lambs became a commercial and critical success in 1991, winning five Academy Awards, both Dino and Martha De Laurentiis found themselves sitting on a valuable asset and eager for a follow-up novel they could adapt. After a lengthy wait, De Laurentiis finally received a call from Harris telling him he had finished the sequel <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs and De Laurentiis purchased the rights for a record $10 million.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{screenplay}} {{was included}} {{on the list of}} [...] "Hollywood's ten best unproduced screenplays" [...] by American Film magazine in 1983. In 1991, Jacob's Ladder was nominated at Horror Hall of Fame II for best horror film, losing <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs. The film was also featured in Bravo's 2004 documentary miniseries The 100 Scariest Movie Moments and in the 2009 book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. In 2012, Total Film ranked it as the 31st best independent horror film of all time. That same year, the film's elements were {{included on the}} list of top ten scariest movie demons by CraveOnline and ranked as the 19th best movie plot twist by Complex; similarly, it was also included on the 2013 list of 20 shocking movie plot twists by Digital Spy. In 2013, Slate ranked it as the 146th greatest horror film of all time, the Jacob Burns Film Center Projectionist Andrew Robinson chose it as his favourite scary movie, and IGN's Lucy O'Brien wrote a feature article about this [...] "brilliant" [...] film, where she called it [...] "the movie every survival horror fan should watch".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with {{generally}} positive reviews from television critics. Dan Martin of The Guardian reacted positively towards the episode, believing the cast performed better than the previous fifth series. He stated [...] "Steven Moffat has thrown away the rule book and made Doctor Who as, you imagine, he's pictured it should be his whole life. Killing the Doctor leaves {{the shape of the}} series mapped out, raises the bar so that no one is safe, and sees Amy, Rory and River facing a terrible dilemma." [...] Martin liked that [...] "Amy's numbed horror ramps things up to a series-finale level on intensity from the off," [...] and then switches [...] "into an Oval Office comedy of manners," [...] and [...] "morphs into gothic horror and finally flings you to the ground with its cinematic cliffhanger." [...] He was also positive towards the American setting, and [...] "our eccentric British foursome bumbling through it," [...] believing the series raised its game with this. With regards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Silence,</b> Martin believed it was [...] "a standard Moffat psychological trick, but the most refined to date." [...] Martin later rated it the second best episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E
40|$|Post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} (PTGS) is a sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism that is widespread in eukaryotic organisms. It is {{often associated with}} methylation of the transcribed region of <b>the</b> <b>silenced</b> gene and with accumulation of small RNAs (21 to 25 nucleotides) homologous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>silenced</b> gene. In plants, PTGS can be triggered locally and then spread throughout the organism via a mobile signal that can cross a graft junction. Previously, we showed that the helper component–proteinase (HC-Pro) of plant potyviruses suppresses PTGS. Here, we report that plants in which PTGS has been suppressed by HC-Pro fail <b>to</b> accumulate <b>the</b> small RNAs associated with <b>silencing.</b> However, <b>the</b> transgene locus of these plants remains methylated. Grafting experiments indicate that HC-Pro prevents the plant from responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>silencing</b> signal but does not eliminate its ability to produce or send the signal. These results demonstrate that HC-Pro functions downstream of transgene methylation and the mobile signal at a step preceding accumulation of the small RNAs...|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|R
40|$|To stand {{a chance}} of {{reclaiming}} their pre-colonial rights, indigenous peoples often have <b>to</b> deploy <b>the</b> tools and logic of the colonial state. Through {{a case study of}} community conservancy in Namibia, we demonstrate that the same holds for the practice of participatory mapping. We engage with J. B. Harley's deconstruction of maps and use our ethnographic data <b>to</b> reveal <b>the</b> <b>silences</b> and lies inherent in the rigid cartographic representations of conservancy maps. The indigenous peoples in our case study are the San, who have been marginalized and displaced from their land. We highlight how these people, once perceived by the colonialists as “rootless,” do have strong relational connections across the landscape. We argue that the practice of counter-mapping, along with its critique, is incomplete without full attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>silences</b> of <b>the</b> map and the relational rhizomes (across boundaries) of the peoples involved...|$|R
500|$|Later in 2002, Hoffman starred {{opposite}} Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in Anderson's {{critically acclaimed}} fourth picture, the surrealist romantic comedy-drama Punch-Drunk Love (2002), {{where he played}} an illegal phone-sex [...] "supervisor". Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader saw the performance as {{a fine example of}} Hoffman's [...] "knack for turning small roles into seminal performances", and praised the actor's comedic ability. In a very different film, Hoffman was next seen with Anthony Hopkins in the high-budget thriller Red Dragon, a prequel <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs, portraying the meddlesome tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in Spike Lee's drama 25th Hour, playing an English teacher who makes a devastating drunken mistake. Both Lee and the film's lead Edward Norton were thrilled to work with Hoffman, and Lee confessed that he had long wanted to do a picture with the actor, but had waited until he found the right role. Hoffman considered his character, Jakob, {{to be one of the}} most reticent characters he had ever played, a straight-laced [...] "corduroy-pants-wearing kind of guy." [...] Roger Ebert promoted 25th Hour to one of his [...] "Great Movies" [...] in 2009, and along with A. O. Scott, considered it to be one of the best films of the 2000s.|$|E

2500|$|Among those {{historians who}} doubt the massacre's historicity, Geza Vermes and E. P. Sanders regard {{the story as}} part of a {{creative}} hagiography. Some scholars argue that the story is an apologetic device or a contrived fulfillment of prophecy, while others point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> of Josephus, who records several examples of Herod's use of violence to protect his power, including the murder of his own sons. Robert Eisenman argues that the story may have its origins in Herod's murder of his sons, an act which made a deep impression at the time. David Hill acknowledges that the episode [...] "contains nothing that is historically impossible," [...] but adds that Matthew's [...] "real concern is ... with theological reflection on the theme of [...] fulfillment". Stephen Harris and Raymond Brown similarly contend that Matthew's purpose is to present Jesus as the Messiah, and the Massacre of the Innocents as the fulfillment of passages in Hosea (referring to the exodus), and in Jeremiah (referring to the Babylonian exile). Brown also sees the story as patterned on the Exodus account of the birth of Moses and the killing of the Hebrew firstborn by Pharaoh.|$|E
