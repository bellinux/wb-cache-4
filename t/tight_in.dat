TLC and late R singer Aaliyah created a fashion trend among women. Wearing over-sized pants and big flannel shirts, they would couple the over-sized clothing {{with a tight}} shirt usually a sports bra underneath their big shirts. This was to show {{their own version of}} femininity, everything {{does not have to be}} form fitting and <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> order to be sexy.|$|E

25|$|In theory, {{an ideal}} rod should {{gradually}} taper from butt to tip, be <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> all its joints (if any), {{and have a}} smooth, progressive taper, without 'dead spots'. Modern design and fabrication techniques, along with advanced materials such as graphite, boron and fiberglass composites as well as stainless steel(see Emmrod)- have allowed rod makers to tailor both the shape and action of fishing rods for greater casting distance, accuracy, and fish-fighting qualities. Today, fishing rods are identified by their weight (meaning the weight of line or lure required to flex a fully loaded rod) and action (describing {{the speed with which}} the rod returns to its neutral position).|$|E
25|$|DOCG {{regulations}} {{stipulate that}} Barbaresco wines must be aged {{for a minimum}} of 2 years (at least 1 year in oak) prior to release and aged for at least 4 years to be considered a riserva. The wines must have a minimum 12.5% alcohol level though most wines are closer to 13.5%. Well-made examples of Barbaresco wines are expected to be aged at least 5 to 10 years after vintage before they are consumed, as they are extremely tannic and <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> their youth, and some continue to drink well even after 20 years. The typical style of a Barbaresco has bouquets of roses or violets with flavor notes of cherry, truffles, fennel and licorice. As the wine ages, it can develop smoky notes and more earthy and animal flavors like leather and tar.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday 4 September reactor no. 1 {{was shut}} down for regular inspections. These check-ups would last at least three months. At that time reactor No.3 was also shut down, {{although}} the normal inspections were long time finished before September. To resume operation, a stress test was required for all suspended reactors by the government, after the accidents in Fukushima. The Ehime prefectural government said it would decide whether to approve the resumption of operations after {{the results of the}} safety test came out. The Shikoku Electric Power Company said that if the No. 3 reactor did not resume operations, power supplies would be very <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> winter when electricity demand would be high.

25|$|The opening {{game of the}} Olympics {{was against}} Cuba. Although the USA had played Cuba several times during their {{exhibition}} tour, and won handily, none of those games counted. A loss in the preliminary round wouldn't eliminate the team form medal contention, but a second loss would, so there was additional pressure. The USA team was playing {{in front of a}} home crowd, and played <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> the beginning, while Cuba hit six of their first eight shots to take a 14–7 lead. The team settled down, helped by a spark from the reserves, and went on to win 101–84. The second game was against Ukraine, another team they had played in exhibition, but a team that had done well against the USA, worrying VanDerveer. This time, the result would not be so close, and the USA team won their second game 98–65.|$|E
25|$|Security is {{exceptionally}} <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> the Suntec City area, with barricades {{being put}} {{up near the}} area's vicinity. The Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre has been closed to public during this period, and several car park entrances to the mall have been closed to the public. During the event, Suntec City and the convention centre is {{being taken care of}} by the Singapore Police Force and CISCO Security, with many policemen patrolling the mall and the convention centre. Vehicle checks are done by the police when they enter the carparks. The overhead bridge from CityLink Mall to Suntec City has been closed to the public for the meetings. A security office has been temporarily built at the main entrance of Suntec City Mall with metal detectors and x-ray machines being installed, and other security facilities. These machines have also been installed at SICEC for the delegates and CSO protestors.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{geometry}} of the tube-sample-detector assembly constant, the sample is normally prepared as a flat disc, typically of diameter 20–50mm. This is located at a standardized, small distance from the tube window. Because the X-ray intensity follows an inverse-square law, the tolerances for this placement and for the flatness of the surface must be very <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> order to maintain a repeatable X-ray flux. Ways of obtaining sample discs vary: metals may be machined to shape, minerals may be finely ground and pressed into a tablet, and glasses may be cast to the required shape. A further reason for obtaining a flat and representative sample surface is that the secondary X-rays from lighter elements often only emit from the top few micrometres of the sample. In order to further reduce the effect of surface irregularities, the sample is usually spun at 5–20 rpm. It is necessary to ensure that the sample is sufficiently thick to absorb the entire primary beam. For higher-Z materials, a few millimetres thickness is adequate, but for a light-element matrix such as coal, a thickness of 30–40mm is needed.|$|E

25|$|Schuck {{was born}} on 30 July 1920 in Frankenholz, now part of Bexbach, in Saar, {{at the time a}} region of Germany {{occupied}} and governed by the United Kingdom and France from 1920 to 1935 under a League of Nations mandate. Schuck was one of five children of Jakob Schuck, a coal miner and veteran of World War I, and his wife. After graduation from the Volksschule (primary school), he unsuccessfully applied for an apprenticeship at the coal mine in Falkenhorst. Money was <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> the family and higher education was out of reach. He then jobbed at a local brickyard. After a plebiscite on 13 January 1935, Saar was restored to Germany on 1 March 1935. The introduction of the compulsory military service on 16 March 1935 was seen by Schuck as a career opportunity and a chance to fulfil his dream of flying. His father, who had experienced the trench warfare during World War I, advised him to take every opportunity to avoid service in the infantry. Schuck volunteered for service in the Luftwaffe of the Wehrmacht at the age of 16, before he could be conscripted into the infantry.|$|E

500|$|Money {{was very}} <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> Villeneuve's early career. He was a {{professional}} racing driver from his late teens, with no other income. In {{the first few years}} the bulk of his income actually came from snowmobile racing, where he was extremely successful. He could demand appearance money as well as race money, especially after winning the 1974 World Championship Snowmobile Derby. His second season in Formula Atlantic was part-sponsored by his snowmobile manufacturer, Skiroule. He credited some of his success to his snowmobiling days: [...] "Every winter, you would reckon on three or four big spills — and I'm talking about being thrown on to the ice at 100 miles per hour. Those things used to slide a lot, which taught me a great deal about control. And the visibility was terrible! Unless you were leading, you could see nothing, with all the snow blowing about. Good for the reactions — and it stopped me having any worries about racing in the rain." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007.

[...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it.

500|$|DiMaggio's {{retirement}} {{after the}} 1951 season gave Stengel {{greater control over}} the players, as the relationship between superstar and manager had sometimes been fraught. [...] Stengel moved Mantle from right to center field in DiMaggio's place. The Yankees were not the favorites to win the pennant again in 1952, with DiMaggio retired, Mantle still recovering from his injury and several Yankees in military service, deployed in the Korean War. Sportswriters favored the Indians. Younger players, some of whom Stengel had developed, came to the fore, with Martin the regular second baseman for the first time. Mantle proved slow to develop, but hit well {{towards the end of}} the season to finish at [...]311. The Yankee season was also slow to get on track; the team had a record of 18–17 on May 30, but they improved thereafter. Stengel prepared nearly 100 different lineup cards for the 1952 season. The race was still <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> early September, and on September 5, Stengel lectured the team for excessive levity on the train after the Yankees lost two of three to Philadelphia.

500|$|The Canadians reorganised and on 14 August they {{launched}} Operation Tractable; {{three days later}} Falaise fell. The Allied noose was relentlessly closing around von Kluge's force, and it fell to the 1st Polish Armoured Division to draw it <b>tight.</b> <b>In</b> a meeting with his divisional commanders on 19 August, Simonds emphasised the importance of quickly closing the Falaise Pocket to General Stanisław Maczek. Assigned responsibility for the Moissy–Chambois–Coudehard area, Maczek's 1st Polish Armoured Division had split into three battlegroups—each of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion—and were sweeping the countryside north of Chambois. However, facing stiff German resistance and with Koszutski's battlegroup having [...] "gone astray" [...] and needing to be rescued, the division had not yet taken Chambois, Coudehard, or the Mont Ormel ridge. Galvanised by Simonds, Maczek was determined to get his men onto their objectives as soon as possible. The 10th Dragoons (10th Polish Motorised infantry Battalion) and 10th Polish Mounted Rifle Regiment (the division's armoured reconnaissance regiment) drove hard on Chambois, the capture of which would effect a link-up with the United States 90th Infantry Division who were simultaneously attacking the town from the south. Having taken Trun and Champeaux the 4th Canadian Armoured Division was able to assist, and by the evening of 19 August the town was in Allied hands.|$|E
500|$|Gaga wore {{a myriad}} of costumes, {{including}} a feathered crown from Gympie milliner Cindy Vogels during [...] "I Won't Dance". Vogels was contacted by Brandon Maxwell Studios from New York—Gaga's stylist—for designer pieces available for the concert. According to the milliner the crown almost never reached Gaga since the entire shipment was seized in Anchorage, Alaska due to the feathers on the piece being subjected to wildlife import issues with US customs officials. After much paperwork for five days the millinery designs were finally released and arrived {{just in time for}} the Cheek to Cheek promotional photo shoot. Vogels recalled, [...] "It was nerve racking and exciting at the same time and a relief when the shipment was finally released from customs." [...] Maxwell said that he and his team did the wardrobe for the dancers and Gaga, and first took references from Wilson regarding the set and lighting designs. The team then started with eight full racks of clothing, between 200 and 300 dresses, and afterwards zeroed in on eight costumes for the show, along with its accessories. Regarding the absence of jewellery, Maxwell explained that most of the outfits [...] "were more about the silhouette and structure of gowns" [...] and too much of accessories would have been a distraction. He wanted the emphasis on Gaga's vocals, hence the jewellery usage was reduced. Designers used for the costumes include Roberto Cavalli, Michael Costello, Mathieu Mirano, Valentino as well as David Samuel Menkes, who created the leather jumpsuit. Gaga had wanted costumes with teal or turquoise colours and flowing gowns, belted in the middle. Maxwell took care to ensure that the dresses were not too <b>tight</b> <b>in</b> Gaga's abdomen area, since it would have been difficult for her to sing. Sandals were provided by Brian Atwood, Stuart Weitzman and Sophia Webster, while a pair of boots were designed by Giuseppe Zanotti. They created custom made shoes which made Gaga appear tall and move freely in the long gowns.|$|E

The excess portion of the wedge is then cut flush with the surface. This supplies a mechanical hold that will prevail when the glue fails. In general, early Windsor chair joints are held together mechanically, making glue a redundant detail in their assembly.|$|E
