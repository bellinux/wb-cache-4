5|$|A {{week after}} the Gent–Wevelgem, Cancellara raced the Tour of Flanders. On the {{penultimate}} climb of the day, the Oude Kwaremont, Cancellara attacked and only Sep Vanmarcke was able to mark his move. The pair traveled along <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> caught the leaders {{on the road and}} the group of four then rode into the finish together. Cancellara out-sprinted the three other riders to win his third edition of the Tour of Flanders. Three days later, Cancellara raced in the Scheldeprijs. Four days following the Scheldeprijs, Cancellara began the Paris-Roubaix. He made a move in the Carrefour de l'Arbre sector and which {{led to the formation of}} a lead group. The group came to the line twenty seconds after the winner, with Cancellara managing to sprint to a third-place finish.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders {{were faced with}} the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E

At home she had installed a high-altitiude tent, and with a speedy recovery she went with Iris Slappendel to Switzerland to train at high altitude. Six weeks after her crash she could race again and started in the 2015 Boels Rental Ladies Tour on 1 September. She rode in the stage race stronger every day and finished second in the time trial, two seconds behind of Lisa Brennauer. She moved to the third place in the general classification and was able to keep this position.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano {{to watch}} Henry, {{then at the}} age of 13 in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even {{attending}} a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> joined Arsène Wenger's Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice. Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the large 1960 team, the teams in subsequent Olympics were scaled back and were the smallest since 1936. The 1964 Winter Olympics were marred by the deaths of Australian skier Ross Milne—who crashed during a practice run—and a British luge competitor. Milne had skidded off <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> crashed into a tree. Members of the IOC asked the AOF whether Milne was negligently sent to compete {{despite a lack of}} experience, which the AOF denied. The Australian manager John Wagner blamed the accident on a large group of skiers who had congregated lower down on the course during the practice session, forcing Milne to take evasive action. The Australian delegation felt that the training arrangements had not been enacted strictly, making the course unsafe. Australia was represented by five skiers—excluding Milne. Christine Smith placed in the top 30 in two events, but the remainder placed 40th or lower, although all were in {{the bottom half of the}} field. Milne's replacement Peter Wenzel placed 68th in both the downhill and giant slalom.|$|E
5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E

5|$|Micheletto won {{the opening}} {{stage of the}} race to give Atala-Dunlop the first lead in the race. Despite two {{consecutive}} stage wins by Legnano riders, Atala-Dunlop still retained the lead going into the fourth stage. The fourth leg was held in rainy conditions that caused some rivers to overflow on <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> riders to take the wrong roads for extensive distances; {{this led to the}} cancellation of the stage and addition of a ninth leg that drew some of its route from the Giro di Lombardia. An Atala-Dunlop rider won the fifth stage, but the team lost the lead to Peugeot for one stage. Following the stage, Atala-Dunlop regained the lead and held that to the race's finish in Bergamo.|$|E
5|$|Paul Kagame {{was still}} in the United States {{at the time of the}} {{outbreak}} of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth. He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion. At the end of September, Kagame informed the college that he was leaving <b>the</b> <b>course,</b> <b>and</b> was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began. The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war. When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops. He flew through London and Addis Ababa, eventually arriving at Entebbe Airport, where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service; the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country, and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass. Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border, and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.|$|E

After brief postings to No.1 Armament School, Point Cook, and Station Headquarters Laverton, {{he was assigned to}} Air Force Headquarters, Melbourne, in May. He was made an acting squadron leader in September 1940 and became Deputy Director of Armament the next year. In April 1942, Hannah was promoted to temporary wing commander. He undertook a general reconnaissance course the following May.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{founding}} the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell saw {{the need}} for leader training. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire. Baden-Powell wanted practical training in the outdoors in campsites. World War I delayed the development of leader training, so the first formal Wood Badge course was not offered until 1919. Gilwell Park, just outside London, was purchased specifically to provide a venue for <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> the Opening Ceremonies were held on July 26, 1919. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief at Gilwell Park, conducted the first Wood Badge course there from September 8–19, 1919. It was produced by Percy Everett, the Commissioner of Training, and Baden-Powell himself gave lectures. The course was attended by 18 participants, and other lecturers. After this first course, Wood Badge training continued at Gilwell Park, and it became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement.|$|E
5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the crosshairs for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope artificial horizon, to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on <b>the</b> <b>Course</b> <b>and</b> Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E
5|$|Wick {{failed to}} pass the third course of his {{training}} but was given a second chance and on 1 April 1938 reported to the officer candidate school at the Luftkriegsschule III (3rd air war school), Wildpark-West near Werder. He successfully completed <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>and</b> in mid-1938 started special pilot training at the Fighter Training facility at Werneuchen. Upon graduation, {{he was assigned to}} II.Gruppe Jagdgeschwader 135 (135th Fighter Wing) which on 1 November 1938 became Jagdgeschwader 333 (333rd Fighter Wing) under Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Max Ibel at Herzogenaurach, flying obsolete Arado Ar 68 biplane fighters. On 8 November 1938, Oberfähnrich (senior ensign) Wick was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) and on 1 January 1939 was transferred to 1. Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 133 (133rd Fighter Wing), which was later renamed Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG53—53rd Fighter Wing). It was there that Wick began flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 monoplane fighter under the tutelage of Werner Mölders, a Spanish Civil War flying ace credited with 14 aerial victories. Under Mölders' guidance, Wick became a Schwarmführer (flight leader).|$|E
