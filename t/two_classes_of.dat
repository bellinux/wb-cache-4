5|$|Between 1893 and 1904, Italy {{laid down}} eight battleships; the later <b>two</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> ship were remarkably fast, though the Regina Margherita class was poorly {{protected}} and the Regina Elena class lightly armed. In some ways, these ships presaged {{the concept of}} the battlecruiser. The Austro-Hungarian Empire also saw a naval renaissance during the 1890s, though of the nine pre-dreadnought battleships ordered only the three of the Habsburg class arrived before Dreadnought herself made them obsolete.|$|E

Shulgin performed seminal work into the descriptive synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of Shulgin's noteworthy discoveries include compounds of the 2C* family (such as 2C-B) and compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM).|$|E
5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were <b>two</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix a bicycle, and when a bicycle was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

40|$|R. Brandl in [2] and H. Mousavi in [6] {{classified}} finite {{groups which}} have respectively {{just one or}} exactly <b>two</b> conjugacy <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> non-normal subgroups. In this paper we determine finite groups which have just one or exactly <b>two</b> conjugacy <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> non-normal cyclic subgropus. In particular, in a nilpotent group if all non-normal cyclic subgroups are conjugate, then any two non-normal subgroups are conjugate. In general, if a group has exactly <b>two</b> conjugacy <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> non-normal cyclic subgroups, there is no upper bound for the number <b>of</b> conjugacy <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> non-normal subgroups...|$|R

5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, {{antimony}} and tellurium, {{as well as}} heavier {{metals and}} metalloids such as Sm, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi and Se, {{can be found in}} topological insulators. These are alloys or compounds which, at ultracold temperatures or room temperature (depending on their composition), are metallic conductors on their surfaces but insulators through their interiors. Cadmium arsenide Cd3As2, at about 1 K, is a Dirac-semimetal—a bulk electronic analogue of graphene—in which electrons travel effectively as massless particles. These <b>two</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> material are thought to have potential quantum computing applications.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} species of fish, the timing of {{spawning}} varies over {{the range of the}} species, with gonad development indicating that spawning in the southern New South Wales region occurs from December to April, while spawning in southern Queensland occurs from September to February. Spawning takes place twice a year, evident by the <b>two</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> egg size found in the ovaries and by the two recruitment pulses observed each year as young fish enter their juvenile habitats. The spawning takes place at the mouths of estuaries or in surf zones, with the larvae occurring in fully marine waters. Juveniles reach 16.5cm in length after their first year of life, 26.7cm after their second year and 30.5cm after their third year. After the beginning of the spawning season young whiting of 10mm and over can be observed swimming actively in small droves of from 10 to 20 on the sand flats and beaches to which they are recruited, moving up and down with the tide, swimming in very shallow water to depths of 1m. Unlike closely related sillaginids, the juveniles usually prefer unprotected sand substrates, while other species tend to use seagrass and mangroves as protection. As they grow older they keep further from the shore.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, {{the prison}} had {{separate}} areas for its <b>two</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> prisoner: the master's side, which housed about 50rooms for rent, {{and the common}} or poor side, consisting of nine small rooms, or wards, into which 300people were confined from dusk until dawn. Room rents on the master's side were ten shillings a week in 1728, with most prisoners forced to share. John Baptist Grano paid 2s 6d (two shillings and six pennies) for a room with two beds on the master's side, shared with three other prisoners: Daniel Blunt, a tailor who owed £9, Benjamin Sandford, a lighterman from Bermondsey who owed £55, and a Mr. Blundell, a jeweller. Women prisoners who could pay the fees were housed in the women's quarters, known as the oak. The wives, daughters and lovers of male prisoners were allowed to live with them, if someone was paying their way.|$|E

5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have <b>two</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{recognized}} <b>two</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> geological feature on Oberon: craters and chasmata ('canyons'—deep, elongated, steep-sided depressions which {{would probably be}} described as rift valleys or escarpments if on Earth). Oberon's surface is the most heavily cratered of all the Uranian moons, with a crater density approaching saturation—when the formation of new craters is balanced by destruction of old ones. This high number of craters indicates that Oberon has the most ancient surface among Uranus's moons. The crater diameters range up to 206 kilometers for the largest known crater, Hamlet. Many large craters are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. The largest craters, Hamlet, Othello and Macbeth, have floors made of a very dark material deposited after their formation. A peak with a height of about 11km was observed in some Voyager images near the south-eastern limb of Oberon, {{which may be the}} central peak of a large impact basin with a diameter of about 375km. Oberon's surface is intersected by a system of canyons, which, however, are less widespread than those found on Titania. The canyons' sides are probably scarps produced by normal faults which can be either old or fresh: the latter transect the bright deposits of some large craters, indicating that they formed later. The most prominent Oberonian canyon is Mommur Chasma.|$|E
