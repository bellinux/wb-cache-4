5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> lift {{him out of the}} water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or quayside.|$|E
5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil.

Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} {{have been proposed}} to interpret the origin of volcanism in the NCVP. This includes slab windows, mantle plumes, crustal extension and deglaciation. The most common and best mechanism used to explain NCVP volcanic activity is incipient rifting of the North American Plate caused by crustal extension. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Mafic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava flows, although more viscous felsic magma also makes its way to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> can produce explosive eruptions. Two major structural features, the Tintina and Denali-Coast fault systems, run parallel with the NCVP. Both structures have had strike-slip motions since the Cretaceous period and has resulted in several hundred kilometres of crustal displacement.|$|E

In the paper, the performance parameters of the developed magneto poles, which are used for finishing <b>the</b> plane <b>surfaces</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> curved ones, have been tested. The curvature of <b>the</b> finished <b>surface,</b> <b>the</b> sloping angle of <b>the</b> machined <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rotation speed of the poles, which affect <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> roughness, are studied theoretically.

5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>and</b> a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E
5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> became the second human to {{set foot on the}} Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E

5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>and</b> the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>and</b> autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
