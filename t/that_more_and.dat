The eventual result is not known. The Î›CDM model of the universe contains dark {{energy in the form}} of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E

25|$|Evolutionary {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} men and women have innate mechanisms that contribute to why they become sexually jealous, especially for certain types of infidelity. It has been hypothesized that heterosexual men have developed an innate psychological mechanism that responds to the threat of sexual infidelity more than emotional infidelity, and vice versa for heterosexual women. This is because it is thought that the threat of cuckoldry is more detrimental to the male, who could potentially invest in offspring that is another male's, and for females, emotional infidelity would be more worrisome because they could lose the parental investment in their offspring for another woman's offspring, therefore affecting their chances of survival. However the evidence for this gender difference is debatable, as new findings are suggesting <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more men and women today would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse (Harris, 2002).|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s the bootleg {{industry}} in the United States expanded rapidly, coinciding with the era of stadium rock or arena rock. Vast numbers of recordings were issued for profit by bootleg labels such as Kornyfone and TMQ. [...] The large followings of rock artists created a lucrative market for the mass production of unofficial recordings on vinyl, as it became evident <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more fans were willing to purchase them. In addition, the huge crowds which turned up to these concerts made the effective policing of the audience {{for the presence of}} covert recording equipment difficult. Led Zeppelin quickly became a popular target for bootleggers on the strength and frequency of their live concerts; Live on Blueberry Hill, recorded at the LA Forum in 1970, was sufficiently successful to incur the wrath of manager Peter Grant. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band recorded numerous concerts for radio broadcast in the 1970s, which resulted in many Springsteen bootlegs.|$|E

500|$|Three {{models of}} the Nostromo were made: a [...] version for medium and long shots, a [...] version for rear shots, and a , [...] rig for the {{undocking}} and planetoid surface sequences. Scott insisted on numerous changes to the models even as filming was taking place, leading to conflicts with the modeling and filming teams. The Nostromo was originally yellow, and the team filmed shots of the models for six weeks before Johnson left to work on The Empire Strikes Back. Scott then ordered it changed to gray, and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch. He asked <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more pieces {{be added to the}} model such that the final version (with the refinery) required a metal framework so that it could be hoisted by a forklift. He also took a hammer and chisel to sections of the refinery, knocking off many of the spires that Bower had spent weeks creating. Scott also had disagreements with miniature-effects cinematographer Dennis Ayling over how to light the models.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{critical}} reviews of Friendship Is Magic, published shortly after the initial broadcast in October 2010, was written by Amid Amidi for the animation website Cartoon Brew. Amidi wrote that the show {{was a sign of}} [...] "the end of the creator-driven era in TV animation". Amidi's essay expressed concern that assigning a talent like Faust to a toy-centric show was part of a trend towards a focus on profitable genres of animation, such as toy tie-ins, to deal with a fragmented viewing audience, and overall [...] "an admission of defeat for the entire movement, a white flag-waving moment for the TV animation industry." [...] The article said this concern was over the fact <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more shows seem to be driven by company executives who want to sell their products, rather than creators. Though the show had been discussed on 4chan's 'comics and cartoon' board ('/co/') before the essay's publication, the alarmist nature of the essay led to more interest in the show, resulting in a positive response for the series for its plot, characters, and animation style. This reaction soon spread to the other boards of 4chan, where elements of the show quickly inspired recurring jokes and memes on the site. Some of these included adopting phrases from the show like [...] "anypony", [...] "everypony", and [...] "nopony", instead of [...] "anybody", [...] "everybody", and [...] "nobody", or jokingly stating that they watch the show for the [...] "plot", a reference to the ponies' flanks.|$|E

This has had a dramatic effect on home ownership rates by Kiwis, now at its lowest level since 1951. Even as recently as 1991, 76% of New Zealand homes were occupied by their owners. By 2013, this was down to 63%, indicating <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more people are having to rent. Raewyn Cox, {{chief executive of the}} Federation of Family Budgeting, says: [...] "High prices and high interest rates (have) sentenced a rising number of New Zealanders to be lifetime tenants" [...] where they are [...] "stuck in expensive rental situations, heading towards retirement." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like the vegetation, Amrum's wild beasts are {{determined}} by the island's location within the North Sea. Thus {{there are only a few}} species of wild mammals on Amrum, like hare, mice, hedgehogs and bats. In the 12th century coneys were introduced as game. Still today they populate the island. A few years ago a pregnant vixen was set free on Amrum. She and her offspring caused severe damage to the island's fauna, but meanwhile they have been hunted down. In the sea and on the sand bars off Amrum, thus within the National Park, harbour seals, grey seals and harbour porpoises have their habitat. Occasionally in December and January young grey seals are washed ashore on Amrum's beaches due to storm surges and are thereafter nursed by the adults. In January 2010 the seal shelter station at Friedrichskoog announced <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more female grey seals were [...] "moving away from less favourable birth sites near Amrum and Sylt to Heligoland." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Daniel Mindel {{stated that}} The Force Awakens would use real {{locations}} and scale models over computer-generated imagery {{to make it}} aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy. Rian Johnson, director of The Last Jedi, reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: [...] "I think people are coming back around to [...] It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more people are hitting kind of a critical mass {{in terms of the}} CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick." [...] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.|$|E

2500|$|In 1932, The Guardian {{reported}} on a trend for frocks based around designs by the French Impressionists, adding: [...] "There {{is no reason why}} they should look any more ridiculous than the Empress EugÃ©nie hats that every other woman was wearing a few months ago". [...] In 1933, The Times reported that milliners were drawing on both the 18th century and the Second French Empire for inspiration, singling out Suzanne Talbot as showing styles similar to Empress EugÃ©nie's riding hats and designs with trims turned up sharply on one side. A wide variety of materials were being used, including taffetas, straw and grosgrain. A year later, the EugÃ©nie hat was still being adapted as part of new season's millinery designs, but now showing more of women's hairstyles: [...] "Hats are halo-like or sailor-like, but with considerable flatness. The idea is now to show the hair and the Eugenie hats, which are tipped forward over the nose, indicate <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more hair is expected {{at the back of the}} head".|$|E
2500|$|Hulk Hogan {{then made}} his way down to the ring as Nash and Hall fled to the outside. In a {{surprise}} move, the longtime fan favorite Hogan then performed two Atomic Legdrops to Savage, revealing himself to be Hall and Nash's partner as The Outsiders returned to the ring to celebrate their new alliance as the stunned crowd looked on. The match officially ended in a no-contest after Hogan threw the referee out of the ring and hit Savage with one more Atomic Legdrop. After the main event, the audience began to throw trash in the ring. Gene Okerlund entered the ring and asked Hogan why he had turned his back on the fans and how he could align himself with Hall and Nash. Hogan claimed that the three of them were [...] "the future of wrestling" [...] and said that [...] "you can call this the new world order of wrestling, brother." [...] Hogan went on to justify his actions, saying he was bored with WCW and had grown tired of constantly pandering to the fans, especially considering <b>that</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more of them had started to turn on him since he had joined the company in 1994. Hogan declared their intention to take over the wrestling business and destroy everything in their path.|$|E
