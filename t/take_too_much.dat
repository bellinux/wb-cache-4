5|$|In late 1923, having {{decided not}} to return to Cambridge, Allen took {{a job in the}} City (London's {{financial}} district) working for the Royal Exchange Assurance Corporation as an underwriter. Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time away from business. He played cricket as often as he could in the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 {{professional}} seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar {{announced his}} retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets {{in the first}} round, they lost four games to one {{in the second round}} of the playoffs to the Suns. Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout, and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy. Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> credit for the team's successes. Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E

25|$|A {{completely}} different approach is often taken for very large systems, which would otherwise <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time or memory. The {{idea is to}} start with an initial approximation to the solution (which {{does not have to}} be accurate at all), and to change this approximation in several steps to bring it closer to the true solution. Once the approximation is sufficiently accurate, this is taken to be the solution to the system. This leads to the class of iterative methods.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{the same}} play {{was made into}} a two-hour {{television}} movie that aired on NBC. The writers suggested Lee J.

Director Richard Irving convinced Levinson and Link that Falk, who wanted the role, could pull it off even though he was much younger than the writers had in mind.|$|E

Pilots use ten traditional customizable weapons, {{including a}} semi-automatic shotgun, machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and the Smart Pistol Mk5. The latter locks onto multiple targets before firing multiple shots in a burst. Players generally require three Smart Pistol shots to die. The pistol can also shoot around corners. All pilots have anti-Titan weapons equipped. Pilots can hop on a Titan's back to [...] "rodeo" [...] and shoot its weak spot, or otherwise use four anti-Titan weapons {{to take them}} down.

500|$|In 1922, six U.S. {{states in}} the Colorado River basin signed the Colorado River Compact, which divided half of the river's flow to both the Upper Basin (the {{drainage}} area above Lee's Ferry, comprising parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming and {{a small portion of}} Arizona) and the Lower Basin (Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of New Mexico and Utah). Each was given rights to [...] of water per year, a figure believed to represent half of the river's minimum flow at Lee's Ferry.

2500|$|They rented part of {{the hotel}} as a {{dormitory}} for New Mexico Highlands University students and sold meal tickets for the restaurant {{as an alternative to}} the university cafeteria.

2500|$|While {{some critics}} criticized the film's depictions of {{violence}} and greed—such as death scenes, Kate's speech, and the gremlins' gluttony—for lacking comic value, scholar Charlotte Miller instead interpreted these as a satire of [...] "some characteristics of Western civilization", suggesting that Westerners may <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> satisfaction from violence. Gremlins can also {{be interpreted as a}} statement against technology, in that some characters, such as Billy's father, are overly dependent on it. In contrast, Mr. Wing is shown to have a strong distaste for television. Kirkpatrick Sale also interpreted Gremlins as an anti-technology film in his book Rebels Against the Future. [...] Another scholar suggested that the film is meant to express a number of observations of society by having the gremlin characters shift in what they are meant to represent. At different times, they are depicted as teenagers, the wealthy establishment, or fans of Disney films.|$|E

2500|$|Gears of War is a third-person shooter {{that places}} {{emphasis}} on using cover to avoid taking damage while moving towards enemy forces. The game uses {{a number of}} weapon archetypes, but predominately featured is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can deal melee damage at close range. Playable characters can carry two primary weapons, grenades, and a smaller, secondary weapon such as the Snub Pistol. Weapons are reloaded with a tap of the RB button, and a second tap within a given time (active reload) rewards the player with a damage bonus. However, failing to perform the [...] "Active Reload" [...] correctly will cause the gun to become momentarily jammed while the player's character fixes it. When the player takes damage, the [...] "Crimson Omen", a red cog representing the player's health gauge, will fade into the screen, becoming more defined with larger amounts of damage. The player can seek cover to recover their health, but if they <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> damage, they will become incapacitated. Once this occurs, a skull will fill the center void of the omen. The player can then be revived by a teammate, executed by an enemy, or remain incapacitated until they [...] "bleed out", dying from blood loss.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral Tryon was {{concerned}} that the normal system of signalling between ships would become unworkable in real war conditions. To send a signal required hoisting a flag sequence, waiting for all ships to raise flags to confirm they had seen and understood, and then lowering the initial flags to signal everyone to carry it out. [...] The signals book had grown to hundreds of pages describing the many possible flag combinations and virtually no one knew them all. In a real battle this process might <b>take</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time, or might be entirely impossible if enemy fire had destroyed the masts from which the flags must fly, or smoke made them impossible to read. Instead, Tryon proposed a simple signal, using the letter-flags T and A, which simply instructed captains to follow their leader. Other flag signals might be used additionally as circumstances allowed, but once the initial order was given, the ships simply had to follow the movements of their leaders. A few, basic, single flag signals were designated for particular movements, which would simply be flown without needing acknowledgement. This was {{a radical departure from}} contemporary practice, in which all movements were precisely signalled from the flagship and acknowledged by their recipients. Opinion was fiercely divided about it, for instance The Times newspaper considered it [...] "unsound in theory and perilous in practice", whilst Rear-Admiral William Kennedy on the East Indies station declared following experiments with it that [...] "the officers commanding thoroughly appreciated the idea which would be invaluable in time of war".|$|E
