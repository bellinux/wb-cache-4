40|$|As {{teachers}} we {{strive to}} teach our students the skills and strategies to be critical thinkers and active learners. When we consider the need for our students to be active, we must consider that active literacy is the “means to deeper understanding and diverse, flexible thinking ” (Harvey & Goudvis, 2007). Students that give their opinions, thoughts and ideas while also spending time questioning, connecting, debating, and inquiring are seen as engaged in their own learning and comprehension. While we may hear teachers telling students to “put on their <b>thinking</b> <b>caps</b> ” or “get ready to think”, as a primer to set-up learning, it’s important {{to ensure that students}} are given the tools to critically contemplate about what they are learning. One way to assist students with thinking about a subject or topic from jut one point-of-view is by using a thinking tool such as the Six Thinking Hats. The Six Thinking Hats “thinking strategy ” was developed by Edward de Bono (1987). This popular strategy is used to promote parallel thinking and to help students look at a problem or decision from many different perspectives. It is used in education and a variety of industries and businesses for training and decision making. The Six Thinking Hats strategy uses the metaphor of “put on your thinking hat ” to mimic a change of thought processes as one puts on or takes off a hat. Each colored hat represents a specific area to focus on when focus to consider ranging from looking at topic for new ideas, from a neutral and objective perspective, while taking an alternative perspective, with opportunity in mind, while focusing on emotions, or t...|$|R
40|$|Unwarranted {{constraints}} on the admissibility of genetics evidence in death penalty cases can undercut some defendants 2 ̆ 7 efforts to fight their executions. For example, genetics evidence can help validate some traditionally accepted mitigating factors (such as certain psychiatric or behavioral disorders) that can otherwise be difficult for defendants to prove. By imposing unreasonable limitations on genetics arguments, {{the criminal justice system}} may be undermining the very principles and progressive <b>thinking</b> the <b>cap</b> on genetics evidence was originally intended to achieve. Part II of this article briefly reviews the facts and legal arguments in Mobley v. State. Part III addresses the primary issues that concerned the court in Mobley, noting that many of the original reasons for the controversy over the potential use of genetics evidence remain the same as they did in 1994. Part IV discusses the twenty-seven key genetics and crime cases occurring between 1994 and 2004, since Mobley spurred the topical dispute. Part V concludes that, contrary to some commentators 2 ̆ 7 warnings during the first Mobley trial, the last decade has not revealed a legally irresponsible application of genetics factors in criminal cases. Rather, courts continue to regard genetics variables skeptically, and society still embraces the same political and moral concerns over the role of such information.

60|$|Notwithstanding his humble rank, {{there was}} {{something}} in the mien and character of Sergeant Dunham that commanded respect: of a tall, imposing figure, grave and saturnine disposition, and accurate and precise in his acts and manner of <b>thinking,</b> even <b>Cap,</b> dogmatical and supercilious as he usually was with landsmen, did not presume to take the same liberties with the old soldier as he did with his other friends. It was often remarked that Sergeant Dunham received more true respect from Duncan of Lundie, the Scotch laird who commanded the post, than most of the subalterns; for experience and tried services were of quite as much value {{in the eyes of the}} veteran major as birth and money. While the Sergeant never even hoped to rise any higher, he so far respected himself and his present station as always to act in a way to command attention; and the habit of mixing so much with inferiors, whose passions and dispositions he felt it necessary to restrain by distance and dignity, had so far colored his whole deportment, that few were altogether free from its influence. While the captains treated him kindly and as an old comrade, the lieutenants seldom ventured to dissent from his military opinions; and the ensigns, it was remarked, actually manifested a species of respect that amounted to something very like deference. It is no wonder, then, that the announcement of Mabel put a sudden termination to the singular dialogue we have just related, though it had been often observed that the Pathfinder was the only man on that frontier, beneath the condition of a gentleman, who presumed to treat the Sergeant at all as an equal, or even with the cordial familiarity of a friend.|$|R

During this period, Aliyu's friend and superior, Ibrahim Babangida also came under the scrutiny of the NSO, this arose because of a business dealing he and his brother in-law Sunny okogwu were involved in. Babangida and his brother in-law had wanted to set up a military hardware company called 'Black Gold' in Kaduna. The then military governor of the state, Air Vice-Marshal Usman Mu'azu wrote to the Supreme Military Council (SMC) explaining that the project was a national security risk and requested guidance on the matter. The SMC then referred the matter to the NSO for investigation.Rafindadi in his deposition to the Oputa Panel in November 2000 alleged that even before the NSO had commenced their investigations, Babangida brought a letter to the late Major-General Tunde Idiagbon, then chief of staff, Supreme Headquarters. The letter {{was supposed to be a}} clearance letter for the project under investigation purportedly written by the previous DG of the NSO, Umaru Shinkafi. Upon examination by the NSO, it turned out that the letter was actually written during Rafindadi's tenure as DG NSO, the name of the officer that signed the letter was fake and the letter was declared as a forgery.In the [...] "Black Gold" [...] affair, Buhari and Idiagbon had finally found a very good excuse to rid themselves of Babangida, he was slated for retirement and Idiagbon travelled to Mecca for the Hajj. Babangida, sensing the imminent end was left with no choice than to seize the initiative by planning and executing the August 1985 coup. A contemporary account from the Supreme Military Council (SMC) meeting that deliberated on the case was given by Mr. Femi Segun, a protocol officer in the State House at the time. Femi Segun recalls that [...] "...IBB (Ibrahim Babangida) was asked to step out of the meeting which was going on because they wanted to discuss about him.
