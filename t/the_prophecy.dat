5000|$|One {{theory to}} explain the {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>prophecies,</b> put forward by 17th-century French priest and encyclopaedist Louis Moréri, among others, {{is that they were}} spread by supporters of Cardinal Girolamo Simoncelli in support of his bid to become pope during the 1590 conclave to replace Urban VII. In <b>the</b> <b>prophecies,</b> <b>the</b> pope following Urban VII is given the description [...] "Ex antiquitate Urbis" [...] ("from the old city"), and Simoncelli was from Orvieto, which in Latin is Urbevetanum, old city. Moréri and others proposed <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> were created in an unsuccessful attempt to demonstrate that Simoncelli was destined to be pope.|$|R

50|$|Several {{historians have}} {{concluded}} that <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> are a late 16th‑century forgery. Spanish monk and scholar Benito Jerónimo Feijóo y Montenegro wrote in his Teatro Crítico Universal (1724-1739), in an entry called Purported <b>prophecies,</b> that <b>the</b> high level of accuracy of <b>the</b> alleged <b>prophecies</b> up until <b>the</b> date they were published, compared with their high level of inaccuracy after that date, is evidence that they were created {{around the time of}} publication. <b>The</b> <b>prophecies</b> and explanations given in Wion correspond very closely to a 1557 history of the popes by Onofrio Panvinio (including replication of errors made by Panvinio), which may indicate that <b>the</b> <b>prophecies</b> were written based on that source.|$|R

5|$|While Bahá'u'lláh did not himself {{directly}} {{claim to}} be either the Hindu or Buddhist messiah, he did so in principle through his writings. Later, `Abdu'l-Bahá stated that Bahá'u'lláh was the Kalki avatar, who in the classical Hindu Vaishnavas tradition is the tenth and final Avatar (great incarnation) of Vishnu who will come to end The Age of Darkness and Destruction. Bahá'ís also believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the fulfilment of <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> of appearance of the Maitreya Buddha, who is a future Buddha who will eventually appear on earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure Dharma. Bahá'ís believe that <b>the</b> <b>prophecy</b> that Maitreya will usher in a new society of tolerance and love has been fulfilled by Bahá'u'lláh's teachings on world peace. Bahá'u'lláh {{is believed to be}} a descendant of a long line of kings in Persia through Yazdgerd III, the last monarch of the Sasanian Dynasty; he also asserted to be a descendant of Abraham through his third wife Keturah.|$|E

The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where {{he is said to}} have been abbot, was probably that of St Andrews.
