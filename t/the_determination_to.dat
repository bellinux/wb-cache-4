5|$|On the {{question}} of images, Elizabeth's initial reaction was to allow crucifixes and candlesticks and the restoration of roods, {{but some of the}} new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 Edmund Grindal, one of the Marian exiles now made Bishop of London, was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts. Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> prevent any further restoration was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of roods, vestments, stone altars, dooms, statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new Privy Council, removing many Roman Catholic counsellors by doing so. Under Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court greatly diminished. The Act of Supremacy was passed without difficulty.|$|E

25|$|In 1882, Grinnell College {{was struck}} by a tornado — then called a cyclone, after which the college {{yearbook}} was named.

25|$|The human chain {{helped to}} {{publicise}} the Baltic cause {{around the world}} and symbolised solidarity among the Baltic peoples. The positive image of the non-violent Singing Revolution spread among the western media. The activists, including Vytautas Landsbergis, used the increased exposure to position the debate over Baltic independence as a moral, and not just political question: reclaiming independence would be restoration of historical justice and liquidation of Stalinism. It was an emotional event, strengthening <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> seek independence. The protest highlighted that the pro-independence movements, established just a year before, became more assertive and radical: they shifted from demanding greater freedom from Moscow to full independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} of the Rhine, the encirclement and reduction of the Ruhr, and the sweep to the Elbe-Mulde line and the Alps all established the final campaign on the Western Front as a showcase for Allied superiority in maneuver warfare. Drawing on the experience gained during the campaign in Normandy and the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine, the Western Allies demonstrated in Central Europe their capability of absorbing {{the lessons of the}} past. By attaching mechanized infantry units to armored divisions, they created a hybrid of strength and mobility that served them well in the pursuit warfare through Germany. Key to the effort was the logistical support that kept these forces fueled, and <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> maintain the forward momentum at all costs. These mobile forces made great thrusts to isolate pockets of German troops, which were mopped up by additional infantry following close behind. The Allies rapidly eroded any remaining ability to resist.|$|E

25|$|Wakahaguro was {{expected}} to quickly push on to yokozuna promotion, but his second tournament as an ōzeki ended with an extremely disappointing 7–8 record. After this {{it was clear that}} Wakahaguro had neither the consistency nor <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> reach sumo's highest rank, and he was to be overtaken by two younger rivals, Taihō and Kashiwado. In November 1960 Wakahaguro managed to defeat Taihō {{for the first time in}} five attempts but could not prevent him from winning his first championship. Wakahaguro's 12–3 runner-up performance was the last time he was able to challenge for a tournament title. In January 1961 it was Kashiwado's turn to win his first championship, and Wakahaguro could produce only a 10–5 score. After a poor 5–10 record in July 1961 he missed the September tournament through injury. In November 1961, the same tournament in which both Taihō and Kashiwado made their yokozuna debuts, Wakahaguro lost his ōzeki rank after managing only a 5–10 record on his comeback. The rules in place at the time meant three consecutive make-koshi or losing scores would result in demotion, and his absences in September were counted as losses.|$|E
25|$|It was his batting {{that got}} the fans on their feet – not the high scores, but <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> stay and grit it out against the Australians. So, with mentor Alan Knott, Russell turned up early for the second Test at Lord's, and for twenty minutes had the MCC ground staff boys throw plastic balls at him – without Russell batting a stroke, just ducking and diving to miss the short deliveries. That day, he also adopted some {{suitably}} pungent language {{in response to the}} Aussies' sledging, and after he had scored 64 not out, the Aussies never tried it on him again. In the third Test at Edgbaston, he scored 42, the second highest score of the first innings. But his greatest achievement was to come in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, where in the summer of the South African cricket rebels and near-certain defeat, for six hours he held up Aussie celebrations by scoring his highest-ever score in cricket, 128 not out, to almost save the Test for England. It was also his maiden century in all forms of cricket, an achievement only matched by one other Englishman in the twentieth century - Billy Griffith against West Indies in 1947–48 – but it was largely forgotten in the furore of the South African debacle, and the loss of the series. Russell finished the Ashes series as England's third-most-successful batsman, with 314 runs and an average of 39.25.|$|E
25|$|On 28 July the Austro-Hungarians {{declared}} war on Serbia and {{on the next day}} Russia declared a partial mobilization, followed by a general mobilization on 30 July. Germany presented an ultimatum to Russia to demobilise, and when this was refused, {{declared war}} on Russia on 1 August. Being outnumbered on the Eastern Front, Russia urged its Triple Entente ally France to open up a second front in the west. Over forty years earlier in 1870, the Franco-Prussian War had ended the Second French Empire and France had ceded the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to a unified Germany. Bitterness over that defeat and <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> retake Alsace-Lorraine made the acceptance of Russia's plea for help an easy choice, so France began full mobilisation on 1 August and, on 3 August, Germany {{declared war on}} France. The border between France and Germany was heavily fortified on both sides so, according to the Schlieffen Plan, Germany then invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg before moving towards France from the north, leading the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 4 August due to their violation of Belgian neutrality. After the German march on Paris was halted in the Battle of the Marne, {{what became known as the}} Western Front settled into a battle of attrition, with a trench line that changed little until 1917. On the Eastern Front, the Russian army led a successful campaign against the Austro-Hungarians, but the Germans stopped its invasion of East Prussia in the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers, opening fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia and the Sinai. In 1915, Italy joined the Allies and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers; Romania joined the Allies in 1916, as did the United States in 1917.|$|E

During his own journey, Karnabatt described Germany as unified by civic order and <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> win, in several letters that were published by Seara in June 1916. The newspaper's wrong bet on a German victory on the Western Front was strained by Alexis Nour who, in April 1916, wrote that a French capitulation would inevitably follow the Battle of Verdun.|$|E
500|$|The Huguenots {{retreated to}} the {{fortified}} stronghold of La Rochelle on the west coast, where Jeanne d'Albret and her fifteen-year-old son, Henry of Bourbon, joined them. [...] "We have come to <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> die, all of us", Jeanne wrote to Catherine, [...] "rather than abandon our God, and our religion". Catherine called Jeanne, whose decision to rebel posed a dynastic threat to the Valois, [...] "the most shameless woman in the world". Nevertheless, the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.|$|E
500|$|On {{the subject}} of effects, Erickson {{asserted}} that sequences such as the [...] "thuddingly generic, drama-challenged main rocket launch" [...] detract from the human factor of the film. Other design elements were criticised: viewing the costumes as dated, Erickson added that [...] "the actors are defeated by the Barbie doll house surroundings", and suggested that the visuals of Doppelgänger match an ethos of [...] "the future will be a shopping mall". Despite judging Doppelgänger [...] "good" [...] (a rating higher than [...] "fair" [...] but lower than [...] "excellent"), Erickson argued that the opportunities presented by the parallel Earth concept were squandered in <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> turn the production into [...] "an excuse to show cool rocket toys".|$|E

500|$|Magic was a {{controversial}} subject in Shakespeare's day. In Italy in 1600, Giordano Bruno, {{known for his}} occult interests, was burnt at the stake for heresy. Outside the Catholic world, in Protestant England where Shakespeare wrote The Tempest, magic was also taboo; not all [...] "magic", however, was considered evil. Several thinkers took a more rational approach {{to the study of}} the supernatural, with <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> discover the workings of unusual phenomena. The German Henricus Cornelius Agrippa was one such thinker, who published in De Occulta Philosophia (1531, 1533) his observations of [...] "divine" [...] magic. Agrippa's work influenced Dr. John Dee, an Englishman and student of supernatural phenomena. When King James took the throne, Dee found himself under attack for his beliefs, but was able to defend himself successfully by explaining the divine nature of his profession. However, he died in disgrace in 1608.|$|E
500|$|Bader {{was bored}} and {{frustrated}} at {{being left out}} of the major actions in the south. To Bader, it did not make sense for 12 Group to apparently sit idle while 11 Group suffered heavy losses and fought at a numerical disadvantage. Bader advocated scrambling 12 Group fighters as soon as German aircraft were detected forming up over France or Belgium. He asserted 12 Group was quick enough to reach [...] over the Thames Estuary before the enemy reached the area. He planned to use large forces, three to five squadrons to engage the enemy. Should this succeed, 11 Group, following up attacks, might have found broken enemy formations whose crews had lost <b>the</b> <b>determination</b> <b>to</b> press on to their targets. Bader implied that this may reduce the losses of fighter pilots in 11 Group. After the war, Bader insisted that both he and Leigh-Mallory wanted the Big Wing tactic enacted in 12 Group only. They both believed, according to Bader, that it was impractical to use 11 Group as the command was located too close to the enemy and would not have enough time to assemble.|$|E

2500|$|The entire sky is {{slightly}} distorted {{due to the}} gravitational deflection of light caused by the Sun (the anti-Sun direction excepted).
