Contador, who had ridden the last three seasons with Astana, remembered Tiralongo as a friend and a valued support rider, and wanted to do something to thank him for all his hard work done on the Spaniard's behalf. The day was also a good one for Kreuziger, as his eighth place on the day moved him up to seventh overall. Kreuziger was just 16th in the stage 21 time trial in Milan, a poor showing for him. But since José Rujano, the man who had been directly ahead of him in the overall standings, is a vastly inferior time trialist (46th on the day), Kreuziger moved past him to finish the Giro in sixth place overall. While he did fall short of his goal to finish on the podium, Kreuziger nonetheless added another Grand Tour top ten and the best young rider jersey to his palmarès.

This research aims to address this gap by focusing on three questions: 1) What behavioral types are associated with <b>top</b> management <b>support</b> for strategic IS projects? 2) How can these behaviors be placed in a coherent framework? and 3) Why do managers sometimes withhold these types of support? To address these questions, we analyzed <b>top</b> management <b>support</b> during a number of strategic IS implementations. To this end, we used an integrationist model as our theoretical lens.

With 1500 m to go, Contador came out of the trailing group and easily sped past both Rodríguez and Tiralongo. However, upon reaching Tiralongo, he effectively led him out to sprint for the finish. The two shared a few words in the stage's final meters, and for the second time Contador appeared to allow another rider a stage win he could have easily taken himself.

He said that he considers Tiralongo a good friend, and hopes that [...] will sign him once his contract with Astana expires, after the 2011 season. Tiralongo echoed many of these sentiments, recalling that he had spent less time with his family at home than with Contador and Alexander Vinokourov during the 2010 season.

40|$|This PhD project {{examines}} {{the strategy of}} mobilizing motherhood through two Indonesian women’s organizations - the Pembinaan Kesejahteraan Keluarga (Family Welfare Movement, or PKK) and Tim ODHA Perempuan (Seropositive Women’s Team, or <b>TOP</b> <b>Support)</b> - {{in the attempt to}} make prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs more socially acceptable. Motherhood and HIV/AIDS are in fact seen as contradictory concepts. However, at a time when PMTCT programs are being promoted, the image of HIV is changing from the disease of ‘women without morals’ to a disease of devoted housewives, which has resulted in the better acceptance of HIV prevention programs in society. The PKK is a formal government led community organization which is socially and politically structured from the very lowest level in the community up to the national level. The involvement of the PKK in maternal and child health programs has contributed to their image of being good housewives and responsible mothers, which has enabled the cadres to gain trust, especially from husbands, to allow them to bring pregnant women to participate in the mobile VCT service. Unfortunately, PMTCT project is not considered of prime importance for the PKK cadres. The notion of ‘sacred motherhood’ enables <b>TOP</b> <b>Support</b> members to project an image of being devoted wives and mothers who were infected by their badly behaved husbands, and who therefore unfortunately (and unknowingly) transmitted the disease to their children. They rework their identity from one of sinful and immoral women to innocent and devoted mothers, and thus generate trust between other seropositive mothers and within the community. The general lack of experience of severe symptoms and ease of access to medical care explains why <b>TOP</b> <b>Support</b> members do not actively champion PMTCT as part of the women’s reproductive health movement. In their involvement in the PMTCT pilot project, the PKK cadres and <b>TOP</b> <b>Support</b> members are able to convert the social capital derived from respected motherhood into social benefits and opportunities to access economic capital. These economic benefits lead the PKK cadres and <b>TOP</b> <b>Support</b> members to regard PMTCT more as an income generating activity rather than a part of the women’s reproductive health movement. This study suggests that there are significant challenges to the promotion of programs such as PMTCT for women through motherist organizations...|$|E

Horizontal crack height, masonry compressive strength, and diaphragm support stiffness properties are assumed as variables, and sensitivity analyses are performed to study the influence of these parameters on the cracked wall characteristic behavior. The parametric studies show that crack height significantly influences wall stability by affecting both the instability displacement and the wall lateral resistance. The reduction in cracked wall lateral resistance and in the instability displacement caused by finite masonry compressive strength is shown to be significantly amplified by the applied overburden.

40|$|Ice wedges, with tops located 27 to 55 cm {{below the}} ground surface, were studied over several summers between 1998 and 2006 at three sites with differing {{elevations}} in northern Victoria Land, East Antarctica. The thermal regime, based on data‐logger measurements over seven years, exhibits very low temperatures. The inferred absence {{of snow and}} the high temperature gradients, between the ground surface {{and the top of}} ice wedge, may trigger the cracking. A co‐isotopic study of the wedge‐ice oxygen (d 18 O) and hydrogen (dD) isotopic values shows extremely negative deuterium excess (d=dD‐ 8 *d 18 O) values with a strong divergence from the expected precipitation. These values suggest that water vapour condensation and sublimation processes play an important role during the formation of these ground‐ice bodies, particularly at high‐elevation sites. Large temperature gradients between the air/ground and permafrost, thin or absent snow cover, low humidity and open cracks during winter are factors that may control the sublimation processes. In addition, strong katabatic winds acting in the area may enhance sublimation. All these factors explain the less negative ice‐wedge d 18 O values compared with the precipitation and very negative deuterium excess values found at the sites. Observations of hoarfrost crystals in open fractures, even in summer, and frequent temperature inversions between the air/ground interface and ice‐wedge <b>top</b> <b>support</b> the hypothesis that condensation and sublimation are important processes in ice‐wedge formation.

40|$|Nowadays, {{with the}} rapid {{development}} of high rise building, larger size and span concrete structures are required. Wall panel is a structural element that considered as a vertical load bearing member that carries weight from the roof to the ground floor and to the foundation. A lower density from lightweight concrete decreases {{the weight of the}} building. However, lightweight concrete having a lower module of elasticity has a faster rate of crack development in reinforced concrete members. By adding steel fibre, it will reduce the macro-cracking. The strength and behavior of steel fibre lightweight concrete, the ultimate load and crack pattern are investigated. This research was using sample size with constant on the height and thickness that is 600 mm and 40 mm respectively to give the constant slenderness ratio (SR= 15). The length was varies from 320 mm, 400 mm, 560 mm and 800 mm provide the range of aspect ratio (AR = 1. 875, 1. 5, 1. 07 and 0. 75). Use 0. 5 % steel fibre of 35 mm length with 0. 55 mm diameter and 30 % Expanded Polystyrene (EPS). From this research, it has been found that the maximum deflection occurs at the wall panel with AR 0. 75 that is 8. 28 mm with an average ultimate load of 127. 78 kN. The maximum lateral displacement for four (4) wall panels occured at the 0. 5 wall height (0. 5 H) of wall panel that is at 300 mm height. Maximum crack length for each wall panels SFLWC- 1 crack length is 30 cm at front, SFLWC- 2 crack length is 25 cm at rear, SFLWC- 3 crack length is 30 cm at rear and SFLWC- 4 crack length is 55 cm at front. The crack pattern from this study shows a concrete crushing at {{the top and bottom of}} the wall panels. This shows that the failure at <b>top</b> <b>support</b> was due to applied load and at bottom end was due to support condition. Besides that, the panel with the low aspect ratio tends to fail by crushing, while a panel with high aspect ratio tends to fail by buckling. It concluded the strength and behavior of steel fibre lightweight concrete wall panel under one way in plane action has been revealed by determination of ultimate load, deflection profile, crack patterns, crack loading, failure modes, deformation profile and stress strain relationship as discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{strategic}} use {{of information}} systems (IS) has become a vital aspect of business strategy. Companies have tried to differentiate themselves based on their use and adaptation of new technology. To accomplish this, <b>top</b> management <b>support</b> has {{become an integral part}} of the IS function. The literature has conceptually supported this notion, but empirical evidence has been lacking. This paper develops a framework for the <b>support</b> from <b>top</b> management (TMS Model) as well as empirically tests the relationship between <b>top</b> management <b>support,</b> the IS function, and IS performance with structural equation modeling, with the results supporting the direct and indirect relationship of <b>top</b> management <b>support</b> and IS performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Top</b> {{management}} <b>support</b> {{has long}} been conceivable as an important factor {{for the success of}} IS projects. Due to the hierarchical nature of an organization, a cross-level interaction can occur among nested levels. Thus, using inappropriate statistical analysis can cause misleading results and lost of information. This study provides two contributions to the IS research. First, Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to explain the cross-level interaction between organizational level and industry level. Second, unlike other studies focusing on an organizational level, this study considers <b>top</b> management <b>support</b> at the industry level and examines the mediating role of <b>top</b> management <b>support</b> between the two levels...|$|R

Brick partitions are pierced with rounded arches, and large brick piers with corbeled <b>tops</b> <b>support</b> the ceiling. The walls are decorated with student artwork. The cooking facilities, sink and bathroom stalls are all original. The original 1894 Gurney furnace remains in operation to supplement the modern furnace.|$|R
