40|$|Low {{electrode}} wear EDM {{is attained}} by the adhesion of heat resolved carbon made from kerosine type machining fluid to the electrode end surface. This phenomenon, however, occurs only under long pulse duration. Therefore, the low electrode wear EDM <b>under</b> <b>finishing</b> condition is impossible so far. In the previous paper, the authors developed a turbostratic carbon electrode whose structure {{is very similar}} to the heat resolved carbon generated in EDM process and {{made it clear that the}} low electrode wear EDM was possible by using the electrode even <b>under</b> <b>finishing</b> condition. In this study, a carbon coated electrode and a SiC coated one which can be made rapidly at low cost were developed and their EDM characteristics were investigated.

50|$|To {{manufacture}} goldbeater's skin, the gut of oxen (or other cattle) is {{soaked in}} a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide, washed, stretched, beaten flat and thin, and treated chemically to prevent putrefaction.

5000|$|Mechanical {{distension}} {{and rapidly}} developing {{areas of the}} body during pregnancy (such as the abdomen, breasts, and thighs) are most commonly associated with striae formation. Some have suggested that relaxin and estrogen combined {{with higher levels of}} cortisol during pregnancy can cause an accumulation of muocopolysaccharides, which increases water absorption of connective tissue, making it prime for <b>tearing</b> <b>under</b> mechanical stress. [...] There also seems to be an association between higher body mass indices and in women with bigger babies and the incidence and severity of striae. Also, younger women seem to be at higher risk of developing striae during pregnancy.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn geology textbooks, {{the fate}} of the oceanic crust seems straightforward. The ocean floor is created by {{upwelling}} of lighter magma at spreading ridges. The magma cools as it moves away from the ridge, forming a stiff layer or "plate" called the oceanic lithosphere. Having increased in density, it then descends back into the mantle in trench regions. Precise seismic tomography studies have revealed that many descending slabs have a more complex evolution and have developed tears, detached from the surface plate, or even broken up into fragments. On page 1173 of this issue, Obayashi et al. (1) not only show clear tomographic evidence {{for the development of a}} vertical <b>tear</b> <b>under</b> southwest Japan, but have also found evidence for ongoing plate rupturing. The authors correlated the images directly with measurements of stress revealed by active seismic sources...|$|R

30|$|In a {{clinical}} setting, the meniscal repair is generally performed for an unstable and large tear using multiple sutures. Henning recommended that {{three to four}} sutures should {{be placed in the}} posterior third of the medial meniscus (Henning et al. 1998). However, there have been no biomechanical reports on the effect of multiple sutures. In this study, {{there were no significant differences}} of widening after cyclic loading with either technique. Thus, both single and double suture could stabilize the meniscal tear with small stress under this cyclic loading condition. On the other hand, as the double sutures presented significantly higher ultimate failure load and stiffness than the single suture, double sutures might be more suitable for the stabilizing meniscal <b>tear</b> <b>under</b> a weight bearing condition. Therefore, we consider that multiple sutures are desired when the meniscal repair is required for an unstable large tear.|$|R
