NDE techniques can significantly increase the accuracy of grading of wood compared to visual grading methods. Longitudinal stress wave and transverse vibration nondestructive evaluation techniques have proven to be accurate means of evaluating the quality of wood-based products. Researchers have found strong relationships between stress wave and transverse vibration parameters (e. g., wave velocity and predicted modulus of elasticity) with the actual static bending properties (e. g., modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture) of dry as well as green wood-based materials [1 – 3]. Therefore, these NDE techniques can be used <b>to</b> <b>presort</b> or grade structural wood prior to drying. Discarding wood with inferior properties prior to drying can result in significant cost savings in the drying process...|$|E

Our algorithm uses a plane sweep <b>to</b> <b>presort</b> the segments; then it operates {{on a list}} of slabs that efficiently stores a single level of a segment tree. With no dynamic memory allocation, low pointer overhead, and mostly sequential memory reference, our algorithm performs well even with inadequate physical memory. 1 Introduction Geographic information systems frequently organize map data into various layers. Users can make custom maps by overlaying roads, political boundaries, soil types, or whatever features are of interest to them. The ARC/INFO system [8] is organized around this model; even a relatively inexpensive database like the Digital Chart of the World [9] contains seventeen layers, several with sublayers.

When store deliveries arrive at the receiving area, they are unloaded and brought <b>to</b> a <b>presorting</b> area, where they are sorted by category prior to actual shelf replenishment, and finally brought to the showroom to a central category location (cf. Kotzab and Teller 2005). From there, the actual shelf replenishment starts. This implies that a pallet, roll cage or other means of transport is placed at this central category location, from which stock clerks take individual items and transport them to the shelves.|$|R

40|$|Column-stores gained {{popularity}} as {{a promising}} physical de-sign alternative. Each attribute of a relation is physically stored {{as a separate}} column allowing queries to load only the required attributes. The overhead incurred is on-the-fly tuple reconstruction for multi-attribute queries. Each tu-ple reconstruction is a join of two columns based on tuple IDs, making it a significant cost component. The ultimate physical design is <b>to</b> have multiple <b>presorted</b> copies of each base table such that tuples are already appropriately orga-nized in multiple different orders across the various columns. This requires the ability to predict the workload, idle time to prepare, and infrequent updates. In this paper, we propose a novel design, partial side-ways cracking, that minimizes the tuple reconstruction cost in a self-organizing way. It achieves performance similar <b>to</b> using <b>presorted</b> data, but without requiring the heavy initial presorting step itself. Instead, it handles dynamic, unpredictable workloads with no idle time and frequent up-dates. Auxiliary dynamic data structures, called cracker maps, provide a direct mapping between pairs of attributes used together in queries for tuple reconstruction. A map is continuously physically reorganized {{as an integral part}} of query evaluation, providing faster and reduced data access for future queries. To enable flexible and self-organizing be-havior in storage-limited environments, maps are material-ized only partially as demanded by the workload. Each map is a collection of separate chunks that are individually reor-ganized, dropped or recreated as needed. We implemented partial sideways cracking in an open-source column-store. A detailed experimental analysis demonstrates that it brings significant performance benefits for multi-attribute queries...|$|R
40|$|Powders of {{synthetic}} diamond with low strength were sorted on sets {{with a different}} grain size. The synthetic diamond sets had various crushing strengths and morphology. They were irradiated with high energy electrons (6. 5 MeV, D = 2 × 1019 cm− 2) and analyzed using X-ray diffraction (Cu Kα) before and after irradiation. As es-tablished from nonlinearity of the a(Θ) = f{R(Θ) } dependences and observed extra splittings in X-ray diffraction patterns (in addition to α 1 -α 2 doublets), crystal lattice {{of synthetic}} diamond from different sets was variously distorted. Irradiation led to decreasing distortions more significantly, the higher the initial strength of the set was. The made conclusions coincide well with our previous results on synthetic diamond powders which were irradiated under various softer conditions with direct measurements of synthetic diamond crushing strength without X-ray diffraction analysis. X-ray diffraction allows <b>to</b> <b>presort</b> synthetic diamond of critically low relative mechanical strength as well as evaluate resistance of diamond crystal lattice against heavy irradiation and other external impacts...|$|E

Potential decision rules include elimination by aspects, acceptance by aspects, lexicographic by features, and a mixed-rule lexicographic by aspects (LBA) that nests the other rules. We provide a dynamic program that makes estimation practical for a moderately large numbers of aspects. We test greedoid methods with applications to SmartPhones (339 respondents, both full-rank and consider-then-rank data) and computers (201 respondents from Lenk et al. 1996). We compare LBA to two compensatory benchmarks: hierarchical Bayes ranked logit (HBRL) and LINMAP. For each benchmark, we consider an uncon-strained model and a model constrained so that aspects are truly compensatory. For both data sets, LBA predicts (new task) holdouts at least as well as compensatory methods {{for the majority of}} the respondents. LBAâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s relative predictive ability increases (ranks and choices) if the task is full rank rather than consider then rank. LBAâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s relative predictive ability does not change if (1) we allow respondents <b>to</b> <b>presort</b> profiles, or (2) we increase the number of profiles in a consider-then-rank task from 16 to 32.

40|$|Abstract: Column-oriented {{database}} {{has gained}} popularity as “Data Warehousing ” data and performance issues for “Analytical Queries ” have increased. Each attribute of a relation is physically stored {{as a separate}} column, which will help analytical queries to work fast. The overhead is incurred in tuple reconstruction for multi attribute queries. Each tuple reconstruction is joining of two columns based on tuple IDs, making it significant cost component. For reducing cost, physical design have multiple presorted copies of each base table, such that tuples are already appropriately organized in different orders across the various columns. This paper proposes a novel design, called partitioning, that minimizes the tuple reconstruction cost. It achieves performance similar <b>to</b> using <b>presorted</b> data, but without requiring the heavy initial presorting step. In addition, it handles dynamic, unpredictable workloads with no idle time and frequent updates. Partitioning provides the direct loading of the data in respective partitions. Partitions are created on the fly and depend on distribution of data, which will work nicely in limited storage space environments...|$|R

We propose a double sampling approach, {{in which a}} large set of traps is used in each stand to estimate total litterfall, and only a subset of these traps is sorted to the relevant components. We examine its feasibility using data from a regional litterfall study of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.), in which the variables of interest were biomass of foliar litterfall from pine and nitrogen content of foliar litterfall from all vegetation. Double sampling was more efficient than simple random sampling but only if every trap received a rapid <b>presorting</b> <b>to</b> remove twigs and cones. The optimal strategy when pine foliar litterfall biomass was the target variable was to conduct full sorting on 33 % of the traps. When foliar litterfall N was the target, sorting only 20 % of the traps was optimal. Holding time costs constant, the variance of estimated pine foliar litterfall biomass could be reduced by 18 %, whereas that for foliar litterfall N could be reduced by 49 %. Alternately, when variance was held constant, the time cost could be reduced by 17 % for pine foliar litterfall biomass or 44 % for foliar litterfall N...|$|R
40|$|Xenopus oocytes {{provide an}} {{excellent}} model system {{for understanding the}} cis-elements and protein factors that carry out mRNA localization in vertebrate cells. More than 20 mRNAs have been identified that localize to the vegetal cortex during stages II–IV of oogenesis. The earliest localizing RNAs are <b>presorted</b> <b>to</b> a subcellular structure, the Balbiani body (also called the mitochondrial cloud in Xenopus), of stage I oocytes prior to entering the vegetal cortex. While some evidence has suggested that diffusion drives RNA localization to the Balbiani body, a role for temperature and metabolic energy in this process has not been explored. To address this issue, we developed a quantitative assay to monitor RNA localization in stage I oocytes. Here we show {{that the rate of}} RNA accumulation to the Balbiani body is highly dependent on temperature and the intracellular concentration of ATP. In fact, while ATP depletion severely impairs RNA localization, increasing the intracellular concentration of ATP by a factor of two doubles the localization rate, indicating that ATP is limiting under normal conditions. We also show that RNA localization in stage I oocytes is reduced by inhibition of kinesin II, and that the Xcat- 2 RNA localization element recruits kinesin II to the Balbiani body. We conclude from these studies that the energy state of the cell regulates the rate of RNA localization to the Balbiani body and that this process, at least to some extent, involves kinesin II...|$|R

We asked whether these two nominal species can be unambiguously distinguished based on shell morphology or whether the taxonomic discrepancy inferred from these character types was reflected in the variation of shell morphology. Our investigations were based on phylogenetic analyses of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, geometric morphometric analyses as well as micro computer tomography. The species <b>presorted</b> <b>to</b> morphospecies by eye overlapped in shell shape. However, statistically, all shells were correctly assigned, but not all of them significantly. Qualitatively, both nominal species can be unambiguously distinguished by the presence/absence of a prominent denticle within the shell. In the phylogenetic analyses, individuals from three populations clustered with the “wrong” morphospecies. In the absence of data from multiple loci, it was assumed for the single specimen from one of these populations that its misplacement was due to a recent hybridization event, based on its very shallow position in the tree. For the other two cases of misplacement neither introgression nor incomplete lineage sorting could be ruled out. Further investigations have to show whether the morphological overlap has a genetic basis or is due to phenotypic plasticity. In conclusion, despite their partly unresolved relationships H. cockerelli and H. fabrorum may be considered sister species, which are reliably diagnosable by {{the presence or absence of}} the denticle, but have not yet fully differentiated in all character complexes investigated...|$|R
