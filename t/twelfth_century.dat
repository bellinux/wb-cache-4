5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century,</b> Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E

5|$|The ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}} {{within the}} kingdom of Somairle's predecessors was the far-flung Diocese of the Isles. Little is known of its early history, although its origins may well lie with the Uí Ímair imperium. In the mid <b>twelfth</b> <b>century,</b> {{during the reign of}} Ragnall's maternal uncle Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles (died 1187), the diocese came to be incorporated into the newly established Norwegian Archdiocese of Nidaros. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Isles—its territorial borders and nominal subjection to Norwayappears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles. Before the close of the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century,</b> however, evidence of a new ecclesiastical jurisdictionthe Diocese of Argyllbegins to emerge during ongoing contentions between the meic Somairle and the Crovan dynasty.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, is debatable. The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E

5|$|Architectural {{evidence}} suggests that, while the Romanesque style peaked {{in much of}} Europe in the later eleventh and early <b>twelfth</b> <b>century,</b> it was still reaching Scotland {{in the second half}} of the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century</b> and was revived in the late fifteenth century, perhaps as a reaction to the English perpendicular style that had come to dominate. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork and has not survived the impact of time and the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, a small number of significant crafted items have also survived and, for the end of the period, there is evidence of painting, particularly the extensive commissioning of works in the Low Countries and France.|$|E
5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The East Angles formed one of {{the seven}} kingdoms known to post-mediaeval historians as the Heptarchy, a scheme used by Henry of Huntingdon in the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> Some modern historians have {{questioned}} whether seven independent kingdoms ever really existed contemporaneously, and claim that the political situation was much more complicated.|$|E

5|$|The {{new wealth}} being {{generated}} {{during this period}} had {{a positive impact on}} Byzantine cultural life.

5|$|Ascall's {{father was}} Ragnall mac Torcaill (died 1146), {{a man who}} may well have ruled as King of Dublin. The men {{were members of the}} Meic Torcaill, a {{substantial}} landholding kindred in the kingdom. Several members of this Norse-Gaelic family held the kingship in the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century.</b> One such man was Ascall's uncle, Brodar mac Torcaill, King of Dublin, who was slain in 1160.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the <b>twelfth</b> <b>century</b> and 1410.
