5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they encountered the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E

5|$|Heroes of Mana {{opens with}} a {{reconnaissance}} mission {{by a group of}} soldiers from Pedda into the beastman kingdom of Ferolia. The group, including the soldier Roget and his captain Yerchael, are on their airship, the Nightswan, when they are shot down by Ferolian ships. After crash-landing in a forest and getting separated, Roget and Yurchael fight their way back {{to the rest of the}} group through the Ferolian army before running into the Peddan military. The Peddans claim not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> group and attack them; after fleeing Roget and Yurchael discover that Pedda is invading Ferolia, and attacking peaceful villages as they do. Unable to support the invasion, the group rebels against Pedda and joins forces with the Ferolians.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} difficult for any scholar {{to construct a}} portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond {{the basic elements of}} his life. On the other hand, scholars such as N. T.

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} kinds of loops, such as the while-loop, the for-loop is often {{distinguished}} by an explicit loop counter or loop variable. This allows {{the body of the}} for-loop (the code that is being repeatedly executed) <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sequencing of each iteration. For-loops are also typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. For-loops are the shorthand way to make loops when the number of iterations is known, as every for-loop could be written as a while-loop.|$|E

Eight hundred European musketmen, with {{an unknown number of}} Bandanese, occupied the trenches on the high ground under the command of Commodore Willem Jacobz Coster and Master of the Field Andriao Cornelio.|$|E

25|$|Huygens {{wrote that}} {{availability}} {{of water in}} liquid form was essential for life and that the properties of water must vary from planet to planet to suit the temperature range. He took his observations of dark and bright spots on the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter to be evidence of water and ice on those planets. He argued that extraterrestrial life is neither confirmed nor denied by the Bible, and questioned why God would create the other planets {{if they were not}} to serve a greater purpose than that of being admired from Earth. Huygens postulated that the great distance between the planets signified that God had not intended for beings on one <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> beings on the others, and had not foreseen how much humans would advance in scientific knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E
25|$|Stability of {{nanoparticle}} agglomerates {{is critical}} for estimating size distribution of aerosolized particles from nano-powders or other sources. At nanotechnology workplaces, workers can be exposed via inhalation to potentially toxic substances during handling and processing of nanomaterials. Nanoparticles in the air often form agglomerates due to attractive inter-particle forces, such as van der Waals force or electrostatic force if the particles are charged. As a result, aerosol particles are usually observed as agglomerates rather than individual particles. For exposure and risk assessments of airborne nanoparticles, it is important <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> size distribution of aerosols. When inhaled by humans, particles with different diameters are deposited in varied locations of the central and periphery respiratory system. Particles in nanoscale {{have been shown to}} penetrate the air-blood barrier in lungs and be translocated into secondary organs in the human body, such as the brain, heart and liver. Therefore, the knowledge on stability of nanoparticle agglomerates is important for predicting the size of aerosol particles, which helps assess the potential risk of them to human bodies.|$|E

The waste generated in the process of manufacturing the Somras was dumped in the Tsangpo river, which flows through Branga territory as Brahmaputra, and resulted in their disastrous plague. Also the birth of Naga babies was credited to Somras as it results in the multiplication of cells at a very high rate which lead to their deformation and outgrowths.|$|E
