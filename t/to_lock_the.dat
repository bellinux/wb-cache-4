5|$|A {{flat-bottomed}} design {{made her}} well-suited to sailing in shallow waters and {{allowed her to}} be beached for loading and unloading of cargo and for basic repairs without requiring a dry dock. Her hull, internal floors, and futtocks were built from traditional white oak, her keel and stern post from elm, and her masts from pine and fir. Plans of the ship also show a double keelson <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> keel, floors and frames in place.|$|E

5|$|Locking {{multiple}} variables using non-atomic locks {{introduces the}} possibility of program deadlock. An atomic lock locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> same two variables using non-atomic locks, {{it is possible that}} one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.|$|E
5|$|Otway {{launched}} the assault {{as soon as}} the first glider overshot the battery, ordering the explosives to be detonated to form two paths through the outer perimeter through which the paratroopers attacked. The defenders were alerted by the explosions, and opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties; only four attackers survived to reach Casemate Four, which they disabled by firing into apertures and throwing grenades into air vents. The other casemates were cleared with fragmentation and white phosphorus grenades, as the crews had neglected <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> doors leading into the battery. During the bombing raid, the battery's guns had been moved inside the casemates and the steel doors left open for ventilation. During the battle, 22 Germans were killed and a similar number made prisoners of war. The rest of the garrison escaped undetected by hiding in the underground bunkers.|$|E
5|$|Sora, Donald and Goofy battle Ansem {{outside the}} door to Kingdom Hearts, which Ansem {{believes}} {{to be the ultimate}} reservoir of darkness. Upon opening the door, however, it reveals its light, overwhelming and destroying Ansem. Beyond the door are King Mickey and Riku, and they help Sora and the others close the door, as there are many Heartless beyond it. Mickey and Sora use their Keyblades <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> door. The worlds lost to the Heartless reconstruct themselves; as the Destiny Islands reform, Kairi returns there while Sora is forced to part with her. The game concludes as Sora, Donald, and Goofy resolve to find Riku and Mickey.|$|E

5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Nhu {{began work}} on the ambitious Strategic Hamlet Program, an attempt to build {{fortified}} villages that would be secure zones for rural Vietnamese. The objective was <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> Vietcong out {{so that they could}} not operate among the villagers. Thảo supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts that they were forced to build, he advised Nhu and Tuyến that it was imperative to build as many hamlets as fast as possible. This pleased the Vietcong, who felt that Thảo's efforts were turning the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo specifically had villages built in areas that he knew had a strong Vietcong presence. This increased the number of communist sympathisers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Vietcong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay {{and decides to}} stick around after he thinks it is a {{familiar}} setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with this and they become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they heard so much about whilst growing up.|$|E

30|$|The IR laser can be <b>locked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high-finesse IR cavity {{by using}} {{standard}} Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking techniques [83, 84]. Since the other optical modes for intra-cavity cooling in the high-finesse IR cavity are derived via EOMs and AOMs from the fundamental laser mode (see Section  7.2. 3), they also follow any {{changes of the}} cavity resonance frequency. In addition, these higher-order modes can in turn be <b>locked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cavity via PDH locking. We will also use an EOM to generate a mode <b>to</b> be <b>locked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IR + UV cavity. To this end, each of <b>the</b> modes <b>to</b> be <b>locked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cavities will separately be frequency modulated in the MHz range {{to allow for the}} generation of distinct PDH error signals from the light reflected from the cavity.|$|R

5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E
5|$|Angered by the situation, {{the group}} and their {{supporters}} decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister {{is reported to have}} been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, the five of them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight. The first to be shot is Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable to control his anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan.|$|E
5|$|Around Playford, much {{activity}} was occurring. Legislation {{provided for the}} tools {{that he was to}} inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation. The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times, and as an agriculture-dominant state, had been at the mercy of commodity prices, so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians, public servants and industrialists. The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 single-member districts—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Over the next three decades, Adelaide's population grew until it had triple the population of the country, but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six. The desired long-term effect was <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the 1938 election. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the electoral system gerrymander was later christened the 'Playmander', {{as a result of its}} benefit to Playford, and his failure to take action towards reforming it.|$|E

5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the uneven ground during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> <b>the</b> frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E
