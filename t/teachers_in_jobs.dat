40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThis dissertation considers how the Child Development Group of Mississippi (CDGM), a statewide, federally sponsored Head Start program, produced a political battle between poor black mothers and grandmothers and white southern Congressmen. Between 1965 and 1968, Mississippi's black working-class participants collaborated {{with the federal government}} to seek bottom-up change in the most repressive state in the country. They moved beyond teaching shapes and colors to challenge the state's closed political system and white supremacist ideology. Black women who had previously worked as sharecroppers and domestics now had significantly higher salaries as preschool <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> that provided them with the financial freedom to vote and send their children to previously all-white schools. Their challenge antagonized the local white power structure and provoked opposition that significantly diminished the transformative possibilities of Head Start and other War on Poverty programs. For a significant number of black women in rural Mississippi, Head Start offered the only viable employment in a state that systematically denied most of them education and held many of them hostage in menial labor positions. In the process of preparing children for first grade, black women began to think differently about themselves and the opportunities available to them. Beyond earning higher wages than any they had ever received, for example, participation also prompted many CDGM women to return to school and obtain an education denied them earlier in life. In response, the state's white power structure led a pitched attack on CDGM. Its members recognized that if former sharecroppers could teach and run centers, they could also run towns and make decisions for themselves. The program's end, despite its unparalleled successes, demonstrated that political exigencies in Washington would continue to limit black attempts at achieving full citizenship in the Deep South...|$|E

Um estudo censitário de corte {{transversal}} investigou 4. 496 professores da rede municipal de ensino infantil e fundamental de Salvador, Bahia, Brasil. Informações sobre queixas de dor musculoesquelética em membros superiores, membros inferiores e dorso (variáveis dependentes), categorias do Modelo Demanda-Controle (variáveis independentes) e covariáveis foram coletadas num questionário padronizado autoaplicável. Análises de regressão logística multivariada revelaram que professores com trabalho de alta exigência apresentaram prevalência de DME mais elevada e professores em baixa exigência, prevalência mais baixa, em cada um dos três segmentos corporais estudados. Professores em trabalho ativo apresentaram prevalência de DME mais elevada do que professores em trabalho de baixa exigência, em membros superiores e dorso. Maiores taxas de prevalência de DME associaram-se à maior demanda psicológica nos três segmentos corporais e ao baixo controle sobre o trabalho em membros superiores, apenas.

When the teachers, who had been working for over a year without a contract, did provide strike notice in September 2005, the provincial government immediately extended, by legislation, the last contract to June 2006 and made a potential strike illegal.

40|$|Abstract: Job {{crafting}} {{refers to}} the process of shaping one’s job characteristics to bring about greater satisfaction, engagement, and meaningfulness. Teachers need to craft their work continuously to effectively deal with the highly complex and demanding nature of their work. The study’s aim was to investigate the relationship between job crafting and subjective well-being amongst South African high school teachers, where subjective well-being comprised psychological meaningfulness and work engagement. The potential mediating effect that psychological meaningfulness had on the relationship between job crafting and work engagement amongst teachers was further explored. Using random sampling, a quantitative, cross-sectional survey design was used and administered to a sample of South African <b>teachers</b> situated <b>in</b> the Gauteng province (N = 251). The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES- 9 item), the Psychological Meaningfulness Scale (PMS), and the Job Crafting Scale (JCS) were employed. Structural equation modelling was utilised to assess the interrelationships between the main research constructs. In addition, standardised regression was used to test the mediating role of psychological meaningfulness. Results confirmed a positive relationship between job crafting, psychological meaningfulness, and work engagement. Furthermore, psychological meaningfulness mediated the relationship between job crafting and work engagement.
