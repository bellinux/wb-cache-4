5|$|The Three Witches of Macbeth have {{inspired}} several painters {{over the years}} who have sought to capture the supernatural darkness surrounding Macbeth's encounters with them. For example, by the eighteenth century, belief in witches had waned in the United Kingdom. Such things {{were thought to be}} the simple stories of foreigners, farmers, and superstitious Catholics. However art depicting supernatural subjects was very popular. John Runciman, {{as one of the first}} artists to use Shakespearean characters in his work, created an ink-on-paper drawing entitled The Three Witches in 1767–68. In it, three ancient figures are shown in close consultation, their heads together and their bodies unshown. Runciman's brother created another drawing of the witches called The Witches show Macbeth The Apparitions painted circa 1771–1772, portraying Macbeth's reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witches' conjured vision. Both brothers' work influenced many later artists by removing the characters from the familiar theatrical setting and placing them in the world of the story.|$|E

He then {{served in the}} German {{delegation}} to the Paris Peace Conference and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the Weimar Constitution. Motivated by {{his understanding of the}} American model, he advocated a strong, popularly elected presidency as a constitutional counterbalance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional bureaucracy. More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution. These provisions were later used by Adolf Hitler to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.|$|E

40|$|A burning peat {{site in the}} Po Valley (Italy) {{has been}} {{investigated}} for the first time. Beyond {{the smoke from the}} smoldering combustion of peat, there are carbonatic concretions and huge amounts of methane in the soil (> 60 % by vol.), leading <b>to</b> fluxes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of the order <b>of</b> 10 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> 2 / 10 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> 3 mg m <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> - 2 d <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> - 1. A wide range of analyses (gas composition, stable isotopes of CH 4 and CaCO 3, methane radiocarbon) were performed in order to understand whether methane is produced by peat layers or seeps from deeper natural gas reservoirs. The quasi-fossil character of CH 4, methane-derived carbonates, methane-stable isotopic compositions related to marine carbonates reduction, the presence of helium, and a fault corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> burning site all converge <b>to</b> indicate that <b>the</b> major part of the methane ascends from deep horizons. Such methane seepage is likely <b>to</b> feed <b>the</b> peat combustion, explaining the observed phenomena and the large outbursts of historical gas-emission events...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthetic {{bacteria}} in Burton Lake, a seasonally tidal, meromictic lake of maximum depth 18 m, {{located in the}} Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, were studied throughout 1983. The dominant species were Chlorobium vibrioforme and Chlorobium limicola (up to 5. 4 X 10 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> 6 cells ml to <b>power</b> <b>of</b> ml minus 1) and minor species were Thiocapsa roseopersicina (< 1. 25 X 10 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> 5 cells ml <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> minus 1) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (< 100 cells ml minus 1). The Chlorobium spp. and T. roseopersicina were found throughout the anoxic water, which ranged in temperature from - 0. 5 C to - 2. 2 C, but did not form discrete layers at the O 2 and H 2 S interface. The growth zone, however, of the Chlorobium spp. was delineated {{by the presence of}} light and H 2 S and was restricted to less than 3 m below the O 2 and H 2 S interface.

25|$|Although Henry {{was by far}} {{the more}} {{powerful}} and dramatic speaker, Madison successfully matched him. Madison's expertise on the subject he had long argued for allowed him to respond with rational arguments to Henry's emotional appeals. Madison persuaded prominent figures such as Edmund Randolph, who had refused to endorse the constitution at the convention, to change their position and support it at the ratifying convention. Randolph's switch likely changed the votes of several more anti-federalists. When the vote was nearing, and the constitution appeared headed for defeat, Madison pleaded {{with a small group of}} anti-federalists, and promised them that, if they changed their votes, he would later push for a bill of rights to provide limits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new government.|$|E
25|$|The Caribbean {{islands and}} early Spanish explorations around the circum-Caribbean region {{had not been}} of major political, strategic, or {{financial}} importance until the conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521. However, important precedents of exploration, conquest, and settlement and crown rule had been initially worked out in the Caribbean, which long affected subsequent regions, including Mexico and Peru. The indigenous societies of Mesoamerica brought under Spanish control were of unprecedented complexity and wealth from what they had encountered in the Caribbean. This presented both an important opportunity and a potential threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown of Castile, since the conquerors were acting independent of effective crown control. The societies could provide the conquistadors, especially Hernán Cortés, a base from which the conquerors could become autonomous, or even independent, of the Crown.|$|E

25|$|Bored {{with the}} {{inactivity}} {{of the new}} U.S. Senate, Burr ran for and {{was elected to the}} New York State Assembly, serving from 1798 through 1799. During this time, he cooperated with the Holland Land Company in gaining passage of a law to permit aliens to hold and convey lands. During John Adams' term as president, national parties became clearly defined. Burr loosely associated with the Democratic-Republicans, though he had moderate Federalist allies, such as Sen. Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey. Burr quickly became a key player in New York politics, more powerful in time than Hamilton. This was due largely <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tammany Society, later to become the infamous Tammany Hall. Burr converted it from a social club into a political machine, particularly in populous New York City, to help Jefferson reach the presidency.|$|E
25|$|The British in {{practice}} preferred inaction, although it enabled Russian expansionism until the Anglo-Russian Convention (Anglo-Russian Entente) of 1907. The Russian sphere ran from Meshed {{in the east}} to Tabriz {{in the west and}} as far south as Teheran and the British sphere ran west of the North-West Frontier of India and the Afghan border, west to the vicinity of Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf. Only the Ottoman Empire remained as a possible field for German diplomatic and economic influence. Traditional Ottoman hostility to Iran on religious grounds meant that the Pan-Islamism of Sultan Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire failed to gain much of a following in Iran, until the Young Persians took it up as a political tool. The Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire evolved into Pan-Turanists, seeking to renew the Ottoman Empire by expanding into Trans-Caucasia, Turkestan and at least the north-west of Iran. By 1914 little attention had been paid to the Pan-Turanists, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire; Ottoman encroachments on Iran were seen as defensive moves against Russia.|$|E
25|$|The Duchy of Lancaster, {{like the}} Crown, {{was no longer}} a {{distinct}} force in Derbyshire, so the immensely rich Cromwell, with a base in the east of the county, was a useful counterweight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greys and Staffords. Cromwell was a prominent member of the royal household and one of the dominant small nucleus in the council. Cokayne allowed himself to be drawn into the complex property deals and lawsuits of Cromwell and his circle. One of Cokayne's services was to pledge support for Cromwell's prosecution of John Grey, Baron Grey of Codnor, over his claim to the manor of Crich in Derbyshire. This took place in 1430 but is known from a long and complicated exemplification obtained by Cromwell in 1433, which shows the breadth of his dealings in the region, with numerous Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire estates claimed by himself or his representatives. Cromwell had obtained judgement against Grey the previous summer but when he launched his prosecution, with the support of Cokayne and his own lawyers, he was still having difficulty in actually gaining possession of Crich.|$|E

25|$|Light exerts {{physical}} {{pressure on}} objects in its path, a phenomenon {{which can be}} deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> light beam divided by c, the speed of light. Due to the magnitude of c, the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects. For example, a one-milliwatt laser pointer exerts a force of about 3.3 piconewtons on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a U.S. penny with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers. However, in nanometre-scale applications such as nanoelectromechanical systems (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research. At larger scales, light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster, acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a windmill. The possibility of making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.|$|E
