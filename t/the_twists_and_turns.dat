In the early spring of 1793, news of the trial and {{execution}} of Louis XVI reached the islands. All royal symbols were subsequently removed from Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

25|$|Gabriel was devotedly in love, but {{he could}} not marry his {{mistress}} because the Romanov's family status forbade any morganatic union. He appealed to his aunt, Olga, Queen of the Hellenes, to intercede on his behalf, and she went to see Nicholas II requesting permission for his nephew to marry, but the emperor flatly refused. Through <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> of the years that followed, Prince Gabriel remained passionate in his devotion to the dancer, determined that one day he would overcome the obstacles and marry her.|$|E
25|$|The secrecy {{campaign}} continued {{even while}} the series aired. Journalists are typically given preview copies of episodes so they might prepare reviews for publication as soon as an episode airs. To keep <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> of Broadchurch a secret, preview copies of each episode were delivered electronically and protected with passwords. Chibnall also significantly restricted access to each completed episode {{to just a few}} people. Nevertheless, a large number of journalists knew who the killer was long before the final episode aired, Chibnall said. But the secret never leaked.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{cause of}} the Sultana disaster {{was determined to be}} mismanagement of water levels in the boiler, exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} vessel was severely overcrowded and top heavy. As the steamboat made her way north following <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> of the river, she listed severely to one side then the other. Her four boilers were interconnected and mounted side-by-side, so that if the boat tipped sideways, water would tend to run out of the highest boiler. With the fires still going against the empty boiler, this created hot spots. When the boat tipped the other way, water rushing back into the empty boiler would hit the hot spots and flash instantly to steam, creating a sudden surge in pressure. This effect of careening could have been minimized by maintaining high water levels in the boilers. The official inquiry found that the boat's boilers exploded due to the combined effects of careening, low water level, and a faulty repair to a leaky boiler made a few days earlier.|$|E

500|$|Frankenstein, {{like much}} Gothic fiction of the period, mixes a [...] and alienating subject matter with {{speculative}} and thought-provoking themes. Rather {{than focusing on}} <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> of the plot, however, the novel foregrounds the mental and moral struggles of the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, and Shelley imbues the text with her own brand of politicised Romanticism, one that criticised the individualism and egotism of traditional Romanticism. Victor Frankenstein is like Satan in Paradise Lost, and Prometheus: he rebels against tradition; he creates life; and he shapes his own destiny. These traits are not portrayed positively; as Blumberg writes, [...] "his relentless ambition is a self-delusion, clothed as quest for truth". He must abandon his family to fulfill his ambition.|$|E

5000|$|On the one hand, {{the name}} [...] "meander" [...] recalls <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> path of <b>the</b> Maeander River in Asia Minor, {{and on the}} other hand, as Karl Kerenyi pointed out, [...] "the meander is the figure of a {{labyrinth}} in linear form". [...] Among some Italians, these patterns are known as Greek Lines. Usually the term is used for motifs with straight lines and right angles; the many versions with rounded shapes are called running scrolls.|$|R
500|$|Sonnets are {{particularly}} {{associated with high}} poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, {{largely due to the}} influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as Edmund Spenser (who gave his name to the Spenserian sonnet), Michael Drayton, and Shakespeare, whose sonnets are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the Oxford Book of English Verse. However, <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> associated with the volta allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects. Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics (John Milton, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Claude McKay), theology (John Donne, Gerard Manley Hopkins), war (Wilfred Owen, e. e. cummings), and gender and sexuality (Carol Ann Duffy). Further, postmodern authors such as Ted Berrigan and John Berryman have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of [...] "sonnets" [...] that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for [...] "Pilot" [...] were {{generally}} favorable. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+, calling the show [...] "a slick action-adventure tale with knotty plotting and zeitgeisty villains". Hank Steuver of The Washington Post praised the episode for being [...] "stylish and swiftly paced" [...] with [...] "intriguing plot twists", but {{felt that there}} was [...] "not a lot of motivation to keep coming back". Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the [...] "tone change" [...] in the episode was [...] "a bit abrupt", but noted that [...] "viewers who can handle <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> will be intrigued". James Poniewozik gave a mixed review of the episode, noting that the show is [...] "setting itself up to be largely a bad-guy-of-the-week show" [...] and that its success will [...] "depend on how interesting Reddington and Keen’s backstories become". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the episode was [...] "stylish and expertly paced", saying that [...] "it is never boring". Dorothy Rabinowitz of The Wall Street Journal gave a positive review of the episode, saying that the episode [...] "reaches undeniably satisfying levels of menace".|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{reception}} was, on the whole, lukewarm compared to some earlier works. For The Independent, Lynne Walker wrote: [...] "Our most prolific and popular playwright {{seems to have}} forgotten that <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> in a storyline do need to be plausible rather than just the vehicle for a sequence of ideas, no matter how cunning they are in themselves", while Sam Marlowe for The Times concluded: [...] "Drowning on Dry Land is like its hapless anti-hero: there's not much {{more to it than}} meets the eye".|$|E

2500|$|The National Guardian's {{coverage}} of <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> of the Rosenberg case was particularly passionate, {{with the paper}} helping to coordinate the legal defense {{efforts on behalf of}} the jailed New Yorkers {{at a time when the}} Communist Party and its Daily Worker attempted to distance itself from the unpopular case. The paper was so closely tied to the Rosenberg defense that after the pair were executed on the electric chair for espionage, National Guardian editor James Aronson was named a trustee of the fund established on behalf of the couple's orphaned children. William A. Reuben, the National Guardian's main reporter on the Rosenberg case, later published an expanded version of his journalism in book form as [...] The Atom Spy Hoax (1954).|$|E

2500|$|IGN {{scored the}} game a 9.1/10 {{and said that}} [...] "anyone looking for a first-person shooter that offers more than flat, stereotypical {{characters}} and copy-and-paste supersoldier plots, one that attempts to establish a {{sense of right and}} wrong and loops you into the decision making process, and one that's set in one of the most vividly realized settings around should pick up BioShock 2. It's a game in which story, setting, and gameplay are expertly blended to create an experience that's as thought-provoking as it is entertaining." [...] IGN's review also stated that the game does not look as visually impressive as its predecessor, but it is still one of the best-looking games around because of its unique art style. In a round-table style video chat, IGN editors said that Rapture was less mysterious because players have seen it before, and that was a major strike against the game. Since the original had such an eerie mysterious feel to it, <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> seen in the sequel seemed less surprising.|$|E

[...] On 11 July 2013, it was {{reported}} that Carl and Phil would be involved in a [...] "massive car accident which leaves both men unconscious", caused by Carl. The storyline involves a flipped car and a helicopter, from which a birds-eye view of the crash scene is seen. It is reported to have cost £1million to make, said to be the most expensive stunt EastEnders has ever filmed. The crash was filmed over two days and was directed by Michael Owen Morris, who had to create what was originally scripted as [...] "car hits wall" [...] and compared it to a James Bond film. Newman said the crash was [...] "A suitably explosive start to a jam-packed autumn and winter full of love, romance and reprisals", while a show insider said, [...] "The crash is going to change things for many residents in Albert Square. There will be serious repercussions and with <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> we have planned for the aftermath, everything might not be as it seems." [...] It was also hoped that the storyline would be [...] "the most talked about TV moment of the year".|$|E
2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the [...] "Best Love Triangle". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by <b>the</b> <b>twists</b> <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a [...] "can't-miss week" [...] for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. [...] Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize that once you have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with. [...] When this happens, things spin wildly out of control." [...] With Phyllis and Nick gaining a fan following, On-Air On-Soaps referred to this as the [...] "Phick vs. Shick" [...] fan-base war.|$|E
