The average for the Chetco River at RM 10.8 (RK 17.4) between 1998 and 2007 was 95 (excellent) {{in the summer and}} 90 in the fall, winter, and spring. <b>These</b> <b>scores</b> are {{comparable}} to the 1986 to 1995 results of 94 and 93.

5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, {{there was a}} little {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not {{out at the end of}} the innings, while Charles Thornton and George Giffen both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite <b>these</b> <b>scores,</b> the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E

This is usually done according to a pre-defined criteria catalogue and if required individual score sheets, both requiring approval by the respective authorities [18]. Depending on the animal model, score sheets consider, e.g. body weight, appearance of coat, posture, breathing, self-care and social behaviour and appearance of excreta besides disease-related aspects. <b>These</b> <b>score</b> sheets unambiguously define at which state an experiment needs to be terminated and the animal killed.

25|$|In rugby union, {{there are}} four types of scores: penalty goal (3 points), drop goal (3 points), try (5 points) and {{converted}} try (7 points). By combining these any points total is possible except 1, 2, or 4. In rugby sevens, although all four types of scores are permitted, attempts at penalty goals are rare and drop goals almost unknown. This means that team scores almost always consist of multiples of try (5 points) and converted try (7 points). The following scores (in addition to 1, 2, and 4) cannot be made from multiples of 5 and 7 and so are almost never seen in sevens: 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 18 and 23.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is {{a simple}} neuropsychological {{screening}} instrument that is well accepted by patients and has solid psychometric properties. Several different CDT scoring methods have been developed, but no consensus has been reached regarding which scoring method is the most accurate. This article reviews the literature on <b>these</b> <b>scoring</b> systems and the changes they have undergone over the years. Historically, different types of scoring systems emerged. Initially, {{the focus was on}} screening for dementia, and the methods were both quantitative and semi-quantitative. Later, the need for an early diagnosis called for a scoring system that can detect subtle errors, especially those related to executive function. Therefore, qualitative analyses began to be used for both differential and early diagnoses of dementia. A widely used qualitative method was proposed by Rouleau et al. (1992). Tracing the historical path of <b>these</b> <b>scoring</b> methods is important for developing additional scoring systems and furthering dementia prevention research...|$|R
