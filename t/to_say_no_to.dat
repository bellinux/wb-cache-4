Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E

25|$|IMF {{policies}} have been repeatedly criticised for {{making it difficult for}} indebted countries <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> environmentally harmful projects that nevertheless generate revenues such as oil, coal, and forest-destroying lumber and agriculture projects. Ecuador for example had to defy IMF advice repeatedly to pursue the protection of its rainforests, though paradoxically this need was cited in IMF argument to support that country. The IMF acknowledged this paradox in the 2010 report that proposed the IMF Green Fund, a mechanism to issue special drawing rights directly to pay for climate harm prevention and potentially other ecological protection as pursued generally by other environmental finance.|$|E

25|$|On 5 December 1995, Solana {{became the}} new Secretary-General of NATO, {{replacing}} Willy Claes {{who had been}} forced to resign in a corruption scandal. His appointment created controversy as, in the past, he had been an opponent of NATO. He had written a pamphlet called 50 Reasons <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> NATO, and had been on a US subversives list. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO. When PSOE came to power later that year, Solana and the party changed their previous anti-NATO positions into an atlanticist, pro-NATO stance. On 12 March 1986 Spain held a referendum on whether to remain in NATO, with the government and Solana successfully campaigning in favour. When criticised about his anti-NATO past, Solana argued that he was happy to be its representative as it had become disassociated from its Cold War origins.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel." [...] David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Ridley Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and MGM) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: [...] "There's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available {{to work on the}} script day-to-day." [...] Mamet was preparing to direct his own film. Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: [...] "It's hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> Dino once and it's almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> him twice." [...] A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as [...] "stunningly bad" [...] but found Zaillian's rewrite to be [...] "gripping entertainment".|$|E

Crosby told reporters that while [...] "it took a lot <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> that much money", he [...] "work hard most of his life to play in the NHL." [...] The deal would have paid him $2.5 million annually and an additional $2 million payout regardless of whether the WHA was realized as a legitimate league or not. It was not clarified, however, how Hamilton could have signed Crosby, as Toronto held his WHA rights. Nevertheless, the WHA never materialized.|$|E

After completing her residency show at the Las Vegas Hilton, McEntire began reaching out to the artists on her list, by phone and e-mail. She came into contact with Justin Timberlake through Joanna García, who portrayed McEntire's daughter on the sitcom Reba and was dating Timberlake's friend Trace Ayala. Timberlake and McEntire {{met for the first time}} at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony on February 11, 2007.

This is a {{reference}} to a future plot in the episode [...] "Reaganing" [...] in which Liz is having intimacy issues because of a traumatic incident from her childhood that involved a poster of singer Tom Jones. Throughout the episode, Jack refers to the Fabian strategy, a strategy named after Roman general Fabius Maximus, which avoids direct battle in favor of attrition warfare. Jack uses the strategy as he does not want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> Avery or give in to her demands. In addition, Jack hails Fabius Maximus as his role model. When Carol surprises Liz at the TGS writers' room, staff writer J.D. Lutz (John Lutz) asks Carol if he is on Facebook, the latter being a social networking website. Later, Liz tells Jack not to interfere in her relationship with Carol, as she believes she has the perfect relationship with him. She reveals that she is modeling her life on that of chef Ina Garten of the Food Network show Barefoot Contessa. Jack responds by saying that Liz will never be like Garten, including the [...] "barefoot" [...] part, referring to the fact that Liz has never let anyone see her feet, which is a real life trait of Fey's.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} {{a committee of}} performers with disabilities, who felt that casting an able-bodied actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate. [...] star Robert David Hall commented: [...] "I think there's a fear of litigation, that a person with disabilities might slow a production down, fear that viewers might be uncomfortable." [...] Glee executive producer Brad Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates, McHale had the singing and acting ability and charisma required for the role and: [...] "it's hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> someone that talented". McHale has stated that he is pleased to represent {{a character in a}} wheelchair, and that: [...] "I think what's great about it is just because he's in a wheelchair, he can still do what everyone else does." [...] Kristin Dos Santos of E! Online refuted criticism of the episode, opining that: Wheels' is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to the disabled community." [...] Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times expressed a similar sentiment, stating: [...] "Here we have an episode bluntly addressing the complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity, and there are complaints about Artie not being wheelchair-bound in real life?

500|$|Davey's debut album, Something Ilk, was {{recorded}} at {{a studio in}} Wales, produced by Ben Hillier whose previous credits included Blur and Elbow, and released in 2004. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "high on presence and very low on filler" [...] and gave it three out of five stars. Hot Press remarked, [...] "Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places without seeming detached". The Irish Independents Paul Byrne described it as [...] "one of the best Irish albums of 2004". Davey performed a nationwide tour in September 2004. She also supported Graham Coxon and Supergrass during tours they undertook that year. The singer later dismissed Something Ilk, saying [...] "I think the record company [...] thought I was an indie rock chick when they signed me and that album is very much other people's idea of what I should sound like. [...] I didn't have the confidence <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> {{some of the things}} [...] suggested". Davey claimed not to [...] "know my arse from my elbow when I signed for them" [...] and did not like performing those songs in a live arena. Despite this, the Irish Independent described her as [...] "very talented—far more so than [...] Hayes" [...] but regretted that she had [...] "failed to find an audience for her fine debut Something Ilk".|$|E

[...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to.</b> At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien.

500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> the impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E
