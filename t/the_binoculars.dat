5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as <b>the</b> <b>binoculars</b> or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 1941, {{the night}} before the {{invasion}} of the Syria–Lebanon Campaign, Dayan's unit crossed the border and secured two bridges over the Litani River. When they were not relieved as expected, at 04:00 on 8 June, the unit perceived that it was exposed to possible attack and—on its own initiative—assaulted a nearby Vichy police station, capturing it. A few hours later, as Dayan was {{on the roof of the}} building using binoculars to scan Vichy French positions on the other side of the river, <b>the</b> <b>binoculars</b> were struck by a French rifle bullet fired by a sniper from several hundred yards away, propelling metal and glass fragments into his left eye and causing severe damage. Six hours passed before he could be evacuated, and he would have died if not for Bernard Dov Protter, who took care of him until they were evacuated. Dayan lost the eye. In addition, the damage to the extraocular muscles was such that Dayan could not be fitted with a glass eye, and he was compelled to adopt the black eye patch that became his trademark.|$|E
25|$|Four {{months after}} Poirot's death, Hastings {{receives}} a manuscript in which Poirot explains all. X was Norton, {{a man who}} had perfected the technique of which Iago in Othello (and a character in Ervine's play) is master: applying just such psychological pressure as is needed to provoke someone to commit murder, without his victim realising what is happening. Norton had demonstrated this ability, with Colonel Luttrell, with Hastings, and Mrs Franklin. Poirot intervened with sleeping pills in Hastings' hot chocolate that night, to avert a disastrous rash action. Ironically, Hastings had unwittingly intervened in Mrs. Franklin's plan to poison her husband, by turning a revolving bookcase table while seeking a book to solve a crossword clue (Othello again), thus swapping the cups of coffee, so Mrs Franklin poisoned herself. Poirot could not prove this. He sensed that Norton, who had been deliberately vague about whom he had seen through <b>the</b> <b>binoculars,</b> would hint that he had seen Franklin and Judith, to implicate them in the murder of Mrs Franklin, not inadvertent suicide as it was. This explains Poirot's testimony at her inquest, to ensure the police would stop their investigation.|$|E

500|$|PT-32, {{which had}} only two good engines, had straggled behind the others. Around dawn, Schumacher spotted what {{appeared}} to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him. He jettisoned his fuel drums so he could increase speed and run from it. He ordered his crew to man the [...]50-caliber machine guns and get ready to launch torpedoes. Akin prepared to toss a barracks bag filled with code books overboard. However, as the light improved, and the vessel drew closer, another look though <b>the</b> <b>binoculars</b> revealed that it was not a Japanese destroyer at all, but PT-41, carrying an angry Bulkeley. Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned, but this proved to be a time-consuming task, and a dangerous one in broad daylight, and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered. Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest. The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby cove.|$|E
2500|$|On October 31, 1983, about 2:00p.m., {{five members}} of a {{construction}} crew saw a 100-foot-long sea serpent off Stinson Beach, which is just north of San Francisco, California. A flagman named Gary saw it first swimming towards the cliffside road which the work crew was repairing. He radioed {{another member of the}} work crew, Matt Ratto, and told him to grab <b>the</b> <b>binoculars.</b> Ratto began looking at the sea serpent when it was 100 yards offshore and {{less than a quarter of}} a mile away. Ratto said, [...] "The body came out of the water first." [...] He added, [...] "It was black with three humps." [...] He continued, [...] "There were three bends. like humps and they rose straight up." [...] He further described it as a [...] "humpy, flat-backed thing". He also made a sketch of the animal which appeared to be a round headed, blunt nosed, snake-like creature followed by 3 vertical arches or coils sticking out of the water. Another eyewitness, Steve Bjora, said [...] "The sucker was going 45 to 50 miles an hour." [...] He also described the animal saying, [...] "It was clipping. It was boogying. It looked like a long eel." [...] Marlene Martin, the Caltran safety engineer who was over seeing the work crew also saw the animal. She said, [...] "It shocked the hell out of me" [...] adding, [...] "That thing's so big he deserves front page coverage." [...] She went on to say, [...] "It was hard to describe how big it was. I have no creative imagination. It was a snake-like thing that arched itself up and was so long it made humps above the water." [...] Martin first saw it near Bolinas and saw it swim the whole way to Stinson beach then watched it turn around and head towards the Farallon Islands. Martin said, [...] "It had a wake as big as a power boat's and it was going about 65 miles an hour. It looked like a great big rubber hose as it moved. If someone had gotten in its way it would have plowed right though them." [...] Before it went underwater Martin saw it lift its head and a portion of its body directly behind its head out of the water then open its mouth. Martin said, [...] "It was like it was playing." [...] She described the animal as a [...] "giant snake or a dragon, with a mouth like an alligator's." [...] She continued, [...] "It was at least 15 or 20 feet in circumference, but it was hard to tell how long it was. I mean, how long is a snake? Marlin Martin concluded by saying, [...] "He should have the whole damn ocean. It's his territory. He's the King of the Sea!" ...|$|E

60|$|Now malahini means new-comer, tender-foot; and, {{despite the}} prettiness of their stroke, {{he knew that}} none except malahinis would venture into the racing channel beyond the diving-stage. Hence the vexation of the captain of Number Nine.

Quite casually, the crew, six of them, carried Number Nine to the water's edge, saw paddles and everything in order for a quick launching, and lolled about carelessly on the sand.

60|$|But it {{was evident}} that the man and woman knew big water. No racing stroke did they make in advance of the wave. The captain {{inwardly}} applauded as he saw them turn and face the wave and wait for it. It was a picture that of all on the beach he alone saw, wonderfully distinct and vivid in the magnification of <b>the</b> <b>binoculars.</b> The wall of the wave was truly a wall, mounting, ever mounting, and thinning, far up, to a transparency of the colours of the setting sun shooting athwart all the green and blue of it. The green thinned to lighter green that merged blue even as he looked. But it was a blue gem-brilliant with innumerable sparkle-points of rose and gold flashed through it by the sun. On and up, to the sprouting beard of growing crest, the colour orgy increased until it was a kaleidoscopic effervescence of transfusing rainbows.|$|E

A little after a calm succeeded, with much rain; and the first meal was eaten, and the watch below lay down to their uneasy slumber on the bilge under a roaring shower-bath. The twenty-ninth dawned overhead from out of ragged clouds; there is no moment when a boat at sea appears so trenchantly black and so conspicuously little; and the crew looked about them {{at the sky and}} water with a thrill of loneliness and fear. With sunrise the Trade set in, lusty and true to the point; sail was made; the boat flew; and by about four in the afternoon, they were well up with the closed part of the reef, and the captain standing on the thwart, and holding by the mast, was studying the island through <b>the</b> <b>binoculars.</b>|$|E

And {{in the midst of}} them, swinging to the tide, were the big [...] "mother ships" [...] we have sent over to nurse them when, after many days and nights of hazardous work at sea, they have brought their flock of transports and merchantmen safely to port.

6000|$|I felt its dread for {{the first}} time in mid-Atlantic one day, many years ago, when we took off the crew of a Danish brig homeward bound from the West Indies. A thin, silvery mist {{softened}} the calm and majestic splendour of light without shadows--seemed to render the sky less remote and the ocean less immense. It was one of the days, when the might of the sea appears indeed lovable, like the nature of a strong man in moments of quiet intimacy. At sunrise we had made out a black speck to the westward, apparently suspended high up in the void behind a stirring, shimmering veil of silvery blue gauze that seemed at times to stir and float in the breeze which fanned us slowly along. The peace of that enchanting forenoon was so profound, so untroubled, that it seemed that every word pronounced loudly on our deck would penetrate to the very heart of that infinite mystery born from the conjunction of water and sky. We did not raise our voices. [...] "A water-logged derelict, I think, sir," [...] said the second officer quietly, coming down from aloft with <b>the</b> <b>binoculars</b> in their case slung across his shoulders; and our captain, without a word, signed to the helmsman to steer for the black speck. Presently we made out a low, jagged stump sticking up forward--all that remained of her departed masts.|$|E
