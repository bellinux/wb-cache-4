25|$|Radio Caroline's <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> {{was almost}} 20 kW, {{achieved}} by linking two 10kW Continental Electronics transmitters. Broadcasting hours were 6am to 6pm to avoid competition from Radio Luxembourg. After its close-down, the station returned at 8pm and continued until after midnight. This was to avoid competition with popular television programmes. Most of Radio Caroline's pop music programmes were targeted at housewives, and some later programming {{was aimed at}} children. Without serious competition, Radio Caroline gained a regular daytime audience of some 10 million.|$|E
25|$|Differential braking (or braked differential) systems {{remove the}} {{clutches}} {{on the track}} and add a differential on the <b>transmission</b> <b>output.</b> The differential allows the tracks to turn at different speeds while remaining powered. Steering is then accomplished by slowing one track with a brake. The advantage to this design is that power is maintained to both tracks even while steering is taking place. Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{have studied}} a {{differential}} gear transmission for low-speed drive of ultrasonic mo-tor. This <b>transmission</b> <b>outputs</b> {{the half of}} the difference of two ultrasonic motors. Therefore when both motors rotate at approximately simi-lar speed in the counter direction, the transmis-sion can output very low speed. When both mo-tors rotate at maximum speed in the same direc-tion, the <b>transmission</b> can <b>output</b> the same speed as the maximum of single motor. Such a wide speed selectivity is useful for MRI-compatible ma-nipulator/robot, which needs ultrasonic motor for the reason of less magnetic interaction. In this paper, we reported its structure, kinematics, and speed selectivity analysis...|$|R

50|$|A {{divorced}} {{or independent}} transfer case is completely {{separate from the}} transmission. It is located further down the driveline than a married transfer case and connected to the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft by a short driveshaft. Independent transfer cases are used on very long wheelbase vehicles, such as commercial trucks or military trucks.|$|E
50|$|The {{exhaust system}} was also changed, gone were the dual {{silencers}} {{and replaced with}} one stainless steel silencer on the right side. The <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft was lengthened to accommodate a wider wheel. A new curved oil-cooler design and oil lines (attached to the oil pan similar to the original 85-87 engines) were installed.|$|E
50|$|The 2017 R1200RTs are {{fitted with}} a judder (definition: an {{instance}} of rapid and forceful shaking and vibration) damper on the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft. New features also include a revised selector drum actuator, transmission shafts, and transmission shaft bearing. In addition to these technical changes, the 2017 R1200RT is now available with optional ABS Pro, which senses lean angle and adjusts intervention accordingly (as part of the Ride Modes Pro option package).|$|E
5000|$|The 1GD-FTV is a 2.8L (2755cc) straight-4 {{common rail}} diesel engine with a {{variable}} nozzle turbocharger (VNT), chain drive and Intercooler.

50|$|Digital {{terrestrial}} television was first transmitted from the Mendip mast from 15 November 1998 using the frequency {{gaps between the}} analogue TV broadcasts. To limit interference to the analogue <b>transmissions,</b> power <b>output</b> on the digital multiplexes was low.|$|R
40|$|Using a Ti:sapphire laser as the pumping {{source in}} the CW mode, the self-Q-switched laser in the co-doped Cr 4 +,Nd 3 +:YAG {{microchip}} with 1 mm thickness was demonstrated. The output Q-switched traces are very stable, the threshold pumping power is as low as 30 mW, the pulse duration is as short as 100 ns. And the pulse width keeps constant and pulse repetition rate is varied with the variation of the pumping power. The slope efficiency is varied with the <b>transmission</b> of <b>output</b> coupler at 1064 nm, and the slope efficiency {{is as high as}} 20 % for 5 % <b>transmission</b> of <b>output</b> coupler at 1064 nm. This can lead to develop the diode laser pumped monolithic self-Q-switched solid-state microchip lasers...|$|R
50|$|The HSV {{building}} (also {{known as}} 'Broadcast Centre Melbourne') is the network's operations hub, where the Master Control Room is located for all metropolitan and regional feeds to be controlled. Programming line-up, advertisement output, feed switching, time zone monitoring and national <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> are delivered here. All Seven Network {{owned and operated}} studios have their LIVE signals relayed here (e.g.) ATN's output is fed to HSV and then transmitted via satellite or fibre optic to the towers around metropolitan Sydney, etc.|$|E

50|$|For the 2017 {{model year}} the bike {{was given a}} facelift, with {{technical}} changes to meet European EU4 regulations. Side reflectors and an on-board diagnostic (OBD) indicator light in the cockpit to indicate a malfunction were added. Like the R1200GS Adventure, all liquid-cooled boxer models were given a damper on the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft. The selector drum actuator, transmission shafts and transmission shaft bearing were revised. The GS was also given a new crash bar option, allowing cylinder protection covers to be mounted, as had been standard on the Adventure.|$|E
50|$|The rear pump was an {{unregulated}} {{gear pump}} driven from the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft, which meant it {{was capable of}} pressurizing the transmission if the vehicle was in motion. This feature {{made it possible to}} push-start a vehicle with a dead battery if the vehicle could be accelerated to at least 15 - 20 mph. At higher speeds, the rear pump provided all the oil volume that was needed to operate the transmission and the front pump's slide was nearly centered, causing that pump to produce little output.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{production}} vehicles, light and medium duty trucks, and motor {{homes have been}} made with a separate drum brake on the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft; called a driveline parking brake. This has an advantage of being completely independent of other braking systems. This is effective {{as long as the}} drive train is intact [...] - [...] propeller shaft, differential, and axle shafts. In many vehicles, this type of parking brake is operated by either a foot pedal or a hydraulic cylinder controlled by the transmission gear selector, or by both.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} {{is the major}} energy consumer compared to computation and sensing operations performed by a battery-powered wireless sensor node. The reduction of communication power consumption in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be achieved using adaptive transmission power adjustment paradigms.

50|$|The {{network devices}} {{supporting}} this feature include IEEE 802.11h Wireless LAN devices in the 5 GHz band compliant to the IEEE 802.11a. The {{idea of the}} mechanism is to automatically reduce the used <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> power when other networks are within range. Reduced power means reduced interference problems and increased battery capacity. The power level of a single device can be reduced by 6 dB which should result in an accumulated power level reduction (the sum of radiated power of all devices currently transmitting) of at least 3 dB (which is half of the power).|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Wheel drive truck {{applications}} for the THM350 used an iron adapter that mated the THM-350 to the transfer case directly, similar to the THM400. The THM350 adapter was cast iron and used a sliding sleeve to couple the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft to the transfer case input shaft with a steel coupler sleeve that was splined to accept both shafts and couple them together. An internal snap ring inside the coupler sleeve controlled the sleeve's position on the shafts, with circular seals in the adapter sealing the transmission from the transfer case.|$|E

50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the front differential, rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. The transmission, front differential, center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> shaft feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The front differential distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|E
50|$|Instead of a {{permanent}} torque split (which is featured in earlier systems), xDrive provides variable torque split between {{the front and rear}} axles {{through the use of a}} multi-plate wet clutch located in the gearbox on the output to the front drive shaft. This setup allows xDrive to modulate the torque split between the front and the rear axles, which is normally split at 40:60 ratio, respectively. If wheel slip is detected by the ABS/DSC system, xDrive can react within a tenth of a second to redistribute up to 100% of the engine power to the front or rear axle. The wet clutch is applied through a high speed electric servo motor turning a cam-shaped actuator disc. As the rear drive shaft is hard-coupled to the <b>transmission</b> <b>output,</b> full torque transfer to the front axle can only be achieved if the rear wheels have no traction and are both slipping.|$|E
50|$|Hydrostatic CVTs {{are common}} in small to {{medium-sized}} agricultural and earthmoving equipment. As the engines in these machines are typically run at constant power settings to provide hydraulic power or to power machinery, losses in mechanical efficiency are offset by enhanced operational efficiency, such as reduced forward-reverse shuttle times in earthmoving operations. <b>Transmission</b> <b>output</b> is varied to control both travel speed and direction. This is particularly beneficial in equipment designed to pivot or skid steer through differential power application as the required differential steering action can easily be supplied by independent CVTs, allowing steering to be accomplished without braking losses or loss of tractive effort and allowing the machine to pivot in place. In mowing or harvesting operations a CVT allows the forward speed of the tractor or combine harvester to be adjusted independently of the engine speed. This allows the operator to slow or accelerate as needed to accommodate variations in thickness of the crop.|$|E
50|$|The same four-horn {{cluster is}} used for RF <b>transmission.</b> The {{transmitter}} <b>output</b> is delivered to the comparater labyrinth, which now acts to divide the outgoing power equally between all four horns. The receivers are protected by TR tubes during the transmit time.|$|R

The proposed method can effectively eliminate the separation of hardware and software from the perspective of response time, and provide a rigorous mathematical derivation process. Analyzing the actual running data of station can effectively identify the reactor protection system reliability shortcomings. At the same time, it also can help to improve system reliability sustained and provide a reference for maintenance as well as fault diagnosis.|$|R
