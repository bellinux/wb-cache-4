30|$|Working with {{field data}} {{revealed}} that estimates of bottom-hole pressure from <b>tubing</b> <b>head</b> pressure data {{to fill the}} missing bottom-hole pressure points have assisted in reducing the uncertainty in the match. It is important to start modeling any field case with the minimum number of compartments (as suggested by geological information) and {{increasing the number of}} compartments as needed. This approach will be useful in reducing the number of parameters for the history matching problem and will decrease the uncertainty.|$|E
30|$|In a study {{carried out}} by Nallaparaju et al. 2012, we observe that Turner’s {{critical}} rate model was plotted with IPR and TPR for a Well with a given initial static reservoir pressure of 3281 psi and <b>Tubing</b> <b>head</b> pressure of 1500  psi as shown in Fig.  4 above. The {{point at which the}} Turner’s curve meets with the IPR curve represent the minimum flowrate to prevent liquid loading (10 MMSCFD), whereas the optimum operating flowrate for the well is around 75 MMSCFD. The farther the operating point from the minimum flowrate, the lower the tendency for liquid loading to occur.|$|E
30|$|This section {{emphasizes}} on optimizing {{the values of}} production and injection parameters of the optimum scenario by improving the oil recovery factor and maximum sweep for the reservoir. Tubing wellhead pressure (THP) and bottom-hole pressure (BHP) are used to control the drawdown of reservoir. BHP corresponds, where operator has installed control valves (subsurface), otherwise well head pressure (WHP) {{is used as a}} control mode. BHP is denoted by pwf (flowing bottom-hole pressure) or pws (shut in pressure). According to Darcy law the lesser the BHP, the higher the drawdown and the more will be the oil recovery. The same principle is applied to THP as well, however, if the THP decreases and BHP increases, this indicates liquid load up in the well. Therefore, in the scenarios 4, these two controlling factors are optimized. Table  3 and Table  4 provide details on injection well control parameters. It can be seen that the well control parameter (I) is controlled by the <b>tubing</b> <b>head</b> pressure (THP) and well control (GI) is controlled by the reservoirs rate.|$|E
50|$|The {{pneumatic}} otoscope is {{the standard}} tool used in diagnosing otitis media. In addition to the pneumatic (diagnostic) head, a surgical head also is useful. The pneumatic head contains a lens, an enclosed light source, and a nipple for attachment of a rubber bulb and <b>tubing.</b> The <b>head</b> is designed so that when a speculum is attached and fitted snugly into the patient’s external auditory canal, an air-tight chamber is produced. In some cases, {{the addition of a}} small sleeve of rubber tubing {{at the end of the}} plastic speculum or use of a rubber-tipped speculum helps to avoid trauma and improve the air-tight seal.1 Gently squeezing and releasing the rubber bulb in rapid succession permits observation of the degree of eardrum mobility in response to both positive and negative pressure.|$|R
40|$|With {{a simple}} {{mechanical}} mock circulation {{it was possible}} to measure the pressure wave and flow in the arterial line and the pressure in the mock circulation and their dependence upon the pulse characteristics, aortic cannula size (inner diameter between 5. 4 mm and 12. 7 mm) and the use of a hollow fibre membrane oxygenator during nonpulsatile as well as pulsatile perfusion. In the arterial line, pressure peaks up to 750 mmHg have been registered, resulting in peak flow rates of 12. 4 I/min. Due to the mechanical construction of the roller pump and the use of silicon <b>tubing</b> in the <b>head,</b> negative pressure peaks of 240 mmHg resulting in retrograde flow peaks up to 5 I/min were measured. The pressure in the mock circulation was dependent on the inner diameter and shape of the aortic cannula. Pulse pressure up to 100 mmHg, systolic pressure up to 130 mmHg and dp/dt upto 1250 mmHg/s could be achieved by using a cannula with an internal diameter of 12. 7 mm. A cannula, however, with an internal diameter of only 5. 4 mm produced a reduced peak pulse pressure of 65 mmHg, a systolic pressure of 100 mmHg and a dp/dt of 450 mmHg/s. By calculating the shear stress at the wall and, most importantly, in the free mixing layer, {{it was possible to}} estimate the resulting haemolysis. Haemolysis occurs when a shear stress over 100 Pa is present for over 100 ms. This destroys platelets as well as erythrocytes. The calculations showed shear stresses up to 1500 Pa while using a cannula with an internal diameter of 5. 4 mm in comparison to 50 Pa with the internal diameter of 12. 7 mm...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The use of {{size and}} shape tunable quantum {{confinement}} nanocrystals has many potential applications for use in semiconductors, optics and sensors. The synthesis of lead sulfide (PbS) and copper indium diselenide (CuInSe₂) nanoparticles are of particular interest for use in semiconductor, optoelectronics and bio-medical applications. The continuous synthesis of lead sulfide (PbS) and copper indium diselenide (CuInSe₂) nanocrystals was undertaken in this work. Quality colloidal nanocrystal synthesis requires three components: precursors, organic surfactants and solvents. The synthesis of the nanocrystals {{can be thought of}} as a nucleation event, followed by a subsequent growth period. Both the nucleation and growth rates were found to be dependent upon factors such as temperature, growth time, and precursor concentration. For a continuous flow system the residence time (at nucleation and growth conditions) was also found to be important. In order to separate the nucleation and growth events, injection techniques were employed to achieve rapid nucleation of nanocrystals with final size dictated by the growth temperature and/or residence time through the growth zone of the reaction system. Experimental parameters to investigate the size, shape, and composition of synthesized nanocrystals included injection temperature, growth temperature, residence time, and concentration of organic surfactants. Size tunability was accomplished for both PbS and CuInSe₂ nanocrystals where particle sizes less than 10 nm were achieved and the resulting nanocrystal compositions were found to be at the approximate stoichiometric ratios for both PbS and CuInSe₂. The materials used for the process tubing and pumps were found to be important as chlorinated reaction byproducts were found to react with the stainless steel <b>tubing</b> and pump <b>heads.</b> Post processing was also found to be important in order to remove any possible reaction by-products and residual precursors from the surface of synthesized nanocrystals. When at least one dimension of the nanocrystal approaches the exciton Bohr radius, the bandgap for the nanocrystal increases. UV-VIS spectroscopy was used to optically characterize synthesized PbS nanocrystals from our continuous flow synthesis. The absorption spectra for the particles demonstrated an absorption onset showing a large blueshift compared to that of bulk PbS. The blueshift matches closely with literature reports of the quantum confinement effect that would be desired when synthesizing PbS nanoparticles at diameters that are less than the PbS exciton Bohr radius of 18 nm...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to implement a data assimilation algorithm for production data {{as a first step}} in dealing with uncertainties in nodal analysis. The methodology is based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), a data assimilation technique that aims to optimally combine uncertain ‘prior’ model predictions and uncertain measured data to obtain a ‘posterior model’ with improved predictive power. The implementation of stochastic nodal analysis models, to generate the uncertain predictions, and the data assimilation procedure were performed with Matlab. A simple production system with uncertain parameters was considered, consisting of a well head choke, a tubing and a near-well reservoir region. The uncertain parameters (random variables) were (log) permeability, skin, choke discharge coefficient and tubing roughness. The predicted and measured variables were the flowing bottom hole pressure and flowing <b>tubing</b> <b>head</b> pressure. The measured data in the EnKF should come from field measurements. To test the method, we performed ‘twin experiments’ in which we used synthetic data with added noise. In the examples considered we achieved a reduction in the uncertainty of the model parameters.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a study on}} how to represent wells in numerical simulation of a coarse-gridded, full-field study of a lean gas condensate reservoir. A "black oil" (formation volume factor representation of fluid properties) model had been historymatched by comparing <b>tubing</b> <b>head</b> pressures as well as adjusting the well deliverability by multipliers on the well productivity indexes, the "WPI Mult" approach. The objective of this work is to investigate how the historymatching of well deliverability approaches {{has an impact on}} the well flowing oil-gas ratio in original lean, fictitious medium and rich gas-condensates reservoirs. Alternative well deliverability approaches investigated are called "Perm Mult" and "Fault Mult" with adjustment of permeability or transmissibility of numerical blocks surrounding the well blocks. The condensate impairment to the gas flow is well-known issue in gas-condensate fileds, but it is not accounted in a coarse-gridded model. The behavior of the important Region 1 and the change in the size of Region 1 are observed in well grid-cell and neighbouring grid cells. The steady-state liquid saturation is seen in Rich gas-condensate behavior after 5 years of production.

40|$|Après une {{description}} des conditions d'accès aux domaines de fonctionnement étudiés, les différents types de fonctionnement du système non-linéaire sont présentés pour les trois couples de paramètres retenus. Des oscillations amorties sont mises en évidence au voisinage de la limite du fonctionnement stationnaire stable. L'influence non négligeable de la désorption gazeuse est observée. Les formes envisageables de la notion de rendement sont évoquées et pour un couple de paramètres, un espace de fonctionnement optimal est indiqué. The production simulator of a gas-lift well {{has already}} been described [1]. It {{should be noted that}} the physical modeling of the process requires 43 variables, 3 partial differential equations, 17 algebraic equations, 19 constants and 4 correlations. This entire set is used to describe the parts of the model, i. e. the annular space, the reservoir, the tubing (separated into two portions by the injection orifice) all making up the complete model formed by the gathering of the elements in the light of the boundary exchange conditions. The numerical solving of this system of equations requires first-order spatio-temporal discretizing, which leads to a set of recurring equations in space (well depth) and in time (time of simulation). The identification of possible types of operating, searching for their domains of existance, and the effect of different possible approximations are part of the understanding of this complex nonlinear system, which has a variety of industrial uses. Among the set of parameters making up the model, the present study is concerned with three that are directly involved in the gas-lift phenomenon, i. e. the gas flow rate upon entering the annular space QATg, the pressure at the <b>tubing</b> <b>head</b> Ptt, and the diameter of the injection orifice Do. The first two are inputs for the gas-lift black box in the sense of automation, and the third is the major physical parameter governing the characteristics of the two-phase gas/oil mixture. In this three-dimensional space, plane by plane the domain of existance is located for stable stationary operating (I), stable alternative operating (II), and the numerical stoppage zone of simulations (III), where the conditions for pocket-slug flow no longer exist. We also find an oscillation zone at the boundary of the stationary space (curve (C), Figs. 1, 9 and 10). The boundaries of the domains investigated are linked to physical conditions, i. e. diameter, flow rate, pressure and flow regime. Specific developments are shown in Figs. 2 to 5. Fig. 2 a shows stable stationary development. Fig. 2 b shows stable alternative development. Figs. 3 a and 3 b analyze the alternative behavior with Do variable. Figs. 4 a and 4 b show oscillating developments. Fig. 5 shows the development of the period of dampened oscillations. Fig. 6 analyzes the approach of an oscillating situation. Conventional nonlinearity can be seen in Fig. 7. The introduction of the thermal behavior of the well (thermodynamic effect) is revealed by Fig. 8. Whereas the saving of this contribution makes for a gain of a factor of three in computing time, it is absolutely not justified by the importance of its effect. The concept of efficiency is indispensible for a so-called productionsystem, but what could be defined as efficiency for the gas-lift process? Several definitions are considered. Whereas the types of operation of the gas-lift process can be listed by a structured simulation set, the concept of efficiency in one or another of the uses considered would require these simulations to be performed systematically in a fairly close mesh in the three preceding spaces. There is nothing to oppose this type of computing, unless it is the tedius nature of the operation. However, the results obtained in space (QATg, Do) (Figs. 1, 6 and 7) serve to situate a quasi-constant zone 6 f maximum efficiency over an interval having the value Do. The coherence of this simulator is reinforced by all the results obtained. These are only simulations, and we regret not being able to compare the results of an experiment in which any opeation is performed...|$|E
