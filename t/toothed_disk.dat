50|$|The {{process of}} gear shaping uses a <b>toothed</b> <b>disk</b> cutter which reciprocates in axial rotations. The {{workpiece}} (or blank gear) rotates {{on a second}} shaft (spindle). The workpiece is aligned with the cutter and it gradually feeds into the cutter while rotating. If a two-step process is used, all tooth spaces are partially cut before finishing.|$|E
40|$|While the pre-harvest {{sugarcane}} burning is a disused practice, {{green harvest}} requires changes concerning ratoon cultivation {{due to the}} presence of a thick layer of straw. The experiment, conducted in a mechanical green harvesting area cultivated with sugarcane, consisted of two stages: in the first stage, the mechanical straw cutting performance of flat disks with different geometry edges was evaluated, considering two types of disks and 10 replications in a completely randomized design; in the second stage, the effect of soil chiseling on both sides of planting lines, using shanks with straw cutting flat disks, was assessed, as well as fertilizer deposition form. The experimental design in the second stage was completely randomized, with seven treatments and five replications. Treatments consisted of a combination of two straw cutting disks (smooth or toothed edge), chiseling presence or absence, and fertilizer deposition forms (broadcast, on the planting line, and incorporated into chiseling furrows). The <b>toothed</b> <b>disk</b> differed from the smooth one, presenting lower values of horizontal and vertical forces, and torque. The agroindustrial variables pol (%), brix (%), fiber (%), and ATR (kg Mg- 1) were not influenced by the fertilizer deposition form and soil chiseling. However, the localized fertilizer deposition increased crop yield when compared with broadcast fertilization...|$|E
50|$|In the wild, {{this species}} grows to {{a height of}} 2 to 12 m, but in {{cultivation}} it can reach twice this height. Distinguishing features include leaves with pale green undersides, whitish flowers with red bases, <b>toothed</b> basal <b>disks,</b> and single whorls of three to five stamens in the male flowers. The fruits contain three large, rounded seeds.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} reducing energy consumption in the mountainous arable farming and approved {{that one of the}} effective ways to solve this problem is minimal technology of tillage machines with disk working organs, using cultivators and harrows. Is proposed for universal working organ of minimum tillage, which is a spherical disc welded with segmented <b>toothed</b> flat <b>disk.</b> When machining of soil with the elaborated spherical working body the value of overlap groove decreases, provided loosening of the ridges formed between the grooves, which provide high technological quality of soil processing and stability of aggregate motion. That organ wich we are presenting makes it possible {{to reduce the number of}} disks in the battery and reduce the traction resistance of aggregate at identical working width...|$|R
50|$|Many modern speedometers are electronic. In designs {{derived from}} earlier {{eddy-current}} models, a rotation sensor {{mounted in the}} transmission delivers a series of electronic pulses whose frequency corresponds to the (average) rotational speed of the driveshaft, and therefore the vehicle's speed, assuming the wheels have full traction. The sensor is typically a set {{of one or more}} magnets mounted on the output shaft or (in transaxles) differential crownwheel, or a <b>toothed</b> metal <b>disk</b> positioned between a magnet and a magnetic field sensor. As the part in question turns, the magnets or teeth pass beneath the sensor, each time producing a pulse in the sensor as they affect the strength of the magnetic field it is measuring. Alternatively, in more recent designs, some manufactures rely on pulses coming from the ABS wheel sensors. Most modern electronic speedometers have the additional ability over the eddy current type to show the vehicle speed when moving in reverse gear.|$|R
