It's reassuring to know that we're still on the same page after all these years. We brought it back to its bare bones, dumbed it down a little, took it back to the rock song underneath." ...|$|E

So, the decision have to be made at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> actually doing choreography, ‘cause I’ll be doing choreography, as well I’ll be in it only one time, that’s it, as Johnny."

[...] "At <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were still flying the Macchi C.200, it was a good, if not very good, machine. Compared to the Macchi 200, it was superior only in one point - its armament of the Hispano-Suiza HS 404 20mm cannon." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that Gore refuses to debate the topic of global warming. Bjørn Lomborg asked him to debate the topic {{at a conference in}} California.

2500|$|Following his {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Patiala, Yadavindra pursued a political and diplomatic career, serving as chancellor of the Chamber of Princes from 1943 to 1944. In 1947, when India gained independence, he was the pro-chancellor of the Chamber of Princes. At a special session he said [...] "After centuries time has come when India has gained independence from foreign rule and it's <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all (princely states) should unite for our motherland" [...] and persuaded many other rulers to join the Indian Union.|$|E

McCain said, [...] "He's a great guy, proud of his grandfather who served in the US Marine Corps. We're going to fight for Joe, my friends, we are going to fight for him. The question Joe asked about our economy is important, because Senator Obama's plan would raise taxes on small businesses that employ 16 million Americans. Senator Obama's plan will kill those jobs at just <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> need to be creating more jobs. My plan will create jobs, and that's what America needs." ...|$|E

One headline stated: [...] "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time". Ladany recalled later:The impact did not hit me at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.|$|E

2500|$|Gary Vincent, an {{employee}} of Funspot and now curator of the Classic Arcade Museum, {{came up with the}} idea of collecting the games in one spot to give visitors to the arcade a different way of understanding the games. Opened in the late 1990s, the American Classic Arcade Museum collects games built no later than 1987. When asked why 1987 was picked as the cut off date, Vincent replied, [...] "We set the cut off date as 1987 because that is pretty much about <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> noticed that the videogame industry was starting to change. Instead of having fantasy-based games, puzzle-based, space shoot 'em up games or whatever, it seemed to switch over to more of what I call 'kick-punch-shoot' games." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lanfear {{thought for}} a moment. Then he said, in the honesty he thought best to use with her: [...] "For the most part I should say it was painful.

I don't know why we should remember so insistently the foolish things and wrong things we do, and not recall <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> acted, without an effort, wisely and rightly." [...] He thought he had gone too far, and he hedged a little. [...] "I don't mean that we can't recall those times.
