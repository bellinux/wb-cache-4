2500|$|The {{ship has}} one large cargo hold with a tween deck {{that can be}} set at three {{different}} heights. [...] It has a single 800-ton derrick for heavy-lift use. [...] In addition it has a single <b>traveling</b> <b>gantry</b> crane fitted with dual portal cranes, {{both of which are}} rated at 75 metric tons independently, and can be operated together for lifts up to 150 metric tons. [...] For roll-on/roll-off (roro) cargo, the ship has two trailer elevators and roro ramps.|$|E

40|$|The {{gantry crane}} {{scheduling}} and storage space allocation {{problem in the}} main containers yard of railway container terminal is studied. A mixed integer programming model which comprehensively considers the handling procedures, noncrossing constraints, the safety margin and <b>traveling</b> time of <b>gantry</b> cranes, and the storage modes in the main area is formulated. A metaheuristic named backtracking search algorithm (BSA) is then improved to solve this intractable problem. A series of computational experiments are carried out to evaluate {{the performance of the}} proposed algorithm under some randomly generated cases based on the practical operation conditions. The results show that the proposed algorithm can gain the near-optimal solutions within a reasonable computation time...|$|R
