5|$|As {{he builds}} this army to attack Superior Spider-Man, Norman {{takes on the}} new alias of <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King. The Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive at the sewers and join up with Goblin King's Goblin Underground. The group revels in the news that, thanks to Superior Spider-Man's assault, <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King now owns over the half of New York's {{organized}} crime. He claims he now owns New York City as <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> Kingpin of Crime. With the help of Menace, <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport, and upgrades Urich's Goblin armor and weapons. Goblin King asks in return only that Urich dedicate his only identity from here on as <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> Knight. Goblin King trains Goblin Knight, anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. Goblin King later poses as Hobgoblin and is sighted {{by some of the}} Spiderlings.|$|E

5|$|Norman's {{position}} as <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King was quickly usurped by <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> Knight (Phil Urich). However, a mysterious {{man with a}} bandaged face is soon shown to be selling Goblin-based weaponry globally to attack Parker Industries. This man reveals himself to be Norman Osborn, alive again post-Secret Wars and still planning on getting revenge on Spider-Man. He is revealed to have {{played a part in}} the recent coup of Symkaria. He restores a semblance of his original features via a twisted form of plastic surgery but also resembles the Green Goblin's facets, and intends to release a modified version of <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> formula to turn the whole country into Goblin-powered soldiers programmed to be loyal to him.|$|E

There, Che and Jenny learn why <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> had kidnapped Che in the first place: they wanted him to be the tutor and companion to Gwendolyn, a young goblin princess who was lame and mostly blind. Because <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> only respect strength and power, Gwendolyn needed to be able to conceal her physical disabilities by riding on Che's back - otherwise she would be overthrown and killed.|$|R

5|$|The Good Campaign opens {{after the}} Fellowship of the Ring has {{set out on}} their mission to unmake the One Ring of Power, with Elrond and Gl√≥in {{planning}} the War in the North. The Elven hero Glorfindel discovers an impending attack on the Elven sanctuary of Rivendell. Thanks to the early warning, Elrond's forces in Rivendell manage to repel the Goblins' attacks. Following the battle, Elrond realizes that the Elves and Dwarves must join forces to purge the threat of Sauron's forces in the North. The next battle takes place in <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> capital of Ettenmoors, where <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> fortress is destroyed, and Gorkil <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King is killed. After their victory, the heroes are informed that the Goblins, on Sauron's command, enlisted {{the service of a}} Dragon named Drogoth who is laying waste to the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. The heroes {{make their way to the}} Blue Mountains and help the Dwarven army defeat Drogoth and his Goblins.|$|E
5|$|The Green Goblin is {{armed with}} a variety of bizarre devices. He wears a green costume {{underneath}} bulletproof chainmail with an overlapping purple tunic. His mask has a built-in gas filter to keep him safe from his own gasses. The Green Goblin's trademark weapons are his pumpkin bombs and razor bats. As their name suggests, the bombs were designed with the appearance of jack-o'-lanterns. These varied in function from smoke bombs to traditional explosives, while the razor edged bat-shaped boomerangs-could cut through very durable surfaces and materials. The gloves of <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> uniform were fashioned with minuscule conductors that allowed for the release of electricity at nearly 10,000 amps of an undetermined voltage. Originally, Osborn used a mechanical broomstick to fly through the air during his first few exploits as the Green Goblin. The Flying Broomstick did not last long, however, and was improved upon, creating <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> Glider. <b>The</b> <b>Goblin</b> Glider was a more efficient flight system than Norman's Flying Broomstick. The Glider allowed <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> to carry a wide array of armaments, including heat-seeking and smart missiles, machine guns, extending blades, a flamethrower and a pumpkin bomb dispenser/launcher with him as he flew and had much greater speed and mobility than the Broomstick.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} the player's group of mercenaries arrives by ship to defend Targos. They {{report to the}} town {{palisade}} and fend off an assault by <b>the</b> <b>goblin</b> army. Afterwards, the mayor of Targos orders them to start an offensive on <b>the</b> <b>goblin</b> army. The group kills the chieftain of the army, and discovers that he was {{under the command of}} a woman named Sherincal. When they return to Targos, the mayor asks them to rendezvous with reinforcements from Neverwinter. The group travels to meet them in an airship piloted by Oswald Fiddlebender.|$|E

There are two groups among them, <b>the</b> {{domestic}} <b>goblins,</b> {{those who live in}} or around houses such as the Trasgu and the Trastolillu; and <b>the</b> forest <b>goblins,</b> <b>the</b> Trenti and the Tentiruju.|$|R
6000|$|... '"YOU {{a miserable}} man!" [...] said {{the king of}} <b>the</b> <b>goblins,</b> in a more contemptuous tone than before.

50|$|Goblins in Dungeons & Dragons are {{influenced}} by <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> in <b>the</b> works of J.R.R. Tolkien. In turn, D&D's goblins influenced later portrayals in games and fiction, such as the tabletop wargame Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> in Tolkien's works, <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> of D&D are a separate race from orcs; instead, {{they are a part}} of the related species collectively referred to as goblinoids, which includes hobgoblins, bugbears, and others.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>goblin</b> shark feeds {{mainly on}} teleost fishes such as {{rattails}} and dragonfishes. It also consumes cephalopods and crustaceans, including decapods and isopods. Garbage {{has been recorded}} from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the blackbelly rosefish (Helicolenus dactylopterus), and midwater species such as the squid Teuthowenia pellucida and the ostracod Macrocypridina castanea rotunda. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>goblin</b> shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.|$|E
5|$|Lamniformes: They are {{commonly}} known as the mackerel sharks. They include <b>the</b> <b>goblin</b> shark, basking shark, megamouth shark, the thresher sharks, shortfin and longfin mako sharks, and great white shark. They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction. The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon, Carcharodon megalodon.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien's {{portrayal}} of goblins in The Hobbit was particularly influenced by George MacDonald's The Princess and <b>the</b> <b>Goblin.</b> However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly than just to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole {{thinking on the}} role of fantasy within his Christian faith.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen-year-old Sarah Williams rehearses a play in {{the park}} with her dog Merlin but becomes distracted by a line she is unable to {{remember}} while being watched by a barn owl. Realizing she is late to babysit her baby brother Toby, she rushes home and is confronted by her stepmother Irene before {{she and her father}} Robert leave for dinner. Sarah has many toys that she has grown out of and realizes that Toby is in possession of her treasured teddy bear Lancelot. Frustrated by this and his constant crying, Sarah rashly wishes Toby be taken away by <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King Jareth, a character in the play she is rehearsing. She is shocked when Toby disappears and <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King confronts her and transports her to his kingdom. He refuses to return the baby but gives Sarah thirteen hours to solve his labyrinth and find him before Toby is turned into a goblin forever. Sarah meets a dwarfish man named Hoggle, who aids her in entering the Labyrinth. She has trouble finding turns and corners but then meets a talking worm who inadvertently sends her in the wrong direction.|$|E
5|$|Finn pursues Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), {{trying to}} explain to her that {{he does not want to}} hurt her. However, Flame Princess, {{confused}} by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her.

(voiced by Andy Milonakis), build flame-retardant battle robots.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{confrontation}} with the returned Spider-Man after his campaign against Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body, Norman Osborn has been rid of <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> formula from his system and thus the lost of his superhuman abilities, forcing him to rely on his intellect and other natural abilities. Doctor Octopus's anti-serum also prevents Osborn's attempts of restoring his powers, ultimately he seeks to rid it in hopes of having them again despite risking his health and sanity.|$|E

50|$|He is {{summoned to}} San Francisco by {{a horde of}} <b>goblins</b> who held <b>the</b> city in their grip and intend to make Demogoblin their ruler. However, he regards <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> as sinners of the worst sort, and so plays along with them {{only long enough to}} kill Charles Palentine, the man who had summoned <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> to Earth, and seize from him the {{necklace}} used for the summoning. He then uses the necklace's near godlike power to kill all <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> and destroys <b>the</b> necklace itself, thus saving the city.|$|R
5|$|Having {{staged a}} coup of New York after {{spreading}} his resources by exploiting Otto's reliance on technology, <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King directly confronts Otto, angry {{that he was}} cheated out {{of the opportunity to}} defeat his enemy, but offering Otto the chance to join him. Otto rejects the offer, but when he finds that he cannot win against <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King's resources, having had his new allies abandon him, and with his faith in his own abilities gone, he sacrifices himself to restore the original Spider-Man's mind. When Spider-Man arrives for the final confrontation, <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King quickly realizes that the original personality is back in control when Spider-Man responds to his nemesis' taunts with his own wisecracks. In the duel that follows, Spider-Man unmasks Goblin King, learning that he has undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, acting as the CEO of Alchemax and intending to re-establish himself as businessman Mason Banks, now that Norman Osborn has become too publicly known as a supervillain. Spider-Man defeats and strips the villain of his powers with a serum devised by Otto, but Norman manages to escape through the discreet aid of Liz Allan. In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared for him when he returns with his new identity and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Green Goblin formula.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him a bona fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics, robotics, engineering, physics and applied chemistry. <b>The</b> <b>Goblin</b> formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn has {{consistently}} been depicted with several unusual weaknesses {{related to his}} psychosis and to his personality. He suffers from manic depression, has a pronounced narcissistic personality disorder co-morbid with severe anti-social psychopathic traits, and in some depictions, a multiple-personality disorder. For some of his early appearances he and <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> were separate personalities; his Goblin side disdaining his human weaknesses, while his Norman Osborn persona was primarily motivated by his concern for Harry. Although his anger over his son's failing health as Norman helped to provoke his transformation back into <b>the</b> <b>Goblin,</b> this supposedly separate and more compassionate side of him never reappeared after he was believed dead. Norman is also highly sadistic, showing a complete lack of empathy for the lives of innocent people who stand {{between him and his}} objectives. These weaknesses have often been referenced in stories featuring him and exploited by his enemies.|$|E

5|$|The Evil Campaign follows an {{alternative}} {{version of the}} War in the North. Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the Nazg√ªl to the North to muster wild Goblins. His lieutenants lead <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> army and launch {{an assault on the}} Elven forest of L√≥rien. Despite heavy resistance, the forest is overrun, with Celeborn slain and Galadriel having fled to Rivendell; even Caras Galadhon collapses under the sheer force of the massive invasion. The Mouth peers eagerly into the captured Mirror of Galadriel for his next attack, as his Goblins celebrate their triumph over the Elves amidst the ruins of the once-mighty ancient stronghold. Another group of Goblins, led by <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> King Gorkil, attacks the Grey Havens by land and sea. The Elven port is destroyed and captured, and the march across Eriador begins; Hobbits of the Shire are chosen as the next target. Gorkil's horde manages to crush the Hobbits and burn their country to the ground, but Saruman's servant Gr√≠ma Wormtongue, suddenly appears with a large army of Isengard Uruks and claims the land for his master. The Goblins annihilate the well-trained army and kill Wormtongue, taking the Shire for themselves.|$|E
5|$|After {{boosting}} the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights {{were carried out}} before Schoch {{was able to make}} a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook <b>the</b> <b>Goblin</b> to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the depths}} {{at which it}} lives, <b>the</b> <b>goblin</b> shark poses no danger to humans. A few {{specimens}} have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums, though they only survived a short time. One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer. This shark is not targeted by any fisheries, but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls, hooked on longlines, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; {{one of the few}} areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. In April 2003, over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed <b>the</b> <b>goblin</b> shark under Least Concern. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity.|$|E

The next night, Tobin and <b>the</b> <b>goblins</b> try to sneak into the village, but he is caught while trying to raid the priest's tent and steal his books of spells.
