5|$|Monster Inc. is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} and markets about 6,000 products, but {{is best known}} for audio and video cables. It also produces speakers, headphones, power strips, mobile accessories and audio devices for automobiles. The company was founded by an audiophile and engineer, Noel Lee, in 1979 by experimenting with different ways to build audio cables. It grew by doing demonstrations to convince <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> audio cables made a difference in audio quality and by establishing relationships with retailers that were attracted to the cable's profit margins.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1946, Novikov {{submitted}} to Stalin plans that would {{lay the groundwork}} for the modern Soviet air force and <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> would supply it. On April 22, 1946, however, before these could be enacted, Novikov was stripped of his rank and titles and then arrested. The reason for this was that at the Potsdam conference it was discovered that the United States had better spy planes than the Soviet Union. He was interrogated and tortured the next day and again between May 4 and May 8, 1946 by Lavrentiy Beria before being forced to read a confession to the Politburo implicating Marshal Zhukov. Novikov was tried by the Military Collegium and sentenced to fifteen years in a labor camp.|$|E

25|$|Unions may {{organize}} a particular section of skilled workers (craft unionism), {{a cross-section of}} workers from various trades (general unionism), or attempt to {{organize a}}ll workers within a particular industry (industrial unionism).

25|$|In 1992, McDonnell Douglas {{unveiled}} {{a study of}} a double deck jumbo-sized aircraft designated MD-12. Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived as merely a public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus. It was clear to most in <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft, and the study quickly sank without a trace. A similar double deck concept was used in Boeing's later Ultra-Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747, but ultimately the double deck concept would not {{see the light of}} day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Republican Party Senator Mark Hanna from Ohio, {{himself an}} owner of {{bituminous}} coal mines (not involved in the strike), sought to resolve the strike as it occurred {{less than two months}} before the presidential election. He worked through the National Civic Federation which brought labor and capital representatives together. Relying on J. P. Morgan to convey his message to <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> a strike would hurt the reelection of Republican William McKinley, Hanna convinced the owners to concede a wage increase and grievance procedure to the strikers. The industry refused, on the other hand, to formally recognize the UMWA as the representative of the workers. The union declared victory and dropped its demand for union recognition.|$|E

25|$|ESA has a {{fleet of}} {{different}} launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market. ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs: Ariane 5, Soyuz-2 and Vega. Rocket launches are carried out by Arianespace, which has 23 shareholders representing <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as CNES, at ESA's Guiana Space Centre. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500m/s due to the higher rotational velocity of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.|$|E
25|$|The IPL line {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} pricing of Alberta oil {{to make it}} sensitive to international rather than regional factors. The wellhead price reflected {{the price of oil}} at Sarnia, less pipeline tolls for shipping it there. IPL is by far the longest crude oil pipeline in the western hemisphere. Looping, or constructing additional lines beside the original, expanded the Interprovincial system and allowed its extension into the American midwest and to upstate New York. In 1976, it was 3,680 kilometres through an extension to Montreal. Although it helped assure security of supply in the 1970s, the extension became a threat to Canadian oil producers after deregulation in 1985. With Montreal refineries using cheaper imported oil, there was concern within <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> a proposal to use the line to bring foreign oil into Sarnia might undermine traditional markets for Western Canadian petroleum.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} 1990s was {{a period}} of {{consolidation}} for the Chinese airline industry. Initially, China Southern looked to acquire several smaller non-profitable domestic carriers as it sought to highlight its expansion plans in an effort to raise funds; among the deals was the purchase of 60% shares of Guizhou Airlines. Due to the weakening economy amidst the 1997 Asian financial crisis and intense competition among the some 30 Chinese carriers, in 1998, CAAC considered a comprehensive restructuring of <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> would see the consolidation of the airlines into three or five carrier groups. At one stage, it was reported that CAAC was contemplating a forced merger of Air China and China Southern. Given the latter's dual listing in Hong Kong and New York, it was thought that such a merger would have eased Air China's path towards its own share offering. China Southern confirmed that such talks between them were occurring, although they ultimately proved fruitless. Had the merger proceeded, their combined fleets would have numbered some 250 aircraft, which would have made the resultant airline the largest in Asia.|$|E
