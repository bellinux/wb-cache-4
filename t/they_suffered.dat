Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad.

Their attack did indeed cause some initial confusion, but Bryennios (or, {{according to the}} Alexiad, his brother John, who commanded the right wing) rallied his men and led forth the second line. This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, they fell upon the Immortals, who also panicked and fled, abandoning their posts. Although <b>they</b> <b>suffered</b> some casualties from Bryennios's pursuing men, most managed to escape well {{to the rear of}} Alexios's army.|$|E
5|$|Bristol in {{the early}} 1960s had an {{estimated}} 3,000 residents of West Indian origin, some who {{had served in the}} British military during World War II and some who had emigrated to Britain more recently. A large number lived in the area around City Road in St Pauls. <b>They</b> <b>suffered</b> discrimination in housing and employment, and some encountered violence from Teddy Boy gangs of white British youths. This community set up their own churches and associations, including the West Indian Association, which began to act as a representative body.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011 Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} debilitating, {{widespread}} and costly health problems worldwide and has a high prevalence in almost every society. Research suggests that depression affects an individual‟s work engagement levels, burnout levels and the occurrence of stress-related ill health symptoms. However, it is unclear whether these findings would differ among individuals who reported that <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression and receive medical treatment for it, individuals who reported that they are unsure whether <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression, and individuals who reported that <b>they</b> do not <b>suffer</b> from depression. This study is quantitative in nature and a cross-sectional design was used. The study population consisted of 15 664 participants from several sectors in South Africa. The participants also differed in terms of gender, age, race, marital status, educational level, language and the province where they reside. The sample population was thus representative of the diverse population of South Africa. The SAEHWS, a self-report instrument based on the dual-process model of work-related well-being, was used to measure all constructs. The participants were divided into three groups, i. e. individuals who reported that <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression and are currently receiving medical treatment for depression, individuals who reported that they are uncertain whether <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression, and individuals who reported that <b>they</b> do not <b>suffer</b> from depression. Frequencies were used to determine the prevalence of depression in the three different groups and MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) was used to determine the significance of differences between the levels of work engagement, burnout and stress-related ill health symptoms of the three different groups (individuals who reported that <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression, individuals who reported that they are uncertain whether <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression, and those who reported that <b>they</b> do not <b>suffer</b> from depression). The results showed that 18, 3 % of the population reported that <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression and receive medical treatment for depression, 16, 7 % of the population reported that they are unsure whether <b>they</b> <b>suffer</b> from depression and 65 % reported that <b>they</b> do not <b>suffer</b> from depression. Furthermore, it was found that depression significantly influences work engagement levels negatively and that it significantly influences burnout levels and the occurrence of stress-related ill health symptoms positively. This study will make organisations aware of the effect of depression on an individual‟s well-being and of the fact that depression is a factor to be reckoned with. Employers should consider ways to assist employees who suffer from depression and should learn how to act preventatively to decrease any further occurrence. Master...|$|R

5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after <b>they</b> <b>suffered</b> blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E

Nevertheless, the 31st/51st Battalion continued to undertake patrols along the Ratsua front, during which <b>they</b> <b>suffered</b> further casualties, until they were withdrawn from combat operations on 28 June.
