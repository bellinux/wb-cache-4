50|$|The {{tanks were}} air pressurised, {{the fuel tank}} by engine {{compressor}} bleed air and the oxidiser tank by ram air and additionally by the stored air bottle. Ram air {{was taken from the}} supersonic inlet boundary layer bleeds. A single timer-controlled valve opened the stored air supply which then opened the pneumatic LP cocks. A second valve, after a delay, engaged the turbopump clutch. HP cocks were opened by a single hydraulic piston, driven by fuel pressure controlled through a third timed valve. Both fuel and oxidiser first flowed through a small pilot valve for ignition, before their main valves opened.

Readings of the modified meter have to be divided by the resistance factor (e.g. 100), and maximum measurable power is reduced by the same factor.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} {{form of the}} ARQ selective repeat protocol with <b>timer</b> <b>control</b> is studied. Transmissions on both the forward and the reverse channels are assumed to experience Markovian errors and therefore the feedback is unreliable. Feedback error recovery is made possible {{through the use of}} time diversity. Using results from renewal theory, exact results for the throughput of the protocol are evaluated. In order to overcome the complexity of the exact analytical technique, lower and upper bounds are developed. Simulation results, that confirm the analysis and document the tightness of the bounds are also shown, and a number of implementation issues are discussed. An application to mobile radio is also presented. It is shown that the use of an appropriate degree of time diversity makes it possible to approach the ideal protocol performance obtained with perfect feedback. 1 Introduction Most communication channels present some impairments.

40|$|Perennial plants {{live for}} more than 1 year and flower only after an {{extended}} vegetative phase. We used Arabis alpina, a perennial relative of annual Arabidopsis thaliana, to study how increasing age and exposure to winter cold (vernalization) coordinate to establish competence to flower. We show that the APETALA 2 transcription factor, a target of microRNA miR 172, prevents flowering before vernalization. Additionally, miR 156 levels decline as A. alpina ages, causing increased production of SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE) transcription factors and ensuring that flowering occurs in response to cold. The age at which plants respond to vernalization can be altered by manipulating miR 156 levels.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMillions {{of acres of}} the U.

The process of returning the land to the civilian sector is sensitive, intensive, and costly (e. g., millions of dollars, and the loss of human life). Hence'clearing (i. e., site remediation, range clearance, and explosive ordnance disposal) UXO's from FUDS is a complex problem. Existing clearing methods are inaccurate, dangerous, and labor intensive. This thesis shows that through robotics technology (e. g., Shepherd rotary vehicle with three degrees of freedom) and the use of advanced computer technology it is possible to make clearing tasks safer, more cost effective, and more efficient. An over arching hardware and software architecture was developed for Shepherd (including a self- contained on board computer system). The software system was developed for <b>timer</b> <b>control,</b> motion control, user interface, and an operating kernel. The hardware and software organization, structure, and interaction provide the framework for real-time control.
