The high mortality rate after DMSO injection matches previous results for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs [15],[16]. For O. mykiss mortality rates after the injection of DMSO, acetone, and dioxane {{were found to be}} higher than 60 %.

40|$|This {{study of}} the Arabidopsis thaliana nitrate {{transporter}} NRT 1. 6 indicated that nitrate is important for early embryo development. Functional analysis of cDNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes showed that NRT 1. 6 is a low-affinity nitrate transporter and does not transport dipeptides. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, and β-glucuronidase reporter gene analysis showed that expression of NRT 1. 6 is only detectable in reproductive tissue (the vascular tissue of the silique and funiculus) and that expression increases immediately after pollination, suggesting that NRT 1. 6 is involved in delivering nitrate from maternal tissue to the developing embryo. In nrt 1. 6 mutants, the amount of nitrate accumulated in mature seeds was reduced and the seed abortion rate increased. In the mutants, abnormalities (i. e., excessive cell division and loss of turgidity), were found mainly in the suspensor cells at the one- or <b>two-cell</b> <b>stages</b> of embryo development. The phenotype of the nrt 1. 6 mutants revealed a novel role of nitrate in early embryo development. Interestingly, the seed abortion rate of the mutant was reduced when grown under N-deficient conditions, suggesting that nitrate requirements in early embryo development can be modulated in response to external nitrogen changes...|$|R

50|$|In normal {{monozygotic}} twin development, one egg is fertilized {{by a single}} sperm. The egg will then completely split into two, normally at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> If the egg splits in the early blastocyst stage, two inner cell masses will be present, eventually leading to the twins sharing the same chorion and placenta, but with separate amnions. However, the egg can split into two, but still have one blastocyst. This will lead to one inner cell mass and one blastocyst. Then, as the twins develop, they will share the same placenta, chorion, and amnion.

50|$|Ectodermin mRNA is maternally {{deposited}} in the animal pole of the egg. In the early blastula stage of the embryo, Ectodermin mRNA and protein forms a gradient that goes from the animal pole (highest concentration) down to the marginal zone (lowest concentration) to prevent TGFβ and nodal signals that induce mesoderm originating from the vegetal pole. Ectodermin mRNA is enriched in the dorsal side of the embryo, {{and at the end}} of this stage the expression gradually disappears. Smad4 is ubiquitinated by Ectodermin in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm where it can be deubiquitinated by FAM; this way Smad4 can be recycled and be functional again. Although there is no expression profile of FAM in early embryos in Xenopus, in the zebra fish, FAM homolog is expressed ubiquitously at a <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> but as development proceeds then its only expressed in the cephalic central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|In mouse embryos, SALL4 {{expression}} is detectable {{as early as}} the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> Its expression persists through 8- and 16-cell stages to the blastocyst, where it is found in some cells of the trophectoderm and inner cell mass (ICM), from which mouse ESCs are derived. SALL4 is an important factor for maintaining the “stemness” of ESCs of both mouse and human origin, since loss of Sall4 leads to differentiation of these pluripotent cells down the trophectoderm lineage. This is possibly due to down-regulation of Pou5f1 (encoding Oct4) expression and up-regulation of caudal-type homeobox 2 (Cdx2) gene expression. Sall4 is part of the transcriptional regulatory network that includes other pluripotent factors such as Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 Because of its important role in early development, genetically mutated mice without functioning SALL4 die early on at the peri-implantation stage, while heterozygous mice have neural, kidney, heart defects and limb abnormalities.|$|E

40|$|The Caenorhabditis elegans coiled-coil protein LIN- 5 mediates several {{processes}} in cell division {{that depend on}} spindle forces, including alignment and segregation of chromosomes and positioning of the spindle. Here, we describe two closely related proteins, GPR- 1 and GPR- 2 (Gprotein regulator), which associate with LIN- 5 in vivo and in vitro and depend on LIN- 5 for localization to the spindle and cell cortex. GPR- 1 /GPR- 2 contain a GoLoco/GPR motif that mediates interaction with GDP-bound Gαi/o. Inactivation of lin- 5, gpr- 1 /gpr- 2, or the Gαi/o genes goa- 1 and gpa- 16 all cause highly similar chromosome segregation and spindle positioning defects, indicating a positive role for the LIN- 5 and GPR proteins in G protein signaling. The lin- 5 and gpr- 1 /gpr- 2 genes appear to act downstream of the par polarity genes in the one- and <b>two-cell</b> <b>stages</b> and downstream of the tyrosine kinase-related genes mes- 1 and src- 1 at the four-cell stage.

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{stages of}} genome {{activation}} {{have been identified}} in the mouse embryo. Specifically, minor transcriptional activation is evident at the one-cell stage and a second major episode of activation occurs at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> Nuclear translocation of RNA polymerase II and phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest enzyme subunit are major determinants of embryonic genome activation. P-TEFb, the Pol II CTD kinase, regulates transcriptional elongation via phosphorylation of the serine 2 residues of the CTD. Results Here, we show that the CDK 9 and cyclin T 1 subunits of P-TEFb are present in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Both proteins translocate to pronuclei at the late one-cell stage and are predominantly localized in nuclei at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> We additionally examine the effects of the CDK 9 -specific inhibitor, flavopiridol, on mouse preimplantation development. Our data show that treatment with the drug results in mislocalization of CDK 9, cyclin T 1, and phosphorylated Pol II, as well as developmental arrest at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> Conclusions A change in CDK 9 localization from the cytoplasm to the pronucleus occurs at the time of minor embryonic genome activation, and CDK 9 accumulation at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> is evident, concomitant with major transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome. Moreover, CDK 9 inhibition triggers a developmental block at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> Our findings clearly indicate that CDK 9 is essential for embryonic genome activation in the mouse. </p...|$|E
40|$|In mice, {{transcription}} {{from the}} zygotic genome {{starts at the}} mid-one-cell stage after fertilization. Previous studies showed that an enhancer is not required for transcription at this stage, and that the enhancer-dependent mechanism of transcription is established during the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> However, these results were obtained using reporter gene assays with promoters derived from viruses, rather than from endogenous genes. We conducted a reporter-gene assay using the promoter of Tktl 1, which is transcribed after fertilization, to investigate the mechanism regulating gene expression at the one-cell stage. When a plasmid containing the 2467 bp upstream and 25 bp downstream of the Tktl 1 transcription start site (TSS) was microinjected into the nuclei of growing oocytes, and one-cell stage and early and late two-cell-stage embryos, transcriptional activity was detected in the one-cell- and two-cell-stage embryos, {{but not in the}} oocytes. It was highest at the early <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> and was reduced at the late <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> The decrease in activity at the late <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> was prevented by inhibiting the second round of DNA replication, suggesting that the transcriptionally repressive state is established during the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> by a mechanism coupled to DNA replication. When the Tktl 1 promoter was deleted to leave 56 bp upstream of the TSS which includes GC and TATA boxes, transcriptional activity was still detected in one-cell-stage embryos, but not early or late two-cell-stage embryos.

However, when a number of embryos have similar characteristics, the selection of the best embryos is left to chance. Recently, we proposed a simple, novel method to overcome this problem, based on pre-selection of embryos cleaving early to the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> In this study we have adopted the same method to choose embryos fertilized after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Fertilized embryos that had cleaved to the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> by 27 h post-injection were designated as 'early cleavage' embryos, while those that had not yet reached the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> were designated as 'no early cleavage'.

No differences between the groups were found when comparing key parameters (age, stimulation protocol and semen characteristics) of the couples.

We draw a parallel between these data and the burst of pericentric satellite transcription that occurs concomitantly with the dynamic reorganization of the pericentric domains into chromocenters in <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> embryos.

40|$|Two large {{families}} of retrotransposons, that is, LINE- 1 (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements- 1) and endogenous retroviruses, encode reverse transcriptase (RT) proteins in vertebrates. We previously showed that mouse preimplantation embryos are endowed with an endogenous, functional RT activity. Inhibiting that activity by microinjecting antisense oligonucleotides against a highly active LINE- 1 family member in mouse oocytes blocked developmental progression between the two- and four-blastomere stages, indicating that LINE- 1 -encoded RT activity is strictly required at this critical transition in early development. Here {{we show that}} incubation of mouse zygotes with 5 '-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) yields massive incorporation of this nucleoside analogue in newly synthesized DNA; surprisingly, a significant incorporation still occurs in both zygotic pronuclei {{in the presence of}} aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA replication. This aphidicolin-resistant BrdU incorporation is quantitatively abolished when embryos are simultaneously exposed to abacavir, a nucleoside RT inhibitor, indicating its retrotranscription-dependent nature. Moreover, quantitative PCR analysis revealed a burst of new synthesis of LINE- 1 copies at the zygote- and <b>two-cell</b> embryo <b>stages.</b> These findings support the conclusion that RT-dependent amplification of LINE- 1 retrotransposons is a distinctive feature of early embryonic genomes.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was {{to find out which}} donor cells would be most {{suitable}} for production of cloned rabbits with a targeted modification of their genome, and their corresponding patterns of reprogramming hetero- and euchromatic histone modifications (H 3 K 4 m 2 / 3 and H 3 K 27 m 3). For these purposes, we carried out NT with rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and adult fibroblasts (RAFs). As totally 13 cell lines of MSCs have been tested, they didn’t show stably higher development potential than RAFs, even though the blastocyst rate of embryos cloned from MSC A/B reached to 76 %. Finally two cloned rabbits were produced from meschnymal stem cells. H 3 K 27 m 3 was undetectable in all stages of nuclear transfer embryos except for one cell stage and blastocysts. It seems that H 3 K 27 m 3 is faithfully reprogrammed in transferred nuclei of all donor cell types, with minor differences in zygotes and blastocysts. Strong signals for H 3 K 4 m 2 / 3 were detected at the one to <b>two-cell</b> <b>stages</b> of in vivo embryos with a slight decrease at the 4 -cell stage, followed by a more drastic decrease at the 8 -cell stage, where the signal minimum was reached. In 16 -cell embryos signals slightly increased and then reached in morulae and blastocysts the levels observed in one-two cell embryos. In all types of nuclear transfer embryos fluorescence intensity ratios differed from that of in vivo embryos. The minimum was not reached at the 8 -cell stage but at the 4 -cell stage. Reprogramming of H 3 K 4 m 2 / 3 modification occurred quite differently with either type of cells irrespective of the cell origin or type and no close similarities in the patterns of this reprogramming was observed between in vivo and nuclear transfer embryos. Embryos cloned from MSC A/B differed from all others in the way that H 3 K 4 m 2 / 3 was generally lower and remained in the range of the donor cells. This suggests that reprogramming of H 3 K 4 m 2 / 3 modification is more aberrant with MSC A/B cells than with any other cell type used in this study. However, with MSC A/B cells, a significantly higher or similar proportion of cloned embryos developed to blastocysts indicating that reprogramming of H 3 K 4 m 2 / 3 modification does not correlate with developmental potential of donor cells. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that histone modifications for heterochromatin are faithfully reprogrammed during NT of rabbit somatic cells, while patterns of epigenetic reprogramming of euchromatic histone modifications differ between individual cell lines irrespective of their origin or type and are not correlated with their developmental potential. Although MSCs were not superior to RAFs in respect to the criteria tested in our study they may be suitable nuclear donors for generating transgenic cloned rabbits due to their high developmental plasticity...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{equalization}} of pericentric heterochromatin from distinct parental origins following fertilization {{is essential}} for genome function and development. The recent implication of noncoding transcripts in this process raises questions regarding the connection between RNA and the nuclear organization of distinct chromatin environments.

We examined whether a vitrification method using cryoprotectant solutions, P 10 and PEPeS, is suitable for preservation of multiple inbred and outbred mouse strains. First, we investigated whether our vitrification method using cryoprotectant solutions was suitable for <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> mouse embryos. In vitro development of embryos exposed to the cryoprotectant solutions was similar to that of fresh controls. Further, the survival rate of the vitrified embryos was extremely high (98. 1 %).

In vivo development did not differ significantly between fresh controls and vitrified embryos of each strain. For strain preservation using cryopreserved embryos, two offspring for inbred lines and one offspring for outbred lines must be produced from <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> embryos collected from one female.

We report here that NHERF 1 controls gland morphogenesis, as demonstrated in three-dimensional (3 D) human intestinal glands developing from a single nonpolarized cell. Starting from the early <b>two-cell</b> developmental <b>stage,</b> NHERF 1 concentrates at the cellular interface in a central membrane disc that marks the apical pole delimiting the forming lumen. NHERF 1 depletion leads to severe disruption of the apical-basal polarity, with formation of enlarged and distorted cell spheroids devoid of a central lumen. This characteristic and the increased number of mitoses in NHERF 1 -depleted spheroids, including multipolar ones, mimic high-grade dysplasia lesions observed in CRC progression. NHERF 1 ERM-binding or PDZ-domain mutants fail to localize apically and impair gland formation most likely by outcompeting endogenous ligands, with the latter mutant completely aborting gland development. Examination of NHERF 1 ligands showed that even if both ezrin and moesin colocalized with NHERF 1 at the apical membrane, moesin but not ezrin depletion disrupted morphogenesis similarly to NHERF 1. NHERF 1 depletion resulted also in membrane displacement of PTEN and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, events contributing to polarity loss and increased proliferation.

Hypoxanthine prevented embryo development past the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> at concentrations as low as 30 nM, and this inhib-itory activity required the presence of n-glucose. The action of hypoxanthine plus n-glucose was reversed by glutamine and higher lactate. n-mannose substituted for n-glucose in supporting the inhibitory action of hypoxanthine, but L-glucose, D-fructose, and 2 -deoxyglucose were much less effective. Other purine derivatives such as inosine and adenosine, but not xanthosine or uric acid, also blocked development at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> at a concentration of 30 1 aM, and guanosine was inhibitory at higher doses. Assays of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity in lysates of four-cell embryos determined that the drugs 6 -mercapto- 9 -(tetrahydro- 2 -furyl) -purine (MPTF) and 6 -mercaptopurine (6 -MP), but not 6 -azauridine (6 -AzaU), prevented salvage of hypoxanthine. In addition, MPTF and 6 -MP produced a significant two-cell block, which did not depend upon the presence of hypoxanthine or n-glucose; whereas 6 -AzaU was without effect. When embryos were cultured 2 days in {{the presence or absence}} of n-glucose, hypoxanthine salvage was significantly reduced in lysates of four-cell embryos exposed to n-glucose. n-glucose had no effect when added directly to the assay mixture. These data demonstrate that the ability of hypoxanthine to block embryo development at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> depends on the presence of n-glucose or other glycolyzable sugars and suggest that inhibition of the purine salvage pathway promotes the two-cell block...|$|E
40|$|The AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) mediates rapid, stress-induced {{loss of the}} {{inhibitor}} of differentiation (Id) 2 in blastocysts and trophoblast stem cells (TSC), and a lasting differentiation in TSC. However, {{it is not known}} if AMPK regulates other potency factors or regulates them before the blastocyst stage. The caudal-related homeodomain protein (Cdx) 2 is a regulatory gene for determining TSC, the earliest placental lineage in the preimplantation mouse embryo, but is expressed in the oocyte and in early cleavage stage embryos before TSC arise. We assayed the expression of putative potency-maintaining phosphorylated Cdx 2 ser 60 in the oocyte, <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> embryo, blastocyst, and in TSC. We studied the loss of Cdx 2 phospho ser 60 expression induced by hyperosmolar stress and its underlying mechanisms. Hyperosmolar stress caused rapid loss of nuclear Cdx 2 phospho ser 60 and Id 2 in the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> embryo by 0. 5 h. Stress-induced Cdx 2 phospho ser 60 and Id 2 loss is reversed by the AMPK inhibitor compound C and is induced by the AMPK agonist 5 -amino- 1 -beta-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole- 4 -carboxamide in the absence of stress. In the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage</b> embryo and TSC hyperosmolar, stress caused AMPK-mediated loss of Cdx 2 phospho ser 60 as detected by immunofluorescence and immunoblot. We propose that AMPK may be the master regulatory enzyme for mediating stress-induced loss of potency as AMPK is also required for stress-induced loss of Id 2 in blastocysts and TSC. Since AMPK mediates potency loss in embryos and stem cells it will be important to measure, test mechanisms for, and manage the AMPK function to optimize the stem cell and embryo quality in vitro and in vivo. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe early {{development}} of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos {{is characterized by}} a series of asymmetric divisions in which the mitotic spindle is repeatedly oriented on the same axis due to a rotation of the nuclear–centrosome complex. To identify genes involved in the control of spindle orientation, we have screened maternal-effect lethal mutants for alterations in cleavage pattern. Here we describe mutations in ooc- 5 and ooc- 3, which were isolated {{on the basis of a}} nuclear rotation defect in the P 1 cell of two-cell embryos. These mutations are novel in that they affect the asymmetric localization of PAR proteins at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage,</b> but not at the one-cell stage. In wild-type two-cell embryos, PAR- 3 protein is present around the entire periphery of the AB cell and prevents nuclear rotation in this cell. In contrast, PAR- 2 functions to allow nuclear rotation in the P 1 cell by restricting PAR- 3 localization to the anterior periphery of P 1. In ooc- 5 and ooc- 3 mutant embryos, PAR- 3 was mislocalized around the periphery of P 1, while PAR- 2 was reduced or absent. The germ-line-specific P granules were also mislocalized at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage.</b> Mutations in ooc- 5 and ooc- 3 also result in reduced-size oocytes and embryos. However, par- 3 ooc double-mutant embryos can exhibit nuclear rotation, indicating that small size per se does not prevent rotation and that PAR- 3 mislocalization contributes to the failure of rotation in ooc mutants. We therefore postulate that wild-type ooc- 5 and ooc- 3 function in oogenesis and in the reestablishment of asymmetric domains of PAR proteins at the <b>two-cell</b> <b>stage...</b>|$|E
40|$|This is an {{electronic}} {{version of an}} article published in Informa Healthcare, Tateno, Hiroyuki; Kusakabe, Hirokazu; Kamiguchi, Yujiroh, International Journal of Radiation Biology, 87 (3), 2011, 320 - 329. Purpose: To quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the changes in chromosomal aberrations during early cleavage in mouse embryos derived from γ-irradiated spermatozoa. Materials and methods: Mature males were exposed to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy of ^ Cs γ-rays, and their spermatozoa were used to produce embryos via in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The metaphase chromosomes were prepared from one-cell, two-cell, and four-cell embryos. In the chromosome preparations from two-cell and four-cell embryos, the separation of the sister blastomeres was precluded by treatment of the embryos with concanavalin A. The incidence of embryos with structural chromosomal aberrations, aneuploidy, or mosaicism was estimated. The fates of the different types of γ-ray-induced structural chromosomal aberrations were also investigated in those embryos. Results: The exposure of spermatozoa to 2 [*]Gy or 4 [*]Gy γ-rays caused structural chromosomal aberrations in 25. 9 % and 35. 7 % of the resultant one-cell embryos, respectively. At <b>two-cell</b> embryonic <b>stage,</b> the incidence of structural chromosomal aberrations was 17. 4 % in the 2 [*]Gy group and 27. 1 % in the 4 [*]Gy group. At the four-cell embryonic stage, although the incidence of control embryos with structural chromosomal aberrations was considerably high, the net incidence of embryos with radiation-induced structural chromosomal aberrations was similar to that at the one-cell stage. The incidence of aneuploidy was high in two-cell and four-cell embryos after both doses of γ-rays. The incidence of mosaicism increased significantly in dose- and embryonic-stage-dependent manners. Anaphase lag, and the degeneration and non-disjunction of the aberrant chromosomes were frequently observed in aneuploid and mosaic embryos. Conclusions: Mouse sperm DNA is highly vulnerable to γ-rays. The structural chromosomal aberrations of sperm origin are unstable in their behaviour and structure during cleavage, and therefore cause secondary aneuploidy and mosaicism in the early cleavage embryos...|$|R
40|$|A {{key factor}} {{in the use of}} {{assisted}} reproductive technologies (ART) for diverse species is the safety of procedures for long-term health. By using a mouse model, we have investigated the effect of in vitro culture and embryo transfer (ET) of superovulated embryos on postnatal growth and physiological activity compared with that of embryos developing in vivo. Embryo culture from <b>two-cell</b> to blastocyst <b>stages</b> in T 6 medium either with or without a protein source reduced blastocyst trophectoderm and inner cell mass cell number compared with that of embryos developing in vivo. Embryo culture and ET had minimal effects on postnatal growth when compared with in vivo development with an equivalent litter size. However, embryo culture, {{and to a lesser extent}} ET, led to an enhanced systolic blood pressure at 21 weeks compared with in vivo development independent of litter size, maternal origin, or body weight. Moreover, activity of enzymatic regulators of cardiovascular and metabolic physiology, namely, serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and the gluconeogenesis controller, hepatic phosphoeno/pyruvate carboxykinase, were significantly elevated in response to embryo culture and/or ET in female offspring at 27 weeks, independent of maternal factors and postnatal growth. These animal data indicate that postnatal physiological criteria important in cardiovascular and metabolic health may be more sensitive to routine ART procedures than growth...|$|R
40|$|A {{microinjection}} {{technique has}} been devised for labelling individual blastomeres of pre-implantation mouse embryos with a marker drop of inert silicone fluid {{placed in the}} cytoplasm either at {{the periphery of the}} egg or at the interface between two blastomeres (i. e. centrally). The following observations were made on blastocysts which developed from injected eggs: (1) All drops derived from peripheral injections (at <b>two-cell</b> to morula <b>stage)</b> were found exclusively in the trophoblast. (2) Drops injected centrally at two- and four-cell stages have been found in both the tropho-blast and inner cell mass. (3) Peripheral labelling of one or both members of a pair of eggs (four-cell to morula) fused into a chimaeric blastocyst yielded markers in both trophoblast and inner cell mass. No evidence was found of inherent bilateral symmetry or polarity in the cleaving egg. The results indicate that physico-chemical positional effects determine whether a cell will dif-ferentiate into trophoblast or inner cell mass. The results are discussed in the light of current hypotheses relating to early embryonic differentiation in the mammal, and it is suggested that cleavage occurs without spatial dis-turbance of the cytoplasmic pattern of the egg so that its cortical region is converted directly to the outer cells of the morula and hence to the trophoblast...|$|R
