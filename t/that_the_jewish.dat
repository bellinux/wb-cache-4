5|$|Other critics even {{in later}} years insisted that the {{character}} of Shylock is that of an outsider separated from society, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> Shylock represented an older form of justice, meant to be supplanted by the Christian view, represented by Portia, who argued for the prevalence of mercy. Shylock, these critics maintained, must be removed {{in order to allow}} society to attain a Christian form of peace. Hazlitt's view, however, has remained as a valid countervailing concept of the play, one that does not arrive at easy conclusions or take sides readily.|$|E

In case the {{previous}} year had started after the equinox, two Passovers would be celebrated in the same solar year (the solar New Year was starting on March 21). Since the 3rd century this disorder of the Jewish calendar of the time was lamented by several Christian writers, who felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> were often using a wrong lunation as their Nisan month and advocated the introduction of an independent computus by the Christians.|$|E
