25|$|Network Externality {{positively}} {{affects the}} cultural commons in many ways. The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

Brian wonders if a hypothetical external viewer of the simulation would feel cheated by what was ultimately a [...] "dream sequence," [...] but Stewie argues that a computer simulation is totally different. Stewie then claims {{that he is not}} yet ready to kill Lois or take over the world, until the right time. Brian tells Stewie that hypothetical viewers would be angered by the simulation. Stewie counters by saying that at least the simulation didn't end like the final episode of The Sopranos, where it just cut to black mid-sentence. As Stewie is saying this, the scene cuts to black mid-sentence.|$|E

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if the Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{was already}} aware of certain stirrings even before he {{received}} the letter, Cecil did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who was involved and had elected to watch <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen.</b> [...] When Monteagle's letter was shown to the king on Friday 1November, James felt that it hinted at [...] "some strategem of fire and powder", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, in 1567. [...] The following day, members of the Privy Council visited James to inform him that a search would be made of the Houses of Parliament, [...] "both above and below". [...] Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain. [...] Fellow plotter Thomas Percy said he was ready to [...] "abide the uttermost trial", and subsequently on 4November Catesby and several others left London for the Midlands to prepare for the planned uprising.|$|E

Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. [...] We wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E

500|$|Teach had at some stage learnt of {{the offer}} of a royal pardon and {{probably}} confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it. [...] The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5January. [...] Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach {{at risk of being}} hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions. [...] Teach thought that Governor Charles Eden was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> to another captain. [...] Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon. [...] He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the Revenge and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to Saint Thomas Island to receive a commission. [...] Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him. [...] He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27September 1718 {{at the mouth of the}} Cape Fear River. [...] All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.|$|E

This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." [...] Before continuing with the storyline, the show's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout. Trish Doolan, star of April's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place, and surmised that; [...] "They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they're focusing on in the woman-woman relationship", with Nikki Weiss, who also consulted, adding: [...] "they didn't want to stereotype anything either, and write from a place where they didn't understand it. [...] I don't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike. I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters, and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of— I think they just have a chemistry together, as actresses, too. You could tell that in the room. They definitely have a chemistry." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to this many modern Marian apparitions included prophecies in them about the world and about the local areas. The Fátima apparition in 1917 included a prophecy given by Mary to three children, that on October 13, 1917 {{there would be a}} great miracle for all to see at Fátima, Portugal, and on that day {{tens of thousands of people}} headed to Fátima <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> including newspaper journalists. Many witnesses, including journalists, claimed to see the sun [...] "dance" [...] in the sky in the afternoon of that day, exactly as the visionaries had predicted several months before. The Kibeho apparition in Rwanda in the 1980s included many prophecies about great violence and destruction that was coming, and the Rwandan genocide only ten years later was interpreted by the visionaries as the fulfilment of these prophecies ...|$|E

After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a local day spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a [...] "bit harsh" [...] {{because it was too}} soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson). The actor stated that viewers would have to wait <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> between Lynsey and Gilly, but believed that there was no comparison when it came to her and Steph.|$|E
2500|$|Starting 23 July, all of Germany's leaders {{returned}} secretly to Berlin to {{deal with}} the crisis they had in large part initiated. A division emerged at various meetings of the Reich’s leadership between those led by the chancellor who wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> following an Austrian attack on Serbia, and the military led by Moltke and Falkenhayn, who urged that Germany immediately follow up an Austrian attack on Serbia with a German attack on Russia. Moltke repeatedly stated that 1914 would be the best time for starting a [...] "preventive war" [...] from the German point of view, or the Russian Great Military Programme would finish by 1917, making Germany unable to ever again risk a war. Moltke added that Russian mobilization was regarded as an opportunity to be sought rather than as a sort of threat, as it would allow Germany to go to war while presenting it as forced on Germany. The German military attaché in Russia reported that Russian preparations for mobilization were on a much smaller scale than was expected. Though Moltke at first argued that Germany should wait for Russia to mobilize before beginning the [...] "preventive war", {{by the end of the}} week he urged that Germany should launch it anyway. In Moltke's view, in order to invade France successfully, Germany would need to seize the Belgian fortress of Liège by surprise. The longer the diplomatic action continued, the less likely Moltke thought that Liège could be stormed by surprise, and if Liège were not taken, then the entire Schlieffen Plan would be unhinged.|$|E
