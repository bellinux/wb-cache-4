5|$|Slavonia is a {{distinct}} region of Croatia in terms of ethnological factors in <b>traditional</b> music. It is a region where <b>traditional</b> culture is preserved through folklore festivals. Typical <b>traditional</b> music instruments belong to the tamburica and bagpipe family. The tamburica is the most representative musical instrument associated with Slavonia's <b>traditional</b> culture. It developed from music instruments brought by the Ottomans during their rule of Slavonia, becoming {{an integral part of}} the <b>traditional</b> music, its use surpassing or even replacing the use of bagpipes and gusle. A distinct form of <b>traditional</b> song, originating in Slavonia, the bećarac, is recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|When {{the forms}} of <b>traditional</b> power come to an end, there {{tends to be a}} {{corresponding}} change in creeds. If the <b>traditional</b> creeds are doubted without any alternative, then the <b>traditional</b> authority relies more and more on the use of naked power. And where the <b>traditional</b> creeds are wholly replaced with alternative ones, <b>traditional</b> power gives rise to revolutionary power (Russell 1938:82).|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{admits that}} there may be death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but says {{that it was not a}} conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor <b>traditional,</b> and even the harp songs are not <b>traditional</b> works, though they are influenced by the <b>traditional</b> music of the United Kingdom and <b>traditional</b> Irish music.|$|E

5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} <b>traditional</b> arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on <b>traditional</b> wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of <b>traditional</b> culture fell out of the mainstream after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the <b>traditional</b> styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E

5|$|During World WarII, tourist travel fell sharply, {{staffing}} was cut, {{and many}} facilities fell into disrepair. By the 1950s, visitation increased tremendously in Yellowstone and other national parks. To accommodate the increased visitation, park officials implemented Mission66, {{an effort to}} modernize and expand park service facilities. Planned {{to be completed by}} 1966, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Park Service, Mission66 construction diverged from the <b>traditional</b> log cabin style with design features of a modern style. During the late 1980s, most construction styles in Yellowstone reverted to the more <b>traditional</b> designs. After the enormous forest fires of 1988 damaged much of Grant Village, structures there were rebuilt in the <b>traditional</b> style.
