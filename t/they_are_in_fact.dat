5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be described by a single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Vincent first {{appears in}} the December 16, 2004 episode as his alter-ego Valerie Davis. While working as an {{executive}} assistant to Crane Industries' vice president Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald, Valerie is characterized through her connection with the Crane family and past sexual encounter with Chad Harris-Crane. Vincent had fabricated a backstory for Valerie to maintain the illusion that they were two separate people. Valerie joins Crane Industries to change its lack of minority employees. Initially appearing as a supporting character, Valerie helps Ivy Winthrop in her attempts to break up Fox Crane and Kay Bennett and supports Chad during their job. She gains more prominence when Eve catches her having sex with Julian; they engage in a catfight with Eve accusing Valerie of using sex to climb the corporate ladder. During this time, Whitney Russell suspects that Valerie is {{having an affair with}} Chad. Vincent is first seen outside of his split-personality when he introduces himself as a tabloid reporter at Chad and Whitney's wedding on December 26, 2006. Whitney sets up Vincent and Valerie as a couple without knowing <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> the same person.|$|E

25|$|Scottish and Northern Irish {{banknotes}} are unusual, firstly {{because they}} are issued by retail banks, not central banks, and secondly, as they are technically not legal tender anywhere in the UK – not even in Scotland or Northern Ireland – <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> promissory notes.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} to postulate that the long vowels and diphthongs should be counted as separate single phonemes, because they can be treated as sequences of two vowels. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> historically derived from two-syllable sequences. This is easily seen in the synchronic co-existence of allomorphic pairs of Hawaiian forms such as kolu with -kou, both meaning 'three'.|$|E
25|$|The Antlia Dwarf and NGC 3109 may be {{actually}} physically bound if {{the distance}} between them is not very large. However their velocity relative to each other—43nbsp&km/s makes it questionable whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> a bound system, especially if {{the distance between}} them is closer to the upper limit—180nbsp&kpc. If they are gravitationally bound, their total mass may be as high as 78 billion solar masses.|$|E

25|$|The method then {{consists}} in placing oneself within the Duration, which always contains {{a sense of}} all the other Durations within the absolute Duration. From here, one should expand their Duration into a continuous heterogeneity. Once this is done, one differentiates two extremities within the Duration to create a dualism, just as one differentiates between red and yellow within the colour spectrum, before showing <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> one.|$|E
25|$|The palace, {{along with}} the other {{properties}} given back to Simeon II, {{has been the subject of}} much controversy in the Bulgarian media and society in the 2000s, as many argue <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> supposed to be public property. Since June 2013, the park has been opened to the public on weekends. The special public transport bus 505, which only runs on weekends during the park's opening hours, connects the palace with Eagles' Bridge.|$|E
25|$|The novel Marriage in Heaven {{depicts the}} {{correspondence}} between two male friends, {{an artist and}} a common man, who complain {{to each other about}} their failures in love: the former complains about a lover who wanted his children when he did not, while the other recalls being abandoned by a woman who, despite his intentions, did not want to become pregnant by him.

50|$|The Villard Houses are {{sometimes}} misattributed to Wells, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> built more than 20 {{years after he}} died, and were actually designed by Joseph M. Wells (1853-1890) of the McKim, Mead & White firm.|$|R
25|$|Then, {{there is}} the {{question}} of the last three poems that were found among her papers. They seem to be in her handwriting, which is why Killigrew’s father added them to her book. The poems are about the despair the author has for another woman, and could possibly be autobiographical if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> by Killigrew. Some of her other poems are about failed friendships, possibly with Anne Finch, so this assumption may have some validity.|$|E
25|$|Until {{recently}} ambrosia beetles {{have been}} placed in independent families Scolytidae and Platypodidae, however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> some of the most highly derived weevils.Marvaldi, A.

25|$|The unique {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} lampreys, {{such as their}} cartilaginous skeleton, suggest they are the sister taxon (see cladistics) of all living jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes), and are usually considered the most basal group of the Vertebrata. Instead of true vertebrae, they {{have a series of}} cartilaginous structures called arcualia arranged above the notochord. Hagfish, which resemble lampreys, have traditionally been considered the sister taxon of the true vertebrates (lampreys and gnathostomes) but DNA evidence suggests that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> the sister taxon of lampreys.|$|E

25|$|As {{shown in}} the cladogram, Phodopus roborovskii is sister to Phodopus campbelli + Phodopus sungorus. The {{validity}} of P. campbelli as a species has been controversial. Some biologists consider {{it to be a}} subspecies of P. sungorus. Neumann et al. determined that, at least for cytochrome b, P. campbelli and P. sungorus do not display the level of genetic divergence characteristic of sister rodent species. Both taxa have 2n=28 chromosomes. However, evidence from hybridization with P. sungorus has suggested to some researchers that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> separate species.|$|E
25|$|Burden of production: P has to {{show some}} {{evidence}} that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then {{it is up to}} the jury itself to decide if <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> convinced of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).|$|E
25|$|The second {{so-called}} sura, entitled al-Hafd (haste) {{translates as}} follows: 'O Allah, we worship You and to You we pray and prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.' Obviously these two pieces constitute so-called 'qunut', i.e. supplications which Muhammad sometimes {{said in the}} morning prayer or witr prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> identical to some parts of qunut reported in the collections of hadith.
