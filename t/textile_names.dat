40|$|In {{this study}} I examine {{changes that have}} taken place in several {{distinct}} traditions of Ewe weaving in different areas of the Volta region of Ghana and southern Togo in the 19 th and 20 th centuries through an account based upon field research in Ghana and Togo, textiles in museum collections, and archival and secondary sources. This research provides a description of techniques, materials and motifs, and investigates the development of these textiles’ forms and industries, the relationship between their histories and the emergence of 20 th century Ewe identities, the social networks of making and marketing these cloths, and the significance of patterns and designs within the wider domains of social practice. The study shows that change lies at the core of these textile traditions, and argues that to understand the ways in which these changes have occurred, one must understand the technology (chapter two), local fabric classifications (chapter three) and concepts of creativity (chapter eight), the education system (chapter six), the production (chapter six), consumption (chapter five) and distribution (chapter seven) of the textiles, and the practice of designing a new pattern (chapter eight). The research highlights interrelationships with Yoruba and Asante textiles; documents mutual influences in detail (chapter three), not only through physical contact between weavers, but also through trade in textiles; and formulates new hypotheses on the early evolution of design and techniques of Ewe and Asante weaving (chapter four). This research not only looks at the historical process of naming cloths, but also focuses on the intricate relationship between <b>textile</b> <b>names</b> and actual types of cloth, both geographically as well as historically. This is a relationship {{that turns out to be}} far from unilateral (chapter three). Furthermore, the historical and geographical trajectories of the main types of textiles are encapsulated in this classification, and in local terminology of equipments and techniques. This study also provides a detailed account of the Ewe ethno genesis (chapter one) and demonstrates that such an identity plays a limited role in the production and use of textiles from the Ewe-speaking region (chapter five). In the concluding chapter, I consider the reasons for the impressive diversity of Ewe textiles and for developments in design. I argue that the creative ability of weavers to survive in a harsh economic environment to satisfy customers’ demand, which often lacks specificity, by experimenting with leftover materials, is the main force that directs design changes and therefore accounts for the varied developments in Ewe textiles. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 DG Enterprise and Industry {{requested}} the European Commission’s DG-JRC to technical evaluate a petition submitted by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont). This petition {{requested the}} creation of a new generic fibre name under the Directive 2008 / 121 /EC on <b>textile</b> <b>names,</b> now repealed by the EU Regulation 1007 / 2011. This would allow distinguishing between their fibre, polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) and, in particular, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), the two most common types of polyesters. Although the three polyesters are very similar in terms of chemical composition, according to DuPont, PTT fibres have a set of improved properties that justify the petition. As identification and quantification methods are required in order to allow market surveillance of textile products, the JRC was responsible for the verification of the test methods proposed by the applicant and for the development and validation of the new required ones. Regarding identification, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy can distinguish between PTT, PET and PBT. This distinction can be achieved also using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), but only on the basis of their crystallisation peaks, since the melting peaks of PTT and PBT occur at the same temperature. The mechanical properties of PTT were studied. Tests were carried out at 25 % elongation. In these conditions, PTT showed an elastic recovery and a permanent deformation ranging from 65. 7 to 78. 1 % and from 5. 4 to 8. 8 %, respectively. On the basis of such results, PTT cannot be considered an elastic fibre. Regarding quantification, the usual pre-treatment protocol is applicable to PTT fibres. The correction factor b for mass loss during pre-treatment for PTT was established as 0 %. The experimental value for the agreed allowance of PTT was determined (0. 34 %). However, for consistency with the values already adopted for polyester and elastomultiester, the value 1. 50 % was agreed by the members of the European Network of National Experts on Textile Labelling (ENNETL). PTT is completely soluble in method 14. The following correction factors d for PTT (mass loss due to dissolution methods) were determined: 1. 00 for methods 2, 3, 7 and 11; 1. 01 for methods 1, 4, 5, 9 and 10; 1. 02 for method 13; 1. 03 for methods 6, 8 and 16. Method 15 is not applicable to binary mixtures containing PTT. Several binary and ternary blends containing PTT were quantified using both manual separation method and chemical dissolution ones. The JRC developed a new DSC method that was proved to be adequate and accurate for the quantification of PTT in blends with PET. The method uses calibration curves prepared with yarns manually separated from the sample under analysis, thus ensuring a common thermal history. Different types of integration as well as multipoint and single point calibration curves based on PTT or PET melting peaks were evaluated. The JRC organised the validation of the optimised DSC method at European level, as a balanced uniform–level experiment with six levels and 15 laboratories. The best results were obtained using multipoint calibration curves based on the integration of PTT melting peak with a linear integration. The method was successfully validated and showed good accuracy, in terms of both trueness and precision, as proved by the following parameters: bias values (0. 06 - 1. 30 %), confidence limits at 95 % probability level (0. 60 - 1. 07 %) and HORRAT values (0. 5 – 2). Results were presented in two meetings of ENNETL, held in Ispra, Italy, on 30 th November 2012 and 4 th October 2013. The definition proposed by DuPont for PTT (“fibre formed of linear macromolecules comprising at least 85 % (by mass) in the chain of an ester of 1, 3 -propane diol and terephthalic acid) was consistent with the evaluation carried out. As regards the proposed name of the fibre (triexta) there was no consensus among the experts belonging to ENNETL. JRC. I. 1 -Chemical Assessment and Testin...|$|E

2500|$|While {{the name}} Courtaulds {{disappeared}} in the chemical merger with Akzo Nobel, the Courtaulds <b>textile</b> <b>name</b> remains as a division in Sara Lee. However, to survive it again had to slash jobs and axed many of its factories as it grappled with {{the high costs of}} manufacturing in the UK and M, under Stuart Rose, continuing to squeeze its suppliers. In February 2005, Brenda C. Barnes became the chairman and CEO of Sara Lee - and had a far more focussed strategy. Courtaulds was seen as basically a British-based brand and company, and did not fit with a global business. Barnes agreed sale of the business was right, and for some time tried to sell the Courtaulds business, which had a turnover in 2005 of $560m (£302m), but was hampered by Courtaulds' pension deficit. It was eventually agreed with the UK pension regulator to increase payments into the deficit from £20m to £32m a year until 2015. In May 2006, Sara Lee announced the sale of Courtaulds Textiles to PD Enterprise Limited, a major supplier of clothing to Courtaulds Textiles.
