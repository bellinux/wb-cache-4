40|$|We thank Professor Siebert {{for this}} comment and {{interest}} in our recent article regarding occipital bending in depression. The focus of our article {{was to investigate the}} prevalence of occipital bending in this patient group relative to control subjects, and our findings suggest that this is separate to previous findings of asymmetry or cortical thinning in the occipital lobe (Peterson et al., 2009). We hypothesized that incomplete neural pruning may lead to the cra-nial space available for brain growth being restricted, or ventricu-lar enlargement observed in depression (Kempton et al., 2011). This compresses the brain and causes torque and curvature around the other occipital lobe. The variation in skull base and vascular anatomy in this region is interesting in the context of our findings of the prevalence of occipital torque. Indeed, the more frequent right <b>transverse</b> sinus <b>draining</b> the superior sagittal sinus (Saiki et al., 2013) results i...|$|R
40|$|Since {{it became}} {{externally}} drained, the fluvial {{dynamics of the}} Ouarzazate foreland basin {{has been dominated by}} erosive processes due to a base level fall. The basin landscape is dominated by extensive Quaternary deposits aggraded by the <b>transverse</b> rivers <b>draining</b> the High Atlas Mountains. These deposits accumulated in valleys and pediments incised in the basin Tertiary infill, characterized mostly by fine-grained and soft sediments. Evidences of fluvial captures are abundant in recent times and throughout the Quaternary, in a scenario where there is more incision efficiency in the interfluves’ secondary streams (characterized by fine-grained or sediment-free pediments) than in the main transverse rivers (characterized by thick gravel deposits). Satellite imagery, elevation data and field observations demonstrate how minor streams increase their catchment areas by headward erosion, creating extensive pediments lying under the main rivers and producing captures of the main rivers. This study demonstrates the unsteady-state of the drainage network of the Ouarzazate basin and its recent reorganization, apparently uncoupled from tectonic or climatic processe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOne of the {{greatest}} challenges {{in the study of the}} evolution of mountain ranges is determining the history of the development of longitudinal and transverse drainages. It has been proposed that the increase of the regional slope during mountain building primarily controls the evolution of the drainage pattern from longitudinal to transverse. Incipient crustal shortening in the upper crust is generally characterized by the detachment of the sedimentary cover from its basement resulting in folding and thrusting, and the undulation of Earth's surface. Folding and thrusting induce local slopes counter to the regional slope, which force the water path in the direction of the fold axes and thrust faults, that is, perpendicular to the regional slope. Enhanced regional slope and erosion in the upper crust, which removes the sedimentary cover during mountain building, result in the capture of the longitudinal rivers by the headward migration of the transverse rivers, and eventually by the progressive replacement of the whole longitudinal-dominated drainage by a transverse-dominated drainage. This evolution accounts for the common observation of the persistence of longitudinal drains where the sedimentary cover has been partly preserved, and for the dominance of <b>transverse</b> <b>drains</b> where the lower ductile crust has been exhumed. Based on a geomorphological analysis calibrated by published long-term (Apatite Fission Track) erosion rates and, new and published short-term (terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide) erosion rates it can be shown that the drainage of the NW Himalaya is evolving in a similar way. Long-term and short-term erosion rates show that the drainage divide between the transverse Beas river (NW India) and the longitudinal Chenab river, located farther in the hinterland, is migrating to the north at 1. 5 ± 1. 55 mm/yr and 1. 7 ± 0. 7 mm/yr, respectively. Divide migration to the North will eventually involve the capture of the upper reaches of the longitudinal Chenab river in ~ 2 ± 1 Ma. At the scale of the central and eastern Himalaya, this evolution from longitudinal-dominated to transverse-dominated drainage is enhanced by the strong difference in elevation of the efficient base level of the rivers on each side of the chain, which induces the inevitably northward migration of the main divide...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of how drainage patterns respond to tectonics can provide an insight into past deformational events within mountain belts and where sediment flux is supplied to depositional basins. The <b>transverse</b> rivers <b>draining</b> the Spanish Pyrenees show sudden diversions to axial courses and the capture of lateral systems producing large trunk rivers that break through the thrust front at structurally controlled points. The drainage reorganization from the initial regularly spaced pattern in the Late Eocene caused by the growth of thrust-controlled topography influenced the location of outlets into the Ebro basin. The headward capture and merger of rivers {{as a result of}} structural diversion formed two large terminal fan systems during the Oligo-Miocene along the Pyrenean thrust front. The early structural topographic controls on drainage evolution will have long-term effects on sedimentation and stratigraphic architecture of foreland basins. This will only be maintained {{as long as there is}} tectonic uplift and the river systems strive to re-attain a regular drainage spacing across the orogenic belt as partly achieved in the Pyrenees...|$|R

40|$|During its {{continental}} {{stage of}} infilling (Late Tortonian-Late Pleistocene), the Guadix Basin acted as an endorheic depression {{in which an}} axial fluvial system, fed partialy by two <b>transverse</b> alluvial systems, <b>drained</b> towards a large shallow lake located in the eastern sector. At that moment, detritic and carbonate sediments were depositing in the floodplains of the axial valley.

The palustrine carbonate sediments have been characterized according to their degree of pedological modification and to their content in detritic components.

40|$|Thin film {{transistors}} (TFT's) with low-temperature processed metal-induced laterally crystallized (MILC) {{channels and}} self-aligned metal-induction crystallized (MIC) source and drain regions {{have been demonstrated}} recently as potential devices for realizing electronics on large-area, inexpensive glass panels. While these TFT's are better than their solid-phase crystallized counterparts in many device performance measures, they suffer from higher off-state leakage current and early drain breakdown. A new technology is proposed, employing metal-induced-unilateral crystallization (MIUC), which results in the removal from the edges of and within the channel region all major grain boundaries <b>transverse</b> to the <b>drain</b> current flow. Compared to the conventional ``bilateral'' MILC TFT's, the new MIUC devices are shown to have higher field-effect mobility, significantly reduced leakage curl ent, better immunity to early drain breakdown, and much improved spatial uniformity of the device parameters...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to improve and {{complete}} the results presented in a previous work published on this journal about an experimental campaign focused on the hydraulic efficiency of continuous <b>transverse</b> grates for <b>draining</b> paved areas. This type of surface drainage structure is commonly used in urban or impervious areas (public squares, airport pavements, parks, and pedestrian areas), where conventional inlets are not recommended because they are rendered ineffective by the lack of a well-defined channelized flow path and gradients capable of directing flows toward the collecting hydraulic structures. In this paper, a methodology is presented to estimate the hydraulic efficiency of nontested continuous transverse grates. Empirical expressions are proposed to relate grate hydraulic performance to flow parameters and grate geometry without the need for laboratory tests. Moreover, the spectrum of the grates was extended in terms of dimensions and hydraulic design with respect to the first study, to enlarge the range of validity of the proposed empirical expressions.

40|$|International audienceIn fold {{and thrust}} belts {{drainage}} organization {{and patterns of}} sedimentation depend conceptually on the ability or not for preexisting reaches to incise uplifting thrust sheets. In this study we investigate experimentally the dynamics of drainage network in a wedge submitted to shortening and erosion. It allows us to reproduce and to monitor the interactions between tectonics, erosion and sedimentation during the development of up to five successive thrust sheets. In the experiments channels adjust to uplift rate by both increasing their slope and narrowing their channels as it is observed in nature. The series of experiments shows {{that the proportion of}} persistent preexisting transverse channels increases with the ratio of rainfall over shortening rates. The experiments confirm the view that the competition between discharge and tectonic uplift controls along-strike variations in sediment flux in sedimentary basins by controlling the drainage organization. If the <b>transverse</b> channels <b>draining</b> a wedge are not diverted, a line-source dispersal system develops in front of the active structure. If channels are diverted in the backlimb of the frontal structure it results in point-sourced depositional systems separated by areas fed only by small channels developing {{in the front of the}} wedge. Fans accumulated in front of the active structures reveal two stages of sedimentation, one of progradation, while the frontal structure is active and a second one of valley backfilling and thrust sealing during internal deformation of the wedge. The experiments also suggest that spatial variations in rock uplift rate along a thrust front may be evidenced by minimum-discharge variations of persistent transverse channels...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} of the course and {{distribution}} of blood vessels supplying and draining the hippocampus. Such information could be of value in designing and evaluating lesion and ablation experiments and may reflect spatial properties of neurons. This study mapped the distribution of major arteries and veins of the rat hippocampal formation. Arteries and veins of adult female Wistar rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital were injected with silicone rubber. Double injections to demonstrate both arteries and veins in the same animal were with India ink and a fluorescent material. Arterial supply to the hippocampus was via transverse hippocampal arteries that stemmed from the longitudinal hippocampal artery, {{a branch of the}} posterior cerebral artery. Internal transverse hippocampal arteries located in the hippocampal fissure supplied small, short branches to the adjacent blade of the fascia dentata, part of the area dentata, and CA 3 fields. Other branches of the longitudinal artery supplied the remaining blade of the fascia and area dentata, subicular fields, and entorhinal structures. Internal transverse hippocampal veins located in the hippocampal fissure alternated in position with the arteries and appeared to be paired with, and to drain fields supplied by, the internal transverse arteries. Deep transverse hippocampal veins, unaccompanied by arteries, received branches in the intraventricular alveus and adjacent stratum oriens of CA 3. The <b>transverse</b> veins <b>drained</b> into longitudinal vessels or the basal vein. Although transversely directed arteries and veins may suggest a hippocampal lamellar neuronal organization, microvascular fields must be mapped before claims are made for a totally segmental vascular architecture in the hippocampus...|$|R
40|$|Expanding the {{urbanization}} of new communities {{within the}} limited low flat desert surfaces of Al-Qairawan area, Kuwait {{has started to}} face the continuous growth of population. The traditional urbanized logged areas affect urbanization of these flat desert surfaces {{as a result of}} the difference in the topographic level, inadequate drainage system and the existence of inland Sabkhas beside shallow-depth clay lenses beneath these sites. Moreover, the soil water depths vary from few centimeters below ground surface to 5. 5 m and the soil-water moves generally from the southwest to the northeast towards the Arabian Gulf. The present paper threw light on a trial to mitigate the waterlogging problem due to the bad use of water resources in Gardening-irrigation activities in the relatively high-land areas of the present traditional urbanized communities in Al-Qairawan area applying mathematical modeling. The groundwater flow model, Visual MODFLOW v. 3, was used to test the reliability of the proposed solution for mitigation and its limitation. Three proposed scenarios for mitigation of waterlogging problem were checked. Decreasing the soil water level using wall sheet system was proposed as a first scenario. The second scenario proposed suitable dewatering system while the third one assumed the construction of transverse open drainage system in the southern boundary of the study area. The results showed that the third scenario was the best solution since it reflected both the lowest soil water level (2. 72 m) and least cost economically (146250 Kuwait-Dinar). Accordingly, the solution concerning soil water rise control in the study area through applying the construction of <b>transverse</b> open <b>drain</b> in the southern boundary of the study water logged area is highly recommended...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the interaction between different controlling variables in fluvial systems in a rift basin, and the differences between transverse and axial drainage in the same setting, I present the results of numerical modelling in which downstream grain size trends along the fluvial systems in the Sperchios rift basin in Central Greece are analysed. The model is used to explore the relationship between (1) the spatial distribution of subsidence, (2) sediment supply and (3) downstream grain size fining trends in such systems. The <b>transverse</b> systems <b>drain</b> from the footwall, across the border faults, and feed coarse alluvial fans that prograde into the centre of the rift whereas the axial system supplies sediment to a fine grained birds foot delta in the Maliakos Gulf. The model used has been developed in recent years by Fedele and Paola (2007) and Duller et al. (2010). I first demonstrate how the grain size data from the Sperchios rift is obtained and quantified, and then present the modelling results based on the obtained grain size data, where the effects of - and interaction between - the controlling variables is explored. Furthermore, I demonstrate how the amplitude and spatial distribution of subsidence impacts grain size fining trends and the distribution of deposition and bypassing. I also show how the sediment supplied to the system impacts the grain size fining trends and distribution of deposition and bypassing. For the fluvial systems in the Sperchios rift, I then compare the transverse systems with the axial system. This study indicates that the model developed by Fedele and Paola (2007) and Duller et al. (2010), despite some weaknesses and necessary assumptions, provides a greater understanding of the interaction between the controlling variables impacting fluvial deposition in rifts...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the ultimate origin of aeolian sand in Arabian deserts by high-resolution petrographic and heavy-mineral techniques combined with zircon U-Pb geochronology. Point-counting is used here as the sole method by which unbiased volume percentages of heavy minerals can be obtained. A comprehensive analysis of river and wadi sands from the Red Sea to the Bitlis-Zagros orogen allowed us to characterize all potential sediment sources, and thus to quantitatively constrain provenance of Arabian dune fields. Two main types of aeolian sand can be distinguished. Quartzose sands with very poor heavy-mineral suites including zircon occupy most of the region comprising the Great Nafud and Rub’ al-Khali Sand Seas, and are largely recycled from thick Lower Palaeozoic quartzarenites with very minor first-cycle contributions from Precambrian basement, Mesozoic carbonate rocks, or Neogene basalts. Instead, carbonaticlastic sands with richer lithic and heavy-mineral populations characterize coastal dunes bordering the Arabian Gulf from the Jafurah Sand Sea of Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates. The similarity with detritus carried by the axial Tigris-Euphrates system and by <b>transverse</b> rivers <b>draining</b> carbonate rocks of the Zagros indicates that Arabian coastal dunes largely consist of far-travelled sand, deposited on the exposed floor of the Gulf during Pleistocene lowstands and blown inland by dominant Shamal northerly winds. A dataset of detrital zircon U-Pb ages measured on twelve dune samples and two Lower Palaeozoic sandstones yielded fourteen identical age spectra. The age distributions all show a major Neoproterozoic peak corresponding to the Pan-African magmatic and tectonic events by which the Arabian Shield was assembled, with minor late Palaeoproterozoic and Neoarchean peaks. A similar U-Pb signature characterizes also Jafurah dune sands, suggesting that zircons are dominantly derived from interior Arabia, possibly deflated from the Wadi al-Batin fossil alluvial fan or even from Mesozoic sandstones of the Arabian margin accreted to the Cenozoic Zagros orogen. Due to extensive recycling {{and the fact that}} zircon is so resistant to weathering and erosion, the U-Pb age signatures are much less powerful a tracer of sedimentary provenance than framework petrography and heavy minerals. Actualistic provenance studies of dune fields at subcontinental scale shed light on the generation and homogenization of aeolian sand, and allow us to trace complex pathways of multistep sediment transport, thus providing crucial independent information for accurate palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic reconstructions...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal valleys form {{first order}} {{topographic}} features in many mountain belts. They are commonly located along faults that separate tectonic zones with varying uplift histories. The Indus Valley of Ladakh, northern India, runs northwestwards following {{the boundary between}} the relatively undeformed Ladakh Batholith to the north–east and the folded and thrusted Zanskar mountains to the south–west. In this region the Shyok Valley, on the northern side of the batholith, approximately parallels the course of the Indus. This study investigates geomorphic variations in <b>transverse</b> catchments that <b>drain</b> the Ladakh Batholith, into the Indus and Shyok rivers. The batholith has been divided into three zones based on varying structural characteristics of its northeastern and southwestern boundaries. Morphometric analysis of 62 catchments that drain into the Indus and Shyok valleys was carried out using three digital datasets, and supported by field observations. Morphometric asymmetry is evident in the central zone where the Shyok valley is considered tectonically inactive, but the Indus Valley is bound by the northeastwardly thrusting Indus Molasse and the batholith. In this zone the catchments that drain into the Indus Valley are more numerous, shorter, thinner and have lower hypsometric integrals than those that drain into the Shyok. By linking these observations with the regional geology and thermochronological data it is proposed that high sediment discharge from the deformed Indus Molasse Indus Valley has progressively raised base levels in the Indus Valley and resulted in sediment blanketing of the opposing tectonically quiescent catchments that drain southwestwards off the batholith. The Indus Molasse thrust front has propagated at least 36 km towards the Ladakh Batholith over the last 20 Ma. Hence it is proposed that this long term asymmetric structural deformation and exhumation has forced the Indus longitudinal valley laterally into the Ladakh Batholith resulting in the morphometric asymmetry of its transverse catchments...|$|R
