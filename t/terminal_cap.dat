However, in 2005, Trinity made changes to the ET-Plus without reporting the changes. It was alleged that the Trinity design change caused it to malfunction. A lawsuit filed in 2012 against Trinity stated that these changes were causing damages to cars and drivers. Tests have shown that the guardrails act the way they should.|$|E

40|$|SummaryCooperativity is a {{defining}} feature of protein folding, but its thermodynamic and structural origins {{are not completely}} understood. By constructing consensus ankyrin repeat protein arrays that have nearly identical sequences, we quantify cooperativity by resolving stability into intrinsic and interfacial components.

Applying a one-dimensional Ising model to a series of constructs chosen to maximize information content in unfolding transitions, we quantify stabilities of the <b>terminal</b> <b>capping</b> repeats, and resolve the effects of denaturant into intrinsic and interfacial components. Reversible thermal denaturation resolves interfacial and intrinsic free energies into enthalpic, entropic, and heat capacity terms. Intrinsic folding is entropically disfavored, whereas interfacial interaction is entropically favored and attends a decrease in heat capacity. These results suggest that helix formation and backbone ordering occurs upon intrinsic folding, whereas hydrophobic desolvation occurs upon interfacial interaction, contributing to cooperativity...|$|R

Inhibition of poliovirus mRNA translation by a 5 '-terminal cap structure was not observed in in vitro translation systems.

However, in contrast to cap-dependent translation, the rate of initiation at the HCV IRES was unaffected by 3 ′-untranslated sequences.

In this work, the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor- 1 α (SDF- 1 α) was encapsulated into nanoparticles composed of poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) -PLGA co-polymer to achieve sustained release. SDF- 1 α and lysozyme as a model protein, were firstly precipitated to promote their stability upon encapsulation. A novel phase separation method utilising a non-toxic solvent {{in the form of}} isosorbide dimethyl ether was developed for the individual encapsulation of SDF- 1 α and lysozyme precipitates. Uniform nanoparticles of 200 – 250 nm in size with spherical morphologies were successfully synthesised under mild formulation conditions and conveniently freeze-dried in the presence of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as a stabiliser. The effect of PLGA carboxylic acid <b>terminal</b> <b>capping</b> on protein encapsulation efficiency and release rate was also explored.

Here we explore their role in the process of meiotic division in the budding yeast, Kluyveromyces lactis. Telomerase RNA mutants that cause unusually long telomeres with deregulated structure led to severely defective meiosis. The severity of the meiotic phenotype of two mutants correlated with the degree of loss of binding of the telomere binding protein Rap 1 p. We show that telomere size and the extent of potential Rap 1 p binding to the entire telomere are irrelevant to the process of meiosis. Moreover, we demonstrate that extreme difference in telomere size between two homologous chromosomes is compatible with the normal function of telomeres during meiosis. In contrast, the structure of the most terminal telomeric repeats is critical for normal meiosis.

40|$|The role of RNA methylations in {{the control}} of mRNA {{maturation}} and incorporation into polysomes has been investigated through {{a study of the}} effects in vivo of cycloleucine, a specific inhibitor of S-adenosyl-methionine mediated methylation. During the cycloleucine treatment, the rate of biosynthesis of hnRNA and its subsequent polyadenylation were only slightly reduced as compared with untreated cells.

Nevertheless, the total amount of pulse-labelled poly(A) + mRNA transferred to cytoplasm after a long chase time (3 h.) was approximately the same for both cycloleucine-treated and control cells. Extensively undermethylated poly(A) + cytoplasmic RNAs, possessing a 5 ' <b>terminal</b> <b>cap</b> were incorporated into polysomes in proportions very similar to control messenger molecules.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to design repeat proteins of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family for the generation of libraries of intracellular binding molecules. From an analysis of naturally occurring LRR proteins, we derived the concept to assemble repeat proteins with randomized surface positions from libraries of consensus repeat modules. As a guiding principle, we used the mammalian ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) family, which comprises cytosolic LRR proteins known for their extraordinary affinities to many RNases. By aligning the amino acid sequences of the internal repeats of human, pig, rat, and mouse RI, we derived a first con-sensus sequence for the characteristic alternating 28 and 29 amino acid residue A-type and B-type repeats. Structural considerations were used to replace all conserved cysteine residues, to define less conserved positions, and to decide where to introduce randomized amino acid residues. The so devised consensus RI repeat library was generated at the DNA level and assembled by stepwise ligation to give libraries of 2 – 12 repeats. <b>Terminal</b> <b>capping</b> repeats, known to shield the continuous hydrophobic core of the LRR domain from the surrounding solvent, were adapted from human RI. In this way, designed LRR protein libraries of 4 – 14 LRRs (equivalent to 130 – 415 amino acid residues) were obtained. The biophysical analysis of randomly chosen library members showed high levels of soluble expression in the Escherichia coli cytosol, monomeric behavior as characterized by gel-filtration, and a-helical CD spectra, confirming {{the success of our}} design approach...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCLIPR- 59 is a {{new member}} of the cytoplasmic linker {{proteins}} (CLIP) family mainly localized to the trans-Golgi network. We show here that Clipr- 59 expression in mice is restricted to specific pools of neurons, in particular motoneurons (MNs), and progressively increases from embryonic day 12. 5 (E 12. 5) until the first postnatal days. We generated a Clipr- 59 knockout mouse model that presents perinatal lethality due to respiratory defects. Physiological experiments revealed that this altered innervation prevents the normal nerve-elicited contraction of the mutant diaphragm that is reduced both in amplitude and fatigue-resistance at E 18. 5, despite unaffected functional muscular contractility. Innervation of the mutant diaphragm is not altered until E 15. 5, but is then partially lost in the most distal parts of the muscle. Ultrastructural observations of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the distal region of the diaphragm reveal a normal organization, but a lower density of nerve <b>terminals</b> <b>capped</b> by <b>terminal</b> Schwann cells in E 18. 5 mutant when compared with control embryos. Similar defects in NMJ stability, with a hierarchy of severity along the caudo-rostral axis, are also observed in other muscles innervated by facial and spinal MNs in Clipr- 59 mutant mice. Clipr- 59 deficiency therefore affects axon maintenance but not axon guidance toward muscle targets. Thus, CLIPR- 59 {{is involved in the}} stabilization of specific motor axons at the NMJ during mouse late embryogenesis and its role is crucial for mouse perinatal development...|$|R

40|$|Infection {{of cells}} with the foot-and-mouth-disease virus, {{a member of}} the {{picornavirus}} family, results in the shut-off of host protein synthesis. A major contributory mechanism is the proteolytic destruction of the gamma subunit of the complex eIF- 4, which functions in translation to promote the binding of the 43 S ribosomal preinitiation complex to the 5 ' end of the cellular mRNA molecules bearing a 5 ' <b>terminal</b> <b>cap</b> structure. Picornavirus RNA molecules, which are uncapped, use a distinct mechanism for translational initiation, which can operate in the absence, or at low levels, of eIF- 4. The proteolysis of eIF- 4 gamma in cells infected by foot-and-mouth-disease virus results from expression of a virus-encoded cysteine proteinase known as Leader (or L) protease. We have used a transcription plasmid encoding this protease as a tool to deplete in vitro translation systems of eIF- 4 gamma in order to elucidate in more detail the role of this polypeptide in the control of translation. Using in vitro transcribed mRNAs we have observed a marked contrast between capped and uncapped transcripts in the response of their translation to the proteolysis of eIF- 4 gamma. Translation of capped mRNAs is, as expected, severely impaired, and is restored by addition of eIF- 4 complex containing the intact gamma-subunit. On the other hand, translation of uncapped transcripts, normally inefficient, is substantially enhanced. The data suggest that the translation of uncapped mRNAs may be stimulated in this system by {{one or more of the}} proteolytic degradation products of eIF- 4 gamma...|$|E
40|$|The plus-strand RNA genome of flavivirus {{contains}} a 5 ′ <b>terminal</b> <b>cap</b> 1 structure (m 7 GpppAmG). The flaviviruses encode one methyltransferase, {{located at the}} N-terminal portion of the NS 5 protein, to catalyze both guanine N- 7 and ribose 2 ′-OH methylations during viral cap formation. Representative flavivirus methyltransferases from dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus (WNV) sequentially generate GpppA → m 7 GpppA → m 7 GpppAm. The 2 ′-O methylation can be uncoupled from the N- 7 methylation, since m 7 GpppA-RNA can be readily methylated to m 7 GpppAm-RNA. Despite exhibiting two distinct methylation activities, the crystal structure of WNV methyltransferase at 2. 8 Å resolution showed a single binding site for S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM), the methyl donor. Therefore, substrate GpppA-RNA should be repositioned to accept the N- 7 and 2 ′-O methyl groups from SAM during the sequential reactions. Electrostatic analysis of the WNV methyltransferase structure showed that, adjacent to the SAM-binding pocket, is a highly positively charged surface {{that could serve as}} an RNA binding site during cap methylations. Biochemical and mutagenesis analyses show that the N- 7 and 2 ′-O cap methylations require distinct buffer conditions and different side chains within the K 61 -D 146 -K 182 -E 218 motif, suggesting that the two reactions use different mechanisms. In the context of complete virus, defects in both methylations are lethal to WNV; however, viruses defective solely in 2 ′-O methylation are attenuated and can protect mice from later wild-type WNV challenge. The results demonstrate that the N- 7 methylation activity is essential for the WNV life cycle and, thus, methyltransferase represents a novel target for flavivirus therapy...|$|E
40|$|DARPin libraries, {{based on}} a Designed Ankyrin Repeat Protein {{consensus}} framework, are {{a rich source of}} binding partners {{for a wide variety of}} proteins. Their modular structure, stability, ease of in vitro selection and high production yields make DARPins an ideal starting point for further engineering. The X-ray structures of around 30 different DARPin complexes demonstrate their ability to facilitate crystallization of their target proteins by restricting flexibility and preventing undesired interactions of the target molecule. However, their small size (18 kDa), very hydrophilic surface and repetitive structure can limit the DARPins' ability to provide essential crystal contacts and their usefulness as a search model for addressing the crystallographic phase problem in molecular replacement. To optimize DARPins for their application as crystallization chaperones, rigid domain-domain fusions of the DARPins to larger proteins, proven to yield high-resolution crystal structures, were generated. These fusions were designed in such a way that they affect only one of the <b>terminal</b> <b>capping</b> repeats of the DARPin and do not interfere with residues involved in target binding, allowing to exchange at will the binding specificities of the DARPin in the fusion construct. As a proof of principle, we designed rigid fusions of a stabilized version of Escherichia coli TEM- 1 β-lactamase to the C-terminal capping repeat of various DARPins in six different relative domain orientations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Telomeres [...] the <b>terminal</b> <b>caps</b> of {{chromosomes}} [...] become shorter {{as individuals}} age, {{and there is}} much interest in determining what causes telomere attrition since this process {{may play a role}} in biological aging. The leading hypothesis is that telomere attrition is due to inflammation, exposure to infectious agents, and other types of oxidative stress, which damage telomeres and impair their repair mechanisms. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis, including observational findings that people exposed to infectious diseases have shorter telomeres. Experimental tests are still needed, however, to distinguish whether infectious diseases actually cause telomere attrition or whether telomere attrition increases susceptibility to infection. Experiments are also needed to determine whether telomere erosion reduces longevity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We experimentally tested whether repeated exposure to an infectious agent, Salmonella enterica, causes telomere attrition in wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus musculus). We repeatedly infected mice with a genetically diverse cocktail of five different S. enterica strains over seven months, and compared changes in telomere length with sham-infected sibling controls. We measured changes in telomere length of white blood cells (WBC) after five infections using a real-time PCR method. Our results show that repeated Salmonella infections cause telomere attrition in WBCs, and particularly for males, which appeared less disease resistant than females. Interestingly, we also found that individuals having long WBC telomeres at early age were relatively disease resistant during later life. Finally, we found evidence that more rapid telomere attrition increases mortality risk, although this trend was not significant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that infectious diseases can cause telomere attrition, and support the idea that telomere length could provide a molecular biomarker for assessing exposure and ability to cope with infectious diseases...|$|R
40|$|Hantaviruses, {{members of}} the Bunyaviridae family, are negative-stranded {{emerging}} RNA viruses and category A pathogens that cause serious illness when transmitted to humans through aerosolized excreta of infected rodent hosts. Hantaviruses have evolved a novel translation initiation mechanism, operated by nucleocapsid protein (N), which preferentially facilitates the translation of viral mRNAs. N binds to the ribosomal protein S 19 (RPS 19), a structural component of the 40 S ribosomal subunit. In addition, N also binds to both the viral mRNA 5 ′ cap and a highly conserved triplet repeat sequence of the viral mRNA 5 ′ UTR. The simultaneous binding of N at both the <b>terminal</b> <b>cap</b> and the 5 ′ UTR favors ribosome loading on viral transcripts during translation initiation. We characterized the binding between N and RPS 19 and demonstrate {{the role of the}} N-RPS 19 interaction in N-mediated translation initiation mechanism. We show that N specifically binds to RPS 19 with high affinity and a binding stoichiometry of 1 : 1. The N-RPS 19 interaction is an enthalpy-driven process. RPS 19 undergoes a conformational change after binding to N. Using T 7 RNA polymerase, we synthesized the hantavirus S segment mRNA, which matches the transcript generated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in cells. We show that the N-RPS 19 interaction plays a critical role in the translation of this mRNA both in cells and rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Our results demonstrate that the N-mediated translation initiation mechanism, which lures the host translation machinery for the preferential translation of viral transcripts, primarily depends on the N-RPS 19 interaction. We suggest that the N-RPS 19 interaction is a novel target to shut down the N-mediated translation strategy and hence virus replication in cells...|$|E

Below the peg sensilla on the pectinal teeth were three histological layers consisting of dendrites, neuronal somata, and a layer of peripheral synapses. The neuronal cell layer within the teeth was further divided into inner and outer sub-larninae, comprised of chemosensory and mechanosensory neurons. The peg sensilla were innervated by iterative cassettes of sensory neurons orthogonal to the layers described. Sensory hairs on the pectinal spine resembled arachnid tactile and chemosensory hairs. The central projection patterns of sensory afferents from tactile hairs on the pectinal spine and peg sensilla on the pectinal teeth were compared. The internal architecture of the neuropile serving the pectines was also characterized. The pectinal neuropile contained a basal disk and a <b>terminal</b> <b>cap.</b> The cap was divided into a fibrous cortex and a medullar region of glomeruli. Sensory afferents from the tactile hairs on the spine were aligned topographically in the pectinal neuropile, but were restricted to the outer cortex. Sensory afferents from the bimodal peg sensilla terminated in both regions of the pectinal neuropil, suggesting that the cortex and medulla are functionally divided into mechanosensory and chemosensory processing areas. Behavioral experiments were conducted using a Y-maze choice test to determine if male scorpions were capable of trailing female conspecifics. A significant proportion of male scorpions preferred the arm of the Y-maze that a conspecific female had walked down and pre-courtship behaviors were only evoked when male scorpions contacted substrates that had been exposed to a female scorpion. The results from this experiment suggest that scorpions may use chemical cues to find potential mates and to initiate courtship...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} nucleoprotein structures at {{the ends}} of linear chromosomes to maintain the integrity of chromosome ends. In human cells, telomeres are protected by a complex of six proteins bound to telomeric DNA, named shelterin. As a crucial component of shelterin, the human telomeric capping protein TRF 2 is required for telomere stabilization and function. Recently, TRF 2 was shown to form a complex with Apollo, a 5 ' -exonuclease of the metallo-beta-lactamase family. In this thesis, biochjemical, genetic, and cellular approaches were combined to understand the mechanism of 5 ' -exonuclease of Apollo in the telomere protection. First, in vitro evidence shows that TRF 2 plays a dual role in controlling Apollo nuclease activity. TRF 2 stimulates the nuclease activity of Apollo on TRF 2 -free DNA ends and inhibits it when it is bound proximately to the 5 ' end. This stimulatory effect of Apollo nuclease depends on the basic domain of TRF 2. Second, the specific coupling between the Apollo nuclease activity and the dynamics of TRF 2 DNA binding shows in vivo that TRF 2 and Apollo are not only involved in the protection of the very-terminal structure of telomeres but also of the inner part of telomere repeat tracts, which is required for telomere integrity during S-phase. Moreover TRF 2 and Apollo protect from DNA damage telomere repeat tracts inserted far away from chromosome ends, furthze indicating that TRF 2 couples the exonuclease activity of Apollo to protect telomere during fork progression. Third, exonuclease activity of Apollo, which is required for the telomere protection, is directly regulated by TRF 2. These data are consistent with a new model of telomere protection in with TRF 2 couples the exonuclease activity of Apollo to replication in order to eliminate clastogenic and recombinogenic structures. The work in my thesis suggest that replicative senescence in human cells may not only be caused by loss of the <b>terminal</b> <b>cap</b> integrity but also by replication-linked DNA breakages and recombinations within the inner part of telomeres.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{compared}} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a β-hairpin forming peptide {{derived from the}} protein Nrf 2 with 10 biomolecular force fields using trajectories of at least 1 μs. The total simulation time was 37. 2 μs. Previous {{studies have shown that}} different force fields, water models, simulation methods, and parameters can affect simulation outcomes. The MD simulations were done in explicit solvent with a 16 -mer Nrf 2 β-hairpin forming peptide using Amber ff 99 SB-ILDN, Amber ff 99 SB*-ILDN, Amber ff 99 SB, Amber ff 99 SB*, Amber ff 03, Amber ff 03 *, GROMOS 96 43 a 1 p, GROMOS 96 53 a 6, CHARMM 27, and OPLS-AA/L force fields. The effects of charge-groups, <b>terminal</b> <b>capping,</b> and phosphorylation on the peptide folding were also examined. Despite using identical starting structures and simulation parameters, we observed clear differences among the various force fields and even between replicates using the same force field. Our simulations show that the uncapped peptide folds into a native-like β-hairpin structure at 310 K when Amber ff 99 SB-ILDN, Amber ff 99 SB*-ILDN, Amber ff 99 SB, Amber ff 99 SB*, Amber ff 03, Amber ff 03 *, GROMOS 96 43 a 1 p, or GROMOS 96 53 a 6 were used. The CHARMM 27 simulations were able to form native hairpins in some of the elevated temperature simulations, while the OPLS-AA/L simulations did not yield native hairpin structures at any temperatures tested. Simulations that used charge-groups or peptide capping groups were not largely different from their uncapped counterparts with single atom charge-groups. On the other hand, phosphorylation of the threonine residue located at the β-turn significantly affected the hairpin formation. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing such a large set of force fields with respect to β-hairpin folding. Such a comprehensive comparison will offer useful guidance to others conducting similar types of simulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of Leishmania parasites within the sand fly vector {{includes}} the development of extracellular promastigotes from a noninfective, procyclic stage into an infective, metacyclic stage that is uniquely adapted for transmission by the fly and survival in the vertebrate host. These adaptations were explored {{in the context of}} the structure and function of the abundant surface lipophosphoglycan (LPG) on Leishmania donovani promastigotes. During metacyclogenesis, the salient structural feature of L. donovani LPG is conserved, involving expression of a phosphoglycan chain made up of unsubstituted disaccharide-phosphate repeats. Two important developmental modifications were also observed. First, the size of the molecule is substantially increased because of a twofold increase in the number of phosphorylated disaccharide repeat units expressed. Second, there is a concomitant decrease in the presentation of terminally exposed sugars. This later property was indicated by the reduced accessibility of terminal galactose residues to galactose oxidase and the loss of binding by the lectins, peanut agglutinin, and concanavalin A, to metacyclic LPG in vivo and in vitro. The loss of lectin binding was not due to downregulation of the capping oligosaccharides as the same beta- linked galactose or alpha-linked mannose-terminating oligosaccharides were present in both procyclic and metacyclic promastigotes. The capping sugars on procyclic LPG were found to mediate procyclic attachment to the sand fly midgut, whereas these same sugars on metacyclic LPG failed to mediate metacyclic binding. And whereas intact metacyclic LPG did not inhibit procyclic attachment, depolymerized LPG inhibited as well as procyclic LPG, demonstrating that the ligands are normally buried. The masking of the terminal sugars is attributed to folding and clustering of the extended phosphoglycan chains, which form densely distributed particulate structures visible on fracture-flip preparations of the metacyclic surface. The exposure and subsequent masking of the <b>terminal</b> <b>capping</b> sugars explains the stage specificity of promastigote attachment to and release from the vector midgut, which are key events in the development of transmissible infections in the fly...|$|R
40|$|Two Chlamydiales have {{previously}} {{been found to}} infect Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), Candidatus Piscichlamydia salmonis and Candidatus Clavichlamydia salmonicola. Both develop intracellularly in cyst-like inclusions in gill cells, generally referred to as epitheliocysts. Here, we present evidence for the association of a novel species of Chlamydiales with epitheliocystis in Atlantic salmon. Based on its partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence, {{it is a new}} member of the family Simkaniaceae, and a 95. 7 % identity to the type species Candidatus Syngnamydia venezia suggests inclusion in the candidate genus Syngnamydia. The presence of the bacterium in epitheliocysts in gills of Atlantic salmon was demonstrated by RNA–RNA hybridization. Ultrastructurally, the novel bacterium produces pleomorphic reticulate bodies and elementary bodies (EBs) with a characteristic morphology. The EBs are short rods with a <b>terminal</b> disc-like <b>cap</b> area, a sub-apical spherical vacuole-like electron-lucent structure and a post-equatorial nucleoid. We propose the name Candidatus Syngnamydia salmonis for this new agent from epitheliocysts in seawater-reared salmon...|$|R
