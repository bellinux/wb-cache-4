40|$|In the Japanese, Formosan and crab-eating monkeys, the dorsal {{metatarsal}} {{arteries and}} their lateral distal perforating branches were well developed and supplied, directly or via <b>the</b> <b>catella</b> plantaris distalis, <b>the</b> plantar digital arteries. In the black ape, the plantar digital arteries {{arose from the}} medial plantar artery. The plantar metatarsal arteries of these monkeys, including the black ape, arose from <b>the</b> <b>catella</b> plantaris proximalis or deep plantar arch and were classified into the superficial plantar metatarsal (sM), superficial plantar intermetatarsal (sI), deep plantar metatarsal (dM) and deep plantar intermetatarsal (dI) arteries {{in relation to the}} interosseous muscles and metatarsal bones. This classification largely coincides with that of the human hand and foot (Murakami, 1969, 1971) and the monkey hand (Nakai et al., 1987). </p...|$|R

40|$|The palmar {{metacarpal}} arteries in monkey {{hands were}} studied. The palmar metacarpal arteries {{arose from the}} deep palmar arch or catella palmaris proximalis and descended in the deep palm, forming <b>the</b> <b>catella</b> palmaris distalis at the distal end of the metacarpus. The palmar metacarpal arteries could be classified into four kinds {{in relation to the}} interosseous muscles and metacarpal bones: (i) the superficial palmar metacarpal (sM) arteries descending on the palmar surfaces of the interosseous muscles along the metacarpal bones, (ii) the superficial palmar intermetacarpal (sI) arteries descending on the palmar surfaces of the interosseous muscles along the intermetacarpal spaces, (iii) the deep palmar metacarpal (dM) arteries descending deep in the interosseous muscles along the metacarpal bones, and (iv) the deep palmar intermetacarpal (dI) arteries descending deep in the interosseous muscles along the intermetacarpal spaces. These findings largely coincide with those obtained from studies of the human hand by Murakami (1969). </p...|$|R
