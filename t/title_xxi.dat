SCHIP programs are run by the individual states according to requirements set by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and may be structured as independent programs separate from Medicaid (separate child health programs), as expansions of their Medicaid programs (SCHIP Medicaid expansion programs), or combine these approaches (SCHIP combination programs). States receive enhanced federal funds for their SCHIP programs at a rate above the regular Medicaid match.|$|E
50|$|Part II, <b>Title</b> <b>XXI,</b> Law xiii: What Duties a Squire Should Perform Before He Receives the Order of Knighthood Cleanliness {{makes all}} things that are visible look well, just as elegance makes them appear graceful, each in its own way. Hence the ancients deemed it proper that knights should be created without any {{suspicion}} of blemish. For, as they should practice purity among themselves and {{it ought to be}} manifested in their good qualities and their habits, as we have stated; they should also display it externally in their clothing, and in the arms which they bear. For although their calling is rude and bloody, as it is concerned with wounds and death; nevertheless, their minds should not refuse to be naturally pleased with things which are beautiful and elegant, and especially when they wear them; for the reason that, on the one hand, they confer joy and comfort upon them, and, on the other, it induces them to perform intrepid deeds of arms, since that they are aware that they will be better known on this account, and that all persons will pay more attention to what they do; therefore cleanliness and elegance are not impediments to the bravery and ferocity which they ought to possess. Moreover, as we stated above, their external appearance indicates the condition of their minds, and, for this reason, the ancients directed that a squire should be of noble descent; that the day before he received the order of knighthood he should keep watch; and that on the day when he received it, in the afternoon, the squires should bathe him and wash his head along with his hands, and place him in the best bed that they could find, and then it was the duty of the knights to dress him in the best garments they had.|$|E
50|$|Part II, <b>Title</b> <b>XXI,</b> Law iv: Knights Should Possess Four Chief Virtues Excellent qualities {{which men}} {{naturally}} possess are called good habits, and are styled virtutes in Latin, and {{of these four}} are superior, namely, prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice. Although every man should desire to be good, and endeavor to acquire these virtues, not only the preachers whom we have mentioned, but others as well, whose duty it is to maintain the country by means of their labors and exertions; among them, there are none, to whom this is more becoming than to the defenders, {{for the reason that}} it is their duty to protect the Church, the monarchs, and all others. Prudence will enable them to do this to advantage, and without injury; fortitude will cause them to be firm and not irresolute in what they do; moderation will induce them to perform their duties as they should, and not be guilty of excess; and justice will enable them to act according to the right. For this reason the ancients, by way of commemoration, caused arms of four kinds to be made for the knights; first, such as they clothe themselves with, and wear; second, those with which they gird themselves; third, those which they bear in front of them; fourth, those with which they strike; And although these are of many forms, nevertheless they are designed for two purposes; blows, which are called weapons. And because the defenders did not ordinarily possess these weapons, and, even though they had them, might not always be able to carry them, the ancients deemed it proper to contrive one which should be emblematic of all these, and this is the sword. For, as the arms which men put on for the purpose of defense indicate prudence, which is a virtue that protects them from all evils which can come upon them through their own fault; so the hilt of a sword which a man holds in his grasp, is also suggestive of this, {{for as long as he}} holds it, he has the power to raise or lower it, or strike with it, or abandon it; and as the arms which a man carries before him to defend himself, denote fortitude, which is a virtue that renders him steadfast in the midst of dangers which may come upon him, so all the fortitude of the sword lies in its pommel, for to it is attached the hilt, the guard, and the blade.|$|E

40|$|The Europeanisation {{of energy}} policy has {{occupied}} a remote {{place in the}} European integration literature to date. However, current developments such as the Energy Policy for Europe launched in 2007 and the Lisbon Treaty <b>Title</b> <b>XXI</b> on Energy have given greater prominence to this policy area within the integration process.

And indeed, European studies are just beginning to shed light on this policy area. Against this backdrop, this article examines the EU environmental performance, supported by the Environmental Policy Integration (EPI), as a driver for energy governance during the process of Europeanisation.

40|$|Due to the {{low risk}} of not {{insuring}} a healthy child for a short, finite period of time, it’s plausible that SCHIP mandatory wait periods, where a child must forgo private insurance for several months before enrolling in SCHIP, do not provide enough incentive for parents to keep their children enrolled in private insurance. Using data from the 1996 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we find that children eligible for SCHIP in states with shorter mandatory wait periods {{are more likely to}} be uninsured during the six months following the implementation of SCHIP than children in states with no mandatory wait periods.

40|$|The {{coherent}} {{regulation of}} Energy and Environment in the European Union – using shale gas as a case-study To adapt to newly emerging environmental and energy challenges, European {{energy and environmental}} law has undergone many revisions and changes throughout the past 30 years. The successful regulation of all environmental aspects of human activities, and the interaction between environmental and energy priorities, {{has proven to be}} challenging. The inclusion of the new <b>title</b> <b>XXI</b> on energy in the Lisbon Treaty changed the Union’s competences and the legal basis to act in this regard. It still has to be seen if this new constitutional setup is better suited to combine energy supply security {{on the one hand and}} environmental protection concerns on the other. One emerging subject in both such areas of law, which is testimony to this challenge, is the extraction of unconventional gas resources, such as shale gas, which is a possible response to both increasing energy demand in the European Union and dependence on gas imports from third countries such as Russia. The large scale and manipulative nature of hydraulic fracturing techniques elicits a mixed response due to a large realm of unknowns, not only about externalities but also concerning the ability of the technology to deliver. Characterised by uncertainties and promises to address climate change, shale gas extraction raises several technical, ethical and legal issues. The research project will (a) test the new constitutional setup on the basis of this challenging case study, (b) assess the Union’s quest for a common energy policy in the absence of a Treaty provision and (c) further analyse other cross cutting issues subject to the environmental and energy supply security challenge, as well as (d) analyse the status of the precautionary principle in European (Environmental) law and (e) assess the existing legal framework on a Union level, taking into account the regulatory experience gained in the United States. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "States provide health care coverage to about 60 million low-income uninsured adults and children largely through two federal-state programs [...] Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Medicaid, established in title XIX of the Social Security Act, generally covers low-income families and elderly and disabled individuals, and SCHIP, established in <b>title</b> <b>XXI</b> of the act, covers children in families whose incomes, although low, are above Medicaid's eligibility requirements. In 2001, the Secretary of Health and Human Services announced a new initiative [...] the Health Insurance Flexibility and Accountability Initiative (HIFA) [...] under which states could expand coverage to uninsured populations using Medicaid and SCHIP funds. HIFA encourages states to develop coordinated public and private health insurance coverage options and to target program resources to uninsured individuals with incomes below 200 {{percent of the federal}} poverty level (FPL). Authority for this initiative comes from section 1115 of the Social Security Act, which allows the Secretary to waive many of the statutory requirements of Medicaid or SCHIP in the case of experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects that promote program objectives. Within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has the lead role in reviewing HIFA waiver applications. In a July 2002 report, we raised legal and policy concerns about the need to clearly establish purposes and populations for which SCHIP funds may be spent. Our specific concerns related to HHS's approval of a HIFA waiver for Arizona, which proposed using unspent SCHIP funds to cover childless adults. We reported that, in our view, approving a waiver to use SCHIP funds for expanding coverage to childless adults was inconsistent with SCHIP's statutory objective to expand health coverage to low-income children. Because the SCHIP statute requires that unused funds be redistributed to states that have spent their allotments, states' coverage of childless adults using SCHIP funds decreases the funding available in future years for reallocation to states with unmet SCHIP needs. We also reported that HHS had approved HIFA waivers for Arizona and California to use SCHIP funds to cover parents of SCHIP- and Medicaid-eligible children without regard to cost-effectiveness, even though the SCHIP statute provides that families may be covered only if such coverage is cost-effective [...] that is, only if covering the family costs no more than covering the eligible children. We suggested that Congress consider specifying in statute that SCHIP funds are not available to cover childless adults and recommended that HHS deny any pending or future state proposals to spend SCHIP funds for such coverage. We also suggested that Congress consider establishing which statutory objectives should take precedence: those of the SCHIP statute, which authorizes family coverage only if cost-effective, or those of section 1115, which allows certain statutory provisions [...] such as cost-effectiveness tests [...] to be set aside. Congress requested that we update our analysis of states' HIFA waiver proposals and approved by HHS after July 2002. ...|$|E
