5|$|In Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, Lohan meets and {{interviews}} victims of human trafficking in Delhi, Kolkata and {{a village in}} West Bengal. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exploitation and abuse they have experienced, describing sexual slavery, physical abuse and difficulties in bringing their traffickers to justice. She also talks to a former trafficker and parents of trafficked children. One trafficked boy says {{that he can not}} go back home because his mother is ill. A mother who trafficked her daughter describes how her family did not have enough food, and how even though they never received the promised payments for her daughter's work, at least she was fed.|$|E
25|$|In Week 29, Alan, Wildcat, and Jay Garrick (Flash) are {{the only}} members of the JSA present on Thanksgiving. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{other members of the}} JSA and about the new Infinity Inc., which is a new version of a team of which Alan's daughter, Jade, was a member.|$|E

25|$|The Sheik Ilderim {{announces that}} {{he is looking for}} a chariot driver to race his team in the coming tournament. Judah, wanting revenge, offers to drive the sheik's chariot, as he intends to defeat Messala. Balthasar and his {{daughter}} Iras are sitting at a fountain in the stadium. Messala's chariot nearly hits them but Judah intervenes. Balthasar thanks Ben-Hur and presents him with a gift. Judah heads to Sheik Ilderim's tent. The servant Malluch accompanies him, and <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Christ; Malluch relates Balthasar's story of the Magi. They realize that Judah saved the man who saw the Christ soon after his birth.|$|E
25|$|After {{she almost}} kisses Alfie, Kat nearly has sex with Max, but regrets it {{and goes to}} Alfie for comfort. The next day, she tells Alfie {{that she wants to}} get back {{together}} with him, but he tells her that he is not ready as {{he does not want to}} hurt her again. This causes Kat to reevaluate her life, so she visits the convent where she gave birth to Zoe to seek some answers, though it is now a nun's care home. A nun, Sister Ruth (June Whitfield), remembers her going into labour and <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> past and the future. Kat then leaves and goes to the police station to make a statement about Harry. Ruth checks their records and discovers that Kat also gave birth to a son. Later, a content Kat returns to Walford and tells Stacey and Alfie that she has finally made her peace with the past and is no longer willing to let Harry control her.|$|E
500|$|Children {{use words}} {{differently}} for objects, spatial relations and actions. Children ages {{one to three}} often rely on general purpose deictic words such as [...] "here", [...] "that" [...] or [...] "look" [...] accompanied by a gesture, which is most often pointing, to pick out specific objects. Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original. This can result in word overextension or misuses of words. Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents. Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words. When children {{come into contact with}} spatial relations, <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> location of one object with respect to another. They name the object located and use a deictic term, such as here or [...] "there" [...] for location, or they name both the object located and its location. They can also use a general purpose locative marker, which is a preposition, postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location. Children's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result. Children use a small number of general purpose verbs, such as [...] "do" [...] and [...] "make" [...] for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited. Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions. Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb. In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say.|$|E

2500|$|... "If I mistake not, it is {{the common}} {{sentiment}} of the secessionists of the South, that <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, but say nothing about the Union.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the series}} finale, an angelic Baltar and Cylon Number Six are walking down a {{sidewalk}} in modern-day New York City. They are unseen and unheard by the people around them. As the two walk, they notice technologically advanced robots, computers, and other cybernetic devices, and <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> technological advancements the humans have made since the Colonists and Humanoid Cylons first arrived to this Earth, over 150,000 years earlier. Cylon Number Six and Baltar have an exchange over one of the ongoing themes from the series, [...] "All of this has happened before. But the question remains, does all of this have to happen again?" [...] Consequently, the revelation that Battlestar Galactica takes place in our collective prehistoric past means that unlike most space opera science fiction stories, the series is a fictional tale of ancient history rather than future history and serves as a fictional tale of origin for modern humanity.|$|E
2500|$|The Escapist's Earnest Cavalli {{called it}} [...] "100 {{percent of your}} daily {{recommended}} allotment of pure, military-grade cute", while GameSetWatch's Danny Cowan called it [...] "every bit as cute as you'd expect, and then some". Play This Thing's Greg Costikyan wrote that while the game was short at about 10 minutes or less in length, the animation, story, and voice acting made for a [...] "highly effective game". Rock Paper Shotgun's wrote that [...] "the cute-o-meter has just started hissing heart-shaped clouds of steam and leaking glitter" [...] {{with the release of}} the game. Denver Westwords Thorin Klosowski named it their [...] "browser game of the week", and wrote that instead of providing people nostalgia, it provided the feeling of [...] "being a kid and making up your own worlds, your own games and your own ridiculous logic". Times Doug Aamoth was magical, fun, and [...] "one of those things people are referring to when <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> good parts of the internet". An editor for Yahoo! Games called it cute, and the [...] "sweetest, maddest game you’re going to play all year". |url=http://uk.videogames.games.yahoo.com/ba/news/my-green-ponycorn-is-called-poo-pants-8a46ba.html |publisher=Yahoo! Games |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2011-05-26}} PC Gamers Lewis Denby felt that while it was cute and the history of its creation was [...] "heart-warming", it was also a decent game in its own right. Despite its short length, Torontoist's Jaime Woo felt that the game derived its quality from Cassie's [...] "childhood innocence" [...] and creativity. He felt that another contributing factor to its quality was her gender, which he felt was underrepresented in video games. The game was honoured as a finalist at Indiecade 2011, where it was nominated for the [...] "Community Impact Award". Cassie Creighton has been named by Backbone Magazine as one of the Top 15 Canadians in Digital Media, alongside the creators of Flickr, StumbleUpon, and the creator of the Civilization series of video games.|$|E

60|$|Yet it is {{extraordinary}} to observe how {{some people will}} talk about him, as <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> good old times; how they will regret his disappearance, {{in the course of}} this world's development, from such and such lands where his absence is a blessed relief and an indispensable preparation for the sowing of the very first seeds of any influence that can exalt humanity; how, even with the evidence of himself before them, they will either be determined to believe, or will suffer themselves to be persuaded into believing, that he is something which their five senses tell them he is not.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 DJ Pimp and DJ R {{appeared}} in a hip hop documentary titled Hip Hop Priča iz Hrvatske. <b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> group and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the Croatian hip hop scene.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{weather for}} a while. Matthew was of opinion {{they were going}} to have some rain. Ann, who was in one of her {{contradictory}} moods, thought there was frost in the air.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> more <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter, {{the greater}} became Harvey's disinclination to go over.

6000|$|... "I didn't mean to {{show you}} this, but it's {{the best way of}} {{explaining}} what I think," [...] Jake said with some diffidence. [...] "I'm weak in technique, because I haven't been taught, but I imagine I've got sensibility. It's plain that when you paint a portrait you must study form and color, but there's something else that you can only feel. I don't mean the character that's expressed by the mouth and eyes; it's something vague and elusive that psychologists give you a hint of when <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> aura. Of course you can't paint it, but unless it, so to speak, glimmers through the work, your portrait's dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bosh," [...] {{answered}} Grant. [...] "I {{never said}} a word against eminent men of science. What I complain of is a vague popular philosophy which supposes itself to be scientific when it is really nothing but a sort of new religion and an uncommonly nasty one. When people talked about the fall of man they knew they were talking about a mystery, a thing they didn't understand. Now that <b>they</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> survival of the fittest they think they do understand it, whereas they have not merely no notion, they have an elaborately false notion of what the words mean. The Darwinian movement has made no difference to mankind, except that, instead of talking unphilosophically about philosophy, they now talk unscientifically about science." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fellow like me {{comes along}} and sizes up the proposition. I've got two choices. I can herd with the suckers, or I can herd with the robbers. As a sucker, I win nothing. Even the crusts of bread are {{snatched}} {{out of my mouth}} by the robbers. I work hard all my days, and die working. And I ain't never had a flutter. I've had nothing but work, work, work. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> dignity of labor. I tell you there ain't no dignity in that sort of labor. My other choice is to herd with the robbers, and I herd with them. I play that choice wide open to win. I get the automobiles, and the porterhouse steaks, and the soft beds.|$|E
60|$|Neither {{spoke for}} a while. Later on, <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> coming election. If the Party got back, Phillips {{would go to}} the Board of Trade. It would afford him a better {{platform}} for the introduction of his land scheme.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010 {{he was a}} {{guest on}} Studio B's Agape program {{together}} with Serbian Orthodox bishop Porfirije where <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> meaning of life, finding ones's self way in life, slowing down, drug abuse and rehabilitation (Rambo confessed using marijuana for 20 years). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhnIb5BOKnk&feature=endscreen&NR=1 ...|$|R
60|$|The idea {{seemed to}} amuse him, for he smiled, and the stem lines in his countenance relaxed for a moment.

60|$|October 1.--Wrote my task, {{then walked}} from one till half-past four. Dogs took a hare. They always catch one on Sunday--a Puritan {{would say the}} devil was in them. I think I shall get more done this evening. I would fain {{conclude}} the volume at the Treaty of Tilsit, which will make it a pretty long one, by the by. J.B. expressed himself much pleased with Nap., which gives me much courage. He is gloomy enough when things are not well. And then I will try something at my Canongate. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pitcher going to the well; but if it goes not to the well, how shall we get water? It will bring home none when it stands on the shelf, I trow. In literature, as in love, courage is half the battle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I mean Lord Warburton and his friends--the {{radicals}} of {{the upper}} class. Of course I only know the way it strikes me. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> changes, but I don't think they quite realise. You and I, you know, {{we know what it}} is to have lived under democratic institutions: I always thought them very comfortable, but I was used to them from the first. And then I ain't a lord; you're a lady, my dear, but I ain't a lord. Now over here I don't think it quite comes home to them. It's a matter of every day and every hour, and I don't think many of them would find it as pleasant as what they've got. Of course if they want to try, it's their own business; but I expect they won't try very hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some day," [...] Carl was musing, [...] "your {{children}} and mine will say, 'You certainly {{lived in the}} most marvelous age in the world.' Think of it. <b>They</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> romance of the Crusades and the Romans and all that, but think of the miracles we've seen already, and we're only kids. Aviation and the automobile and wireless and moving pictures and electric locomotives and electric cooking {{and the use of}} radium and the X-ray and the linotype and the submarine and the labor movement--the I. W. W. and syndicalism and all that--not that I know anything about the labor movement, but I suppose it's the most important of all. And Metchnikoff and Ehrlich. Oh yes, and a good share of the development of the electric light and telephone and the phonograph.... Golly! In just a few years!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{lives of}} guns; what number of rounds some will stand {{and others will}} not; how soon one can make two good guns out of three spoilt ones, and what crazy luck {{sometimes}} goes with a single shot or a blind salvo.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> yacht until Mabel got up {{and took}} them to the drawing-room. She was curious, but in the {{meantime}} did not think her curiosity would be satisfied. Bob knew no more than he had told and it was plain that Wyndham meant to use reserve.|$|R
60|$|They took each other's {{hands and}} wandered out of <b>the</b> great palace; <b>they</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{grandmother}} and the roses on the leads, wherever they came the winds hushed {{and the sun}} came out.
