30|$|From the {{aeration}} tank, {{the treated}} sewage/activated sludge mixture {{passes through a}} port in the wall into the settling tank or clarifier. Here, the heavier activated sludge mass settles {{to the bottom and}} the clear treated liquid flows over a weir and into the discharge line. The retention time within this section is usually 4  h. The settled sludge or bacteria is then returned back to the aeration tank by the air <b>lift</b> <b>sludge</b> return system.|$|R

5000|$|The {{exclusion}} principle is most commonly applied when one poses this scenario; One usually considers that the desire <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> one’s arm as a mental event, and the lifting on one's arm, a physical event. According to the {{exclusion principle}}, there must be no event that does not supervene on e while causing e*. To show this better, substitute [...] "the desire <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> one's arm" [...] for [...] "e", and [...] "one <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> their arm" [...] for [...] "e*".|$|R
