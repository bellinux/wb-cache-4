40|$|We use "selecting" as {{a general}} term for {{selection}} processes, including filtering, retrieval, routing, and searching. The search for recorded knowledge in a digital library environment is examined in terms of selection at three levels: 1. Selecting which library (repository) to look in; 2. Selecting which document(s) within a library to look at; and 3. Selecting fragments of data (<b>text,</b> <b>numeric</b> data, images) from within a document. These tasks with their di#ering problems have, historically, been treated as separate and di#erent. Examination and comparison of these three processes reveal similarities and di#erences between the three levels. The three selecting processes are fundamentally the same in theory. The di#erences in practice are seen as arising from differing deficiencies in internal structure or lack of metadata. Identification of these deficiencies provides a basis for an agenda of research and development. Introduction This paper examines the process of selection at th [...] ...|$|E

The basic idea of the method is to create an index based on WordNet to expand the tuple words semantically for text attributes and on the information of numeric attributes. The candidate results for a query are retrieved by the index and a simple SQL selection statement, and then top-N answers are obtained.

IRVEs present {{a number of important}} information. We describe a set of design issues for this type of integrated visualization and demonstrate a coordinated, multiple-views approach to support 2 D and 3 D visualization interactions such as overview, navigation, details-ondemand, and brushing-and-linking. In the CAVE, spatial information in a VE is interactively linked to embedded visualizations of related abstract information. Software architecture issues are discussed with details of our implementation applied to the domain of chemical information visualization. Lastly, we subject our system to an informal usability evaluation and identify usability issues with interaction and navigation that guides future work in these environments...|$|E
40|$|Advancements in {{healthcare}} industry with {{new technology and}} population growth {{has given rise to}} security threat to our most personal data. The healthcare data management system consists of records in different formats such as <b>text,</b> <b>numeric,</b> pictures and videos leading to data which is big and unstructured. Also, hospitals have several branches at different locations throughout a country and overseas. In view of these requirements a cloud based healthcare management system can be an effective solution for efficient health care data management. One of the major concerns of a cloud based healthcare system is the security aspect. It includes theft to identity, tax fraudulence, insurance frauds, medical frauds and defamation of high profile patients. Hence, a secure data access and retrieval is needed in order to provide security of critical medical records in health care management system. Biometric authentication mechanism is suitable in this scenario since it overcomes the limitations of token theft and forgetting passwords in conventional token id-password mechanism used for providing security. It also has high accuracy rate for secure data access and retrieval. In this paper we propose BAMHealthCloud which is a cloud based system for management of healthcare data, it ensures security of data through biometric authentication. It has been developed after performing a detailed case study on healthcare sector in a developing country. Training of the signature samples for authentication purpose has been performed in parallel on hadoop MapReduce framework using Resilient Backpropagation neural network. From rigorous experiments it can be concluded that it achieves a speedup of 9 x, Equal error rate (EER) of 0. 12, sensitivity of 0. 98 and specificity of 0. 95 as compared to other approaches existing in literature...|$|E

Design pedagogy uses a rich body of sources and is informed by deep communication between faculty and student. Advancing technology for distribution and manipulation of digital design media and a pervasive computer network at the Harvard Graduate School of Design provide an ideal environment for investigating new methods of access to design resources. A research initiative called the DOORS project (Design-Oriented On-line Resource System) will make a variety of design reference materials available over the GSD's computer network Potentially, DOORS will provide access to: - the Frances Loeb Library's visual and special collections, - slides, drawings, photographs, videos, - private faculty slide collections, - maps and geographic information systems of <b>text,</b> <b>numeric</b> and other visual databases of three- dimensional computer models, - computer-generated animations and digital video segments with sound of multimedia projects. As early pilot versions of DOORS are released, faculty and students will gather visual information for study and modification, analyze images and models, compare and link design documentation in different formats, develop lectures and make presentations from computers in offices, classrooms, and studio work areas. Emphasis will be placed on flexibility, as this particular tool's success will hinge on its ability to respond to different approaches to design and instruction. DOORS proposes to offer three modalities, browsing, composition and presentation, to enable searching, organizati-on, and display. Using established library standards for record format, subject access and keyword indexing, browsing will offer flexible and diverse search criteria. Composition will provide tools for linking, annotation and manipulation of assembled materials. Individual presentations will be viewed in classrooms, studios or offices. A pilot project to assemble some of the basic technology and expertise required is currently under way. The objective of the pilot is to deliver a slice of material over the GSD's local area network in order to raise awareness of the tool's potential among faculty and students, to evaluate its effectiveness, and to formulate technical specifications for later project phases...|$|E

40|$|In {{most cases}} GISs are {{concerned}} with heterogeneous data and, in addition, frequently data with a different level of detail are managed. In this case a rigorous GIS data model must be applied both to low and high detail sets; the former in general really needs such a model, the latter doesn 2 ̆ 7 t. The reason is that low detail data often need complex processing while high detail data need less complex processing, or are just used as an attached visual document.
