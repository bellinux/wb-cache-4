40|$|The study {{examines}} the changing {{culture of the}} community that occupied the Kinver rock houses over three centuries. They are regarded as an interesting but incidental feature of the rural landscape, rather than an unusual and historically important aspect of post mediaeval and modern life. The Kinver Edge rock houses were created in response to growing demand rather than desperate need and provide an unusually detailed record of a community living on the edge, with the names and occupations of its residents appearing in legal documents and parish registers throughout the late C 18 th and C 19 th. The rock houses which formed the three small enclaves clustering {{on the periphery of}} the village were the forerunners of the dormitory suburb. In this respect, the social history of the rock houses is the history of Kinver and of many other villages like it, from c. 1770 to c. 1950. Their creation, use, change and decline in use from working community to café and tea rooms, human resource to <b>tourist</b> <b>amenity,</b> spells out the centuries-long social and economic changes which have altered not only the appearance but also the fabric and substance of things across the U.

40|$|This study centres on tourists’ {{satisfaction}} level; {{with specific}} {{attention given to}} their experience and expectation of 20 holiday attributes during their visits to Penang. The study adapts the model of Holiday Satisfaction (HOLSAT) to measure the difference between experience and expectation of holiday attributes. The attributes employed are categorised into four groups, namely accessibility, accommodation, <b>tourist</b> <b>amenities</b> and food/meals. Results are drawn from a questionnaire survey of 4170 domestic and international tourists who visited Penang in 2014. The data is analysed quantitatively using matrices that show the mean score of expectation, plotted against the mean score of experience on a two-dimensional axis. The significance of the results is determined using a paired t-test at a scale of 1 : 1000. A similar pattern of satisfaction and dissatisfaction level was detected for international and domestic tourists. Overall, the study observed similar satisfaction and dissatisfaction patterns for all attribute groups, for both international and domestic groups. Despite a slight difference in p values, both accessibility and accommodation attributes performed excellently, except for attribute [3] ‘availability of information for tourists at entry points’ as perceived by the domestic group. However, the results for food/meals and <b>tourist</b> <b>amenities</b> should {{be of interest to}} tourism service providers as these are the attributes that need to be significantly improved upon and enhanced in order to increase tourists’ positive experience; especially for the domestic group. Specific attention should be directed towards conserving the ocean and beaches, as they house many of the main tourism developments and activities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to measure tourist's {{satisfaction}} among international and domestic visitors while embarking for holiday in Pahang, Malaysia. Holiday Satisfaction model (HOLSAT) was utilized in this study in order to determine the gap between tourist's expectations and experiences based on 47 positive and negative attributes that were grouped into six categories namely; accessibility, accommodation, <b>tourist</b> <b>amenities,</b> <b>tourist</b> activities, food/meal and tourism attractions. The result was drawn from questionnaire survey of 389 international visitors and 259 domestic visitors who visited Pahang in 2010. The data were analyzed using matrices which shown the mean scores of expectations, the mean score of experience and the mean of difference between experience and expectation scores. The mean scores of expectation were then plotted against experience in a two dimensional map for positive and negative attributes. The t-test was performed to identify the significant result of each attributes at 1 : 1000 levels. The findings provide Pahang's tourism stakeholders with insights about the level of satisfactions among domestic tourists and call for better improvements strategies for future tourism development in Pahang...|$|R

40|$|The {{expectations}} of cities served by High Speed Rail are numerous.

The development of tourism is also influenced by the collective strategies of local stakeholders.
