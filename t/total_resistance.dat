25|$|An {{integrated}} system has several technical advantages {{in comparison to}} towed barges. Traditionally tugs, being short in length, have to operate at relatively high Froude numbers resulting in high wave making resistance and the barges, being towed in the tugs' wake, have skegs that improve directional stability but increase drag. Positioning the tug behind the barge in a stern notch improves the hydrodynamic efficiency of the combination, resulting in significant reductions in the <b>total</b> <b>resistance.</b> In addition the tug, operating {{in the wake of}} the barge, has better control over the combination and thus improves seaworthiness and maneuverability in comparison to the traditional towing arrangement.|$|E
25|$|Vactrols {{have been}} used as {{remote-controlled}} resistors for precise ground termination of Beverage and Ewe type antennae. In a typical ham radio setup, the vactrol is placed in the termination box at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies <b>total</b> <b>resistance</b> between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his radio shack by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a potentiometer. Tuning with vactrols improves directional cardioid pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols are superior to traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of neon lamps acting as gas dischargers.|$|E

40|$|The Holtrop & Mennen {{method is}} widely used at the initial design stage of ships for {{estimating}} {{the resistance of the}} ship (Holtrop and Mennen, 1982). The Holtrop & Mennen method provide a prediction of the <b>total</b> <b>resistance’s</b> components. In this work we present a neural network model which performs the same task as the Holtrop & Mennem’s method, for two of the <b>total</b> <b>resistance’s</b> components. A multilayer perceptron has been therefore trained to learn the relationship between the input (length-displacement ratio, prismatic coefficient, longitudinal position of the centre of buoyancy, after body form and Froude number) and the target variables (form factor and wave-making and wave-breaking resistance per unit weight of displacement). The network architecture with best generalization properties was obtained through an exhaustive validation analysis (Bishop, 1995).

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the hypothesis that}} atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a primary vasodilator, which reduces arterial pressure directly and increases <b>total</b> peripheral <b>resistance</b> secondarily by reflex mechanisms. The effects of 30 -minute infusions of ANF (0. 3 jug/kg/min i. v.) were examined in conscious dogs, rats, and monkeys before and after ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. In seven intact, conscious dogs, ANF reduced mean arterial pressure by 7 ± 1 % and cardiac output by 19 ± 3 % and increased <b>total</b> peripheral <b>resistance</b> by 15 ± 3 %. After ganglionic blockade, ANF reduced mean arterial pressure by 7 ± 2 % but still increased <b>total</b> peripheral <b>resistance</b> by 15 +± 3 %. Similar results were observed in four dogs with total cardiac denervation and in six dogs with arterial baroreceptor denervation. Furthermore, in two dogs, combined ganglionic and ael-adrenoceptor blockades failed to alter the rise in <b>total</b> peripheral <b>resistance</b> observed with ANF.

25|$|A non-pharmacological nasal strip, applied prophylactically, variably reduces EIPH, {{depending}} on the severity of EIPH in an individual horse, and the duration and intensity of the exercise bout. The strip minimizes the increase in resistance to breathing, {{and the work of}} breathing as exercise intensity increases. There is synergy with the nasal strip in combination with furosemide. The strip has a spring-like action that mechanically supports and maintains the size of the nasal passage at its narrowest part, the nasal valve. Resistance to breathing doubles during intense or long-duration endurance exercise, with >50% of the <b>total</b> <b>resistance</b> originating at the nasal passages. Decreased resistance reduces the airway forces across the pulmonary capillary membrane, reducing the EIPH. Use of the strip is permitted by the FEI, and in U.S. horse racing.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nettles' death, Applewhite became {{increasingly}} paranoid, fearing a conspiracy against his group. One member who joined in the mid-1980s recalled that Applewhite avoided new converts, worrying that they were infiltrators. He feared a government raid on their home and spoke highly of the Jewish defenders of Masada in ancient Israel who showed <b>total</b> <b>resistance</b> to the Roman Empire. Increasingly, he began to discuss the Apocalypse, comparing the Earth to an overgrown garden {{that was to be}} recycled or rebooted and humanity to a failed experiment. In accordance with the garden metaphor, he stated that the Earth would be [...] "spaded under". Woodward notes that Applewhite's teaching about the Earth's recycling is similar to the cyclical perspective of time found in Buddhism. Applewhite also utilized New Age concepts, but he differed from that movement by predicting that apocalyptic, rather than utopian, changes would soon occur on Earth. He contended that most humans had been brainwashed by Lucifer, but that his followers could break free of this control. He specifically cited sexual urges as the work of Lucifer. In addition, he stated that there were evil extraterrestrials, whom he referred to as [...] "Luciferians", who sought to thwart his mission. He argued that many prominent moral teachers and advocates of political correctness were actually Luciferians. This theme emerged in 1988, possibly in response to the lurid alien abduction stories that were proliferating at the time.|$|E

60|$|The {{first step}} in {{reducing}} the armament {{from that of the}} battle-ship proper, at the same time increasing the speed, produces the armoured cruiser. This type of vessel may carry no guns of more than 8-inch calibre, and the armour belt is reduced to three or four inches in thickness. Instead of the roof over the armour belt, the protective deck is carried all over the ship, but it is not flat, nor is it of equal thickness, as in a battle-ship. On the top and in the middle it is three inches thick, but the sides are six inches and they slope abruptly to below the water-line. Between these sloping sides and the thin armour belt coal is stored, so that a shell would have to penetrate the outer belt, six or eight feet of coal, and a sloping belt of steel six inches thick, the <b>total</b> <b>resistance</b> of which is calculated to be equal to a solid horizontal armour plate fifteen inches thick.|$|E
