25|$|At 12:02p.m., Harris and Klebold {{returned}} to the library. This was 20 minutes after their lethal shooting spree had ended, leaving 12 students dead, one teacher dying, and another 24 students and staff injured. Ten of their victims {{had been killed in}} the library, with their bodies strewn about the floor. Harris and Klebold went to the west windows and opened fire on the police outside. Six minutes later, <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bookshelves near a table where Patrick Ireland lay badly-wounded and unconscious. Student Lisa Kreutz, injured in the earlier library attack, was also in the room, unable to move.|$|E
25|$|At 20:30 the Palmes {{left their}} apartment, unescorted, {{heading for the}} Gamla stan metro station. Several people {{witnessed}} their short walk to the station and, according to the later police investigation, commented {{on the lack of}} bodyguards. The couple took the subway train to the Rådmansgatan station, from where <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Grand Cinema. They met their son and his girlfriend just outside the cinema around 21:00. Olof Palme had not yet purchased tickets which were by then almost sold out. Recognizing the prime minister, the ticket clerk wanted him to have the best seats, and therefore sold Palme the theatre director's seats.|$|E
500|$|As part {{of their}} in-ring personas, MNM had a {{distinctive}} ring entrance. <b>They</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring on a red carpet, while members of the [...] "paparazzi" [...] took photos of them. The male members of MNM usually wore fur coats to the ring. As they took them off, Melina suggestively rubbed their abs while removing the title belts from their pants, where they hung in an exaggerated phallic fashion. Melina has a signature entrance which involves her doing a split on the ring apron—from the floor—then bending forward and crawling under the bottom rope.|$|E

500|$|While he {{was still}} on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third {{interview}} with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then [...] "without being asked a further question" [...] he stated, [...] "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." [...] Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while {{he was looking for}} his stash of beers. According to Webster, <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> saltbushes together, where he pulled off her clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking her for a while before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he [...] "thought she would squeal on [...] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the judge did not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.|$|E
500|$|The Chinese {{authorities}} {{stated that}} the seven people {{who had come to}} Tiananmen Square with the intention of self-immolating were all from the city of Kaifeng in Henan province. The state-run Xinhua News Agency asserted that the self-immolators were [...] "avid practitioners" [...] of Falun Gong who had taken up the practice between 1994 and 1997, and that they fantasised during the preceding week about [...] "how wonderful it would be to enter heaven". Six of them reportedly took the train on 16 January, meeting Chen Guo, the daughter of one of them, upon their arrival in Beijing. The seven agreed to light themselves {{in different parts of the}} Square at 2:30 pm on the designated day with gasoline smuggled there in plastic soda bottles; each had been armed with two lighters in case one would fail. According to the government-run China Association For Cultic Studies website, Wang Jindong stated afterwards that the group arrived in Tiananmen Square by two taxis, and were dropped off at the south of the Great Hall of the People, from where <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spot where they would ignite themselves. Wang said he was approached by police as he was splitting open the soda bottles, and ignited himself hurriedly without assuming the lotus position.

500|$|The Fabulous Kangaroos are {{considered}} {{by many in the}} wrestling world {{as one of the best}} tag-teams in the history of wrestling. In fact, many people in the past held the mistaken belief that The Fabulous Kangaroos invented tag team wrestling, which was not true since tag team wrestling had been seen as early as 1936. The reason for this belief lies in the fact that The Kangaroos were one of the first teams to popularize tag team wrestling, and because tag teaming was often referred to as [...] "Australian rules" [...] or [...] "Australian tag team". The Kangaroos themselves were not slow to play off this belief, often claiming (kayfabe) that they were such a well coordinated tag team because [...] "Amateur team wrestling was very popular in Australia". The term [...] "Australian rules" [...] had been coined long before 1957 debut of The Kangaroos. Records indicate that tag team wrestling was already being referred to as [...] "Australian rules" [...] already in the mid-1940s. The Fabulous Kangaroos were among the first people in wrestling to play up the sports entertainment elements in professional wrestling; beyond being talented wrestlers, Costello especially was also very good at playing up their characters. The Kangaroos showed their [...] "advertising" [...] skills through promotional literature, which stated that The Fabulous Kangaroos had [...] "fashioned a razor-edged aluminum boomerang to cut the jugular of a Kodiak bear from afar". They also frequently threw cardboard boomerangs with their name and pictures on them into the crowd as <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring. The team carried a huge Australian banner with the name [...] "The Fabulous Kangaroos" [...] on it as part of their entrance rituals as well.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, an Allied Mosquito {{reconnaissance}} aircraft flying over Rangoon saw {{no sign of}} the Japanese in the city, and also noticed a message painted {{on the roof of the}} jail by released British prisoners of war. It read, Japs gone. Extract digit - Royal Air Force slang for [...] "Get your finger out" [...] or [...] "Hurry up". Boldly, the crew of the plane tried to land at Mingaladon Airfield, but damaged their tailwheel on the potholed runway preventing them taking off again. <b>They</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jail, where they found 1,000 former prisoners of war who informed them of the Japanese evacuation. The air crew then went to the docks, where they commandeered a sampan and sailed it down the river to meet the landing craft.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 1910, the Mafra Palace {{was also}} the scene for an episode of the Republican Revolution that {{occurred}} in Lisbon. King Manuel II fleeing from the coup in Lisbon, took refuge and over-nighted in the Palace of Mafra. The next day they abandoned the palace, by car, travelling {{with his mother and}} grandmother to the shores of Ericeira, where the royal yacht D. Amélia would take them onto Gibraltar and exile.
