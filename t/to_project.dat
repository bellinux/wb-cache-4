5|$|A North American {{version was}} {{announced}} as EarthBound 64, {{but did not}} materialize when the 60 percent-complete Japanese release was cancelled in August 2000 in reprioritization leading up <b>to</b> <b>Project</b> Dolphin (the code name of the GameCube). At the time, the game was estimated to need another two years of work.|$|E
5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; they were used <b>to</b> <b>project</b> Spanish power over the surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E

5|$|As the West German public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon <b>to</b> <b>project</b> their understanding of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability <b>to</b> <b>project</b> venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{given that}} both {{population}} and prosperity increased substantially in this period, economic recovery in Byzantium {{appears to have}} been strengthening the economic basis of the state.

5|$|The Song {{people used}} the {{turntable}} trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They were all called 'fire trebuchets' {{because they were}} used <b>to</b> <b>project</b> fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance.

5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century.

5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge <b>to</b> <b>project</b> burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E
5|$|After William the Conqueror {{defeated}} Harold Godwinson and the English at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, {{he continued}} to face resistance to his rule {{in the north of}} England. For a number of years, William's position was very insecure. In order <b>to</b> <b>project</b> his influence northwards to control the people of the Danelaw (an area that had for a time been under the control of Scandinavian settlers), he constructed a number of major castles in the North and Midlands of England: including those at Warwick, Nottingham and York. After gaining control of York, the Conqueror turned southwards and arrived at the Roman and Viking city of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|After a long battle, Itachi {{is pushed}} to use Izanami to trap Kabuto in an eternal time-loop {{in his own}} mind, to have him break his jutsu. His soul {{beginning}} to fade, Itachi uses his Sharingan <b>to</b> <b>project</b> his memories to Sasuke to reveal the full story of the events leading to the Uchiha Clan Massacre. Telling his brother {{that he does not}} have to forgive him, Itachi tells Sasuke that he will always love him, no matter what choice he makes from then on. With his brother's parting words, and accepting defeat after his final battle with Naruto, Sasuke renounces destroying the village and devotes himself to protecting it, fulfilling Itachi's wish for his younger brother. Sasuke even adopts Itachi's habit of poking on the forehead as a sign of affection, which Sasuke does with his wife Sakura and daughter Sarada.|$|E

5|$|Anton Meyer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor George Irving. He {{appeared in the}} series from its first episode, broadcast on 12 January 1999, until series four, episode 46, broadcast on 20 August 2002. His role in the show is that of consultant cardiothoracic surgeon {{and head of the}} cardiothoracic surgery department at Holby General. Irving had considerable input in creating the character, who was initially envisioned by the series producers as an Iranian surgeon named Hussein. At Irving's suggestion, Meyer became Hungarian, an emigrant to Britain following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Little of the backstory created for Meyer was ever revealed on-screen, as part of a deliberate bid to present the character as enigmatic, allowing viewers <b>to</b> <b>project</b> their own imagination onto him.|$|E
5|$|Ballistas or springalds were siege {{engines that}} {{worked on the}} same {{principles}} as crossbows. With their origins in Ancient Greece, tension was used <b>to</b> <b>project</b> a bolt or javelin. Missiles fired from these engines had a lower trajectory than trebuchets or mangonels and were more accurate. They were more commonly used against the garrison rather than the buildings of a castle. Eventually cannons developed {{to the point where}} they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the main weapon in siege warfare.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{is married}} to Stephanie and they have two children, Grace and Andrew (born November 2007). His cousin, Scott Fletcher, also played for the Cubs, {{along with many other}} teams over his fifteen-year career. Barrett has spent a {{considerable}} portion of his personal life devoted to helping children. He runs several youth baseball programs, including one in Hawaii, which was inspired from his tenure with the Hawaiian Winter Baseball League. He also works with the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Cubs Care Program to help lesser fortunate and sick children. More recently, he has worked with Kerry Wood and Ryan Dempster to raise money to help Derrek Lee's daughter and research for Leber's congenital amaurosis. Michael Barrett donated $50,000 <b>to</b> <b>Project</b> 3000 and pledged an additional sum of money for every home run he hits. Barrett was also a regular guest on FOX Chicago's The Final Word television show, which is co hosted by Tom Waddle, a former Chicago Bears wide receiver.|$|E

5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that {{a shaft of}} light had been seen <b>to</b> <b>project</b> from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began <b>to</b> <b>project</b> the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came {{to be regarded as}} one of the signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E
5|$|Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor {{known for}} his natural, authentic, and {{understated}} acting style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-five years, from 1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star {{from the end of}} the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability <b>to</b> <b>project</b> his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero.|$|E

Thus, development projects in California funded only by private sources and not requiring approval by a federal agency would be exempt from NEPA, but would likely be subject to CEQA.|$|R
