Of the Hardin passengers, 11 adult men died, while eight women and children and one adult man survived. Kamal Seikaly, an individual quoted in an article from the Lebanese publication Daily Star, stated that according to a May 16, 1912 issue of the Al-Khawater magazine stored in <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>University</b> of Beirut, of the 125 Lebanese aboard, 23 survived.

5|$|Dubnium {{does not}} occur {{naturally}} on Earth and is produced artificially. The first discovery of the element was claimed by the Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in 1968, followed in 1970 by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>University</b> of California. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, resulting in credit for discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was officially named dubnium in 1997 after the town of Dubna, {{the site of the}} JINR.|$|E

5|$|Harvard {{was able}} to secure {{substantial}} new funding for its botanical programs {{in the years after}} the war, but Gray encountered significant trouble finding a suitable replacement for his professorial duties. <b>The</b> <b>American</b> <b>university</b> system had failed to train replacements for its professors. Only Harvard and Yale had botany programs, and in the war and pre-war years there had been few botany students. However, after the war there was an upswing in the numbers of botany students. Gray was grooming Horace Mann Jr. as his replacement, but he died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in November 1868.|$|E
5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with {{the intricacies of the}} Arab–Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>University</b> in Beirut.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, Stevens {{returned}} to the United States and began to study law, taking classes at <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>University</b> and Columbia University in international law and foreign policy.

From Cuba, she went to The Hague for the first World Conference on the Codification of International Law held on 13 March. Presenting her data on what had been accomplished in the Americas, Stevens asked that the international community enact laws to protect women's citizenship. She {{returned to the}} United States and her studies. Though she didn't graduate, in 1931 she became the first woman member of the American Institute of International Law. That same year, she, Belmont and Paul attended the League of Nations meeting in September to present their nationality findings.|$|E
5|$|Jeita I (sometimes {{referred}} to as Nahr-el-Kelb) is a dry cave, 56 metres deep {{to the east of}} the source cave from where the river flows and connected to it by narrow channels. It was first noted in 1833 by Botta and excavated by Godefroy Zumoffen in two positions in 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1910. It was later excavated by Auguste Bergy with materials from both excavations now with the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory, the Archaeological Museum of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>University</b> of Beirut and the private collection of Dr. Gigues. Henri Fleisch noticed an Upper Paleolithic level with further finds including polished Neolithic pieces, primitive potsherds, burned bones and end scrapers. Jacques Cauvin noted similarities in these finds to the Néolithique Moyen period of Byblos. Evidence of later occupation included a Chalcolithic tripod pot found by Father Fleisch and a combed-ware sherd suggested to date to the Early Bronze Age levels at Byblos.|$|E

5|$|The program's {{coaching}} {{extended beyond}} just within the program itself. Bowerman had his athletes mentor {{the community and}} continued to be active in the sport after his retirement. He was also a coach for the US Olympic team in 1972 and an assistant coach in 1968 US Olympic Team. Bill Dellinger coached the distance runners in the 1984 Olympic Games. After Dellinger retired from the University of Oregon, he continued to coach running on a consulting basis despite suffering through a stroke. Tom Heinonen remained a running coach after his retirement at the volunteer level for the University of Oregon Running Club. Alumnus Alberto Salazar became a noted marathon coach after his running days under the employ of Nike. Salazar used controversial coaching tactics like tweaking runners' natural running form, but had coached many athletes to the apex of their careers. He launched an experimental training program called the Oregon Project financed by Nike {{with the purpose of}} integrating African runners' training conditions into American training mixed with modern technology. He also discovered similarities in running posture between sprinters and top level distance runners, two disciplines previously thought to be exceedingly different. Instilling some of these methods into American runners, he was able to coach Kara Goucher to a third-place finish in the Boston Marathon in 2009, an event that East Africans typically dominate. Mo Farah and alumnus Galen Rupp were training partners under Salazar and finished first and second respectively in the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 10k. Rupp was the first American to medal in the 10k since Billy Mills in 1964 and the first medalist not born in Africa since 1988. Also running for Salazar and the Oregon Project, alumnus Matthew Centrowitz Jr. won a gold medal in the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first American to win gold in the 1,500m since Mel Sheppard in 1908, ending a 108 year drought. Similar to his collegiate coaches, Salazar wrote a pair of books about distance running. Matt Centrowitz, another University of Oregon alumnus and father of Matthew, took <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>University</b> track and field program to prominence since the rebirth of the program in 1999.|$|E
