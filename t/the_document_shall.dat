Like de la Cloche, he was pious, though not much turns on that. If Armanni's information is correct, if, when taken, the man wrote to the General of the Jesuits--who knew de la Cloche's handwriting--we can scarcely escape the inference that he was de la Cloche.|$|E

Dither is shown to be essential if quantisation-related distortion is to be avoided. Careful application of noise-shaping is shown to be of audible benefit by increasing the perceived dynamic range of a signal. Various drawbacks of the technique are discussed. In particular the `fragility' of signals processed {{in this way is}} noted, and the ease with which the benefits may be undone is illustrated.

40|$|Personal data” means any {{information}} relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. Anidentifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to anidentification number or {{to one or more}} factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic,cultural or social identity. There are different ways in which an individual can be considered ‘identifiable’. Aperson’s full name is an obvious likely identifier. But a person can also be identifiable from otherinformation, including a combination of identification elements such as physical characteristics, pseudonymsoccupation, address etc. International and national authorities tried to adopt different types of regulations inorder to protect individuals’ personal data and to inform them with respect to their rights. The legalprovisions are continuously changing according to the new realities (society and economy are changing,individuals are using different kind of communications). In order to have a strong protection of personal dataand unitary rules for all member states, the European Commission published in January 2012 a proposal for aGeneral Data Protection Regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personaldata and on the free movement of such data, which will supersede Directive 95 / 46 /EC. A regulation wasconsidered the most appropriate legal instrument to define the new framework for the protection of personaldata in the European Union: is directly binding upon the Member States, is directly applicable within theMember States and as soon as a regulation is passed, it automatically becomes part of the national legalsystem. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>shall</b> be discussed by the European Parliament and the EU Member States meeting inthe Council of Ministers for discussion.

Other tanks to be sampled will be assigned by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) at a later date in the study process as resources allow, <b>the</b> <b>document</b> <b>shall</b> be revised as required. The sampling of headspace for each of these tanks shall be performed using available risers or the Standard Hydrogen Monitoring System (SHMS) cabinet as available. The tank farm vapor cognizant engineer shall assign the injection and sample testing point for each tank and document the point in the field work package. SUMMA TMI canisters, equipped in-line with dual particulate air filters and two silica gel sorbent traps will be used to collect the gas samples. The purpose of dual particulate air filters is to ensure no radioactive particulates are transferred to the SUMMA TMI canisters. The silica gel sorbent traps will effectively eliminate any tritiated water vapor that may be present in the sample gas stream.

40|$|I uppsatsen föreslås, undersöks och problematiseras ett möjligt sätt att definiera begreppet "retorisk funktion". Rhetoric can be {{seen through}} many {{perspectives}} as being a function-centred science. For instance, Bitzer argues that the “[…] situational view of rhetoric takes as its starting point the observable fact that human beings interact functionally with their environment” (Bitzer 1980 : 21). Theories regarding rhetorical genre, from Aristotle to modern theorists such as Carolyn Millers, can also be described as being functional. In fact, throughout the rhetorical field {{it is common to}} read that “x has a rhetorical function”. But what do we mean by that? What does it mean that something has a rhetorical function? This essay will strive to provide an answer to this question in an interesting and atypical fashion. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>shall</b> commence with the philosophy of functionalism in biology and will explore how theorists reason when the question poised concerns functions such as the human heart or the skin of a chameleon. The controversial theorist Ruth Millikan shall then be discussed. She is of the opinion that the way in which she determines functions (which is largely based on natural selection) is transferable to human language. Although it is the opinion of the author that Millikan possesses a questionable view of language {{it should be noted that}} she has constructed useful terms for application in this particular field. After an analysis of her direct- and derived proper functions concept, the novel theories of direct- and derived rhetorical proper functions will be detailed and explained. In the following section, the term function in popular rhetoric theories such as the rhetorical situation and the rhetorical genre shall be discussed and compared to the terms suggested, in order to determine if the terms are meaningful...|$|E
40|$|Germany {{participates in}} ESA's Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Programme {{supporting}} Europe's independent utilization of space through {{the provision of}} space weather information, in particular with respect to hazards to the infrastructure. The delivery of space weather services is gathered under five European expert groups and centres of excellence, among which the German Aerospace Center (DLR) coordinates the Ionospheric Weather Expert Service Center (I-ESC). Furthermore, DLR operates the Ionosphere Monitoring and Prediction Center (IMPC). The service center offers nowcast and forecast information on the ionospheric state as well as warnings on issues related to space weather. Moreover, in 2015 the DLR Neustrelitz invited scientists and experts of scientific institutions, commerce and industry as well as government agencies {{to participate in a}} joint national space weather workshop and continues previous activities organized in 2000, 2005, and 2008. Those events have contributed to establishing the topic of space weather in Germany in order to raise the awareness of possible influences on the highly technological society. Within the framework of the last workshop, a position paper was prepared which is currently in iteration. <b>The</b> <b>document</b> <b>shall</b> help national decision makers to consider the current aspects of space weather issues for their policy and to use existing national resources accordingly. DLR holds two projects {{that are part of the}} International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) : The world-spanning, near real-time network named GIFDS (Global Ionospheric Flare Detection System) and the educational project named SOFIE (SOlar Flares detected by Ionospheric Effects). Both projects deal with the monitoring of the lower ionosphere by means of VLF measurements in order to provide information on solar flare effects. The SOFIE project is a prominent part of the annual Joint Space Weather Summer Camp. In collaboration with the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) and the DLR, the Summer Camp has become a trilateral workshop in which always two of the partners take over the role of the hosts. Of course, Germany has a variety of scientists and experts in diverse institutions dealing with the topic space weather. Amongst others, the working group on extraterrestrial research (AEF: Arbeitsgemeinschaft Extraterrestrische Forschung) promotes space weather activities including various subdisciplines ranging from the Sun to the geospace.
