However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|In the 1110s, Beauchamp became Sheriff of Worcestershire, {{holding the}} office until 1130. Some sources state he {{received}} the office in 1114, and others place the acquisition of the office between December 1113 and April 1116. Beauchamp inherited most of d'Abetot's lands and the hereditary office of Sheriff of Worcestershire when Roger d'Abetot, Urse's son, forfeited his lands and offices after being exiled by Henry I for murder. King Henry I of England granted Beauchamp the right to hunt wolves and foxes in the royal forests of Worcestershire. Along {{with the right to}} hunt in the royal forests came a grant of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pheasants on his own lands, and the right to fine anyone hunting the birds without his permission.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's triumph marked {{their fifth}} European Cup {{and the first}} by an English team since Manchester United had {{defeated}} Bayern Munich in the 1999 final in Barcelona. By winning the European Cup for a fifth time, Liverpool earned the privilege of wearing a multiple-winner badge and <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the trophy (under normal competition rules, the winning club can keep the trophy for only 10 months, as they must deliver it to UEFA {{two months before the}} next year's final). The 2005–06 participants competed for a new identical trophy. The rule to keep the trophy, which had been in effect since the 1968–69 season, was changed for the 2009–10 season, so that the actual trophy remained with UEFA at all times, thus Liverpool was the fifth and last club to accomplish the feat.|$|E

5|$|Before long, Darnley grew arrogant. Not {{content with}} his {{position}} as king consort, he demanded the Crown Matrimonial, which would have made him a co-sovereign of Scotland with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Scottish throne for himself if he outlived his wife. Mary refused his request, and their marriage grew strained even though they conceived by October 1565. He was jealous of her friendship with her Catholic private secretary, David Rizzio, who was rumoured {{to be the father}} of her child. By March 1566, Darnley had entered into a secret conspiracy with Protestant lords, including the nobles who had rebelled against Mary in the Chaseabout Raid. On 9 March, a group of the conspirators, accompanied by Darnley, murdered Rizzio in front of the pregnant Mary at a dinner party in Holyrood Palace. Over the next two days, a disillusioned Darnley switched sides, and Mary received Moray at Holyrood. On the night of 11–12 March, Darnley and Mary escaped from the palace, and took temporary refuge in Dunbar Castle before returning to Edinburgh on 18March. The former rebels Lords Moray, Argyll and Glencairn were restored to the council.|$|E

25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment {{to keep and bear}} arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E
25|$|Hitchens philosophically {{supported}} gun {{rights and}} was generally opposed to gun control.

Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> and bear arms, he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.|$|E
