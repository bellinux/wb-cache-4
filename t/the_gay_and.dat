5|$|Save Our Children, Inc. was a {{political}} coalition formed in 1977 in Miami, Florida to overturn a recently legislated county ordinance that banned discrimination in areas of housing, employment, and public accommodation based on sexual orientation.

The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will {{have a better understanding of}} the psychological and social distresses of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian veterans.|$|E
