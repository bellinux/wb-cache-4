40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the speed and}} accuracy with which latitude and longitude coordinates can be entered into a computer by use of a <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switch</b> unit. In addition, it determined the effect offlight gloves on thumbwheel operation,. and compared two methods of using thumbwheels for entering coordinates. In thefirst method, one thumbwheel unit was used to enter both latitude andlongitude of a given checkpoint before proceeding to the coordnates of the next checkpoint. In the second method, all latitude coordinates were entered sequentially, after which all longitude coordinates were entered in a similar manner. It was {{found that there were}} no significant dfferences in errors between gloved and ungloved operation, or between the two methods of entering coordnates. However, the two-unit method of entry was significantly faster than the one-unit method. I t was concluded that the <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switch</b> is suitable for use in entering navigational coordnates into an airborne computer. INTRODUCT'ION For precise navigation, the airborne operator must periodically update navigational computers by inserting checkpoint information. More specif-ically, he must manually enter latitude and longi-tude coordinates of the checkpoints. He must {{be able to do so}} while wearing gloves, because many missions in high performance aircraft and space-craft necessitate his wearing a full pressure suit. One device that might be used for this purpose is the <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switch.</b> Kolesnik and Plath (1965) demonstrated that thumbwheels could be positioned and read quickly and accurately. How-ever, the task required of their subjects differed from that of entering navigational coordinates, in that it involved only threedigit numbers; naviga-tional coordinates may require use of seven digits PIUS an alphabetic prefix. Others have investigated the effects of gloves on manual dexterity, exertible force, and control manblation and obtained in-conclusive results. Bradley (1956), Bradley and Stump (1955), and Jenkins (1958) all found per-formance with gloves superior to that with th...|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{distribute}} both power and data, 6 channel [...] "dumb" [...] repeater boxes were used. The cables carried both data and power. In {{order to meet}} safety standards, the data cable was rated at 600 v, {{to allow it to}} be used in 3 phase power applications. The channel number (also known as an address) was set with three <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switches</b> on each lite and a common practical joke on the part of non-Vari-lite crew, would be to renumber random [...] "lites" [...] (this became a common way of referring to a Vari*Lite unit {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic).|$|R
50|$|The {{new digital}} delay box timers used decimal or {{binary coded decimal}} <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switches</b> to set {{countdown}} timer values in digital logic. The thumbwheels also fed back a visual numerical value that the race car driver could use to help him calculate proper settings. A popular early digital unit of this type was designed and produced by Robert Furrow (B. F. Electronics of Weatherford, Oklahoma). Robert Furrow's delay box utilized a quartz crystal for timing accuracy and Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits. Furrow's digital delay box was a substantial improvement in accuracy and ergonomics but suffered in reliability. In the United States many B.F. Electronics delay timers were sold Nationwide.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} {{the first}} microprocessor based delay box timer {{was introduced by}} Richard Beutnagel (Thorn Microsystems in Rochester, NY). Richard Beutnagel's design also used a quartz crystal time base for accuracy but without the TTL glue logic. The Thorn Microsystems unit utilized a single chip microcomputer from Intel, a professionally fabricated double sided printed circuit board with plated through holes, large BCD <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switches,</b> and rugged solid state bipolar output circuitry (no electromechanical relay). The Thorn Microsystems design reduced parts count to [...] "one chip" [...] and one power transistor substantially reduced PCB (printed circuit board) solder interconnections for a significant enhancement in reliability. The firmware embedded within the Intel microcontroller chip performed all the timing and control functions required of the delay box with quartz crystal digital accuracy.|$|R

For the safety of the patient many safeguards have been built in: a transformer in the output circuit prevents d. c. stimulation and also a leakage current of more than 500 nA, upper and lower frequency limits which are established independently of the computer by means of <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switches,</b> and a built-in battery-powered R-wave synchronised pacemaker, which takes over the rhythm if something should go wrong.

40|$|Simultaneous {{detection}} of gamma rays and neutrons emanating from an unknown source {{has been of}} special significance and importance to consequence management and first responders since {{the earliest days of}} the program. Bechtel Nevada scientists have worked with 6 LiI(Eu) crystals and 6 Li glass to develop field-operable dual sensors that detect gamma rays and neutrons simultaneously. The prototype 6 LiI(Eu) counter, which has been built and tested, is designed to collect data for periods of one second to more than eight hours. The collection time is controlled by <b>thumbwheel</b> <b>switches.</b> A fourpole, high pass filter at 90 KHz reduces microphonic noise from shock or vibration. 6 LiI(Eu) crystals generate completely separable gamma-ray and thermal neutron responses. The 6 LiI(Eu) rate meter consists of a single crystal 3. 8 x 3. 8 cm (1. 5 x 1. 5 in) with a 2. 54 -cm-(1 -in-) thick, annular, high-density, polyethylene ring around the cylinder. Special features are (1) thermal and epithermal neutron detection (0. 025 eV to 250 keV) and (2) typical gamma resolution of 8 % at 661. 6 keV. Monte Carlo N-Particle calculations for characteristics of gamma spectral behavior, neutron attenuation length, relative neutron and gamma detection efficiency are reported...|$|R

The input stage maps sensor or other inputs, such as <b>switches,</b> <b>thumbwheels,</b> and so on, {{to the appropriate}} membership functions and truth values. The processing stage invokes each appropriate rule and generates a result for each, then combines {{the results of the}} rules. Finally, the output stage converts the combined result back into a specific control output value.|$|R
