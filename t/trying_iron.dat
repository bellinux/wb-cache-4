50|$|The {{alternative}} to refining gray iron {{was known as}} 'wet puddling', also known as 'boiling' or 'pig boiling'. This was invented by a puddler named Joseph Hall at Tipton. He began adding scrap iron to the charge. Later he <b>tried</b> adding <b>iron</b> scale (in effect, rust). The result was spectacular in that the furnace boiled violently. This was a chemical reaction between the oxidised iron in the scale and the carbon dissolved in the pig iron. To his surprise, the resultant puddle ball produced good iron.|$|R

5000|$|After {{being named}} Brigadier General, at the {{beginning}} of 1934 he was transferred to the national capital, where he served as royal commissioner at the Bucharest Military Tribunal. In this capacity, he was part of a panel of judges who <b>tried</b> the <b>Iron</b> Guard (Legionnaire) assassins of Prime Minister Ion G. Duca and their moral accomplices. The latter category included Guard leaders Codreanu and retired general Gheorghe Cantacuzino-Grănicerul, as well as prominent affiliates such as Gheorghe Clime, Nichifor Crainic and Mihai Stelescu. He voted to convict the assassins themselves (the Nicadori), but supported the acquittal of Codreanu and Cantacuzino-Grănicerul. He soon after secretly joined the banned Guard and, in recognition for his stance during the trial, was named a member of its senate. At Codreanu's trial in April-May 1938, Petrovicescu appeared as a witness for the defence, praising Codreanu's [...] "proper behaviour" [...] and [...] "patriotism". Due to his repeatedly expressed pro-Iron Guard sympathies, King Carol II retired him in September 1938.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{integration}} of FBO into the new RKO Radio Pictures in 1929, Marcus became the executive vice-president for the new company. He, along with Joseph I. Schnitzer and William LeBaron, were the triumvirate which ran the new company. In February, Marcus announced that the new RCA Photophone process of sound on film was the direction the studio would go in, rather than the alternative of sound on disc. He stated, [...] "Our synthesis of sound to action is all that we would want in accuracy, and certainly the exhibitor's projection and sound problem is, to our mind, a much simplified one with sound-on-film." [...] With sound films becoming the norm, Marcus announced that RKO would still produce 40–50 per cent of their sound films with silent versions as well in 1929.

Their system <b>tried</b> to {{identify}} <b>iron,</b> zinc and nitrogen deficiencies by monitoring lettuce leaves. The capture of the images was done by an analog video camera, and only afterwards the images would be digitized. The first step of the proposed algorithm is the segmentation of the images into leaf and background. In the following a number of size and color features are extracted from both the RGB and HSI representations of the image. Those parameters are finally fed to neural networks and statistical classifiers, which are used to determine the plant condition.|$|R

Later in 1955 Ford was hired by Warner Bros to direct the Naval comedy Mister Roberts, starring Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, William Powell, and James Cagney, but there was conflict between Ford and Fonda, who had been playing the lead role on Broadway {{for the past seven years}} and had misgivings about Ford's direction. During a three-way meeting with producer Leland Hayward to <b>try</b> and <b>iron</b> out the problems, Ford became enraged and punched Fonda on the jaw, knocking him across the room, an action that created a lasting rift between them. After the incident Ford became increasingly morose, drinking heavily and eventually retreating to his yacht, the Araner, and refusing to eat or see anyone. Production was shut down for five days and Ford sobered up, but soon after he suffered a ruptured gallbladder, necessitating emergency surgery, and he was replaced by Mervyn LeRoy.|$|R

Midas tried to escape on a vehicle piloted by one of his Centurions after Iron Man defeated him.

50|$|Bessemer {{licensed}} {{the patent}} for his process to five ironmasters, {{but from the}} outset, the companies had great difficulty producing good quality steel. Mr Göran Fredrik Göransson, a Swedish ironmaster, using the purer charcoal pig iron of that country, {{was the first to}} make good steel by the process, but only after many attempts. His results prompted Bessemer to <b>try</b> a purer <b>iron</b> obtained from Cumberland hematite, but even with this he had only limited success because the quantity of carbon was difficult to control. Robert Forester Mushet, had carried out thousands of experiments at Darkhill Ironworks, in the Forest of Dean, and had shown that the quantity of carbon could be controlled by removing almost all of it from the iron and then adding an exact amount of carbon and manganese, in the form of spiegeleisen. This improved the quality of the finished product and increased its malleability.|$|R
50|$|The first key {{breakthrough}} {{occurred in}} 1828-29, when Scotsman James Beaumont Neilson patented the hot blast technique & process, {{which he had}} conceived {{in an attempt to}} improve the efficiency of conventionally fueled furnaces.

In 1836, he <b>tried</b> smelting anthracite <b>iron</b> on a practical scale at his property, Valley Furnace, near Pottsville, Pennsylvania, while in the same year White & Hazard's LC&N Co. built two experimental blast furnaces in Mauch Chunk. He produced a small quantity of iron, but due to mechanical breakdowns, could not keep the furnace in operation for more than two months. While distinguished visitors, including Governor Joseph Ritner, acknowledged his success, he sold out his share in Valley Furnace and went to New York City.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} an {{investigation}} into the character of the Christian imagination. It examines in depth three central aspects: paradox, anarchy and the childlike, acknowledging that within each category there is something of the unreasonable or nonrational. Rather than <b>trying</b> to <b>iron</b> out or explain away the logically problematic, the thesis explores the possibility that an idea can be contrary to rationality and yet be true and meaningful. It is demonstrated that a number of central tenets of the Christian doctrine require a faith that often goes beyond reason or does not exclusively identify with it. The study involves the systematic analysis of central stylistic features of literary nonsense using Lewis Carroll’s famous Alice stories as exemplar. The construction of a nonpejorative model of nonsense is then used to introduce analogous components of Christian theology with a particular focus on the doctrine of Salvation. Sparked by G. K. Chesterton’s description of the Fall as the condition of ‘being born upside-down’, soteriology is conceived of as a tospsy-turvy reorientation of the will and an imaginative attunement to the absurd. The project culminates in the setting-up of a nonsense theology by considering the practical and evangelical ramifications of associating Christian faith with nonsense literature; and conversely, the value of relating theological principles to the study of literary nonsense. Ultimately, the research suggests that faith is always a risk and that a strictly rational apologetic misrepresents the nature of Christian truth...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} has been {{conducted}} to elucidate the Fe-sites in natural clinoptilolite, and the possibility to produce a reversible replacement of these atoms in the zeolite framework. In order to achieve these results we have <b>tried</b> to introduce <b>iron</b> in clinoptilolite structure after the almost total extraction of the natural iron species. A sample of the purified natural clinoptilolite from Tasajeras deposit, Central region of Cuba, was modified by a hydrothermal treatment with orthophosphoric acid. Iron exchange forms of the orthophosphoric zeolite were obtained using FeSO 4 and Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 solutions. The modified zeolites were studied by multinuclear magnetic resonance (27 Al, 29 Si, 31 P MAS NMR and 129 Xe NMR). Other analytical techniques as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, X-ray diffraction, Mo¨ssbauer and Infrared spectrometry, volumetric measurements and chemical analysis by Induced Plasma Coupled spectroscopy were used to support the results of NMR studies. The presence of iron species with tetrahedral and octahedral coordination {{in the structure of}} a natural clinoptilolite has been confirmed. The influence of iron in tetrahedral coordination in the thermal stability of the clinoptilolite structure was also confirmed...|$|R
