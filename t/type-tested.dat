50|$|Designed in 1954 {{by a team}} under Lionel Haworth and {{intended}} as a more powerful alternative to the Dart, the RB.109 Tyne was initially designed for a power of 2,500 shp but when first run in April 1955 the engine far exceeded expectations and was soon being <b>type-tested</b> at 4,220 shp. The Tyne was developed primarily for the four-engined Vickers Vanguard airliner, the prototype first flying on 20 January 1959 equipped with four Tyne Mk.506 of 4,985 e.s.h.p. Production deliveries of the engine were made from mid-1959 onwards to power the 43 Vanguards delivered to British European Airways and Trans-Canada Airlines. The engine was further developed with greater power and used in the later twin-engined Dassault-Breguet Atlantique long-range reconnaissance aircraft; also in the Canadair CL-44 and Transall C-160 transport aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. Low-voltage {{switchgear}} and controlgear assemblies with a rated short-circuit withstand strength above 10 kA, are required, by law, {{to conform}} to the South African standard, SANS 1473 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Typetested, partially <b>type-tested</b> and specially tested assemblies with rated short-circuit withstand strength above lOkA). Standard SANS 1473 - 1 stipulates three categories of assemblies i. e. <b>type-tested,</b> partially <b>type-tested</b> and specially tested assemblies. The specially tested assembly is unique to the South African market, while the other two categories are stipulated in standard SANS IEC 60439 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : <b>Type-tested</b> and partially <b>type-tested</b> assemblies), which is internationally accepted in many countries as the applicable low-voltage assembly standard. Standard SANS 1473 - 1 specifies seven type-tests for certification as a <b>type-tested</b> assembly (TTA), but specifies, at most, three type-tests for certification as a specially tested assembly (STA). The underlying purpose of a technical standard is to provide for the safety of people and property, with the purpose of the research being twofold: 1. To investigate if the testing requirements specified for a specially tested assembly (STA), in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, are correctly applied, and do not pose any safety risks. 2. To investigate any safety risks that stem from the fact that four type-tests are excluded for verification as a specially tested assembly (STA), as opposed to the seven type tests required for verification as a <b>type-tested</b> assembly (TTA). The document highlights the technical inadequacies of an assembly that is certified as a STA, in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, and the potential safety risks associated with this type of assembly classification...|$|E
40|$|Repeatered {{fiber optic}} {{submarine}} cables require {{a very high}} reliability. The cables operate at a voltage of 10 kV DC to supply electrical power to the repeaters that are placed every 50 - 70 km along the cable to amplify the optical signal. To ensure that the cable's polyethylene insulation system can operate without faults for 25 years, electrical test methods that take relevant stresses, defects and service conditions into consideration are needed. The ROC- 2 cable is currently <b>type-tested</b> with 100 kV DC for 9 days {{under the assumption that}} an inverse power law relation holds for the insulation's electrical lifetime. Inverse power law relations are known experimentally to hold under AC voltage, but may not hold under DC. Oxidized particles, metal inclusions and protrusions on the conductor are unavoidable in polymeric cables. An infrared spectroscopic analysis of 15 pellets with contaminants found in 23 kg of cable insulation raw material with a pellet scanner indicated the presence of oxidized material. Electrical degradation often occurs around such insulation irregularities, and they are thus a limiting factor in the insulation lifetime. The long-term effect on the cable insulation of a DC field corresponding to an applied voltage of 100 kV DC over the cable was studied using Rogowski test objects with and without insulation irregularities in form of metal inclusions and oxidized particles. The test objects were tested to breakdown with ramped 50 Hz AC voltage after different lengths of DC pre-stress (0, 9, 35 and 163 days). Some objects were breakdown tested with a ramped 0. 1 Hz (VLF) before and after 35 days of DC pre-stress. In addition to this a few test objects were tested for partial discharge activity (PD) before and after 35 days of DC pre-stress. No significant deterioration of the insulation was observed after the DC pre-stress. The AC breakdown strength of test objects without particles and test objects with oxidized particles seemed to increase after 163 days of DC pre-stress, but this is probably a result of manufacturing variations and statistical errors due to the small amount of test objects. The average VLF breakdown strength was at least 2 - 3 times as high as the AC breakdown strength. PD inception in the insulation occurred at a lower field after 35 days of DC pre-stress, but the inception values are low enough to suspect surface discharges due to the conducting paint's poor adhesion to the insulation rather than internal discharges. The results indicate that a long-term high DC field does not accelerate any of the tested breakdown processes in the cable insulation. The current type test's ability to detect the types of irregularities that have been found in the raw material and those that have previously been found in manufactured cable lengths is therefore questionable...|$|E
40|$|Gröna Tåget (English: Green Train) is a {{research}} and development programme, the aim {{of which is to}} define a concept and develop technology for future high-speed trains for the Nordic European market. The target is a train for Scandinavian interoperability (Denmark, Norway and Sweden), although the pan-European minimum standards must be applied. Gröna Tåget is a concept for long-distance and fast regional rail services. It should be suitable for specific Nordic conditions with a harsh winter climate as well as mixed passenger and freight operations on non-perfect track. Gröna Tåget delivers a collection of ideas, proposals and technical solutions for rail operators, infrastructure managers and industry. The programme aims to define a fast, attractive, environmentally friendly and economically efficient high-speed train concept based on passenger valuations and technical possibilities. Proposals do not take corporate policies into account as these may vary between companies and over time. This is one of the final reports, specifying the functional requirements for the train concept from a technical, environmental and economic perspective, with an emphasis on the areas where research and development have been carried out within the Gröna Tåget programme. It is not a complete specification of a new train, but concentrates on issues that are particularly important for successful use in the Scandinavian market. It should be regarded as a complement to the pan-European standards. Research and development within the Gröna Tåget programme, including analysis and testing activities, are summarized. References are given to reports from the different projects in the programme but also to other relevant work. Other summary reports deal with market, economy and operational aspects as well as a design for an attractive, efficient and innovative train from a traveller’s point of view. The main alternative proposed in this concept specification is a train for speeds up to 250 km/h, equipped with carbody tilt for short travel time on existing main-line track. The train is proposed to have high-power permanent magnet motors, low aerodynamic drag and modest adhesion utilization. It has low noise emissions and a track-friendly bogie design. The train should be equipped with active highperformance suspension to produce superior ride qualities on non-perfect track and minimize suspension motions. Due to the approximately 3. 30 m interior width of the carbody, one more comfortable seat can be accommodated abreast, which will reduce cost and energy use per seat-km and also maximize the capacity of the train and of the railway system. One most important and critical issue is that the train must be able to run in a Nordic winter climate, where technologies have been tested, proposed and also compiled in a special report. Most technologies developed can also be used for modified train concepts, such as non-tilting trains, trains for higher speeds than 250 km/h, trains with continental width carbodies, and others. Further, many technologies developed in the programme are also useful for lower speeds. Newly developed technologies were <b>type-tested</b> in a special test train from 2006 to 2009. Endurance tests in commercial service were performed between 2009 and 2011. QC 20120124 Gröna Tåge...|$|E
