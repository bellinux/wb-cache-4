5|$|Microgale macpheei is an extinct shrew <b>tenrec</b> from southeastern Madagascar. It {{is known}} only from two partial skulls found in Andrahomana cave, which {{radiocarbon}} dating of associated rodent remains suggests are about 2000 years old. It {{is the only}} known recently extinct <b>tenrec.</b> First described in 2007, it is most similar to the smaller Microgale brevicaudata of northern and western Madagascar. M.macpheei has a broad rostrum (front part of the skull) and, like M.brevicaudata, lacks a diastema (gap) between the premolars. A number of details of tooth morphology are characteristic of M.macpheei.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis {{is one of}} {{only three}} extinct rodents known from Madagascar (the others are Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis and Nesomys narindaensis from northwestern Madagascar). In general, few small animals became extinct on Madagascar, except for these rodents, two species of Plesiorycteropus, and the shrew <b>tenrec</b> Microgale macpheei; in contrast, large animals such as subfossil lemurs, the {{carnivore}} Cryptoprocta spelea, Malagasy hippopotamuses, Dipsochelys tortoises, and Aepyornis and Mullerornis birds all became extinct around the time that humans arrived.|$|E
5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small <b>tenrec</b> (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught during the rainy season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{show that}} <b>tenrecs</b> and golden moles should be {{separated}} from Insectivora and placed in Afrotheria which include the elephant shrews and hyraxes. They share few morphological synapomorphies. Mitochondrial/nuclear gene sequences and rare genomic changes demonstrated that chrysochlorids and <b>tenrecs</b> form their own clade, Afrosoricida (African shrew-like mammals). It contains no soricids (shrews) and is sometimes confused with the shrew subgenus Afrosorex. Alternative names were [...] "Tenrecoidea" [...] and [...] "Tenrecomorpha‚Äù. Divergence between golden-moles and <b>tenrecs</b> occurred about 50 million years ago. They are now classified as Chrysochloridea instead of a specialized members of Order Insectivora.|$|R
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked <b>tenrec</b> (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} {{only from the}} cave of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} there, {{like that of the}} extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct <b>tenrec</b> species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating has been carried out on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E
500|$|Remains of shrew tenrecs (Microgale) {{were found}} during [...] expeditions {{to the cave}} of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar, led by David Burney in 2000 and 2003. The Microgale {{material}} {{was described as a}} new species, M.macpheei, in 2007 by Steven Goodman, Natalie Vasey, and Burney. The species was named after Ross MacPhee in honor of his contributions to knowledge of the genus Microgale and the paleontology of Madagascar. Goodman and colleagues considered [...] the living Microgale brevicaudata from northern and western Madagascar to be the closest relative of M.macpheei; some populations of this <b>tenrec</b> have since been separated into a different species, M.grandidieri. The common name [...] "MacPhee's shrew tenrec" [...] has been proposed for M.macpheei. The genus of M.macpheei, Microgale, includes more than 20species and is the largest of the <b>tenrec</b> family, which includes a variety of other Madagascan mammals.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the silky sifaka, Marojejy is home to 10 other species of lemur, several of which are also endangered due mainly to habitat loss. [...] The nocturnal aye-aye has only been seen once at the park, although one old nest and traces of its feeding have been found at various elevations.

500|$|The diet of the fossa in {{the wild}} has been studied by {{analyzing}} their distinctive scats, which resemble gray cylinders with twisted ends and measure [...] long by [...] thick. Scat collected and analyzed from both Andohahela and Andringitra contained lemur matter and rodents. Eastern populations in Andringitra incorporate the widest recorded variety of prey, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates consumed ranged from reptiles {{to a wide variety}} of birds, including both understory and ground birds, and mammals, including insectivores, rodents, and lemurs. Invertebrates eaten by the fossa in the high mountain zone of Andringitra include insects and crabs. One study found that vertebrates comprised 94% of the diet of fossas, with lemurs comprising over 50%, followed by tenrecs (9%), lizards (9%), and birds (2%). Seeds, which comprised 5% of the diet, may have been in the stomachs of the lemurs eaten, or may have been consumed with fruit taken for water, as seeds were more common in the stomach in the dry season. The average prey size varies geographically; it is only [...] in the high mountains of Andringitra, in contrast to [...] in humid forests and over [...] in dry deciduous forests. In a study of fossa diet in the dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar, more than 90% of prey items were vertebrates, and more than 50% were lemurs. The primary diet consisted of approximately six lemur species and two or three spiny <b>tenrec</b> species, along with snakes and small mammals. Generally, the fossa preys upon larger lemurs and rodents in preference to smaller ones.|$|E

40|$|Afrotheria, {{one of four}} {{mammalian}} superorders, comprises elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, aardvark, elephant shrews, <b>tenrecs</b> {{and golden}} moles. Their placentas either form an equatorial band or are discoid in shape. The interhemal region, separating fetal and maternal blood, is endotheliochorial in elephants, aardvark and possibly the sea cows, but hemochorial in the remaining orders. There is a secondary epitheliochorial placenta in elephant shrews while a similar structure in <b>tenrecs</b> erodes maternal tissues. Specialized hemophagous regions are a striking characteristic {{of some of these}} placentas yet absent in hyraxes, elephant shrews, and golden moles. It is possible that the common ancestor of the Afrotheria had an endotheliochorial placenta. Establishment of a hemochorial condition, as seen in rock hyraxes, elephant shrews, <b>tenrecs,</b> and golden moles, would be a more recent development. The elephant, manatee, and aardvark all have circumferential placentas. Thus the formation of a discoid placenta with a more or less extensive secondary placenta in elephant shrews and <b>tenrecs</b> would also be a derived state...|$|R
