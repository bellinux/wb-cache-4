40|$|A {{new concept}} in {{aircraft}} propulsion {{is described in}} this work. In particular, variable jet engine is investigated for supersonic ASTOVL aircraft. This engine is a Selective Bleed Variable Cycle, <b>twin</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>turbofan.</b> At low flight speeds the engine operates as a medium bypass turbofan. At supersonic cruise it operates as low bypass turbofan without reheat. The performance of the engine and its components is analyzed using a novel matching procedure. Off-design engine performance characteristics are explained, compressor running lines are shown, and variable geometry requirements are described. The performance analysis shows that fuel savings are significant, thus reducing aircraft take-off weight. The major advantage of this engine {{is that all the}} components are used continuously for all operating modes, thus incurring low weight penalties. The benefits predicted by this preliminary investigation indicate that further research on this engine should be carried out. The matching procedure developed and described shows itself to be very effective for two-shaft engines with a fixed geometry LP turbine. The method can also be extended to three shaft cases with or without a variable geometry LP turbine. Extensive development of compressor and turbine design and performance software has been undertaken...|$|E

5000|$|The {{heart of}} the {{concrete}} batching plant is the mixer, {{and there are many}} types of mixers such as Tilt Drum, Pan, Planetary, Single <b>Shaft</b> and <b>Twin</b> <b>shaft</b> mixer. The <b>twin</b> <b>shaft</b> mixer can ensure an even mixture of concrete through the use of high horsepower motors, while the tilt mixer offers a consistent mix with much less maintenance labor and cost.

A Pan or Planetary mixer is more common at a precast plant. Aggregate bins have 2 to 6 compartments for storage of various sand and aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.) sizes, while cement silos are typically one or two compartments, but at times up to 4 compartments in a single silo.

The proposed model is implemented on a nonlinear aircraft system with six degree of freedom, which is linearized into lateral and longitudinal ight dynamics mode of an aircraft system. To achieve the specific transient performances of the both longitudinal and lateral ight dynamics mode, a model predictive control strategy is designed. The proposed model predictive control scheme is implemented on the developed aircraft model with six degree of freedom. Simulation were pursuit using Matlab / Simulink. The result obtained envisages that the aircraft system using the proposed model predictive controller achieves the good transient performances.

A mathematical model of a two <b>shaft</b> <b>turbofan</b> engine is develop in Matlab / Simulink. The proposed Kalman Filter based diagnostic technique consist of a bank of Kalman Filters used to recognize and separate sensor aw. Each of the Kalman Filter is composed in view of a particular speculation for identifying a particular sensor issues. At the point when an issue happen, all channel aside from the one utilizing the right speculation will deliver huge estimation slip, from which a particular deficiency is secluded.
