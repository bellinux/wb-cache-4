5|$|The Injustice: Gods Among Us {{comic book}} series was {{announced}} by Ed Boon on October 5, 2012, during the EB Games Expo. The series {{serves as a}} prequel detailing the {{events leading up to}} the game, as well as those <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the interregnum between Superman's murder of the Joker and the discovery of the primary universe. The series was first written by Tom Taylor and illustrated by a number of artists, including Jheremy Raapack, Mike S. Miller, Bruno Redondo, Tom Derenick, and others. The comic was released digitally beginning on January 15, 2013. The series was later issued in regular comic book form, and eventually a collected edition. In December 2014, Tom Taylor announced that he would be leaving the series and left after writing Injustice: Year Three #14, with Brian Buccellato replacing him by continuing the story into Year Four and Five. The final chapter of the series was released in September 2016, leaving the story incomplete; another comic book series, titled Injustice: Ground Zero, followed afterwards, which picked up the story and concluded the retelling of the game's events from Harley Quinn's perspective.|$|E

May also result if we are witness to situations <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the course of our work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes, etc).

25|$|The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) sets {{official}} {{standards for}} all prescription and over-the-counter medicines, dietary supplements, and other healthcare products manufactured {{and sold in}} the United States, but USP standards are also recognized and used in more than 130 other countries. USP operates two programs to promote patient safety. The Medication Errors Reporting Program enables healthcare professionals to report medication errors directly to USP. MEDMARX, an internet-based error and drug reaction reporting program, is designed for use in hospitals. The USP analyzes the data it receives through its reporting programs, develops professional education programs and disseminates alerts related to medication errors. The MEDMARX report released in 2007 analyzed 11,000 medication errors during surgery in 500 hospitals between 1998 and 2005. The analysis showed that medication errors <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the operating room or recovery areas are {{three times more likely}} to harm a patient than errors occurring in other types of hospital care. , this was the largest known analysis of medical errors related to surgery.|$|E

The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third {{of which was a}} spoof news report on the events <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the film.

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Seeley's series Hack/Slash through Image Comics, {{publisher}} Eric Stephenson suggested Seeley write another monthly book. Seeley {{knew he wanted to}} work with Norton again, and the two discussed ideas over the following months, mostly during lunch breaks. Seeley was interested setting a story in a small town so he could write about the kind of crimes <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> a place where people prefer to live far away from each other. Norton was interested in telling a new kind of zombie story, since he felt The Walking Dead had perfected the zombie survival story. They combined the two ideas to create the premise for Revival. They pitched the series as Fargo meets The Walking Dead, using the terms [...] "Rural Noir" [...] and [...] "Farm Noir" [...] to describe the hardboiled detective story set in a small town.|$|E

HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall complimented the episode for staying true to the characters {{compared to the}} rest of the season, which he had criticized in an earlier review. He called the episode a [...] "significant step up" [...] albeit just [...] "decent" [...] in absolute terms. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt criticized the Andy–Kevin–Darryl subplot for its lack of continuity or any sort of punchlines. He was also critical of the Pam–Dwight plot for not staying true to the characters, and suggested that the writers needed to write the show as less of [...] "a bland copy of itself". He called it one of the laziest half-hours of the show and gave it a C−. Cindy White of IGN said that the episode needed a stronger A-plot writing that the plots [...] "felt like a meal made up of two tasty side dishes". She gave it a 7 out of 10. Hanna Lawrence of Hollywood.com praised the episode for being believable and for showing things <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> real life. She also praised the Jim–Pam plot for showcasing the couple as not completely [...] "perfect". She called the band subplot [...] "weak".|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E

2500|$|Aristotle saw {{chance and}} {{necessity}} as opposite forces.

[...] Aristotle classified events into three types: certain events that happen necessarily; probable events <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> most cases; and unknowable events that happen by pure chance. He considered the outcome of games of chance as unknowable.|$|E

The album is a concept album about an imaginary town that is built on top of a catfish. All of the songs are stories <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the town. The idea of having a miniature town was one of Yonezu's first when planning the album, and he created characters and stories for the people who lived in the town.

2500|$|Intertemporal {{choice is}} {{commonly}} {{measured in the}} laboratory using a [...] "delayed discounting" [...] paradigm, which measures the process of devaluing rewards and punishments <b>that</b> <b>happen</b> <b>in</b> the future. In this paradigm, subjects must choose between a smaller reward delivered soon and a larger reward delivered at a delay in the future. [...] Choosing the smaller-sooner reward is considered impulsive. By repeatedly making these choices, indifference points can be estimated. For example, if someone chose $70 now over $100 in a week, but chose the $100 in a week over $60 now, it can be inferred that they are indifferent between $100 in a week and an intermediate value between $60 and $70. [...] A delay discounting curve can be obtained for each participant by plotting their indifference points with different reward amounts and time delays. [...] Individual differences in discounting curves are affected by personality characteristics such as self-reports of impulsivity and locus of control; personal characteristics such as age, gender, IQ, race, and culture; socioeconomic characteristics such as income and education; and many other variables. Lesions of the nucleus accumbens core subregion or basolateral amygdala produce shifts towards choosing the smaller-sooner reward, suggesting the involvement of these brain regions in the preference for delayed reinforcers. [...] There is also evidence that the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in delay discounting, although there is currently debate on whether lesions in this region result in more or less impulsivity.|$|E
