25|$|In 1980, an {{even worse}} {{catastrophe}} occurred. The UNP Government provoked a strike in the Railway Department. The strike became a general strike.

25|$|For {{a number}} of years the Socialists and Communists fought for control of {{organized}} labor. In 1940 groups under both Socialist and Communist influence established the “Organización Sindical”, which 5 years later, on 14 August 1945, sponsored a congress that established the country's first central labor group, the <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Federation</b> of Workers of Panama (Federación Sindical de Trabajadores de Panamá, FSTP). It remained united until 1948, when the rival General Union of Workers (Unión General de Trabajadores) was created under Socialist leadership, after losing control of the FSTP to the Communists.|$|E
25|$|The United Public Workers of America (1946–1952) was an American {{labor union}} {{representing}} federal, state, county, {{and local government}} employees. The union challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} Hatch Act of 1939, which prohibited federal executive branch employees from engaging in politics. In United Public Workers of America v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Hatch Act, finding that its infringement on the Constitutional rights was outweighed by the need to end political corruption. The union's leadership was Communist, and in a famous purge the union was ejected from its parent <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation,</b> the Congress of Industrial Organizations, in 1950.|$|E

25|$|During this interval, Van Patten {{fulfilled}} a dual Secretarial role, {{not just}} heading the SLP but also serving as Secretary {{of the governing}} General Executive Board of the Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor, an early <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation</b> largely composed of ethnic Irish and English members. In this organization Van Patten was a voice which advocated closer relations between the Knights and the existing radical, ethnic German-dominated local unions of the Chicago Central Labor Union (CLU), from which anti-Socialist unionists and the Knights had seceded in 1880. Close relations and joint parades, picnics, and demonstrations of the CLU and the Knights after 1881 were largely a product of Van Patten's efforts in this regard.|$|E
25|$|Fraina {{and his two}} Comintern {{associates}} {{soon discovered}} that the Communist Party of Mexico existed in name only, with only party secretary José Allen and a small group organized as the Young Communist Federation remaining committed {{to the idea of}} building a revolutionary Marxist political party in the country. The Comintern representatives established an office as the Latin American headquarters of the Profintern and founded two newspapers, El Trabajador (The Worker) and Boletín Comunista (Communist Bulletin). A convention was held in February 1921 which established a new radical national <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation,</b> the Confederación General de Trabajadores (CGT). Comintern funds were also used to establish a publishing house, Biblioteca Internacional, which issued pamphlets and books by prominent European radicals.|$|E
25|$|From 1922 onwards {{membership}} fell considerably, despite militancy in {{the working}} class remaining constant. The phenomenon is likely the result of political bickering within the organization. Accordingly, the Communist Party withdrew all unions associated with it from the CGT in 1924 and established its own <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation</b> in 1925. The CGT became increasingly concentrated in the industrial centers Lisbon/Setúbal/Barreiro, Porto/Braga, and Covilhã. At the same time, actions by the union lost in efficiency, its structure became increasingly hierarchical, and repression {{by the state and}} business became more commonplace. Likewise, the circulation of A Batalha sank from 25,000 in 1919/1920 to 10,000 in 1925. In 1922, it was decided that non-union organizations could join the CGT as well.|$|E

25|$|From March 1946 to June 1947, 64% {{of these}} rations were {{provided}} by the UNRRA. Heating depended on supplies of German coal shipped by the U.S. on lax credit terms. Drought of 1946 further depressed farm output and hydroelectric power generation. Figl's government, the Chambers of Labor, Trade and Agriculture, and the Austrian <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Federation</b> (ÖGB) temporarily resolved the crisis in favor of tight regulation of food and labor markets. Wage increases were limited and locked to commodity prices through annual price-wage agreements. The negotiations set a model of building consensus between elected and non-elected political elites that became the basis of post-war Austrian democracy, known as Austrian Social Partnership and Austro-corporatism.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 he {{was elected}} {{a member of the}} Knesset. In 1994, after failing in a {{previous}} bid for Histadrut leadership, Peretz joined forces with Haim Ramon to contest control of the then powerful <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation.</b> They ran on an independent list against the favoured candidate of then Labor leader Yitzhak Rabin. They won, and Peretz became Ramon's deputy at the Histadrut, isolating him within the Labor Party. He became chairman of the Histadrut in December 1995, when Ramon reentered the cabinet following Rabin's assassination. During his early years {{at the helm of the}} Histadrut, Peretz was regarded as a militant firebrand, with an easy hand on the trigger of general strikes. Sometimes the pretext for declaring a general strike would be an inopportune statement by the finance minister, as had been the case with Ya'akov Ne'eman in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Al-Bashir has {{achieved}} {{economic growth in}} Sudan. This was pushed further by the drilling and extraction of oil. However, economic growth has not been shared by all. Headline inflation in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11 percentage points up from the budget projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued removal of subsidies, as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations; also it aroused the discontent of the Sudanese Worker's <b>Trade</b> <b>Union</b> <b>Federation</b> (SWTUF), which threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration {{in the value of}} the Sudanese pound (SDG) poses grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).|$|E

25|$|The Coordinadora Democrática, {{led by the}} {{business}} federation Fedecámaras and the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation</b> Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV), called for a fourth paro cívico, {{which turned out to}} be the most serious, and is known as the 2002–2003 oil lockout/strike, to begin on 2 December 2002. The opposition also called a recall-referendum-petition-signature-gathering day for 4 December. Initially the strike had a mixed response, with affluent eastern Caracas seeing most shops closed, while downtown and western Caracas was busy; many business owners either supported Chávez or put their business above politics. Early attempts to block a crucial navigation channel in Lake Maracaibo, in order to paralyse the oil industry, were foiled by the navy. The National Electoral Council voted to hold a non-binding recall referendum on 2 February, but the Coordinadora Democrática chose to ignore it. On 4 December the captain of a large oil tanker named for the beauty queen Pilín León anchored in the Lake Maracaibo shipping channel and refused to move. The rest of PDVSA 13-ship fleet was quickly similarly grounded. Combined with the PDVSA management walkout, this effectively paralysed the Venezuelan oil industry.|$|E
500|$|According to Angela Vogel and Hartmut Rübner, Carl Hillmann, a typesetter and {{prominent}} trade unionist in the 1870s, was the [...] "intellectual father" [...] of the localist and anarcho-syndicalist movement. Vogel's and Rübner's claim {{is based on}} the fact that Hillmann was the first in Germany to consider unions' primary role to be the creation of the conditions for a socialist revolution, not simply to improve workers' living conditions. He also advocated a de-centralized <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation</b> structure. Many of the later anarcho-syndicalists including Rudolf Rocker agree with this notion. Hans Manfred Bock, on the other hand, sees no evidence for Hillmann's influence on the FVdG.|$|E
500|$|The Free Association of German Trade Unions ( [...] ; {{abbreviated}} FVdG; sometimes also {{translated as}} Free Association of German Unions or Free Alliance of German Trade Unions) was a <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>federation</b> in Imperial and early Weimar Germany. It {{was founded in}} 1897 in Halle under the name Representatives' Centralization of Germany as the national umbrella organization of the localist current of the German labor movement. The localists rejected the centralization in the labor movement following the sunset of the Anti-Socialist Laws in 1890 and preferred grassroots democratic structures. The lack of a strike code soon led to conflict within the organization. Various ways of providing financial support for strikes were tested before a system of voluntary solidarity was agreed upon in 1903, {{the same year that}} the name Free Association of German Trade Unions was adopted.|$|E
