50|$|DI Christer Schalin was {{appointed}} the Production Manager of the <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> production line in 1979. He had previously worked as the Export Manager of SAT and started now {{to work hard}} to develop the <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> business. Schalin expanded the export market and he also created the Sisu Terminal Systems name and logo.|$|E

5000|$|Distinctions {{between a}} <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> {{and a regular}} road truck are several and noticeable: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> were {{separated}} from the other vehicle production under its own organisation in 1989. In 1991 Sisu Terminal Systems division was founded for the RoRo equipment manufacturing.|$|R
5000|$|Ottawa Trucks, now {{formally}} {{referred to}} as Kalmar Ottawa, is a United States company {{which is the largest}} manufacturer of <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> in North America, with over 55,000 produced.|$|R
50|$|A new {{acquisition}} {{followed in}} 1997 when Partek took over Sisu Corporation. At {{the same time}} Partek bought the Swedish container handling equipment producer Kalmar Industries, into which STS was joined. Use of Sisu brand on <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> was discontinued thereafter, and the name kept on living as a lorry producer.|$|R
50|$|In {{operation}} the translifter is {{coupled with}} a universal <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> with lifting 5th wheel (Fifth wheel coupling). Terminal tractors' 5th wheel connects to the translifter's Kingpin. The translifter is lowered down and driven under the cassette and then raised again with the cassette for transportation. Translifters usually have automatically steered tires which helps handling {{the combination of the}} translifter and <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Logistic RC model {{include the}} following, Tractor unit, Semi-trailer truck, Semi-trailer, <b>Terminal</b> <b>tractor,</b> Refrigerator truck, Forklift truck, Empty Container handlers, and Reach stacker. Most {{of them are}} in 1:14 and run on {{electric}} motors.|$|E
50|$|The <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> {{production}} totalled about 2 600 units by {{the production}} transfer. The vehicles {{produced in the}} Karis factory are included into the figures. In addition, hundreds of gooseneck trailers and other container carriages were produced.|$|E
50|$|Kalmar {{products}} and services are used in ports, terminals, distribution centers and in the heavy industry. Kalmar products include forklifts, <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors,</b> quay cranes, yard cranes, ASCs, shuttle and straddle carriers, reachstackers and equipment for empty container handling. Lately, Kalmar has invested in terminal automation and in energy-efficient container handling.|$|R
50|$|SAT {{got another}} {{significant}} facility in Hämeenlinna in 1968 {{when the company}} was merged with Vanajan Autotehdas. Production of Vanaja lorries was run down and all civil lorry production was concentrated in Karis. Instead, production of bus and mobile crane chassis, <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> and military lorries were transferred to Hämeenlinna.|$|R
50|$|The port {{also uses}} {{straddle}} carriers (also known as shuttle carriers), which move containers between the automated container stacking {{area and the}} quay cranes. <b>Terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> and trans lifter trailers - which move cassettes, onto which containers are loaded - are used on the port's land side to move containers between the automated stacking area and the port's rail terminal and inspection facilities.|$|R
50|$|Sisu Terminal Systems Oy (STS) was a Finnish <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> producer. The {{production}} {{began in}} 1969 {{as a part}} of Suomen Autoteollisuus (SAT) and after STS was sold and restructured in 1997 the Sisu brand was replaced by Kalmar.|$|E

50|$|Cargotec's Kalmar {{business}} area {{started to take}} shape in 1997 when Partek Corporation acquired the Finnish state-owned Sisu Ltd including its <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> business. During the same year, Partek acquired a major shareholding in Kalmar Industries Ltd, a container handling equipment producer.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{fell into}} {{financial}} difficulties by {{end of the}} 1960s; {{this led to a}} merger with the other Finnish heavy vehicle producer Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab at the end of 1968. The Vanaja brand ceased to exist in 1971, after which the former Vanaja factory produced Sisu <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors,</b> bus chassis, military vehicles and mobile crane chassis. The factory now belongs to Patriawhich produces Patria AMV armoured personnel carriersand heavy-vehicle axle producer Sisu Axles.|$|R
50|$|CCC {{began as}} a firm that {{remanufactured}} World War II-era surplus vehicles for civilian crane-carrying use. In 1953 CCC presented their first own truck, and soon evolved into a company that manufactured over-the-road trucks for concrete mixing, logging, mining, and other construction industries, including a wheeled loader. CCC also builds trucks for oil drilling, water well drilling, <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors,</b> and aviation fuelers. As with most American specialty truck manufacturers, the customer's choice of proprietary engines and transmissions have been available.|$|R
50|$|Nessling became head of SAT in 1932, {{soon after}} the company's foundation. He {{developed}} the business {{in an era when}} only few believed in the possibility of a Finnish automotive industry, and a decade later had become the company's majority shareholder. Nessling took a patriarchal approach to his leadership of the company, which he built into a producer of trucks, bus chassis, rail vehicles and specialist <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors.</b> Nessling lost his controlling shareholding following a merger in 1968, resigned in 1970 and died the following year.|$|R
50|$|In autumn 1980, Sisu TR-200, {{which was}} the world's strongest <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> by then, was {{presented}} in Portex fair in Hamburg. The Sisu terminal tractors could be designed relatively easily according to the customer requirements due to highly modulised structure; this led to success in export markets in particular.|$|E
50|$|A <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor,</b> {{known in}} the United States as a spotter truck, {{spotting}} tractor, yard truck, yard dog, yard goat, yard jockey or mule, is a semi-tractor intended to move semi trailers within a cargo yard, warehouse facility, or intermodal facility, much like a switcher locomotive is used to position railcars.|$|E
50|$|When Sisu Corporation {{was created}} as a {{consequence}} of merger between the owning Sisu-Auto and Valmet wheeled machines, STS became a limited liability company (Oy). As a part of the following restructuring the production was transferred gradually to former Valmet facilities in Tampere. The last <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> produced in Hämeenlinna rolled out from the factory in January 1996.|$|E
5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was {{three to four years}} before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{nickname}} [...] "Yard Goats" [...] {{was selected}} {{as part of a}} [...] "Name the Team" [...] contest which drew over 6,000 submissions. [...] "Yard goats" [...] is rail-yard slang for the switch engines or <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> that shuttle train cars between different locomotives, but the logo features a goat chomping on a baseball bat and the team makes heavy use of animal imagery and symbolism. The colors, meanwhile, are a nod to the Hartford Whalers team that played in the National Hockey League from 1979 to 1997, when the franchise moved to Raleigh, North Carolina and became the Carolina Hurricanes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} a dock assignment problem based on the situation encountered in a practical case. Trailers are assigned to gates during a specific period in time for loading or unloading activities. The parking lot is used as a buffer zone. Transportation between the parking lot and the gates is performed by additional resources called <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors.</b> The problem is modeled as a three-stage flexible flow shop, where the first and the third stage share the same identical parallel machines and besides that, all stages share a different set of identical parallel machines. Different mathematical formulations are given and a Lagrangian relaxation approach is examined to solve this flexible flow-shop problem...|$|R
50|$|The company's main {{markets are}} in heavy truck, <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> and {{military}} vehicle axles; the driven axles are exclusively with planetary reduction. Sisu Axles was started when Suomen Autoteollisuus, later Sisu Auto, started own axle production in Helsinki in 1940s. The production was later transferred to Hämeenlinna {{and sold to}} investors. The current owner is American Marmon Group.|$|E
50|$|Sisu-Auto {{founded a}} new <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor</b> factory in White Oak, Texas in 1987. The main {{responsibility}} {{of the project was}} on Heikki Luostarinen who later became the company General Manager. The vehicles were branded first Sisu, later Sisu-Magnum and at the end just Magnum. The factory was closed in 2005 and production of Magnum terminal tractors was continued in other facilities.|$|E
50|$|Once again {{independent}} {{after nearly}} 50 years, the Autocar company now employs 300 at its manufacturing facility in Hagerstown, Indiana {{where the company}} produces custom-engineered Class 8 trucks for severe-duty vocational applications. The company’s severe-duty ACX model offers features ranging from improved ergonomic cabs, integrated controls, and a hybrid drive truck, the Autocar E3. The Autocar ACX is now #2 nationally in several segments, including concrete pump trucks and refuse trucks. The Autocar ACTT is a leading model of <b>terminal</b> <b>tractor.</b> The company has a nationwide service network in the US. Autocar’s customer base includes large fleets, private fleets and major municipalities in the United States and Canada such as Miami, Newark, Houston, Chicago and Vancouver.|$|E
50|$|Various other engine {{models were}} used in small numbers. Due to {{delivery}} problems of Leyland in the 1950s, Perkins diesels were offered as an option for K-28 for a short time. During 1960s Kärppä-Sisu K-35 was available with BMC diesel. SAT had Ford Dagenham diesels in engine selection in 1958-1972 and they were available for Nalle-Sisu KB-24, KB-124 and KB-121 models. AEC engines {{were used in}} 1970 to power some rail vehicles and buses. The Sisu <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors</b> as well as mobile crane chassis used typically customer-designated engines; common options were Cummins, Deutz, Fiat/Iveco, Leyland, Perkins, Scania and Volvo. DAF delivered horizontally mounted six-cylinder engines for Sisu bus chassis {{in the middle of}} the 1980s, shortly before the production of bus chassis ceased.|$|R
50|$|The {{company name}} was changed Oy Sisu-Auto Ab in 1981. In the {{domestic}} market Sisu was the leading make among the heaviest vehicles, such as earthmoving, road maintenance and logging trucks. Share of exports reached 23% at its best. The major export articles were <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors,</b> in which Sisu-Auto became the leader in European market, and military vehicles, XA-180 in particular. Terrain capability {{was one of the}} core competences of the company. The assembly plants were located in Helsinki, Karis and Hämeenlinna. The company opened a new facility in Mäntyharju for plastic component production in 1977. The decision was influenced by political control; Finland was suffering of high unemployment rate and the government pressed the company board, which was appointed on political grounds, to move production to an area where the unemployment rate was high.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} a dock assignment problem, where trailers need to be assigned to gates for a given period of time for loading or unloading activities. The parking lot is used as a buffer zone. Transportation between the parking lot and the gates is performed by additional resources called <b>terminal</b> <b>tractors.</b> The problem is modeled as a three-stage flexible flow shop, where the first and the third stage share the same identical parallel machines and the second stage consists of a different set of identical parallel machines. We examine multiple integer-programming formulations for the parallel-machine model in stage two and for the three-stage flow shop and we provide extensive computational results. Our goal is to explore the limits of the instance sizes that can be solved to guaranteed optimality within acceptable running times using integer programming. status: publishe...|$|R
