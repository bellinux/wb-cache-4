2500|$|In spring 711, Song and Yao {{suggested}} to Emperor Ruizong {{that the way}} to stop the rumors about Li Longji's being replaced would be to send Princess Taiping and her husband Wu Youji to live in Luoyang, while sending Li Chengqi and Li Shouli out of the capital Chang'an to be prefectural prefects. [...] Emperor Ruizong initially agreed (with the exception that he believed that Luoyang was too far, and therefore was ready to send Princess Taiping to Wu Youji <b>to</b> <b>Pu</b> Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) instead), but after Princess Taiping found out and objected vehemently, Li Longji, fearful of consequences, disavowed and denounced Song and Yao. [...] Emperor Ruizong removed both from their chancellor positions and demoted them to be prefectural prefects—in Song's case, to be the prefect of Chu Prefecture (楚州, roughly modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). [...] He later served successively as the prefect of Yan Prefecture (兗州, roughly modern Jining, Shandong), Ji Prefecture (冀州, roughly modern Hengshui, Hebei), and Wei Prefecture (魏州, in modern Handan); the examiner of Hebei Circuit (河北, roughly modern Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin); the commandant at You Prefecture (幽州, roughly modern Beijing); and principal of the imperial university (國子祭酒, Guozi Jijiu), being in charge of Luoyang. [...] He was then recalled to Chang'an to serve as the secretary general of the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (雍州, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi).|$|E

[...] Pu Sheng was born blind in one eye (though some {{accounts}} said that he lost his eye to an eagle while trying to get eagle eggs). [...] Once, his grandfather Pu Hong teased him, [...] "I heard that you, my blind boy, only shed tears from one eye; is that true?" [...] Pu Sheng, in anger, stabbed his blind eye and exclaimed, [...] "This is the other eye shedding tear!" [...] Pu Hong, shocked at his reaction, whipped him and told him, [...] "You are only deserving to be a slave!" [...] He responded, [...] "That is fine; I'll just be like Shi Le(a slave who became an emperor)." [...] Pu Hong became concerned at his behavior, which was also manifested by lack of discipline, and told Pu Jiàn that he should consider killing his son, lest that his family be destroyed by him. [...] Pu Jiàn considered it, but was dissuaded from it by his brother Pu Xiong (蒲雄). [...] As Pu Sheng grew, he became known for his strength and ferocity in battle, as he {{was strong enough to}} battle wild beasts, and was skillful in horsemanship and use of weapons. [...] After his father (who had by then changed the family name from Pu to Fu) established Former Qin in 351, he was created the Prince of Huainan.|$|E

2500|$|In {{light of}} Emperor Dezong's refusal {{to let him}} succeed Li Zhengji, later in 781, Li Na {{attacked}} the imperially-controlled Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Shangqiu, Henan). [...] While he was doing so, however, Li Wei (李洧), a cousin of Li Zhengji's, whom Li Zhengji had made the prefect of Xu Prefecture (徐州, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), offered {{to submit to the}} imperial government, along with the prefects of Hai (海州, in modern Lianyungang, Jiangsu) and Yi (沂州, in modern Linyi, Shandong) Prefectures. [...] In anger, Li Na attacked Xu Prefecture, joined by an army from Weibo, but was defeated by joint forces commanded by Liu Qia (劉洽); the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit; Qu Huan (曲環), a commander of the directly-imperially-controlled Shence Army (神策軍); Li Cheng (李澄), an officer of Yongping Circuit (永平, headquartered in modern Kaifeng); and Tang Chaochen (唐朝臣), an officer of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, then headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). [...] Li Na was forced to withdraw from his siege against Xu Prefecture, and in the aftermaths, he briefly lost Hai Prefecture and Mi Prefecture as well, but quickly recovered them. [...] Li Na himself withdrew <b>to</b> <b>Pu</b> Prefecture (濮州, in modern Heze, Shandong), and Liu followed him there and put Pu Prefecture under siege. [...] As, by that point, Tian Yue was also under siege at his headquarters at Wei Prefecture, Liang Chongyi had committed suicide after having been defeated by Li Xilie the military governor of Huaixi Prefecture (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), and Li Weiyue, under pressure from imperial forces, had been killed by his own officer Wang Wujun, who then submitted to imperial authority, it was believed that imperial authority would soon prevail over all of the rebels.|$|E

30|$|Cognitive {{radio is}} a {{promising}} wireless technology {{to resolve the}} growing scarcity of the indispensable electromagnetic spectrum resources. In cognitive radio, secondary users (SUs) detect spectrum holes in their radio environment for data transmission, while primary users (PUs) use their own licensed spectrum band [1]. CR techniques for spectrum access (SA) are generally classified as underlay SA, overlay SA, and interweave SA [2]. Among it, the underlay SA has higher flexibility since it focuses on specific power control for satisfying a required interference <b>to</b> the <b>PUs.</b> Hence, the other {{can be understood as}} the special cases of the underlay SA. Basically, the underlay SA allows simultaneous transmission of SUs and PUs by sharing the spectrum as long as the interference <b>to</b> <b>PUs</b> during the secondary transmission is under a predefined threshold level called interference temperature [3]. Thus, to reduce the interference <b>to</b> <b>PUs</b> in a manner of the underlay SA is a critical issue.|$|R
