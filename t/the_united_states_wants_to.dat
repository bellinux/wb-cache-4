The last thing <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> see is a resumption of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see. By refusing to ratify this treaty, the United States Senate has done a lot to undermine the arms control agenda that the international community, including Australia, has been working on.|$|E

5000|$|Jacobson {{states that}} if <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> reduce global warming, air {{pollution}} and energy instability, it should invest only in the best energy options, and that nuclear power {{is not one of}} them. Jacobson's analyses state that [...] "nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy, when reactor construction, uranium refining and transport are considered". These calculations are based on a 2009 paper of Jacobson's that was published in Energy and Environmental Science, which report nuclear emissions to be in the range of 68-180.1 g/kWh.|$|E
5000|$|The {{island has}} no {{permanent}} population, and conditions {{are said to}} be harsh and unpleasant. The island {{is in a state of}} terra nullius, since neither Canada nor <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> claim the land and each country says it belongs to the other. (See Bir Tawil for a similar real-life example of this.) Bullwinkle J. Moose serves as Moosylvania's presumed namesake and its governor but only stays two weeks at a time, since (according to Bullwinkle) [...] "after two weeks here, anyplace else feels like Heaven." ...|$|E
5000|$|John Dickerson and Dahlia Lithwick of Slate {{suggested}} that the Iraqis {{should be able to}} put the Marines on trial:"Let's let the Iraqis put the Americans alleged to have committed these crimes on trial. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> encourage the fledgling Iraqi institution of democracy, right? That's why we wanted Saddam tried in Iraq, and through the Iraqi judicial system--both to build up its legitimacy and to give Iraqis the sense of ownership that comes with having control over the legal process. Why, then, shouldn't we also turn over our own soldiers who were involved in either the Haditha massacre {{or any of the other}} possible massacres for trial under the Iraqi justice system?" ...|$|E

5000|$|US {{officials}} have denied the general perception in Pakistan that the US {{government wants to}} influence the electoral process in Pakistan {{to bring in a}} friendly government. US Secretary of State John Kerry skipped a planned visit to Pakistan to avoid accusations of meddling in the 11 May elections. Spokesperson Victoria Nuland stated that the message <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> send out during the election season is [...] "we have no favourites among Pakistani politicians and we are looking forward to work with whoever is elected on May 11." [...] Secretary Kerry's decision to skip Pakistan during his South Asia visit is an indication of Washington's eagerness to maintain neutrality during the elections.|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi refused {{foreign aid}} for the emergency, saying that Italians were [...] "proud people" [...] and had {{sufficient}} resources {{to deal with the}} crisis. However he singled out the United States, announcing that he would accept aid for reconstruction: [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> give a tangible sign of its solidarity with Italy, it could take on the responsibility of rebuilding heritage sites and churches. We would be very happy to have this support." [...] and suggested the USA help rebuild [...] "a small district of a town or a suburb". Aid was offered by Austria, Brazil, Croatia, the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, Greece, Slovakia, Israel, Portugal, Iran, Macedonia, Mexico,Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tunisia, the Turkish Red Crescent, Ukraine, and the United States.Aid was also offered by various organisations, companies, sport clubs and celebrities including ACF Fiorentina, Carla Bruni, Madonna, S.S.C. Napoli, Zastava and Fiat.|$|E
40|$|This Note {{addresses}} {{the problems in}} copyright law created by orphan works. The Author identifies three issues. First, it stifles creativity by limiting the public’s access to the piece. Second, it defeats the economic incentive to create copyrightable works because no one can receive the potential royalty if the copyright owner cannot be found. Third, it undermines copyright law by forcing some orphan works users to violate infringement laws, despite efforts to comply. Recent attempts at legislation have been unsuccessful. According to the Author, the sole remedy is to create uniformly-applied legislation that fairly balances the interests of copyright holders, {{those who want to}} use copyrighted materials, and the public’s access to and the availability of as many creative works as possible. Part I of this Note is an overview of the copyright system. Part II illustrates factors that contribute to a copyrighted work becoming orphaned. Part III discusses the Copyright Office’s Report on Orphan Works from 2006 and Congress’s proposed acts in 2008. Part IV examines why the proposed acts in 2008 ultimately did not pass in Congress. Part V discusses alternatives to legislative action. Part VI details what it means to conduct a reasonably diligent search. Part VII is an application of the proposed definition of the term, “reasonably diligent search. ” The Author notes that if <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> become a world leader in copyright law, Congress should enact legislation regarding the orphan works problem—a global, not just domestic, problem. The benefits of a legislative solution are better than the benefits of other potential solutions and, more importantly, are not unrealistic, but are completely plausible...|$|E
50|$|The 2008 contest {{was held}} on October 4, 2008. Crews {{included}} Massive Monkees from <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>Wanted</b> from France, and T.I.P. Crew from South Korea. The winner of the general B-boy battle was selected to represent Japan.|$|R
50|$|The {{treaty was}} instigated by Alexander Ramsey, the first {{governor}} of Minnesota Territory, and Luke Lea, Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> treaty {{to gain control}} of agricultural lands for more European-American settlers.|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{security}} concerns, Saddam rarely left Iraq, so Aziz would often represent Iraq at high-level diplomatic summits.

50|$|With no rival bid having emerged since April 2017 the CONCACAF member federations of Canada, Mexico and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> sent a joint {{request to}} FIFA to hasten the bid process.

50|$|Faced {{with such}} broad and vociferous criticism, ISDS was {{abandoned}} in September 2015; in its place, the European Commission proposed an Investment Court System (ICS). Not long afterwards, ICS was declared illegal by the German Association of Magistrates, though the commission dismissed the magistrates' judgement as {{based on a}} misunderstanding. For its part, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> ISDS reinstated.|$|R
50|$|The ongoing Chinese Civil War {{and thus}} the {{question}} of which Chinese government was legitimate presented a dilemma to conference organizers. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to invite <b>the</b> Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan to represent China, while <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom wished to invite the People's Republic of China (PRC) on mainland China as China's representative. As a compromise, neither government was invited.|$|R
25|$|Before the Doha ministerial, {{negotiations}} {{had already}} been under way on trade in agriculture and trade in services. These ongoing negotiations had been required under the last round of multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round, 1986–1994). However, some countries, including <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>wanted</b> to expand <b>the</b> agriculture and services talks to allow trade-offs and thus achieve greater trade liberalization.|$|R
50|$|After Randy is imprisoned falsely, Steve {{attempts}} to reconcile with his daughter, unsuccessfully, and informs her {{he has to}} leave. Apparently, elements in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>want</b> Castillo dead and have hired local thugs to kill him. Castillo survives a fight with the hired hands in the last episode and heads south for Honduras with no explanation to the Diegos.|$|R
50|$|The New York City parade is {{held every}} third Saturday in September (on the 17th in 2016, on the 16th in 2017, {{and on the}} 15th in 2018). It was founded in 1957 by {{immigrants}} from Germany who, {{being part of the}} largest self-reported immigrant ancestral group in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>wanted</b> to keep <b>the</b> traditions of their German homeland alive.|$|R
50|$|Franklin Roosevelt {{promptly}} informed Winston Churchill that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to approach}} directly the Portuguese {{government for the}} purpose of also obtaining aviation facilities in the Azores. The negotiations for the agreement between <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Portugal, conducted initially by George Kennan Chargé d’Affairs in Portugal, were long and complex. The final agreement was signed in November 28, 1944 between US ambassador Raymond Henry Norweb and Salazar.|$|R
50|$|When peace {{negotiations}} began after the Battle of Yorktown, a primary issue of debate was {{the fate of}} Black British soldiers. Loyalists who remained in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> Black soldiers returned so their chances of receiving reparations for damaged property would be increased, but British military leaders fully intended to keep the promise of freedom made to Black soldiers despite the anger of the Americans.|$|R
5000|$|Fisher {{was known}} for a unique idea towards nuclear deterrence. In a March 1981 paper, while {{discussing}} the importance on reaching a [...] "wise decision", {{especially in terms of}} nuclear arms, he suggested implanting the nuclear launch codes in a volunteer. If the President of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to activate nuclear weapons, he would be required to kill the volunteer to retrieve the codes.|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} {{changed dramatically}} after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and <b>the</b> subsequent <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{declaration of war}} upon Japan. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> every Latin American country to join the Allies, in order to generate a continent-wide resistance. Argentine resistance to do so motivated an embargo and blockade against Argentina. Castillo did, however, declare {{a state of emergency}} in Argentina after the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|R
25|$|Later on, Novo Ecijanos would {{continue}} {{to participate in the}} drama of war, revolution and the fight for freedom. They would fight when the revolt against Spain continued after the peace treaty broke down and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> after declaring war on Spain, promised to help Filipinos fight for freedom. Then, Novo Ecijanos again joined General Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippine–American War (after it became evident <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to make <b>the</b> Philippines their own colony).|$|R
2500|$|On 11 April 2014 the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) {{announced}} that it had added Chornomornaftagaz to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List {{as part of the}} third round of U.S. sanctions. Reuters quoted an anonymous U.S. official who explained that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to make it impossible for Gazprom to [...] "have dealings with Chornomorneftegaz", and if that were to happen, Gazprom itself could face sanctions.|$|R
50|$|The ACS {{planted the}} colony of Liberia {{on the coast}} in West Africa in 1819. Cary was among {{numerous}} free blacks who became interested in this movement. Most free blacks, however, as native to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>wanted</b> no part of expatriation. They believed that, like European Americans, their roots were in the US. They wanted to enjoy the rights of citizens and free {{people in the country}} where they had many ties.|$|R

25|$|This national-patriotic {{movement}} {{charges that}} for centuries the West has plundered Russia of her natural resources, {{trying to bring}} Russia {{to her knees and}} undermining Russia's messianic and self-sacrificing mission to enlighten and save mankind, {{with the collapse of the}} Soviet Union as evidence.

50|$|In addition, the Bush {{administration}} in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> Canada to openly join the National Missile Defense program (currently Canada participates {{in some parts}} of the shield). The Conservatives were open to negotiating the issue with the USA, while the Bloc, the NDP, the Green Party and some Liberals strongly opposed it. Prime Minister Martin announced in February 2005, that Canada would not join the missile shield; this has upset some Liberals who supported missile defense.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, with {{increased}} European-American settlement, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to relocate all Native Americans from Michigan and Wisconsin to {{west of the}} Mississippi River, proposing to consolidate them on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota. The proposed relocation plan proved futile. The tribes resisted and a minor rebellion broke out in 1898 on the Leech Lake Reservation of northern Minnesota. The US finally left the tribes in small rural reservations in these areas.|$|R
