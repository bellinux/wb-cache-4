ABSTRACT: This study determined technical efficiency of wheat farmers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Data from 300 wheat growers were collected through multistage stratified random sampling technique. Maximum likelihood estimation technique was applied to estimate stochastic frontier Cobb-Douglas production function to estimate the level of technical efficiency in wheat farming. Results showed that explanatory variables i. e., land under wheat crop, labor, chemical fertilizer, and <b>tractor</b> <b>plough</b> were statistically significant. The estimated elasticity for these variables indicated that a one percent increase in land under wheat crop, labor, chemical fertilizer and <b>tractor</b> <b>plough</b> would raise the wheat yield by 0. 126, 0. 248, 0. 081, 0. 226 and 0. 066 percent respectively. The coefficient of farm yard manure was found insignificant. The estimated value of technical efficiency ranges from 39 to 94 per cent, {{with an average of}} 64 per cent. This means that if an average farmer opts to attain the technical efficiency level of its most efficient counterpart, then wheat yield could be increased by 32 per cent. Similarly the most technically inefficient farmer could enhance wheat yield by 58 per cent. Farmers ’ age, farming experience, farmer ’ education and land under wheat crop were major determinants of technical inefficiency. The relationship between farmers ’ age and technical inefficiency was positive and statistically significant implied that technical efficienc...|$|E

40|$|A capture-mark-recapture {{study was}} {{conducted}} in crop fields in Morogoro, Tanzania, to investigate how the popu-lation dynamics of multimammate field rats, Mastomys natalensis, was influenced by the commonly practised land preparation methods and cropping systems. Two land pre-paration methods (<b>tractor</b> <b>ploughing</b> and slash and burn) and two cropping systems (mono-cropping with maize and inter-cropping with maize and beans) were investigated in a Complete Randomized Design experiment with 2 · 2 fac-tors, and two 0. 5 ha replicates per treatment. Mastomys natalensis comprised 97. 8 % of the abundance of the three rodent species captured in the study area. The slash and burned fields had higher rodent population densities than <b>tractor</b> <b>ploughed</b> fields (P 0. 05]. The study shows that land preparation methods should be considered a component of rodent pest manage-ment in ecologically based or integrated management practices. In maize fields in Tanzania, the crop is most sus-ceptible to damage byM. natalensis in the first 2 weeks after planting, and therefore, lower densities of rodents will result into lower crop damage in <b>tractor</b> <b>ploughed</b> fields.

40|$|Statistical {{tools are}} {{discussed}} {{for the analysis}} of data collected from tractor guidance systems. The importance of both accuracy and precision is discussed, and statistical tools for analysis are considered which incorporate important features of the data. In particular, accuracy is modelled using a generalized least squares model incorporating autocorrelation, and variances (inverse of precision) using a gamma generalized linear model. The methods are applied to data collected during an experiment conducted with a Trimble receiver used with a Beeline tractor guidance system. Three different scenarios are considered, then compared: a <b>tractor</b> simulating <b>ploughing</b> a field; the <b>tractor</b> pulling a <b>plough</b> with the receivers on the tractor; the <b>tractor</b> pulling a <b>plough</b> with the Trimble receiver on the plough. The change in the precision and accuracy between the scenarios is discussed. Data were recorded over repeated swaths for each scenario. After discussing specific statistical techniques for analysis of this type of data, the collected data are analysed; major conclusions are: The data from the Trimble receiver showed evidence of autocorrelation in the offsets; the plough recorded a variance about three times that recorded by the tractor...|$|R

50|$|The more {{fixed capital}} is used per worker, the more {{productive}} the worker can be, {{other things being}} equal. For example, a worker who tills the soil only with a spade is normally less productive than a worker who uses a tractor-driven plough {{to do the same}} work, because with a <b>tractor</b> one can <b>plough</b> more land in less time, and thus produce more in less time, even if a tractor costs more than a spade. Obviously one would not normally use a <b>tractor</b> to <b>plough</b> a small garden, but in large-scale farming the income earned using a tractor by far outweighs the expense of using a tractor. It is not economical to use a spade for large-scale ploughing, unless the labour is extremely cheap, and the supply of labour is plentiful.|$|R

The specific volume density of dry soil was 1. 48 g/cm 3. The following engine parameters were measured: Diesel oil consumption, engine speed, wheel slippage, time interval required for passing through the measured distance and the depth and width of ploughing. Measured values were used for calculation of Diesel oil consumption (amount required for ploughing of 1 cu. m. and the area ploughed up for a unit of time). <b>Tractor</b> <b>ploughed</b> always with the full fuel tank. Measurements were carried out at 1680 – 1850 and 1900 – 2050 revolutions per minute.

40|$|More {{effective}} {{control of the}} tsetse fly in Africa will reduce constraints imposed by the livestock disease, trypanosomiasis. Trypanosomiasis lowers livestock productivity, and in some areas, may limit the ability of farmers to keep livestock and plough the land using animal traction. Control of the disease may cause the expansion of livestock populations and cultivated land area which, in turn, may have negative impacts on ecosystem structure and function. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the impacts of tsetse (Glossina morsitans submorsitans, G. pallidipes, G. fuscipes fuscipes) control (using insecticides), through expansion of agricultural land use, on vegetative structure and tree species composition in the Ghibe Valley, SW Ethiopia. This was done by first describing land cover land-use patterns in areas with and without tsetse flies, and then quantifying land-use impacts on vegetation. Land-use/land cover was assessed and quantified by classifying a recent LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) image of the valley and analysing the abundance of cover types in a geographical information system (GIS). Vegetative structure and tree species composition were measured in field plots in 2 types of cultivated fields (oxen and <b>tractor</b> <b>ploughed),</b> and in upland wooded grasslands and riparian woodlands. Land cover in the Ghibe Valley was dominated by wooded grasslands (60) and cultivation (26), with smaller patches of dense upland woodland (9) and sparse woodland strips along river courses (3). Most farms were cultivated by smallholders using oxen (25 of the total cultivated area) with limited areas ploughed by large holders using tractors (0. 5). The cover of woody plants was highest in riparian woodlands (53), moderate in oxen-ploughed fields (6) and wooded grasslands (9), and lowest in tractor-ploughed fields (1). Species diversity (Shannon index 'H') was greatest in riparian woodlands (1. 6) and smallholder fields (1. 4), moderate in grasslands (1. 0) and low on largeholder farms (0. 7). These results highlight the importance of rare but biologically rich riparian areas, which should be a focus for conservation. If tsetse control, through the expansion of cultivation, causes degradation of these woodlands, the potential for impact is high. However, there appear to be few changes in the vegetation in the process of conversion of wooded grasslands into smallholder fields, which is the likely result of successful tsetse control. A hypothetical model of vegetative change in the Ghibe Valley is described in the light of the vegetative potential of the area and recent changes in the frequency of hunting and burning in the valley...|$|R
