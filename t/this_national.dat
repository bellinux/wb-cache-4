5|$|The Konjaku Monogatarishū from ca. 1120 is {{the most}} {{important}} setsuwa compilation. It is an anonymous collection of more than 1,000 anecdotes or tales. About two-thirds of the tales are Buddhist, telling about the spread of Buddhism from India via China to Japan. As such it is the first world history of Buddhism written in Japanese. <b>This</b> <b>National</b> Treasure is also known as the Suzuka Manuscript and consists of nine volumes covering setsuwa from India (vols. 2 and 5), China (vols. 7, 9, 10) and Japan (vols. 12, 17, 27, 29). It is considered to be the oldest extant manuscript of the Konjaku Monogatarishū and has served as a source for various later manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} Indonesian novels {{published}} by the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies Balai Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict between traditional (adat) and modern culture. These novels, published beginning in the 1920s, spearheaded the use of Indonesian as a national language. <b>This</b> <b>national</b> awakening, which was also realised through political actions, was followed in July 1933 {{with the establishment of}} the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe (New Writer). The literary magazine, which Belenggus author Armijn Pane helped establish, was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>National</b> War Museum Committee {{set about}} {{collecting}} material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, {{the production of}} munitions, and women's war work. There was an early appreciation {{of the need for}} exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'. The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig, who reportedly took great interest in his work. In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.|$|E
