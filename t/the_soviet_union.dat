5|$|Contemporaneously to {{establishment}} {{of the office of}} the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet constitution which stated that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which, in turn, played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the Party and its hegemony over <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and its people. Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> would assume the office, though <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> collapsed before this was actually tested. After the failed August Coup the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> never {{participated in}} the Eurovision Song Contest, but it made several {{attempts}} in the late 1980s. In 2009, Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due {{to the number of}} political reforms made by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> would impact on the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and the capitalist countries of the west. Valery Leontyev was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the Communist Party of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> never entered the contest before dissolving.|$|E

On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991.

During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse by trading with Western Europe and the Arab World. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> {{initially}} denied {{knowledge of}} the incident, but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that {{it was on a}} MASINT spy mission. The Politburo of the Communist Party of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> said it was a deliberate provocation by the United States to probe the Soviet Union's military preparedness, or even to provoke a war. The White House accused <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders, which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E
