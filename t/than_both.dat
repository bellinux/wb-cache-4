5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often weaker <b>than</b> <b>both</b> the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells <b>than</b> <b>both</b> the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do.

While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor <b>than</b> <b>both</b> of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E

Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, americium is located {{to the right}} of plutonium, to the left of curium, and below the lanthanide europium, with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Americium is a highly radioactive element. When freshly prepared, it has a silvery-white metallic lustre, but then slowly tarnishes in air. With a density of 12g/cm3, americium is less dense <b>than</b> <b>both</b> curium (13.52g/cm3) and plutonium (19.8g/cm3); but has a higher density than europium (5.264g/cm3)—mostly because of its higher atomic mass. Americium is relatively soft and easily deformable and has a significantly lower bulk modulus than the actinides before it: Th, Pa, U, Np and Pu. Its melting point of 1173°C is significantly higher than that of plutonium (639°C) and europium (826°C), but lower than for curium (1340°C).|$|E

5|$|The Triangulum Galaxy, {{also known}} as Messier 33, was {{discovered}} by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in the 17th century. A distant member of the Local Group, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough {{to be seen by}} the naked eye under the darkest skies. Under light-polluted skies, it is challenging or invisible even in a small telescope or binoculars. Because of its low surface brightness, low power is required. It is a spiral galaxy with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller <b>than</b> <b>both</b> the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way. A distance of less than 300 kiloparsecs between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger galaxy. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of Beta Andromedae. Within the galaxy, NGC 604 is an H II region where star formation takes place.|$|E

However, the energy from the axe can also produce a shield to protect the holder as well. They are more advanced <b>than</b> <b>both</b> the Initiate and the Warrior classes in that they spend the vast majority of their time on two feet only.

The investigation was taken of 275 males and 157 females in 1978, and 258 males and 232 females in 1990. The results were summarized as follows: 1. The rates of the desire for a kiss, petting and coitus were higher in males <b>than</b> in females <b>both</b> in 1978 and 1990, respectively. The desire for coitus was higher in 1990 <b>than</b> in 1978 <b>both</b> in males and female subjects. 2. The rates of experience in a kiss, petting and coitus were higher in 1990 <b>than</b> 1978 <b>both</b> in males and females, and there were obviously significant differences in males. 3. Concerning the limit to friends of men and women, coitus was higher in males than in females, and in 1990 <b>than</b> in 1978 <b>both</b> in males and female subjects. 4. The rate of admittance to coitus before the marriage were higher in males <b>than</b> in females <b>both</b> in 1978 and 1990, respectively. 5.

Its mission was to protect the southern flank of the Allied armies, south of the Sambre river and just north of Sedan. Further south, in France, was the French 2nd Army, protecting the Franco-Belgian border between Sedan and Montmédy. The two weakest French armies were thus protecting the area of the main German thrust.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys {{species are}} medium-sized, soft-furred rice rats. They closely {{resemble}} other medium-sized lowland forest rice rats, such as Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys from the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas and Handleyomys alfaroi from Central America and northwestern South America. In general, Transandinomys are distinguished from those animals {{by their very}} long superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes). Euryoryzomys species are in general slightly larger and Hylaeamys are about as large as Transandinomys, so that the only feature of external morphology that distinguishes the two genera is {{the length of the}} vibrissae.
