25|$|In 1964, James Cronin, Val Fitch and {{coworkers}} provided clear evidence from kaon decay that CP-symmetry could be broken. This work won them the 1980 Nobel Prize. This discovery showed that weak interactions violate {{not only the}} charge-conjugation symmetry C between particles and antiparticles and the P or parity, but also their combination. The discovery shocked particle physics {{and opened the door}} to questions still at the core of particle physics and of cosmology today. The lack of an exact CP-symmetry, but also the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> nearly a symmetry, created a great puzzle.|$|E
25|$|A {{legacy of}} serious {{environmental}} problems has beset {{the area from}} the time the canal arose from the local tidal wetlands and fresh water streams. In recent years, there has been a call once again for environmental cleanup. In addition, development pressures have brought speculation that the wetlands of the Gowanus should serve waterfront economic development needs which may not be compatible with environmental restoration. Experts have said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> polluted that if someone were to fall in the canal, they would need to be taken to a hospital for decontamination. Also, if anyone were to drink the water, they would likely contract dysentery and would be at risk of cancer and arsenic poisoning.|$|E

500|$|Reception to Hair {{upon its}} Broadway premiere was, with exceptions, {{overwhelmingly}} positive. [...] Clive Barnes {{wrote in the}} New York Times: [...] "What is so likable about Hair...? [...] I think it is simply <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> likable. [...] So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions." [...] John J. O'Connor of The Wall Street Journal said the show was [...] "exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into {{every nook and cranny}} of the Biltmore Theater". Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote that [...] "it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm, its high spirits are contagious, and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist." ...|$|E
500|$|The next type of uncertainty, ascertainability, {{is where}} it is {{impossible}} to find the beneficiaries, either because they have died, moved or changed names. This is not necessarily fatal; the test for deciding if it is or not was laid out by Wynn-Parry J as: [...] "mere difficulty of ascertainment is not of itself fatal to the validity of the gift. As has been pointed out, {{it is a matter of}} degree, and it is only when one reaches, on the evidence, a conclusion <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> vague or that the difficulty is so great that it must be treated as virtually incapable of resolution, that one is entitled, to my mind, to say that a gift of that nature is void for uncertainty". If a beneficiary cannot be found despite strenuous steps to find one, the trustees can apply for a Benjamin Order, named after the case of Re Benjamin, which authorises them to distribute the property as if the beneficiary is dead. The final type of uncertainty is administrative unworkability — where the trust is, by its very nature, so impractical that the trustees cannot carry out their duties. Where this prevents the trustees carrying out their duties, the trust will be declared invalid, and not applied.|$|E
500|$|Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carnivàle [...] "the perfect {{show for}} those who thought Twin Peaks was too accessible". The Australian said Carnivàle [...] "seems to have been {{conceived}} in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] {{can be a problem}} for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E

500|$|BuddyTV lauded the episode, {{writing that}} it was one of the best Veronica Mars episodes in months, mainly due to the reappearances of Wallace, Weevil, and Cliff, leading to what the {{reviewer}} called [...] "an old school Veronica Mars feel".Logan and Heather's subplot also garnered praise: [...] "It’s a nice departure from the oft repeated scenario of Logan exercising indiscretion." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a positive review, praising the case of-the-week and the episode's development of the Dean O'Dell mystery. He argued that this story arc was the best of the series so far, writing [...] "What makes this third season's second mystery work is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> balanced. [...] It's a closed system with multiple possibilities." [...] He was also intrigued by the case-of-the-week, noting that it stood out from others because it was not resolved within the episode. However, he was negative towards the Heather–Logan subplot and dynamic, referring to Heather as a type of Manic Pixie Dream Girl who is not sexualized. [...] "Heather is so ridiculously contrived as a way to help Logan out of his funk that it's almost embarrassing." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode an [...] "A", stating that [...] "I'm all for anything that gets Veronica and Keith working together on a big case." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing for the New Statesman and Nation, Raymond Mortimer {{wrote that}} the panels [...] "seems served from Picasso's Crucifixion , but further distorted, with ostrich necks and button heads {{protruding}} from bags—the whole effect gloomily phallic, like Bosch without the humour. These objects are perched on stools, and depicted {{as if they were}} sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. But that is the horror in the sense <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies? People came out as though purged into happiness, into a fuller reality of existence." ...|$|E
500|$|Scully goes to warn Fellig that he {{is about}} to be charged for murder, and accuses him of {{profiting}} from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to close her eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{resulting}} representation, {{also called the}} de Broglie–Bohm theory or Bohmian mechanics, the wave-particle duality vanishes, and explains the wave behaviour as a scattering with wave appearance, because the particle's motion is subject to a guiding equation or quantum potential.
