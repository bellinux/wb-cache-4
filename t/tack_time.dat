40|$|Abstract: Polyurethane {{plaster cast}} {{was an open}} weave fabric bandage, {{prepared}} by coating polyurethane prepolymer on raschel knitted fiberglass and polyester fabric. Curing takes place by coming in contact with water to form hard rigid cast. Polyurethane prepolymers were synthesized by reacting molar excess of diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) with polypropylene glycol (PPG) at 60 °C for 2 hours. This effect of different NCO/OH molar ratio and molecular weight of polyol on the <b>tack</b> free <b>time,</b> setting time, diametral compression strength, percent elongation and tensile strength of polyurethane plaster cast were investigated [...] It was observed that with increase in NCO/OH molar ratio, <b>tack</b> free <b>time</b> and setting time of the cast decreases, whereas diametral compression strength increases. Tensile strength was determined in universal testing machine and was found to increase with increasing NCO/OH ratio while opposite trend was observed in case of percent elongation. With increase in polyol molecular weight, <b>tack</b> free <b>time</b> and setting time of the cast increases, whereas diametral compression strength decreases. Blended polyols i. e. PPG 1000 with PPG 400 in 50 / 50 ratio gives tensile strength and diametral compression strength in between their unblended counterparts. In comparison to fiberglass cast, polyester cast has higher percent elongation and diametral compression strength. Key words: Polyurethane plaster cast Prepolymer Fiberglass cast Polyester cas...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlexible PU foam was {{synthesized}} {{by using}} recycled PU foam polyol (Infrigreen) which contain 4 functionality obtained from glycolysis wasted PU foam, as a polyol. PU foam is prepared by incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 wt% in petrochemical polyol (CARADOL. SA 34 - 05) which contain 2 functionality. Triethlylenediamine (TEGOAMIN 33) {{was used as}} the gelling catalyst. Polyether modified polysiloxane (TPGAOSTAB B 8715 LF 2) was the surfactant. Distilled water was used as a blowing agent to generate foam. Polymeric methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) which contain 2. 7 isocyanate groups/molecule was used for generate urethane linkage and carbon dioxide. The parameters investigated are characteristic time, i. e. cream time, gel time, rise <b>time</b> and <b>tack</b> free <b>time,</b> cell structure and cell morphology, tensile properties, compressive properties and compression set were compared with petrochemical based PU foam. It was found from the research that, cream time, gel time, rise <b>time</b> and <b>tack</b> free <b>time,</b> decrease with the recycled PU foam polyol content. It was also found that the incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol led to the increase in smaller cell size and large distribution of cell size. Tensile properties and compressive properties of PU foam increase with polyol functionality, including crosslink density and urea formation in PU foam. Decreasing of shape recover properties of PU foam obtained at high recycled PU foam polyol contents. This was caused by the deformation of hydrogen bonding between hard segments of PU chains. These results indicate that tensile properties and compressive properties of PU foam enhance by incorporation of recycled PU foam polyol...|$|R
50|$|Different sailboats have varying {{capabilities}} for sailing upwind {{because of}} the condition of their sails, the type of rigging, {{and the ability to}} track in the water based on their keel or centerboard design. That means {{there is not a single}} rule for everyone; each vessel has its own individual polar plot of boat speed for all of the possible wind angles. The mathematical calculations for determining the <b>tacking</b> angles and <b>times</b> with polar plots would not be practical to do mentally.|$|R
60|$|So the Dutch skipper {{appeared}} to think, {{for a few}} minutes afterwards he gave orders to bring her about on the other <b>tack.</b> Three <b>times</b> they tried and failed; each time the vessel slowly came up into the wind, but the heavy waves forced her head off again before the headsails filled. Then the skipper gave orders to wear her. Her head payed off to the wind until she was nearly before it. Two or three great seas struck her stern and buried her head deeply, but at last the boom swung over and her head came up on the other tack. During the course of these manoeuvres she had made fully two miles leeway, and when she was fairly under sail with her head to the west Malcolm took another long look towards the south.|$|R
40|$|The {{planning}} of routes for sailing vessels {{is subject to}} uncertainty from the weather. This is particularly important in yacht racing where the accuracy of a weather prediction can determine {{the outcome of a}} race. With a perfect weather forecast it is possible to use the polar tables of a given yacht to compute a route that minimises its arrival time at its destination. Software that does this for racing yachts is now a standard part of most commercial instrumentation packages. With uncertain weather information the routing problem becomes more difficult. We review two models for optimising yacht routes under uncertainty about the weather. The first of these is suitable for short course racing. It treats the wind as a Markov process, and based on observations of the wind ditrection, it computes tacking and heading decisions at each point of the course so as to minimise the expected arrival time at the next mark. The second model, which is intended for ocean races, models the weather using ensemble forecasts rather than a Markov process. In both models it is possible to represent risk-averse and risk-seeking behaviour.

40|$|A {{large portion}} of {{research}} in time series analysis addresses questioning specific components like trend, cycle or seasonal behavior.

The investigation has been realized upon varved lake sediments as one of common proxydata in paleoclimatics.

30|$|The Braive and BK drying {{recorder}} is {{an instrument}} frequently {{employed in the}} coatings industry to measure the drying performance of a paint film operated with different lengths of a test strip; hence the two names used to denote it. This recorder consists of hemispherically ended needles, moving {{along the length of}} the test strip, which is made from plain glass and coated with a thin film. The drying characteristics of paint film are classified into four stages: the paint flows together (wet-edge time), the paint begins to polymerise (dust-free time), surface dries and finally lines become no longer visible on the film (total drying or through drying time) (Miccichè et al. 2005 a). However, Klaasen et al. classified the drying performance into three phases: open time (a scratch line traced by a pin closes up), dust free time (pin leaves a visible scratchy line, partially closed) and <b>tack</b> free <b>time</b> (a scratch line does not close) (Klaasen & van der Leeuw 2006). Clearly, assessing the drying of film suffers from subjective evaluation.|$|R

60|$|The vessel to {{windward}} {{was not the}} first lugger, by fifty, that Captain Cuffe had assisted in chasing, and he knew the hopelessness of following such a craft under circumstances so directly adapted to its qualities. Then he was far from certain that he was pursuing an enemy at all, whatever distrust the signals may have excited, since she had clearly come out of a friendly port. Bastia, too, lay within a few hours' run, and there was the whole of the east coast of Corsica, abounding with small bays and havens, in which a vessel of that size might take refuge if pressed. After convincing himself, therefore, by half an hour's further trial in open sailing under the full force of the breeze, of the fruitlessness of his effort, that experienced officer ordered the Proserpine's helm put up, the yards squared, and he stood to the northward, apparently shaping his course for Leghorn or the Gulf of Genoa. When the frigate made this change in her course, the lugger, which had <b>tacked</b> some <b>time</b> previously, was just becoming shut in by the western end of Elba, and she was soon lost to view entirely, with every prospect of her weathering the island altogether, without being obliged to go about again.|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this Ph. D. thesis is the study and the {{development}} of the instruments needed to monitor and calibrate the Muon Detector of the LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) experiment. LHCb is currently under installation at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and will start to take data during 2007. The experiment will study B mesons decays to achieve a profound understanding of favour physics in the Standard Model framework and to search signs of new physics beyond. Muons {{can be found in the}} final states of many B-decays which are sensitive to CP violation. The Muon Detector has the crucial role to identify the muon particles generated by the b-hadron decays through a measurement of their transverse momentum, already at the first trigger level (Level- 0). A 95 % effciency in events selection is required for the Muon Trigger, which operates at the Level- 0. 1380 detectors are used to equip the whole Muon System and the corresponding 122, 112 readout channels must be time aligned and monitored with a resolution of a few ns to assure the correct Muon Trigger selection. In order to satisfy these requirements, it is necessary to distinguish the time distributions of muons generated by B-decays from the background and center them inside the bunch crossing period. Moreover, the selected events must be unambiguously associated to the bunch crossing which generated the detected muons. Before synchronization, signals generated to the same bunch crossing and coming from different readout channels will have different absolute delays with respect to the interaction time. The electronic instruments designed to time align and to monitor each Muon Detector readout channel are two Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), called DIALOG (DIagnostic time Adjustment and LOGics) and SYNC, developed in CMOS IBM 0. 25 um technology. The DIALOG chips are placed on the detectors, at the beginning of the electronic chains used to collect and to send the channel information to the Muon Trigger. The SYNC chips are placed at the end of the chains. In the Muon System there are 7632 DIALOG and 3552 SYNC devices. DIALOG and SYNC are VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits and were designed in Cagliari by the LHCb group. My research activity was at first focused on the design and on the simulation of the two ASICs. DIALOG is a mixed-signal circuit constituted by analog, digital and mixed blocks. SYNC is a synchronous digital circuit working at 40 MHz. After chip submissions, a semi-automatic test bench called DIALOG Test System (DTS) was developed to characterize and validate all DIALOG prototype characteristics. About 500 DIALOG chips were characterized in full detail by means of the DTS, allowing the definition of the proper sorting intervals needed to perform the validation of the about 12, 000 DIALOG mass production chips. The last part of my work was to study the feasibility of the Muon System time alignment, using the realized instruments during the first phase of LHCb data taking.

The NCO index (NCO equivalent/OH equivalent) was fixed at 1. 00. The characteristic times such as cream time, gel time, rise <b>time</b> and <b>tack</b> free <b>time</b> were followed during cup test. The physical properties were characterized and studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and foam density. The tensile and compression properties were investigated by UTM machine. The {{results show that the}} foam density decreased with increasing Emerox® 14001 contents up to 20 wt% replacement and then decreased. This trandency was similar to tensile modulus, compressive modulus and compressive strength results. The cell size of foams was important parameter to control their properties. However, tensile strength and elongation at break were enhanced by the addition of Emerox® 14001 at 20 wt% contents replacement and then decreased at higher content. Both parameters rely on balance between urethane linkages and urea microdomain and/or polyurea ball contents(urea aggregate), which were rapidly generated by isocyanate group and water. The increased Emerox® 14001 contents required more isocyanate. As a result, more urea microdomain were produced leading to the decreasing of tensile strength and elongation at break. Moreover, the compression set of the foams was dependent upon amount of urea linkages which was generated from the reaction of isocyanate group and water...|$|R
