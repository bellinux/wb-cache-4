On the other hand, when investors exhibit stronger subjective beliefs, fuzzy credit spreads diminish. Using fuzzy information and random analysis, one can consider more uncertain sources to explain how the asset price jump process works and the subjective judgment of investors in financial markets under a variety of fuzzy conditions. An appropriate price range will give investors more flexibility in making a choice...|$|R
50|$|Hedge funds use <b>Total</b> <b>Return</b> <b>Swaps</b> {{to obtain}} {{leverage}} on the Reference Assets: they can receive {{the return of}} the asset, typically from a bank (which has a funding cost advantage), without having to put out the cash to buy the Asset. They usually post a smaller amount of collateral upfront, thus obtaining leverage.|$|E
50|$|A swap {{agreement}} {{in which one}} party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swaps,</b> the underlying asset, {{referred to as the}} reference asset, is usually an equity index, loans, or bonds. This is owned by the party receiving the set rate payment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Total</b> <b>Return</b> <b>Swaps</b> {{are also}} very common in many {{structured}} finance transactions such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). CDO Issuers often enter TRS agreements as protection seller in order to leverage the returns for the structure's debt investors. By selling protection, the CDO gains exposure to the underlying asset(s) without having to put up capital to purchase the assets outright. The CDO gains the interest receivable on the reference asset(s) over the period while the counterparty mitigates their market risk.|$|E

50|$|Investors {{can choose}} to obtain a passive {{exposure}} to these commodity price indices through a <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> or a commodity index fund. The advantages of a passive commodity index exposure include negative correlation with other asset classes such as equities and bonds, as well as protection against inflation. The disadvantages include a negative roll yield due to contango in certain commodities, although this can be reduced by active management techniques, such as reducing the weights of certain constituents (e.g. precious and base metals) in the index.|$|R

40|$|As most Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) {{engage in}} {{securities}} lending or {{are based on}} <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swaps,</b> they expose their investors to counterparty risk. In this paper, we estimate empirically such risk exposures for a sample of physical and swap-based funds. We find that counterparty risk exposure is higher for swap-based ETFs, but that investors are compensated for bearing this risk. Using a difference-in-differences specification, we uncover that ETF flows respond significantly to changes in counter-party risk. Finally, we show that switching to an optimal collateral portfolio leads to substantial reduction in counterparty risk exposure...|$|E

40|$|A <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> (TRS), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} a <b>total</b> rate of <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> or TR swap, is an agreement between two parties that exchanges the <b>total</b> <b>return</b> from a financial asset between them. This is designed to transfer the credit risk from one party to the other. It {{is one of the}} principal instruments used by banks and other financial instruments to manage their credit risk exposure, and as such is a credit derivative. They are used as credit risk management tools, and also as synthetic repo instruments for funding purposes. One definition of a TRS is given in Francis etal. (1999), which states that a TRS is a swap agreement in which the <b>total</b> <b>return</b> of a bank loan or credit-sensitive security is exchanged for some other cash flow, usually tied to Libor or some other loan or credit-sensitive security. The TRS trade itself can be to any maturity term – that is, it need not match the maturity of the underlying (or reference) security. In a TRS, the <b>total</b> <b>return</b> from the underlying asset is paid over to the counterparty in return for a fixed or floating cash flow. This makes it slightly different to other credit derivatives such as credit default swaps, as the payments between counterparties to a TRS are connected to changes in the market value of th...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} a chronic US current account deficit is an {{integral}} and sustainable feature of a successful international monetary system. The US deficit supplies international collateral to the periphery. International collateral in turn supports two-way trade in financial assets that liberates capital formation in poor countries from inefficient domestic financial markets. The implicit international contract is analogous to a <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> in domestic financial markets. Using market-determined collateral arrangements from these transactions we compute the collateral requirements consistent with recent foreign direct investment in China. The data are remarkably consistent with such calculations. The analysis helps explain why net capital flows from poor to rich countries and recent evidence that net outflows of capital are associated with relatively high growth rates in emerging markets.

Exchange-traded funds, which have become popular among investors seeking exposure to a diversified portfolio of assets, share this characteristic, especially when their returns are replicated using derivative products. As the volume of such products grows, such replication strategies can lead to a build-up of systemic risks in the financial system.

40|$|Currency <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swaps</b> (CTRS) are hybrid {{derivatives}} {{instruments that}} allow to simultaneously hedge against credit and currency risks.

This indicates that, beyond interest rate risk, firm-specific factors are major drivers of the variations in the valuation of these instruments. Regression analysis of residuals shows that exchange rate determinants account for up to 40 % of model pricing errors – indicating that a currency risk premium affects the CTRS price significantly but only marginally, which confirms the prevalence of credit risk in the pricing of CTRS.

5000|$|The {{emerging}} market credit linked note, also sometimes called a “clean,” are traded by buy side clients {{to gain access}} to local debt markets for several reasons. First is that a direct investment in the sovereign debt may not be legal due to domicile restrictions of the country. One instance would be the local government requiring the purchaser of debt to have a business office in the country. Another instance would be tax restrictions or tariffs in countries with NDF currencies. A fund in USD would have difficulty repatriating the currency if local restrictions or taxes made it undesirable. When this occurs, the sell side global bank purchases the debt and structures it into a derivative note then issued to the client or clients. The client then owns the issued security which derives its <b>total</b> <b>return</b> from the underlying instrument. A CDS, credit default swap, is embedded in the instrument. It {{can be thought of as}} a fully funded <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> where the underlying asset <b>total</b> <b>return</b> is exchanged for a funding fee as well as the cost of the issued CLN. From a market risk perspective owning a CLN is almost identical to owning the local debt.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) of 1999 allows {{commercial}} bank expansion into investment banking of securities and insurance activities without limit in subsidiaries separate from {{commercial bank}}s. This paper demonstrates how securities hedging, insurance underwriting, and capital regulation through the <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> approach jointly determine the optimal bank interest margin {{under the same}} roof. We find that the bank’s interest margin and noninterest income are positively related to the bank’s securities hedging demand, and to the insurance underwriting provision, but negatively related to the bank capital requirement. We also find {{that the results of}} the bank’s noninterest income follow a similar argument {{as in the case of}} a change in interest margin. The results show that the combined production of commercial banking expansion into investment banking enhances the bank’s synergistic gains. In addition, if regulators reduce capital charges, a commercial bank will have a strong incentive to expand its investment banking activities. This suggests obviou...|$|R
40|$|All major asset classes {{including}} {{stocks and}} bonds have a well developed derivative market. Derivatives enable counterparties to reflect a view on a particular market, without having to trade the underlying asset. This {{seems to be a}} particularly appealing feature for real estate, an industry characterized by high transaction cost, long lead transaction time and lack of short-selling mechanism. Still, real estate remains the last major asset class without a liquid derivative market until recently when Credit Suisse began to offer swaps on the NCREIF Property Index (NPI) in the U. S. early this year following the UK's ten-year endeavor in developing real estate derivative market. The purpose of this thesis is two fold. First, in chapter one and two, we would like to explain what real estate derivatives are, how they work and why they can be beneficial to investors. Second, we are introducing some practical tools investors may use in evaluating and trading real estate derivatives. In chapter three, we are introducing three forecasting models on the NCREIF Property Index. In chapter four, we are expanding Prof. David Geltner's pricing methods on real estate index capital <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> to the NPI <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swap</b> and property type <b>total</b> <b>return</b> <b>swap.</b> (cont.) These pricing methods present a basic foundation for investors to price all three types of swap currently being offered by Credit Suisse. In our study, we find that derivatives can provide numerous benefits to real estate investors including low transaction cost, quick execution and short-selling mechanism. These benefits in turn can help investors implement various strategies including hedging against market risk, asset allocation, sector rebalancing, international diversification and portable Alpha. Our research on UK's experience in real estate derivatives as well as our investor survey results in the U. S. and the UK lead us to believe that further initiative and pioneering efforts are critical {{for the development of the}} real estate derivatives market. By presenting this study on index forecasting models and pricing methodologies, we hope to increase the awareness and comfort level of investors and thus encourage the proliferation of real estate derivatives. by Jong Yoon Lim and Yi Zhang.
