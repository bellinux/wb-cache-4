Motivated by this fact, we introduce the Poisson cloning model GP <b>C(n,</b> <b>p)</b> for random graphs {{in which the}} degrees are i. i. d Poisson random variables with mean λ. Then, we first establish a theorem that shows the new model {{is equivalent to the}} classical model G(n, p) in an asymptotic sense. Next, we introduce a useful algorithm, called the cut-off line algorithm, to generate the random graph GP <b>C(n,</b> <b>p).</b> The Poisson cloning model GP <b>C(n,</b> <b>p)</b> equipped the cut-off line algorithm enables us to very precisely analyze the sizes of the largest component and the t-core of G(n, p).

Then, the t-core problem for random hypergraphs and the pure literal algorithm for random k-SAT problems are analyzed. ...|$|R

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC license. The integral measurement of the 12 <b>C(n,</b> <b>p)</b> 12 B reaction was performed at the neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF at CERN. The total number of 12 B nuclei produced per neutron pulse of the n_TOF beam was determined using the activation technique in combination with a time-of-flight technique. The cross section is integrated over the n_TOF neutron energy spectrum from reaction threshold at 13. 6 MeV to 10 GeV. Having been measured up to 1 GeV on basis of the 235 U(n, f) reaction, the neutron energy spectrum above 200 MeV has been re-evaluated due to the recent extension of the cross section reference for this particular reaction, which is otherwise considered a standard up to 200 MeV. The results from the dedicated GEANT 4 simulations {{have been used to}} evaluate the neutron flux from 1 GeV up to 10 GeV. The experimental results related to the 12 <b>C(n,</b> <b>p)</b> 12 B reaction are compared with the evaluated cross sections from major libraries and with the predictions of different GEANT 4 models, which mostly underestimate the 12 B production.

In a paper [1], {{published}} in 1990, in a (somewhat inaccessible) conference proceedings, the authors {{had shown that}} for the unitary operators on a separable Hilbert space, endowed with the strong operator topology, those with singular, continuous, simple spectrum, with full support, form a dense Gé. A similar theorem for bounded self-adjoint operators with a given norm bound (omitting simplicity) was recently given by Barry Simon [2], [3], with a totally different proof. In this note we show that a slight modification of our argument, combined with the Cayley transform, gives a proof of Simon’s result, with simplicity of the spectrum added. Theorem 1 (p. 148) of Choksi-Nadkarni [1] (hereafter referred to as CN) states THEOREM 1. Pc, the set of non-atomic (i. e. continuous) probability measures on the circle S 1, is a dense Gé in P the set of all probability measures on the circle (in the weak* topology.). Since the set of measures in P which vanish on a fixed open arc I of the circle is closed, nowhere dense in P we immediately have COROLLARY (<b>CN</b> <b>P.</b> 148).

How this biolotical activity effects the exchange of carbon at the air-sea and shelf-ocean interfaces depends on the spatial and temporal relationship between photosynthesis and respiration (P-R), and the hydrodynamic transport mechanisms (turbulent mixing and circulation). Coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystems models provide an important tool for investigating variability in this system as they allow flux estimates and balanced budgets under a range of forcing scenarios. In this work, conducted for CASIX (Centre for observation of air-sea interactions and fluxes), we employ POLCOMS (Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal-Ocean Modelling system) coupled to ERSEM (European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model) in a 15 year simulation of the north-west European shelf (from 20 W to 13 E and 40 N to 62 N at 12 km resolution; see www. metoffice. gov. uk/research/ncof/shelf/browser. html). the ERSEM model partitions the ecosystem into four phytoplankton, three zooplankton classes and a bacteria class, the growth, consumption and death of which are simulated by the fluxes of <b>C,N,</b> <b>P</b> and Si between these compartments and four detrital classes and a separate benthic model.
