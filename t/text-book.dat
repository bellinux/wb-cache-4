He wrote for popular periodicals like Popular Science and Cosmopolitan and literary journals like American Monthly Review of Reviews.

He {{was responsible for the}} academy's mineralogical and geological cabinet. Tillman also wrote a series of memoirs which have been featured in the works of Miami University historian Dwight L.

25|$|Clarke {{published}} a Latin {{version of the}} Traité de physique of Jacques Rohault (1617(?)-1672) with notes, which he finished before he was twenty-two. The system of Rohault was based on Cartesian principles, and was previously known only {{through the medium of}} a crude Latin version. Clarke's translation (1697) continued {{to be used as a}} <b>text-book</b> in the university till supplanted by the treatises of Newton. Four editions were issued, the last being that of 1718. It was translated into English in 1723 by his younger brother John, dean of Salisbury.|$|E
25|$|After {{teaching}} for some time, Wells {{found it necessary}} to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the College of Preceptors (College of Teachers). He later received his Licentiate and Fellowship FCP diplomas from the College. It was not until 1890 that Wells earned a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from the University of London External Programme. In 1889–90, he managed to find a post as a teacher at Henley House School, where he taught A. A. Milne. His first published work was a <b>Text-Book</b> of Biology in two volumes (1893).|$|E
25|$|The Art of Cookery: A Manual for Homes was {{published}} in 1896, and A <b>Text-book</b> of Cookery: For Use in Schools in the following year. In 1898, Ewing founded the Model Home School of Household Economics, which was affiliated Marietta College of Ohio. The normal course extended over two years. Associated with Ewing were, Helen M. Rathbun, manager of the model home: Maud E. Pike, principal of practical instruction; and Elizabeth M. Oakley, superintendent of practice kitchen. The new venture prospered, {{and the result was}} a similar institute in Syracuse, New York, over which Ewing presided.|$|E

25|$|An edited {{version of}} the book by Robert Evans Peterson was {{published}} in the United States in 1851 as Familiar Science; or, the Scientific Explanation of Common Things, with a revised edition following in 1863. These versions were edited and rearranged in order to make them more suitable for American pupils and were used as a <b>text-book</b> by schools in Pennsylvania and Brooklyn. Brewer wrote to Peterson expressing his satisfaction at the rearrangement but nevertheless prepared a revised edition of his own which {{was published in the}} US in 1864. This edition was digitised and republished by the University of Michigan Library in 2005 following a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation as part of Making of America IV: the American voice, 1850–1877.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his growing {{reputation}} Lanfranc was invited to defend the doctrine of transubstantiation against the attacks of Berengar of Tours. He took up the task with the greatest zeal, although Berengar had been his personal friend; he was the protagonist of orthodoxy at the Church Councils of Vercelli (1050), Tours (1054) and Rome (1059). To Lanfranc's influence is attributed the desertion of Berengar's cause by Hildebrand and the more broad-minded of the cardinals. Our knowledge of Lanfranc's polemics is chiefly derived from the tract De corpore et sanguine Domini, probably written c. 1060-63. Though betraying no signs of metaphysical ability, his work was regarded as conclusive and became for a while a <b>text-book</b> in the schools. It is often said to be the place where the Aristotelian distinction between substance and accident was first applied to explain Eucharistic change. It is the most important of the surviving works attributed to Lanfranc.|$|E
25|$|While local (to a {{database}} system) relaxed serializability methods compromise serializability for performance gain (and are utilized {{only when the}} application can tolerate possible resulting inaccuracies, or its integrity is unharmed), it is unclear that various proposed relaxed global serializability methods which compromise global serializability, provide any performance gain over commitment ordering which guarantees global serializability. Typically, the declared intention of such methods has not been performance gain over effective global serializability methods (which apparently have been unknown to the inventors), but rather correctness criteria alternatives {{due to lack of}} a known effective global serializability method. Oddly, some of them were introduced years after CO had been introduced, and some even quote CO without realizing that it provides an effective global serializability solution, and thus without providing any performance comparison with CO to justify them as alternatives to global serializability for some applications (e.g., Two-level serializability). Two-level serializability is even presented as a major global concurrency control method in a 2010 edition of a <b>text-book</b> on databases (authored by two of the original authors of Two-level serializability, where one of them, Avi Silberschatz, is also an author of the original Strong recoverability articles). This book neither mentions CO nor references it, and strangely, apparently does not consider CO a valid Global serializability solution.|$|E
