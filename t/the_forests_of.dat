5|$|At first, <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> the {{watershed}} {{were not significantly}} affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in {{the watershed}} was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

In 1879 these forests were constituted into a reserve forest where restricted felling was permitted.|$|E

5|$|Mythology {{has it that}} <b>the</b> <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> Vajjabhumi (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities.

Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith, Bakreshwar, Kankalitala, Fullara near Labhpur, Sainthia and Nalhati.

5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} valley floor became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works.

Henry IV and Louis XIII of France often used <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> for fox hunting. Louis XIV also walked <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and hired an architect, André Le Nôtre, to build a terrace {{bordering}} <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> dominating <b>the</b> valley <b>of</b> the River Seine in 1663. He also built a high wall, finished by Napoléon, encircling <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> to prevent game from escaping the woods. After <b>the</b> abandonment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Germain in 1682 by Louis XIV, Charles X resumed the hunting tradition of Saint-Germain. Napoléon III purchased land to the South to link <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Germain with <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>of</b> Marly. <b>The</b> arrival of the railway in 1835, then {{the development of the}} car, considerably increased use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|R
