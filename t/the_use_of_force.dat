5|$|The Jedi Knight {{series is}} {{composed}} primarily of first/third-person shooter gameplay elements, {{with a number}} of variation on the norms of the genre within each game. All of the games use a level based system which contains a series of objectives that must be completed before the player can continue. From Dark Forces II onwards, the games have included lightsaber combat and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Force</b> powers, which have been tweaked and modified as the series has progressed.|$|E

5|$|Edwin Porch Morrow (November 28, 1877June 15, 1935) was an American politician, {{who served}} as the 40th Governor of Kentucky from 1919 to 1923. He was the only Republican elected to this office between 1907 and 1927. He championed the typical Republican causes of his day, namely equal rights for African-Americans and <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> to quell violence. Morrow had been schooled in his party's {{principles}} by his father, Thomas Z. Morrow, who was its candidate for governor in 1883, and his uncle, William O. Bradley, who was elected governor in 1895. Both men were founding members of the Republican Party in Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|Washington, {{alarmed by}} what {{appeared}} to be an armed insurrection in Western Pennsylvania, asked his cabinet for written opinions {{about how to deal with}} the crisis. The cabinet recommended <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> except for Secretary of State Randolph who urged reconciliation. Washington did bothhe sent commissioners to meet with the rebels while raising a militia army. When the final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws, the president invoked the Militia Law of 1792 to summon the militias of Pennsylvania, Virginia and several other states. The governors sent the troops and Washington took command as Commander-in-Chief, marching into the rebellious districts.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E

5|$|Arrangements devised in 1963 between 'Aflaq and the Military Committee {{led to a}} {{very close}} mutual {{involvement}} {{of the military and}} civilian sectors of the regime, so {{that by the end of}} 1965 the politics of the Syrian army had become almost identical to the politics of the Ba'th Party. The principle military protagonist of the period Hafiz, J'did, and 'Umran were no longer on military service and their power depended on their intermediary supporters in the army and in the party. In November 1965, the National Command issued a resolution which stated it was forbidden for the Regional Command to transfer or dismiss military officers without the consent of the National Command. After hearing of the resolution, Jadid rebelled immediately, and ordered Colonel Mustafa Tlas to arrest the commanders of the Homs garrison and his deputy, both supporters of National Command. In response, Razzaz called for an emergency session of the National Command which decreed the Regional Command dissolved, and made Bitar Prime Minister. Hafiz was made Chairman of a new Presidential Council and Shibli al-Aysami his deputy. Umran was recalled from exile and reappointed to the office of Minister of Defence and commander-in-chief, and Mansur al-Atrash was appointed Chairman of a new and expanded National Revolutionary Council. Jadid and his supporters responded by making war on the National Command. Assad, who neither liked nor had sympathy for the Aflaqites, did not support a showdown through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> In response to the coming coup, Assad, along with Naji Jamil, Husayn Mulhim and Yusuf Sayigh, left for London.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{specification}} {{of the model}} error covariances in data assimilation systems is a challenging issue. Ensemble land data assimilation methods rely on stochastic perturbations <b>of</b> input <b>forcing</b> and model prognostic fields for developing representations of input model error covariances. This article examines <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>using</b> a single <b>forcing</b> dataset for specifying forcing uncertainty inputs for assimilating snow depth retrievals. Using an idealized data assimilation experiment, the article demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> hybrid <b>forcing</b> input strategies (either through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an ensemble <b>of</b> <b>forcing</b> products or through <b>the</b> added <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> climatology) provide a better characterization of the background model error, which leads to improved data assimilation results, especially during the snow accumulation and melt-time periods. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> hybrid <b>forcing</b> ensembles is then employed for assimilating snow depth retrievals from the AMSR 2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) instrument over two domains in the continental USA with different snow evolution characteristics. Over a region near the Great Lakes, where the snow evolution tends to be ephemeral, <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> hybrid <b>forcing</b> ensembles provides significant improvements relative to <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a single <b>forcing</b> dataset. Over the Colorado headwaters characterized by large snow accumulation, <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>forcing</b> ensemble is less prominent and is largely limited to the snow transition time periods. The results of the article demonstrate that improving the background model error through <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>forcing</b> ensemble enables the assimilation system to better incorporate the observational information...|$|R
