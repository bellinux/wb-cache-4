He served more than two years in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, and {{he was the first to}} sign the Declaration of Independence in his position as president of Congress. He returned to Massachusetts and was elected governor of the Commonwealth, serving in that role for most of his remaining years. He used his influence to ensure that Massachusetts ratified the United States Constitution in 1788.|$|E

These remained fixed during the terms of Duhalde and Néstor and Cristina Kirchner, despite <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> motivated them having ended. As the inflation rate grew during the period, the state financed part of these prices with subsidies. Investment in these areas decreased, and the generation and distribution networks suffered. Argentina lost its self-supply of energy, and had to import it, rather than being able to export surpluses.|$|E
5|$|The Oran fatwa was a responsum fatwa, or an Islamic legal opinion, {{issued in}} 1504 to address <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> {{occurred}} when Muslims in the Crown of Castile (now part of Spain) {{were forced to}} convert to Christianity in 15001502. The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E

Analyzing the roots of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> Russian culture had fallen into, Gippius (somewhat paradoxically, given her 'demonic' reputation) suggested as a remedy the 'Christianization' of it, which in practice meant bringing the intelligentsia and the Church closer together.

After continued depreciation, and high inflation, the then Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, made a statement in the Parliament of India on the issue. He was of the view that, the present depreciation is partly led by global factors as well as domestic factors.

25|$|During its {{brief history}} {{the town was}} {{isolated}} from the surrounding community socially as well as physically, its residents keeping to themselves in a strict, simple lifestyle.

25|$|Absurdism shares some concepts, and {{a common}} {{theoretical}} template, with existentialism and nihilism. It has its origins {{in the work of}} the 19th-century Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, who chose to confront <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> humans face with the Absurd by developing his own existentialist philosophy. Absurdism as a belief system was born of the European existentialist movement that ensued, specifically when Camus rejected certain aspects of that philosophical line of thought and published his essay The Myth of Sisyphus. The aftermath of World War II provided the social environment that stimulated absurdist views and allowed for their popular development, especially in the devastated country of France.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempted}} {{assassination of}} Coligny triggered <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the}} massacre. Admiral de Coligny was the most respected Huguenot leader and enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} the king, although he was distrusted by the king's mother. Aware of the danger of reprisals from the Protestants, the king and his court visited Coligny on his sickbed and promised him that the culprits would be punished. While the Queen Mother was eating dinner, Protestants burst in to demand justice, some talking in menacing terms. Fears of Huguenot reprisals grew. Coligny's brother-in-law led a 4,000-strong army camped just outside Paris and, although there is no evidence it was planning to attack, Catholics in the city feared it might take revenge on the Guises or the city populace itself.|$|E

25|$|The Muslim {{conquest of}} Hispania {{began when the}} Moors (Berbers and Arabs) invaded the Christian Visigothic kingdom of Hispania in the year 711, under the Berber general Tariq ibn Ziyad. They landed at Gibraltar on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his Arab superior, Musa ibn Nusair. During the eight-year {{campaign}} most of the Iberian Peninsula was brought under Muslim rule – save for small areas in the northwest (Asturias) and largely Basque regions in the Pyrenees. In 711, Visigothic Hispania was very weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne involving two Visigoth suitors. The Muslims took advantage of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> crossed the Hispano-Visigothic society {{to carry out their}} conquests.

25|$|Ironically, one of {{the plots}} called for Papen's murder by Austrian Nazi sympathisers as a pretext for a retaliatory {{invasion}} by Germany. On 25 January 1938, the Austrian police raided the Vienna headquarters of the Austrian Nazi Party, arresting Gauleiter Leopold Tavs, the deputy to Captain Leopold, and discovered a cache of arms. The plans laid out by Captain Leopold called for Papen to be assassinated by Austrian Nazis disguised as policemen, providing the pretext for a German invasion of Austria. The police raid set off <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>that</b> led directly to the Anschluss as the Austrian Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg now took up the invitation to meet Hitler to confront him with {{the evidence that the}} Austrian Nazis had been planning a putsch contrary to the Austro-German treaty of 1936.

Kluttig and Reineboth, two other SS officers, realize that Zweiling was the informant, but choose to ignore it; they begin to search for the child. Kluttig is keen on massacring the camp's surviving prisoners, but commandant Schwahl forbids it, fearing American retribution - although he knows of the secret resistance. Kluttig and Reineboth brutally torture Höfel and Kropinski, but they refuse to tell the boy's whereabouts. The resistance's leaders meet to discuss <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> <b>that</b> may bring about an SS crackdown before their planned uprising.
