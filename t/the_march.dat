5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about <b>the</b> <b>March</b> on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement of <b>the</b> <b>march.</b> In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement of <b>the</b> <b>march</b> was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader of <b>the</b> <b>march.</b> The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse <b>the</b> <b>march.</b> When Meany heard Randolph's speech after <b>the</b> <b>march,</b> he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and the UAW union to help mobilize demonstrators for the cause.|$|E

These bands, known as the Infantry Regimental Band and the Artillery Regimental Band, helped to train new students in <b>the</b> <b>marching</b> style of <b>the</b> <b>Marching</b> Band. These bands met primarily in the Winter and Spring Quarters, and were often complimented by the upperclass members of <b>the</b> <b>Marching</b> Band, looking to continue to improve their marching and musicianship.
