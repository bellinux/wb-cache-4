40|$|Abstract — {{recently}} lot {{of research}} and development work is being carried out for devices of power train for Electrical Vehicle (EV). This paper proposes novel integrated use by selection of different power <b>train</b> <b>element</b> of EV.

There are different device for each power <b>train</b> <b>element.</b> Aim is to select dc/dc converter to reduce ripple, which have higher voltage gain, and to make selection of inverter like square wave inverter or PWM inverter, and select motor like BLDC or PMSM and motor control method like Field Oriented Control (FOC), Scalar control method; which will affect size, efficiency, cost and performance of EV. A novel integration of power electronics device for electric power train of electrical vehicle is presented in this paper and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink...|$|R
