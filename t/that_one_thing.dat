25|$|The Huayan school {{taught the}} {{doctrine}} of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in Indra's net. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> This philosophy is based {{in the tradition of the}} great Madhyamaka scholar Nagarjuna and, more specifically, on the Avatamsaka Sutra. Regarded by D.T. Suzuki as the crowning achievement of Buddhist philosophy, the Avatamsaka Sutra elaborates in great detail on the principal of dependent origination. This sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one another.|$|E
500|$|Mouna Ragam {{provides}} {{insight into}} the issues faced by married couples, exploring the plight and perception of divorce and how societies need to view the desires of women. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan compared the film to J. Mahendran's Nenjathai Killathe (1980), another {{story of a woman}} torn between the man she loves and the man she marries, Antha Ezhu Naatkal (1981) and its Hindi remake, Woh Saat Din (1983). Rakesh Mehar of The News Minute noted <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> differentiating Mouna Ragam from Antha Ezhu Naatkal and similar films is that it remains focused on Divya. Kumuthan Maderya, writing for PopMatters, described Mouna Ragam a [...] "chick flick", because like other chick flicks, the film allowed romance to blossom between Divya and Chandrakumar, rather than let divorce split them; according to him, [...] "chick flicks center on the romantic worldview of females while gratifying their hopes and dreams usually through a warm and fuzzy denouement".|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and gave you a sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E

500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E

His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

Haig had none. He was stubborn, self-righteous, inflexible, intolerant—especially of the French—and quite humourless ... Indeed, one powerful legacy of Haig's performance is the conviction among the imaginative and intelligent today of the unredeemable defectiveness of all civil and military leaders. [...] Haig could be said to have established the paradigm.|$|E

The government is there to help people but not control them," [...] he remarked. A 2000 Rolling Stone profile notes that Hoppus [...] "pray every night". He elaborated on his religious views in a 2005 interview: [...] "It's amazing to me that anyone can say <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is right.

So for Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog drew inspiration from Ubisoft's [...] and Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption to make their offering the [...] "go-to game for PS3 multiplayer." [...] Naughty Dog also told the magazine <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> they learned through all their multiplayer testing is that damage and health in multiplayer should be [...] "the same or similar to single player." [...] Naughty Dog announced that Uncharted 3 wouldn't feature a dedicated server, because Naughty Dog looks for a potential four-year lifespan instead.|$|E
2500|$|According to Girard, the {{substitution}} of an immolated victim for the first, is [...] "the very first symbolic sign created by the hominids". [...] Girard also says {{this is the first}} time <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> represents another thing, standing in the place of this (absent) one. This substitution is the beginning of representation and language, but also the beginning of sacrifice and ritual. The genesis of language and ritual is very slow and we must imagine that there are also kinds of rituals among the animals: [...] "It is the originary scapegoating which prolongs itself in a process which can be infinitely long in moving from, how should I say, from instinctive ritualization, instinctive prohibition, instinctive separation of the antagonists, which you already find to a certain extent in animals, towards representation." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E

2500|$|When {{invited to}} perform at the White House {{for the first time}} in 1970, Richard Nixon's office {{requested}} that he play [...] "Okie from Muskogee" [...] (a satirical Merle Haggard song about people who despised youthful drug users and war protesters), [...] "Welfare Cadillac" [...] (a Guy Drake song which denies the integrity of welfare recipients), and [...] "A Boy Named Sue." [...] Cash declined to play the first two and instead selected other songs, including [...] "The Ballad of Ira Hayes" [...] (about a brave Native American World War II veteran who was mistreated upon his return to Arizona), and his own compositions, [...] "What Is Truth" [...] and [...] "Man in Black". Cash wrote that the reasons for denying Nixon's song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason. However, Cash added, even if Nixon's office had given Cash enough time to learn and rehearse the songs, their choice of pieces that conveyed [...] "anti-hippie and anti-black" [...] sentiments might have backfired. In his remarks when introducing Cash, Nixon joked <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he'd learned about the singer was one didn't tell him what to sing.|$|E
2500|$|Silas plots to {{discredit}} Lynsey {{by making it}} seem as if she is having a breakdown. Silas plans to send Lynsey mad so that no one will listen to her. Rawle said that Silas delights in the idea that Lynsey thinks she is good enough to play him. Silas puts a webcam in Lynsey's flat in order to watch her. He sneaks into the house and plays tricks on Lynsey by turning the gas on and writing a [...] "sinister" [...] message on her mirror with lipstick. Of this, Rawle explained: [...] "Silas alters Lynsey's reality — so when she insists <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> is happening, it appears not to be the case the next minute." [...] Silas sneaks into Lynsey's flat at night and moves her things around which Rawle said is [...] "a subtle way of sending a person barmy". Lynsey's friends do not believe her accusations and question her state of mind, so she leaves the village. Lynsey's friend, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), sees Silas watching Lynsey as she is leaving and Hassan said that [...] " [...] starts to think there's something odd about him".|$|E
