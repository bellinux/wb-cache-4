5|$|Governments {{around the}} world are {{considering}} a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E
5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> due {{to the introduction of}} filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E

5|$|Messiaen's {{music has}} been {{described}} as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it. Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.|$|E
5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> due to the brightness enhancement of the opposition effect; at quarter phase, the Moon is only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.|$|E
5|$|The weather of Mount Washington is {{notoriously}} erratic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> {{due to the}} convergence of several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due to the relative temperature differences between the Northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed from {{the summit of the}} mountain on average of 110 days per year.|$|E

5|$|There is {{relatively}} little parking {{elsewhere on the}} site, other than the 190-space facility at the Sainsbury's supermarket; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> mitigated by the retention of the London Road multi-storey car park, located between Block C and the A23 London Road itself. The residential areas in particular have very few dedicated parking spaces. Block K will have 27 spaces to be shared between the hotel and the office building; nine of these will be for disabled drivers. The master plan proposed 34 (including five on-street spaces), {{all of which were}} allocated to the office building.|$|E
5|$|Although the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977, it did {{not have}} a major {{immediate}} impact on global oil prices. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because it took several years to reach full production and partly because U.S. production outside Alaska declined until the mid-1980s. The Iranian Revolution and OPEC price increases triggered the 1979 energy crisis despite TAPS production increases. Oil prices remained high until the late 1980s, when a stable international situation, the removal of price controls, and the peak of production at Prudhoe Bay contributed to the 1980s oil glut. In 1988, TAPS was delivering 25 percent of all U.S. oil production. As North Slope oil production declined, so did TAPS' share of U.S. production. Today, TAPS provides less than 17 percent of U.S. oil production.|$|E
5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can transmit pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to transmit Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, {{the final}} tournament is rotated between confederations, {{allowing}} only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid {{to host the}} tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{volcanic}} {{zones in}} the Garibaldi Belt, volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field are not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active their magma systems are. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because {{the field is}} located in a remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the last few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have considerable effects, particularly in a region like southwestern British Columbia where the Garibaldi Belt {{is located in a}} highly populated area. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge {{on the state of the}} Garibaldi volcanoes. This improvement is continuous and will support the understanding to monitor volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field for future volcanism.|$|E

5|$|San Diego's roadway system {{provides}} an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city's hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown {{tend to be}} utility cycling oriented. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because of the grid street patterns now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, a majority of cycling is recreational. In 2006, San Diego was rated the best city (with a population over 1 million) for cycling in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The Library {{holds an}} almost {{complete}} collection of British and Irish newspapers since 1840. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> {{because of the}} legal deposit legislation of 1869, which required newspapers to supply a copy of each edition of a newspaper to the library. London editions of national daily and Sunday newspapers are complete back to 1801. In total the collection consists of 660,000 bound volumes and 370,000 reels of microfilm containing {{tens of millions of}} newspapers with 52,000 titles on 45km of shelves. From earlier dates, the collections include the Thomason Tracts, comprising 7,200 17th-century newspapers, and the Burney Collection, featuring nearly 1 million pages of newspapers from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The section also holds extensive collections of non-British newspapers, in numerous languages.|$|E
5|$|The Minerals Management Service (renamed on 18 June 2010 to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or Bureau of Ocean Energy (BOE)) is the {{regulatory}} and inspecting body for {{offshore oil drilling}} and rigs in the United States of America. According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection. Reports {{of the last three}} inspections for 2010 were provided under Freedom of Information legislation. Each of these inspections had taken two hours or less.|$|E

5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} {{has much to do}} with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
5|$|The work {{commenced}} {{at the end}} of {{the building}} furthest from the altar, with the latest of the narrative scenes, and progressed towards the altar with the scenes of the Creation. The first three scenes, from the story of Noah, contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because of the subject matter, which deals with the fate of Humanity, but also because all the figures at that end of the ceiling, including the prophets and Ignudi, are smaller than in the central section. As the scale got larger, Michelangelo's style became broader, the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> {{due to the lack of}} sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E
