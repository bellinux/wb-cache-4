5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic <b>toolkit.</b> They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of <b>toolkit</b> genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most <b>toolkit</b> genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important <b>toolkit</b> genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other <b>toolkit</b> genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E

5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the <b>toolkit,</b> either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when <b>toolkit</b> genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the Neo-Lamarckian theory that epigenetic changes are later consolidated at gene level, something {{that may have been}} important early in the history of multicellular life.|$|E

5|$|This process {{explains}} the accurate conservation of <b>toolkit</b> gene sequences, which {{has resulted in}} deep homology and functional equivalence of <b>toolkit</b> proteins in dissimilar animals (seen, for example, when a mouse protein controls fruit fly development). The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.|$|E

5|$|Variations in the <b>toolkit</b> {{may have}} {{produced}} {{a large part of}} the morphological evolution of animals. The <b>toolkit</b> can drive evolution in two ways. A <b>toolkit</b> gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a <b>toolkit</b> gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E

5|$|The European Nucleotide Archive handles {{large volumes}} of data which pose a {{significant}} storage challenge. As of 2012, the ENA's storage requirements continue to grow exponentially, with a doubling time of approximately 10 months. To manage this increase, the ENA selectively discards less-valuable sequencing platform data and implements advanced compression strategies. The CRAM reference-based compression <b>toolkit</b> was developed to help reduce ENA storage requirements.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{somewhat}} controversial {{argument is}} that evolution in animals (though no doubt similar processes occur in other organisms) proceeds mostly by modifying the way that regulatory genes, which do not code for structural proteins (such as enzymes), control embryonic development. In turn, these regulatory genes {{turn out to be}} based on a very old set of highly conserved genes which Carroll nicknames the <b>toolkit.</b> Almost identical sequences can be found across the animal kingdom, meaning that <b>toolkit</b> genes such as Hox must have evolved before the Cambrian radiation which created most of the animal body plans that exist today. These genes are used and reused, occasionally by duplication but far more often by being applied unchanged to new functions. Thus the same signal may be given at a different time in development, in {{a different part of the}} embryo, creating a different effect on the adult body. In Carroll's view, this explains how so many body forms are created with so few structural genes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVirtual environments (VEs) {{demonstrate}} the immense potential computer technology can provide to society. VEs {{have been created}} for almost two decades, but standardized tools and procedures for their creation do not exist. Numerous efforts to create tools for creating VEs have come and gone, {{but there is little}} consensus among tool creators for establishing a common subset of standard features that developers can expect. Currently, developers use one of many Virtual Reality (VR) <b>toolkits</b> to create a VE. However, VR <b>toolkits</b> are problematic when it comes to interoperability between applications and other VR <b>toolkits.</b> This paper investigates why the development tools are in this state. A discussion on the history of VR <b>toolkits</b> and developer experiences is used to show what developers face when they create a VE. Next, Three Dimensional Interaction Technique (3 DIT) <b>toolkits</b> are introduced to show a new way of developing some parts of VEs. Lastly, a vision for the future of VE development that may help improve the next generation of <b>toolkits</b> is presented...|$|R

New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's Windows NT. The company also launched WebObjects, a platform for building large-scale dynamic web applications. Many large businesses including Dell, Disney, WorldCom, and the BBC used this WebObjects software for a short time. Today, WebObjects is used almost solely to power Apple's iTunes Store {{and most of its}} corporate Web site.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic <b>toolkit</b> studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's <b>toolkit.</b> In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E

It earned about $100 per month, mostly from companies in Ukraine and Russia. Kaspersky's then-future wife Natalya Kaspersky became his coworker at KAMI.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful <b>toolkit</b> for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008 an ochre {{processing}} workshop {{consisting of}} two <b>toolkits</b> was uncovered in the 100,000-year-old levels at Blombos Cave, South Africa. [...] Analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich mixture was produced and stored in the shells of two Haliotis midae (abalone), and that ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones and hammer-stones also formed a composite part of the <b>toolkits.</b> As both <b>toolkits</b> were left in situ, and as there are few other archaeological remains in the same layer, it seems the site was used primarily as a workshop and was abandoned shortly after the pigment-rich compounds were made.
