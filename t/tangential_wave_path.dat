40|$|A surface magnon-polariton can {{be excited}} by both p- and s-polarized light if {{at least one}} of the layers is a {{magnetic}} material. We present general expressions of the <b>tangential</b> <b>wave</b> vectors of s- and p-polarized light at an interface of two media. Analysis reveals additional new regimes of surface polariton resonances with magnetic materials for s- and p-polarized light. The <b>tangential</b> <b>wave</b> vectors are found to be equal in magnitude to the normal wave vectors at surface polariton resonances. The spatial distributions of the fields at resonant enhancement and the spectra of the <b>tangential</b> <b>wave</b> vectors are studied for different dielectric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities of the two media. If one of the media has dispersive dielectric function and permeability function, additional surface polariton resonance peaks appear for both s- and p polarizations. For a medium with a superconductor, the tangential component increases asymptotically at lower frequencies, providing subwavelength capability at the terahertz regime.

The results indicate that both elevated burning rate induced by the <b>tangential</b> <b>wave</b> motions and variable nozzle blockage due to passage of vortical flow through the nozzle throat must act together to generate the large mean pressure peaks observed in the tests. There is strong correlation between the amplitude of wave motions {{and the level of}} mean pressure rise. Evidence for the presence of traveling <b>tangential</b> <b>waves</b> {{at the time of the}} D. C. shift was found by use of dual Kistler pressure transducers mounted at the head end of the burner.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem of}} robot coverage is {{to plan a}} path that brings a point on a robot within a fixed distance of every point in the free space. This problem is solved {{under the assumption that}} a robot follows the path exactly. However, a robot with uncertainty in sensing and actuation is not guaranteed to follow the path exactly and thus is not guaranteed to cover the free space. A coverage planner, rather than producing a path, should produce a feedback policy, but it is unclear exactly what performance it is to achieve. To make the problem concrete, we formulate a ???probably approximately correct??? measure of performance that captures the probability 1 - e of covering a fraction 1 - d of the free space. We apply this measure to a simple system in which a robot is commanded to follow a square <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> in a rectangular region. We show that following a square <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> with passes parallel to the short axis performs better than following a square <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> with passes parallel to the long axis. This inspires a new strategy in which a square <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> is steered throughout the free space. We design a feedback policy where the square <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> is treated as a larger, virtual robot with coverage implement size equal {{to the size of the}} square wave. The virtual robot tracks a global path and generates a local path that the robot tracks. Coverage planning is then simplified by decoupling local and global coveragestrategies. We describe in detail the coverage planning algorithms for the robot and the virtual robot, specifically the calibration, estimation, and control processes. For the particular case of the virtual robot operating along the boundary, we introduce a method of simultaneous coverage and calibration. For robots with boundary sensors that trigger when entering or leaving the free space, like the ones we consider, we show that it is possible to estimate the robot odometric parameters based on the difference in time between boundary crossings. Through an analysis of observability, we design a sequence of switchback trajectories that produce robust parameter estimations.

40|$|In {{anisotropic}} media, several parameters {{govern the}} propagation of the compressional waves. To correctly invert surface recorded seismic data in anisotropic media, a multi-parameter inversion is required. However, a tradeoff between parameters exists because several models can explain the same dataset. To understand these tradeoffs, diffraction/reflection and transmission-type sensitivity-kernels analyses are carried out. Such analyses can help us to choose the appropriate parameterization for inversion. In tomography, the sensitivity kernels represent {{the effect of a}} parameter along the <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> between a source and a receiver. At a given illumination angle, similarities between sensitivity kernels highlight the tradeoff between the parameters. To discuss the parameterization choice in the context of finite-frequency tomography, we compute the sensitivity kernels of the instantaneous traveltimes derived from the seismic data traces. We consider the transmission case with no encounter of an interface between a source and a receiver; with surface seismic data, this corresponds to a diving <b>wave</b> <b>path.</b> We also consider the diffraction/reflection case when the <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> is formed by two parts: one from the source to a sub-surface point and the other from the sub-surface point to the receiver. We illustrate the different parameter sensitivities for an acoustic transversely isotropic medium with a vertical axis of symmetry. The sensitivity kernels depend on the parameterization choice. By comparing different parameterizations, we explain why the parameterization with the normal moveout velocity, the anellipitic parameter η, and the δ parameter is attractive when we invert diving and reflected events recorded in an active surface seismic experiment. © 2016 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} seismological method {{to probe the}} solar {{atmosphere}} above sunspot umbrae with three-minute oscillations. Our technique allows us to estimate both the vertical distance between atmospheric layers and the wave-propagation speed without specifying any extra parameters, in particular, the phase speed of the wave or the emission formation heights. Our method uses the projected <b>wave</b> <b>paths</b> of slow MHD waves propagating through the atmospheric layers of different heights and guided by the magnetic field. The length of the projected <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> depends upon {{the distance between the}} layers and the inclination angle of the magnetic field with respect to the line of sight, allowing us to estimate the distance between the layers from measured projected <b>wave</b> <b>paths</b> and the local magnetic-field vector. In turn, the wave-propagation delay registered at different heights allows for the calculation of the phase speed. We estimated the vertical distance between the emission layers at the temperature minimum (1600 Å) and transition region (304 Å), as well as the average phase speed above the sunspot umbrae, for three active regions. We found that the distance between the 1600 Å emission layer and the transition region above the sunspot umbrae lies in the range of 500 [...] 800 km. The average phase speed between these layers was found to be about 30 km/s giving the sound speed of 6 km/s. The temperature between the layers has been roughly estimated as 3000 K and corresponds to the region of the temperature minimum. The results obtained are consistent with the semiempirical model of the sunspot umbrae atmosphere by Fontenla, 2009. The manuscript has been accepted for publication in Solar Physics journal...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{designing}} transformation electromagnetics devices using tensor impedance surfaces (TISs) is presented. The method is first applied to idealized tensor impedance boundary conditions (TIBCs), {{and later to}} printed-circuit tensor impedance surfaces (PCTISs). A PCTIS is a practical realization of a TIBC. It consists of a tensor impedance sheet, which models a subwavelength patterned metallic cladding, over a grounded dielectric substrate. The method outlined in this paper allows anisotropic TIBCs and PCTISs to be designed that support <b>tangential</b> <b>wave</b> vector distributions and power flow directions specified by a coordinate transformation. As an example, beamshifting devices are designed, using TIBCs and PCTISs, that allow a surface wave to be shifted laterally.

40|$|In {{acoustic}} emission analysis, common source location algorithms assume, {{independently of}} the nature of the propagation medium, a straight (shortest) <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> between the source and the sensors. For heterogeneous media such as concrete, the wave travels in complex paths due to the interaction with the dissimilar material contents and with the possible geometrical and material irregularities present in these media. For instance, cracks and large air voids present in concrete influence significantly the way the wave travels, by causing <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> deviations. Neglecting these deviations by assuming straight paths can introduce significant errors to the source location results. In this paper, a novel source localization method called FastWay is proposed. It accounts, contrary to most available shortest path-based methods, for the different effects of material discontinuities (cracks and voids). FastWay, based on a heterogeneous velocity model, uses the fastest rather than the shortest travel paths between the source and each sensor. The method was evaluated both numerically and experimentally and the results from both evaluation tests show that, in general, FastWay was able to locate sources of acoustic emissions more accurately and reliably than the traditional source localization methods...|$|R
40|$|Stochastic {{modeling}} is {{an essential}} tool for studying statistical properties of wireless channels. In multipath fading channel (MFC) models, the signal reception is modeled by a sum of <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> contributions, and Clarke's model is an important example of such which has been widely accepted in many wireless applications. However, since Clarke's model is temporally deterministic, Feng and Field noted {{that it does not}} model real wireless channels with time-varying randomness well. Here, we extend Clarke's model to a novel time-varying stochastic MFC model with scatterers randomly flipping on and off. Statistical properties of the MFC model are analyzed and shown to fit well with real signal measurements, and a limit Gaussian process is derived from the model when the number of active <b>wave</b> <b>paths</b> tends to infinity. A second focus of this work is a comparison study of the error and computational cost of generating signal realizations from the MFC model and from its limit Gaussian process. By rigorous analysis and numerical studies, we show that in many settings, signal realizations are generated more efficiently by Gaussian process algorithms than by the MFC model's algorithm.

40|$|A new optical {{state is}} {{described}} both analytically and numerically at {{the boundary of}} a chiral medium with continuous helical symmetry of the dielectric tensor. The <b>tangential</b> <b>wave</b> number {{is assumed to be}} zero. The state appears to be localized near the boundary. It does not transfer energy along this boundary and falls off exponentially with the distance from the boundary. The field penetration into chiral medium is blocked at wavelengths close to the helical pitch and corresponding to the photonic band gap. The polarization of light near the boundary has the same sign of chirality as the helical medium. It is shown that the homogeneous environment, or the substrate must exhibit the anisotropic metallic reflection. Spectral manifestation of the state is determined by the angle between the optical axes at the interface.

The HLLC solver, originally developed by Toro, Spruce and Spears, generalizes the algorithm {{described in a}} previous paper (Mignone & Bodo 2004) to the case where magnetic fields are present. The solution to the Riemann problem is approximated by two constant states bounded by two fast shocks and separated by a <b>tangential</b> <b>wave.</b> The scheme is Jacobian-free, {{in the sense that}} it avoids the expensive characteristic decomposition of the RMHD equations and it improves over the HLL scheme by restoring the missing contact wave.

The resulting numerical scheme is simple to implement, efficient and suitable for a general equation of state.

We take the <b>wave</b> <b>path</b> from the Japanese LF transmitter (frequency= 40 kHz) and an observing station of Kochi (<b>wave</b> <b>path</b> length of 770 km), and a much longer period (of five years) than before, is considered. This subionospheric LF propagation can be called "an integrated measurement" in the sense that any earthquakes in the LF sensitive area just around the great-circle path can influence the observed LF signals, so that we define the "effective magnitude" (Meff) by integrating the total energy from different earthquakes in the sensitive area on a current day and by converting it back into magnitude. A superimposed epoch analysis for the effective magnitude greater than 6. 0 has yielded that the ionosphere is definitely disturbed in terms of both amplitude and dispersion, and that these perturbations tend to take place prior to an earthquake. The statistical z-test has also been performed, which has indicated that the amplitude is definitely depleted 2 – 6 days before the earthquake day and also that the dispersion is very much enhanced during the same period.
