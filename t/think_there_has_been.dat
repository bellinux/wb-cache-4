2500|$|On 11 May 2016, he {{was cleared}} of the charges. The {{integrity}} of the laboratory that tested the sample was brought into question, with the ICC hiring an independent expert {{to find that the}} lab's outcome was not sustainable. Perera [...] had spent some of his own money on fighting the charges, including travelling to the UK to undergo further tests to clear his name. After being cleared, Perera said that [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> much damage done to my reputation", after the media, fans and Sri Lankan Cricket Board stood by him. On July 6, ICC has agreed to support Sri Lanka Cricket and Kusal Perera's claim for costs and damages from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).|$|E

6000|$|... 'We {{are very}} proud of him,' said Mrs. Edmonstone, smiling. 'I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an hour's anxiety about him since he was born.' ...|$|E
60|$|You <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cases {{within the}} last few years in which persons, in your judgment, not {{entitled}} to that distinction <b>have</b> nevertheless <b>been</b> elected?--Certainly.|$|R

6000|$|... 'My dear,' exclaimed Albinia, 'what can it signify? They {{are only}} a very good joke. I did not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> so much {{imagination}} in Bayford.' And off she went laughing again.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} stranger, who was, of course, Mistah Mocker the Mockingbird. [...] "I haven't seen any one here, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> any one here but myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} you have had no one to care for," [...] he answered. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no one to care for you in the way you wanted--but those days are over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{have been}} a few {{stopping}} off and on here, or taking rooms in the village," [...] the landlord answered; [...] "but I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> any one fishing on the stream for the last few days." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{think the}} fun part comes with coming up with ideas and characters. The hardest part for me is still {{learning}} how to draw well. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> any easy parts of designing for me.|$|R
6000|$|He {{wished the}} details of the {{incident}} to remain vague. He wished his friends to <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> some mistake, that Mr. Harford and he had missed each other. His friends, who knew quite well Mr. Harford's manners in drinking were silent. Mr. Power said again: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{an early}} marriage. He went {{home as soon as}} he had {{sufficient}} salary, married her, and brought her out. She was a brilliant dark beauty, who became quickly a motherly, housewifely, common-place person--I should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a poet's love, never awakened from.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes them}} disgusting. I should {{be afraid of}} some of the malaria {{clinging}} to them. And just <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a dead body lying across that ugly thing! I never thought of that before. There! I declare I cannot eat another mouthful of dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{there is}} so great a misfortune there must {{generally}} have been a fault. But I do not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> any here. Do not misunderstand me, dear. The misfortune is not with me. I {{do not know that}} the Lord could have sent me a greater blessing than to have been loved by you,--were it not that your trouble, your grief, your complainings rob me of my joy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have failed}} to {{discover}} any motive at all for Reginald Wilmore's disappearance," [...] Francis admitted, [...] "nor have I at any time been able to connect you with it. Mr. Shopland's efforts, however, although he has not seen well to take me into his entire confidence, have my warmest approval and sympathy. Although I have accepted your very generous hospitality, Sir Timothy, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no misunderstanding between us on this matter." ...|$|E
5000|$|In March 1988, Paul Fox {{left the}} company to join the BBC, after {{spending}} 15 years as Yorkshire managing director. A month later, Paul Mckess resigned. A member of staff said [...] "It comes {{as a surprise to}} us, but we don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a row or anything like that". Clive Leach became managing director.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot guess," [...] {{answered}} De Bracy, [...] "nor did I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{within the}} four seas that girth Britain a champion that could bear down these five knights in one day's jousting. By my faith, I shall {{never forget the}} force with which he shocked De Vipont. The poor Hospitaller was hurled from his saddle like a stone from a sling." ...|$|R
2500|$|Chomsky is very {{critical}} of this empirical theory of language acquisition. He has said, [...] "It's true there's {{been a lot of}} work on trying to apply statistical models to various linguistic problems. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> some successes, but a lot of failures." [...] He claims the idea of using statistical methods to acquire language is simply a mimicry of the process, rather than a true understanding of how language is acquired.|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{all been}} the old Duke's doing," [...] said Rattler, [...] "and {{no doubt it}} was {{intended}} for the best; but the thing has been a failure {{from the beginning to}} the end. I knew it would be so. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a single man who has understood what a Ministerial Coalition really means except you and I. From the very beginning all your men were averse to it in spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{the baggage}} should {{all have been}} left at Panwell and, in that case, the force could have entered Poona three days after landing, instead of delaying from the 25th of November until today, the 7th of January; and even now, at their present rate of advance, they may be another {{fortnight}} before they arrive at Poona. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> so disgraceful a business since we first put foot in India.|$|E
6000|$|... "Na, na," [...] said Moniplies, {{keeping his}} ground firmly, [...] "if {{he likes to}} strike a lad that has {{followed}} him for pure love, for I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> little servant's fee between us, a' the way frae Scotland, just let my lord be doing, and see the credit he will get by it--and I would rather (mony thanks to you though, Master George) stand by a lick of his baton, than it suld e'er be said a stranger came between us." ...|$|E
5000|$|.....I think surgery has {{no place}} except maybe in some {{extraordinary}} condition, I don't think we know enough about lobotomy to say with perfect certainty. In the department as a whole, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> any in the 20 years I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here. Shock treatment may have some value in acute disturbances where the patient is apt to injure himself and nobody can make contact, {{but this is a}} rare occurrence." [...] (Lidz, 1971) ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that Cornell was going to take over writing New Excalibur, another series with close links to MI: 13, but, over time, the project morphed into a new series. Cornell explained, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so many Excaliburs lately that Nick [...] just wanted to underline that this is a fresh start. And it shows that we have a purpose firmly in mind. And it spotlights Cap, which is fine by me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Morva’s defense {{attorney}} requested {{a change of}} the trial location for Morva’s original robbery charges. The trial was {{to be held at}} Montgomery County Circuit Court, but Morva's attorneys argued {{it would be impossible to}} find an impartial jury in Montgomery County due to the publicity Morva received since his escape and the subsequent murders. Morva's attorney is quoted as saying, “I don’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> (<b>have)</b> <b>been</b> this many cases that have gotten nearly as much attention.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] sighed Anne, [...] "we shall, indeed, {{be known}} {{to be related to}} them!" [...] then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added, [...] "I {{certainly}} do <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance. I suppose" [...] (smiling) [...] "I have more pride than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them." ...|$|E
60|$|Just a line {{or two to}} say I am {{suddenly}} called away to bury my sick mother. When that is off my mind I'll {{write you}} what I know about the Hegira, the Flight into Egypt, the Retreat of the Ten Thousand, and whatever else {{you would like to}} learn. There is nothing mean about me! I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> any wilful desertion. You may engage an editor for, say, fifty years, with the privilege of keeping him regularly, if, {{at the end of that}} time, I should break my neck hastening back.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the band}} struck up [...] "The Roast Beef of Old England," [...] the two {{went out into}} the verandah, and Bremmil began looking for his wife's dandy (this was before 'rickshaw days) while she went into the cloak-room. Mrs. Hauksbee came up and said: [...] "You take me in to supper, I think, Mr. Bremmil." [...] Bremmil turned red and looked foolish. [...] "Ah--h'm! I'm going home with my wife, Mrs. Hauksbee. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a little mistake." [...] Being a man, he spoke as though Mrs. Hauksbee were entirely responsible.|$|E
5000|$|Celebrated {{songwriter}} Jerry Leiber said: [...] "The Beatles {{are second}} to none in all departments. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> ever <b>been</b> a better song written than 'Eleanor Rigby'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I haven't {{been in the}} trenches, of course," [...] he replied, [...] "but I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{much more}} noise than there was." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} book Lionel Shriver said [...] "I {{wanted to write a}} dystopic novel set in the very near future. But that's an {{established}} form and I needed to make my project distinctive. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a lot of novels written about the dystopic economic future. Having, like the rest of us, gone through the whole 2008 financial debacle I thought I had plenty of material. My reading on what happened in 2008 is that we dodged a bullet. I feel as if that bullet is still whizzing around the planet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! my dear namesake," [...] rejoined Tom, {{shaking his}} head, mournfully; [...] "you cannot know my beloved uncle's {{constitution}} and feelings {{as well as}} I! Rely on it, the medical men are right; and your hopes deceive you. The sending for Mrs. Dutton and Miss Mildred, both of whom my honoured uncle respects and esteems, looks more like leave-taking than any thing else; and, as to Sir Reginald Wychecombe,--though a relative, beyond a question,--I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> some mistake in sending for him; since he is barely an acquaintance of the elder branch of the family, and he is of the half-blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "H'm. Well--She {{impressed}} me {{as having the}} air of a girl who has had to solve many problems for which the normal mother provides ready made solutions. That is how I inferred that there was no mother. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> any stepmother, either friendly or hostile? There hasn't been. I thought not. She has had various governesses and companions, ladies of birth and education, engaged to look after her and she has done exactly what she liked with them. Her manner with Miss Seyffert, an excellent manner for Miss Seyffert, by the bye, isn't the sort of manner anyone acquires in a day. Or for one person only. She is a very sure and commanding young woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> any {{very great}} descent," [...] she went on. [...] "You {{must try to}} realize that those men are not wastrels now, however they may have lived in England, Montreal, or the cities down Puget Sound. They're rending new roads through the {{mountains}} to let in progress and civilization, and making fast {{the foundations of the}} future greatness of a wide and prosperous land. Already, because of what they and their kind have done, you can travel through it without seeing a ragged, slatternly woman, or a broken-down, desperate man. Besides, many of them, and certainly most of the small bush ranchers, lead lives characterized by the old heroic virtues that seem to have gone out of fashion in the cities, though you'll find some of them held up for emulation in the Pauline epistles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s {{a perfect}} nuisance. We have just dismounted. I {{will have to}} lunch as I am. A lifelong habit of {{beginning}} her day on horseback. She pretends she is unwell unless she does. I daresay, when one <b>thinks</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> hardly a day {{for five or six}} years that she didn’t begin with a ride. That’s the reason she is always rushing away from Paris where she can’t go out in the morning alone. Here, of course, it’s different. And as I, too, am a stranger here I can go out with her. Not that I particularly care to do it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He and I <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> some {{mistake about}} that. You {{suggested}} the appointment to him, {{and he felt}} unwilling to raise an objection without giving the matter very mature consideration. You can understand that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Hugo {{listened with}} his good-humored {{smile as he}} took {{a cup of tea}} from his wife, and then said, [...] "Well, you know, a Liberal is bound to <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> singers since Catalani's time." ...|$|R
