500|$|Gail {{tries to}} use the fact that Kylie gave Max up against her. Lane {{revealed}} {{that it did not}} work because Kylie revealed her past hardships and gained sympathy from David. The scenes also offered viewers the chance to gain a better perspective on who Kylie is and learn about her past. The night before their wedding, Gail unsuccessfully tries to pay Kylie one thousand pounds to leave for good. Lane said that Kylie had the audacity to come back after [...] "£25K for Max" [...] so [...] "£1000 to give up a salon and someone she loves is nothing", though she still keeps the money. Up until this point Kylie had been [...] "playing the game with Gail", but she was not on [...] "Kylie's radar". Kylie then realises how determined Gail is to ruin her wedding. Lane said [...] "Gail has taken a pretty intense disliking to Kylie, so of course Kylie is going to fight her corner—that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> she is." ...|$|E
500|$|USA Today writer Steve Jones {{named it}} one of the {{standout}} tracks of the album and commented that [...] "she seems most at ease when she's playing the teasing tart". Talia Kraines of the BBC commented that Spears needed more songs like [...] "Womanizer", saying [...] "Britney 2.0 needs to be full of wild dancefloor driven moves". Simon Price of The Independent commented the song borrows its electronic sound from Goldfrapp. Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times complimented Spears' delivery and the lyrics, saying the song is [...] "about <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> power that's focused on besting one obnoxious man, is also [...] and contemporary at the same time– more feminism as individualism". Mike Newmark of PopMatters called the song [...] " [...] a meaty, high-voltage shuffler helmed by the Outsyders, who do an admirable job of recreating the chemistry of Spears and Danja on last year’s single 'Gimme More'".|$|E
500|$|Early in the tour, Vicious {{wandered off}} from his Holiday Inn in Memphis, Tennessee, looking for drugs. He {{was found in a}} {{hospital}} with the words [...] "Gimme a fix" [...] on his chest; he had written them with a marker pen. During a concert in San Antonio, Texas, Vicious called the crowd [...] "a bunch of faggots", before striking an audience member across the head with his bass guitar. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he received simulated oral sex on stage, later declaring [...] "that's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> I like". Suffering from heroin withdrawal during a show in Dallas, Texas, he spat blood at a woman who had climbed onstage and punched him in the face. He was admitted to hospital later that night to treat various injuries. Offstage he is said to have kicked a female photographer, attacked a security guard, and eventually challenged one of his own bodyguards to a fight—beaten up, he is reported to have exclaimed, [...] "I like you. Now we can be friends." ...|$|E

[...] Bernadette Davis has said: [...] "As far as I know, there aren't any other comedies about <b>girls</b> <b>of</b> this age.

500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
500|$|Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News praised Kim Possible as [...] "an {{entertaining}} {{show that}} should indeed appeal to tweens, younger kids {{and even their}} parents" [...] that [...] "plays with the superhero format {{in a way that}} doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't play down to the viewers." [...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need to watch tv (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{opens with}} the track [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] {{and the track}} has been {{compared}} to artists M.I.A., Daphne & Celeste and The Ting Tings, featuring a [...] "breakdown section" [...] where Roberts raps as well as singing traditional vocals. The second track, [...] "Lucky Day", is a dance-pop song and has gathered comparisons to artists Katy Perry and David Guetta. The 1960s style track lyrically talks about falling in love, with Roberts explaining [...] "The song is about a boy not playing along but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts' voice {{has been described as a}} [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. The next track, [...] "Yo-Yo", {{has been compared to}} the sound of Kate Bush and described as [...] "wistful", featuring the lyrics [...] "I'm <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> who likes to dream a lot". It opens with an 808 kick drum, and the track [...] "thumps to a dramatic, 50's girlpop pastiche". The [...] "unhinged" [...] choruses featuring explicit words, lyrics such as [...] "Don’t want to be the last to know-oh oh oh", and during the middle-eight of the track the 1950s theme [...] "completely goes out the window" [...] for a classic club mix featuring a drum machine. [...] "Cinderella's Eyes", the fourth track, has been compared to past tracks by Girls Aloud, with a [...] "slomo disco" [...] style where Roberts performs falsetto, suggesting a Kate Bush influence. [...] "Porcelain Heart" [...] is the fifth track, featuring an [...] "eerie twinkle of descending notes". The track has been described as [...] "Italo-disco" [...] with a [...] "single-minded pulse", with Roberts shouting the word [...] "Heart" [...] before the track breaks into a synth section.|$|E

The fears would come quickly when Annie Watson (Jaime Pressly), {{who grew up}} in an ultra-strict conservative family, begins to notice that she has allowed her daughter Sophie (Kristi Lauren) to do what she wants to do, which she takes advantage of by embarrassing and mocking her mother, while best friend Nikki Miller (Katie Finneran), who grew up unpopular and overweight and has reinvented herself as a Southern Belle, begins to notice how manipulative her daughter Mackenzie (Aisha Dee) has become. Even the ex-husbands are not very good fathers: Annie's ex Matt is too clueless, prompting his lawyer brother Jack (Kevin Rahm) to step in (and become an object of Annie's crush) while Nikki's ex Gary is letting their complicated relationship become more complicated in the parenting department. These situations are among the major challenges Annie and Nikki must face to keep the daughters from turning into the people they were afraid of when they were their daughters' age.|$|R

40|$|I {{am going}} to look into Greek Life sororities on campus at the University of Illinois. I will be looking into if Middle Eastern or Muslim women can {{participate}} in Greek life, {{and to what extent}} she will be looked into when joining a sorority and not be stereotyped as what most Americans think of when they see a young girl wearing a hijab. I will be researching and interviewing what the stereotypes of the Greek system are and where they come from. In addition, I will uncover what stereotypes are associated with sororities: blue eyes, blonde hair, etc. Also, I will see if the individual sororities have stereotypes for <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> they want or do not want, or if Muslim girls do not want to join because they think sororities have these stereotypes. I will investigate if there is a pressure to look a certain way when one joins a sorority, even if the pressure seems to be implicit. In addition to interviewing Muslim girls, Middle Eastern girls, and non-Muslim girls, I will conduct research on statistics that are associated with race and religion in sororities on campus. I will be looking into the sororities' ideals and their priorities, which include philanthropy, service hours, study hours, and social life. Moreover, I will research IFC, UGC, BGC and Pan-Hellenic sororities; this includes all 37 houses on campus, with a majority of them being Pan-Hellenic (19). I will observe other sororities which can be seen as more academic and investigate the reasons as to why or why not Muslims and Middle Eastern girls might be more attracted to these types of sororities...|$|R
