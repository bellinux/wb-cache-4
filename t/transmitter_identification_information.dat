In addition, the autocorrelation result of the actual sampled PRS signal can be considered as the sum of two components. One component is the sum of the autocorrelation results of the original PRS signal and the delayed signal, and the other is the cross-correlation result of the original PRS signal and the delayed signal. Here, the received signal strength and the <b>transmitter</b> <b>identification</b> <b>information</b> (TII) for the received T-DMB signals can be used to determine the earliest signal to the mobile user.|$|E
