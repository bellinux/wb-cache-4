25|$|The Gemara related {{another story}} of Mar Ukba's charity. A poor man lived in Mar Ukba's {{neighborhood}} {{to whom he}} regularly sent 400 zuz {{on the eve of}} every Yom Kippur. Once Mar Ukba sent his son to deliver the 400 zuz. His son came back and reported that <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> did not need Mar Ukba's help. When Mar Ukba asked his son what he had seen, his son replied that they were sprinkling aged wine before <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> to improve the aroma in the room. Mar Ukba said that if <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> was that delicate, then Mar Ukba would double the amount of his gift and send it back to <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hardy's first novel, <b>The</b> <b>Poor</b> <b>Man</b> and the Lady, {{finished}} by 1867, {{failed to find}} a publisher. He then showed it to his mentor and friend, the Victorian poet and novelist, George Meredith, who felt that <b>The</b> <b>Poor</b> <b>Man</b> and the Lady would be too politically controversial and might damage Hardy's ability to publish in the future. So Hardy followed his advice {{and he did not}} try further to publish it. He subsequently destroyed the manuscript, but used some of the ideas in his later work.|$|E

25|$|A special miracle recounted by Fr. Romano to Fr. Diego de la Torre, {{who added}} {{that there were many}} {{witnesses}} to this prodigy. During Holy Week of 1739, a native from Piat was crossing the river beside the Ermita when he was caught by a crocodile. Placed in this situation, he invoked Our Lady of Piat, and was immediately free of the animal's jaws. <b>The</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man,</b> shaking violently, went to the Ermita to thank Our Lady.|$|E

60|$|In one word, {{while the}} spirit of the world thinks of itself, and helps itself, Charity, which is the Spirit of God, thinks of other people, and helps other people. And now:--to be always {{thinking}} of other people's feelings, and always caring for other people's comfort, what is that but the mark, and the only mark, of a true gentleman, and a true lady? There is none other, my friends, and there never will be. But <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>man</b> or woman can do that; <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>man</b> or woman can be courteous and tender, careful not to pain people, ready and willing to help every one {{to the best of their}} power; and therefore, <b>the</b> <b>poorest</b> <b>man</b> or woman can be a true gentleman or a true lady in the sight of God, by the inspiration of the Spirit of God, whose name is Charity.|$|R

500|$|Gasaway {{disagreed}} {{that the}} Whigs deceived the voters, [...] "The 'fable' of 1840 {{tells us that}} the Whigs triumphed over baffled and listless Democrats by convincing voters that Harrison lived in a log cabin and that he was a great war hero when, so the legend goes, neither claim was true. [...] Whigs did not say that Harrison lived in a log cabin and in fact went into great detail describing his actual house. The 'log cabin' was much more symbol than claim." [...] Gasaway suggested that the 1840 campaign gained a poor reputation because Harrison and the Whig Party soon vanished from the scene, and many of those who had supported both in 1840 saw the election as a squandered opportunity: [...] "Add to this the fact that <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> died only thirty days into an administration launched by what was perhaps the most exciting election campaign in the nation's history up to that time and we are confronted... with an undeniable and almost irresistible touch of opera bouffé." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara related a {{story about}} how to give to the poor. A poor man lived in Mar Ukba's {{neighbor}}hood, and every day Mar Ukba would put four zuz into the poor man's door socket. One day, <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> thought that he would try to find out who did him this kindness. That day Mar Ukba came home from the house of study with his wife. When <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> saw them moving the door to make their donation, <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> went to greet them, but they fled and ran into a furnace from which the fire had just been swept. They did so because, as Mar Zutra bar Tobiah said in the name of Rav (or others say Rav Huna bar Bizna said in the name of Rabbi Simeon the Pious, and still others say Rabbi Johanan said in the name of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai), it is better for a person to go into a fiery furnace than to shame a neighbor publicly. One can derive this from [...] where Tamar, who was subject to being burned for the adultery with which Judah had charged her, rather than publicly shame Judah with the facts of his complicity, sent Judah's possessions to him with the message, [...] "By the man whose these are am I with child." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maududi opposed {{any and all}} {{interest}} on loans as unIslamic riba.

60|$|Seen {{through this}} clear atmosphere, {{the works of}} the farmer, his {{ploughing}} and reaping, had a beauty to our eyes which he never saw.

50|$|The Porto surname {{history has}} {{its origins in}} the Piemonte region of what is today Italy and parts of present-day Southern France.

2500|$|And {{yet what}} is said {{is one of the}} {{permanent}} truths; it is only in degree that any improvement of society could prevent wastage of human powers; the waste even in a fortunate life, the isolation even of a life rich in intimacy, cannot but be felt deeply, and is the central feeling of tragedy. And anything of value must accept this because it must not prostitute itself; its strength is to be prepared to waste itself, if it does not get its opportunity. A statement of this is certainly non-political because it is true in any society, and yet nearly all the great poetic statements of it are in a way [...] "bourgeois", like this one; they suggest to readers, though they do not say, that for <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> things cannot be improved even in degree.|$|E
2500|$|The Asquiths finally vacated 10 Downing Street on 9 December. Asquith, not {{normally}} given to displays of emotion, confided {{to his wife}} that {{he felt he had}} been stabbed. He likened himself (10 December) to the Biblical character Job, although he also commented that Aristide Briand's government was also under strain in France. Lord Newton wrote in his diary of meeting Asquith at dinner {{a few days after the}} fall; [...] "It became painfully evident that he was suffering from an incipient nervous breakdown and before leaving <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> completely collapsed." [...] Asquith was particularly appalled at Balfour's behaviour, especially as he had argued against Lloyd George to retain Balfour at the Admiralty. Writing years later, Margot's spleen was still evident; [...] "between you and me, this is what hurt my husband more than anything else. That Lloyd George (a Welshman!) should betray him, he dimly did understand, but that Arthur should join his enemy and help to ruin him, he never understood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Perrotta {{characterizes the}} {{attitude}} of the Jews as expressed in the Old Testament scriptures as being [...] "completely different from the classical view." [...] He points out that servile and hired work was not scorned by the Jews of the Old Testament as it was by Greco-Roman thinkers. [...] Instead, such work was protected by biblical commandments to pay workers on time and not to cheat them. [...] The poor were protected from being exploited when in debt. [...] Perrotta asserts that the goal of these commandments was [...] "not only to protect the poor but also to prevent the excessive accumulation of wealth in a few hands." [...] In essence, <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>man</b> is [...] "protected by God". [...] However, Perrotta points out that poverty is not admired nor is it considered a positive value by the writers of the Old Testament. [...] The poor are protected because the weak should be protected from exploitation.|$|E
