500|$|There are {{two types}} of costumed shows used by Chuck E. Cheese's: the LIVE! show and the Road show. The LIVE! show is {{performed}} {{at the front of the}} stage in the showroom, whenever a child is celebrating a birthday. The live show is a way of pumping up the crowd before a customized rendition of [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] is sung to the child that is celebrating the birthday ("I say Happy, you say Birthday..."). A costumed Chuck E. Cheese dances with the guests and sings, while being accompanied by the cast members. The Road show is a performance by a costumed Chuck E. Cheese character, and is performed outside the normal showroom. Children are gathered via the public announcement system or by Chuck E. Cheese himself. Chuck E. Cheese wants the kids to dance in order to win free tickets. The free tickets are thrown at the end of the performance for all <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>that</b> participated. Chuck E. comes out every hour on the half hour (12:30, 1:30, etc.). The songs Chuck E. and the kids dance to are usually well-known classic songs such as [...] "If You're Happy and You Know It" [...] and [...] "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes".|$|E
500|$|Peter, truly {{believing the}} anti-sex {{propaganda}} Meg brings home, starts wearing a chastity belt {{and refuses to}} have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in [...] "ear sex" [...] (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex [...] "in the eyes of the Lord." [...] This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>that</b> while they should not have sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only {{as long as it is}} practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with Cleveland poking out the window and saying the line [...] "Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!".|$|E

500|$|The 1960s {{setting of}} X-Men: First Class, technologically {{inspired}} by the James Bond films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they [...] "did a cool job representing the period, {{in a way it}} still felt muscular and action-oriented", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the [...] "badass, charming, ruthless and sweet" [...] personality. The director said his goal was to [...] "feel like a '60s Bond film, but {{with a little bit of}} reality it could be grounded in. I wanted there to be just a hint of this world of the mutants coming through. A mutant in this world having powers needed to be the equivalent of you or I sneezing, as normal as possible, at least until the humans start seeing it for the first time." [...] At the same time, Vaughn tried to do the [...] "bloody hard balancing" [...] of modern and antique to recreate the 1960s in way it was [...] "not so alien to <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>that</b> it looked like a period piece." [...] The director also tried to depict the era still in a realistic way, particularly [...] "that 60s misogynist vibe" [...] with women in skimpy suits, and McTaggert's reliability as a CIA agent being questioned.|$|E
500|$|It is {{revealed}} in [...] "The Italian Bob" [...] (season 17, 2005) that Bob has moved to Italy to make a fresh start. He is elected mayor of a village in Tuscany and marries a local woman named Francesca, {{with whom he has}} a son named Gino. The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for Mr. Burns, encounters him by chance. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they not reveal his felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds, alienating Bob from his citizens. He, his wife and son swear a vendetta on the Simpsons. The entire Terwilliger family returns in [...] "Funeral for a Fiend" [...] (season 19, 2007) in which Bob's father, Robert, and mother, Dame Judith Underdunk, make their first appearances. Bob fakes his own death and locks Bart in the coffin, which he attempts to cremate at the otherwise empty funeral home as all the Terwilligers laugh maniacally. They are foiled by Lisa {{and the rest of the}} Simpson family and sent to prison. Bob briefly returns in the season 20 episode [...] "Wedding for Disaster", when Bart and Lisa initially suspect Bob of kidnapping Homer to prevent him from attending his second wedding with Marge (due to a keychain they found had an 'S' and a 'B'), but Krusty provides him with an alibi, explaining to <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>that</b> Bob was with him the whole day. Eventually, Bob and the kids discover the true culprits, Patty and Selma.|$|E

Donnelly tells <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>that</b> his wife just died as well, and begins to weep. <b>The</b> <b>kid</b> again presses Donnelly with his [...] "deadly" [...] story of a cow with trapped wind. Donnelly capitulates, and <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> tells his 'true' story, which is so bizarre that Donnelly can't help but laugh. [...] "Best day of me fucking life - that cow exploding," [...] <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> concludes.|$|R

2500|$|At {{least one}} {{psychologist}} warned that Survive This risked being exploitative and might damage {{the mental health}} of the participants. [...] "You're putting kids into real emotional situations for other people's enjoyment," [...] said Jennifer Kolari, a child and family therapist and author. [...] "It's okay to have some competition, it's okay to try out for things," [...] she says. [...] "Those are okay lessons for kids. But doing it on national television, to be watched and judged, that's where I feel it's a little bit exploitive, and I think we need to consider {{the mental health of}} <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>that</b> are on that show." [...] But other mental health experts declared the show safe, concluding that the participants merely displayed strong competitiveness and that social ostracization was largely avoided.|$|E

I presume we're all agreed we won't be satisfied till we build up the biggest darn Sunday School in the whole state, so the Chatham Road Presbyterian won't have to take anything off anybody. Now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they've already used contesting teams, and given prizes to <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>that</b> bring in the most members. And they made a mistake there: the prizes were a lot of folderols and doodads like poetry books and illustrated Testaments, instead of something a real live kid would want to work for, like real cash or a speedometer for his motor cycle. Course I suppose it's all fine and dandy to illustrate the lessons with these decorated book-marks and blackboard drawings and so on, but when it comes down to real he-hustling, getting out and drumming up customers--or members, I mean, why, you got to make it worth a fellow's while.|$|E
