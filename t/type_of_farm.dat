5|$|Manitoba's economy {{relies heavily}} on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming occurs {{as far north as}} The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).|$|E
25|$|The Schapendoes descends from {{a general}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> and herding dog {{popular in the}} Drenthe {{province}} of the Netherlands, and the Veluwe, an area of forests and swampland. The dogs there had many names, and were not a specific breed as we use the term today. They were the local working dog, adapted to the people, environment, and types of work needed. They were exhibited in early dog shows (in the 1870s) as Domestic herding dog.|$|E
25|$|On the {{southern}} {{boundary of the}} Low German house region, {{as well as the}} multi-sided farmsteads, there is the historical Ernhaus <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm,</b> also referred to as the Middle German house (mitteldeutsches Haus) or Frankish farmstead (fränkisches Haus). A northern neighbour of the Fachhallenhaus in the immediate vicinity of the North Sea coast was the Gulf house (Gulfhaus) or Frisian farmstead (Ostfriesenhaus) which is found in the marsh regions and, later, also on the geest areas of West Flanders, Frisia as far as Schleswig-Holstein (known there as a Haubarg). It had replaced the Old Frisian farmhouse in the 16th century. Another northern neighbour in the Southern Schleswig area is the Geesthardenhaus, which also occurs in the whole of Jutland and hence is also called the Cimbrian farmhouse.|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, {{there are}} limited {{empirical}} evidences {{on this subject}} in the EU. Vrolijk and Poppe (2008) analysed a very large samples <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> based on several EU countries. This allows for comparison among countries and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> supporting the idea that farm income variability is generally high and that differences among countries and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> exist: more specialised and small farms are often faced with relatively higher income variability. Agrosynergie (2011) found that variability appears on average high in specialist granivore and specialist field crops farms, while low in mixed farms. Furthermore, variability is higher in small than in large <b>farms</b> in most <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> and across regions (Agrosynergie 2011).|$|R

40|$|All {{gradations}} {{in farming}} systems between cash grain production and large cattle feeding establishments {{are present in}} Cass and Otoe counties. Therefore, to facilitate {{a study of the}} various combinations, the farms are classified into <b>types.</b> Three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> grain, general, and livestock, have been arranged with arbitrary limits so that a reasonably representative sample falls within each group. A preliminary phase of the study attempts to compare three methods <b>of</b> determining <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms.</b> Another phase deals with the extent of grain, general, and livestock farming in this area by groups of years similar in price level and production. An analysis is made to try to identify any significant shifting in <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> between groups <b>of</b> years. The third objective is an attempt to determine what relationships exist between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> size <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> and labor incomes. Finally the study includes an analysis <b>of</b> specialized <b>farms</b> within <b>types,</b> that is, those farms characterized by relatively heavy production of cattle, hogs, corn, or wheat. The source of the data consists <b>of</b> 827 <b>farm</b> account records from Cass and Otoe counties. The data cover the 12 year period from 1928 to 1939, inclusive. Advisor: N/...|$|R
2500|$|The {{architectural}} historian Ronald Brunskill states that, {{although the}} British examples are older, the term [...] "bank barn" [...] is an imported term [...] "to describe a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farm</b> building {{which is so}} common {{in certain parts of}} Britain that it has developed no descriptive term of its own".|$|E

A special feature of the Low German house is its longitudinal division, {{also referred to as}} dreischiffige or [...] "triple-aisled". This is considerably different from all-in-one farmhouses elsewhere in Germany and Europe which are built with traditional transverse divisions, as in the Ernhaus, not to mention other common farm layouts where the farm comprises several buildings with different functions, usually around a farmyard.|$|E

40|$|Different {{agriculture}} {{models can}} be developed to deal with sustainability issues. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a new analytical framework allowing the identification of key agriculture models at the crossroads <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> systems, food systems and territorial (local) dynamics. The first dimension of this framework is based on the distinction between three key <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> systems: synthetic inputs-based, biological inputs-based and biodiversity-based. They are more or less dependent on exogenous inputs and ecosystem services. The second dimension is based on the identification of how each <b>of</b> these three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> system interacts with global food systems and territorial dynamics i. e. circular economy, local food systems and integrated landscape approaches. Our framework makes it possible to specify agriculture models corresponding to a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> system and to the nature and level of its interactions with its socio-economic context. Finally, in considering six key agriculture models we sketch out key associated scientific issues...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{micro-economic}} data of the Hungarian FADN system we analysed the role of subsidies in the profitability <b>of</b> <b>farms,</b> we aimed to reveal which <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> and economic sizes are effected more by subsidies related to efficiency and profitability. The agricultural enterprises' balance of taxes and subsidies counted from the micro-economic data of FADN enterprises was also analysed in the different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>farming</b> categories and economic size classes. Our aim was to find out what <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>farms</b> are subsidized and what types are net payers to the central budget. Examining the pre-tax profit we made the conclusion that with the increase of economic size not only the proportion <b>of</b> profitable <b>farms</b> rises, but the profit per size unit increases and the loss decreases. Analysing the effect of production based subsidies and interest subsidies on the pre-tax profit we made the conclusion that the sum of subsidies received from government per size unit is almost equal in all economic size classes. agricultural subsidies, profitability, payments of agricultural enterprises, FADN, Agricultural Finance, Q 12,...|$|R
