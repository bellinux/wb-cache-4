5000|$|Dry-aged beef is beef {{that has}} been hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks. After the animal is {{slaughtered}} and cleaned, it is hung as a full or half carcass. Primal (large distinct sections) or sub primal cuts, such as strip loins, rib eyes, and sirloin, are placed in a refrigerator unit, {{also known as a}} [...] "hot box". This process involves considerable expense, as the beef must be stored near freezing temperatures. Subprimal cuts can be dry aged on racks either in specially climate-controlled coolers or within a moisture-permeable drybag. Moreover, only the higher grades of meat can be dry aged, as the process requires meat with a large, evenly distributed fat content. Because of this, dry-aged beef is seldom available outside of steak restaurants and upscale butcher shops or groceries. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the <b>tenderization</b> of the meat texture.|$|E
40|$|Tenderness is {{the most}} {{important}} meat quality trait, which is determined by intracellular environment and extracellular matrix. Particularly, specific protein degradation and protein modification can disrupt the architecture and integrity of muscle cells so that improves the meat tenderness. Endogenous proteolytic systems are responsible for modifying proteinases as well as the meat <b>tenderization.</b> Abundant evidence has testified that calpains (CAPNs) including calpain I (CAPN 1) and calpastatin (CAST) have the closest relationship with tenderness in livestock. They are involved {{in a wide range of}} physiological processes including muscle growth and differentiation, pathological conditions and post-mortem meat aging. Whereas, Calpain 3 (CAPN 3) has been established as an important activating enzyme specifically expressed in livestock’s skeletal muscle, but its role in domestic animals meat <b>tenderization</b> remains controversial. In this review, we summarize the role of CAPN 1, calpain II (CAPN 2) and CAST in post-mortem meat <b>tenderization,</b> and analyse the relationship between CAPN 3 and tenderness in domestic animals.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine whether variation in the <b>tenderization</b> of lamb longissimus could be attributed to variations in the rise in free calcium postmortem and sarcomere lengthening post rigor. The longissimus muscle of 10 crossbred lambs (RomneyxCoopworth) was sampled at 1 and 7 days postmortem for determination of MIRINZ shear force, myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), sarcomere length, free calcium, and proteolysis of troponin-T. Despite considerable variation in tenderness and <b>tenderization</b> of the muscles, sarcomere lengthening was not observed. The concentration of free calcium at 7 days postmortem correlated significantly with the MFI (r= 0. 640; P< 0. 05) and tended to correlate with the shear force (r=− 0. 596; P< 0. 1) and degradation of troponin-T (r= 0. 625; P< 0. 1). Degradation of troponin-T was significantly correlated with <b>tenderization</b> (r= 0. 664; P< 0. 05). Troponin-T is a calpain substrate, but reportedly is not degraded through a direct effect from calcium. The present results, therefore, suggest that the variation in free calcium in postmortem muscle affects <b>tenderization</b> through an effect on the calpain system and not through a direct effect of calcium on myofibrillar proteins. Consequently, the results of this study do not support the (calcium) theory that calcium directly affects <b>tenderization...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In each of two trials per experiment, fillets were {{harvested}} from 40 broiler carcasses 10 min postmortem (Experiment 1) or after a 4 -h carcass aging period (Experiment 2). Fillets and carcasses were chilled either in tap water or a 5 % solution of sodium chloride and baked or deep fat fried. Chilling in brine increased solution uptake of both fillets and carcasses, decreased drip loss associated with fillet storage prior to cooking, decreased fillet cook loss, and increased chloride ion {{concentration of the}} cooked meat. <b>Tenderization</b> due to brine chilling was maximized by baking (lower shear force) and most apparent in hot-boned samples (Experiment 1). Deep fat frying tended to mask <b>tenderization</b> effects of brine chilling by producing its own <b>tenderization</b> effect, especially in samples that would normally exhibit relatively low shear force values (Experiment 2). The <b>tenderization</b> effect of brine chilling was not totally dependent on increased water-holding capacity associated with cooked meat moisture content, but also occurred even when {{no significant difference in}} moisture content was observed...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} the mechanism(s) of calcium- induced <b>tenderization</b> in calcium-enhanced beef muscle. At 72 hours postmortem, we injected (9 % by weight) beef strip loins (n= 15) with 0, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, or 0. 4 M calcium chloride (CaCl 2) {{with and without}} 0. 05 M zinc chloride (ZnCl 2), and they were then aged until 15 days postmortem. Warner- Bratzler shear force peak values indicated that addition of ZnCl 2 drastically inhibited tenderization; however, enhancement with CaCl 2 still tended to reduce shear values (P= 0. 07; 0. 55 kg) when ZnCl 2 was present. In the absence of ZnCl 2, the 0. 2 and 0. 4 M CaCl 2 treatments were 18. 9 and 32. 1 % more (P< 0. 05) tender than the no CaCl 2 treatment. These results suggest that both calcium-activated enzymatic activity and a non-enzymatic salting-in effect contributed to <b>tenderization</b> of calcium-enhanced muscle. However, the enzymatic mechanism reduced toughness 2. 9 to 7. 5 fold more than the non-enzymatic mechanism.

40|$|Steaks from {{cows are}} tougher {{than those from}} young steers and heifers.

Top sirloin butts were randomly assigned to five post-mortem aging periods (5, 19, 33, 47, and 61 days). One-half of each beef GM was randomly assigned to either a blade tenderized treatment or a non-blade tenderized treatment that was not blade tenderized. Steaks were then evaluated for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), metmyoglobin reducing activity (MRA), oxygen consumption rate (OCR), visual color panel, instrumental color, Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) enumeration, pH, and sensory properties. Aging × blade <b>tenderization</b> interactions (P < 0. 05) were found for display color panel, discoloration panel, WBSF, overall tenderness, myofibrillar tenderness, bloody/serumy, metallic, overall sweet, and bitter (P < 0. 05). As steaks were aged longer and blade tenderized they became more discolored during display and more tender. In addition, there were aging × display time interactions (P < 0. 05) observed for L*, a*, b*, display color panel, and discoloration panel. As steaks were aged longer, they had increased L*, a*, b*, and hue angle values and display color panel scores when initially put into a retail case, but L*, a* and b* decreased and discoloration scores increased as display time increased. Furthermore, there were blade <b>tenderization</b> × display time interactions (P < 0. 05) found for display and discoloration panels. Blade tenderized steaks discolored faster in retail display than non-blade tenderized steaks. With increased aging time, there was an increase (P < 0. 05) in TBARS, OCR, initial color panel, LAB enumeration, and warmed-over flavor, as well as a decrease in MRA. Also, as aging increased there was a decrease (P < 0. 05) in MRA, initial color panel scores, and WBSF values. Blade <b>tenderization</b> significantly increased (P < 0. 05) initial color panel scores, rancid flavor, and spoiled flavor. Increasing the aging time of the GM, produced steaks with decreased color stability, altered the flavor profile, and increased tenderness.
