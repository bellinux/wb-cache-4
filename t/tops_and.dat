The oldest pillar is undated, but experts say it is late Elizabethan. The second oldest was given by Bristol merchant Robert Kitchen, who died in 1594. The two remaining nails are dated 1625 and 1631.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations. They {{generally}} prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. American kestrels also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret <b>tops,</b> <b>and</b> six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the port side of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret <b>tops,</b> <b>and</b> six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E

5|$|There are 233 {{scheduled}} monuments in Mendip. These {{include a}} large number of bowl and round barrows and other neolithic, Bronze and Iron Age tumuli such as the Priddy Circles and Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. There are also several Iron Age hill forts on the hill <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> lake villages on the lowlands such as Meare and Glastonbury Lake Villages. The lake villages were often connected by timber trackways such as the Sweet Track. There are several Roman sites particularly around the Charterhouse Roman Town and its associated lead mining. Some later coal mining sites are also included in the list.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, Warren and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions. This is the taxonomically richest area for Banksia, with 19 species, of which six are endemic, including B.brownii itself. It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and <b>tops,</b> <b>and</b> in shale in gullies.|$|E
5|$|Brachychiton rupestris {{is found}} in central Queensland from {{latitude}} 22° S to 28° S, with the western limits of its range defined by the 500mm rainfall isohyet. It grows on the <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> slopes of hills or ridges in low hilly country, in clay, shale, or basalt soils. It is an emergent tree in forests dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), or ooline (Cadellia pentastylis). It is always present in the Central semi-evergreen vine thicket—also known as Bottletree Scrub—of the Brigalow Belt. Other common species include broad-leaved bottle tree (Brachychiton australis) and belah (Casuarina cristata). The bottle tree is replaced by the kurrajong in similar communities in New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|On December 15, 2010, SOPHIA the 3rd made an {{appearance}} in the Flash game Super Mario Bros. Crossover, in its Version1.2 release. In the game, the tank possesses all abilities from Blaster Master and is the first character in the game to have a limited supply of ammunition; players need to collect power-ups from enemies in order to fire homing missiles, which is necessary to defeat Buzzy Beetles, Spike <b>Tops,</b> <b>and</b> Bullet Bills. The version also allows SOPHIA to grapple onto ceilings. On December 21, 2012, the game was updated to include, among other skins, a skin that changes the level, enemy, and interface graphics to those based on Blaster Master. According to the game's designer, SOPHIA was planned {{to be in the}} game from the beginning along with Ryu Hayabusa and Luigi, although they were left out of the first release due to time.|$|E

Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|The early Archaic {{people living}} near Mesa Verde {{utilized}} the atlatl and harvested {{a wider variety}} of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa <b>tops,</b> <b>and</b> canyons, where they created rockshelters and rock art, and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.|$|E

5|$|Because the Supremes {{were popular}} with white {{audience}}s {{as well as}} with black ones, Gordy had the group cater to its middle American audience with performances at renowned supper clubs such as the Copacabana in New York. Broadway and pop standards were incorporated into their repertoire alongside their own hit songs. As a result, the Supremes {{became one of the first}} black musical acts to achieve complete and sustained crossover success. Black rock and roll musicians of the 1950s had seen many of their original hit tunes covered by white musicians, with these covers usually achieving more fame and sales success than the originals. The Supremes' success, however, counteracted this trend. Featuring three group members who were marketed for their individual personalities (a move unprecedented at the time) and Diana Ross's pop-friendly voice, the Supremes broke down racial barriers with rock and roll songs underpinned by R stylings. The group became extremely popular both domestically and abroad, becoming one of the first black musical acts to appear regularly on television programs such as Hullabaloo, The Hollywood Palace, The Della Reese Show, and, most notably, The Ed Sullivan Show, on which they made 17 appearances. The Supremes' cross-cultural success effectively paved the way for the mainstream success of contemporaneous label mates such as the Temptations, the Four <b>Tops</b> <b>and</b> the Jackson 5.|$|E
5|$|Steadily {{rising sea}} levels then further {{isolated}} this little island, which is entirely of volcanic origin. It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as columnar jointing. The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E
