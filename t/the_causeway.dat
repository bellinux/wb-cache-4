5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} <b>the</b> <b>Causeway</b> had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and <b>the</b> <b>Causeway</b> continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on <b>the</b> <b>Causeway</b> from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on <b>the</b> <b>Causeway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} a new bridge at The Narrows {{downstream}} from <b>the</b> <b>Causeway</b> in the aftermath of World War II were put on hold while a new Causeway could be constructed. Vehicle traffic using <b>the</b> <b>Causeway</b> had almost doubled between 1930 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) tint the water south of <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> a greenish color. North of <b>the</b> <b>causeway,</b> the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through <b>the</b> <b>causeway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Miami has {{six major}} causeways that span over Biscayne Bay {{connecting}} the western mainland, with the eastern barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean. <b>The</b> Rickenbacker <b>Causeway</b> is <b>the</b> southernmost <b>causeway</b> and connects Brickell to Virginia Key and Key Biscayne. <b>The</b> Venetian <b>Causeway</b> and MacArthur Causeway connect Downtown with South Beach. <b>The</b> Julia Tuttle <b>Causeway</b> connects Midtown and Miami Beach. <b>The</b> 79th Street <b>Causeway</b> connects <b>the</b> Upper East Side with North Beach. <b>The</b> northernmost <b>causeway,</b> <b>the</b> Broad <b>Causeway,</b> is <b>the</b> smallest of Miami's six causeways, and connects North Miami with Bal Harbour.|$|R
50|$|Also {{related to}} ring ditches, is <b>the</b> <b>causewayed</b> ring ditch, {{which is a}} roughly {{circular}} ditch with a central area and multiple causeways which cross it. <b>The</b> <b>causewayed</b> ring ditch is a subcategory of the ring ditch.|$|R

5|$|In Perth, a {{roundabout}} {{was constructed}} at the north-western end of Albany Highway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic onto and off <b>The</b> <b>Causeway.</b> It opened in 1952, with guides on the usage of the roundabout published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began to upgrade the intersection to a partial cloverleaf interchange at {{the eastern end of}} <b>The</b> <b>Causeway.</b> The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.|$|E

25|$|Tolled <b>causeways</b> include <b>the</b> Venetian <b>Causeway</b> (NE 15th Street) to Miami Beach, <b>the</b> Rickenbacker <b>Causeway</b> {{connecting}} Interstate 95 in Brickell to Key Biscayne, and <b>the</b> Broad <b>Causeway</b> connecting North Miami with Bay Harbor Islands and Bal Harbour.|$|R
2500|$|With his brigantines, Cortés {{could also}} send forces and {{supplies}} to areas he previously could not, which put a kink in Cuauhtémoc's plan. [...] To {{make it more}} difficult for the Spanish ships to aid the Spanish soldier's advance along <b>the</b> <b>causeways,</b> <b>the</b> Aztecs dug deep pits in shallow areas of the lakes, into which they hoped the Spaniards would stumble, and fixed concealed stakes into the lake bottom to impale the launches. [...] The Spanish horses were also ineffective on <b>the</b> <b>causeways.</b>|$|R
5|$|October 17–18, 1891 – A {{hurricane}} {{passes a}} short distance to the west with extremely high tides and pounding waves. <b>The</b> <b>Causeway</b> is extensively damaged.|$|E
5|$|Roundabouts were {{constructed}} {{at each end}} of <b>The</b> <b>Causeway,</b> to improve the flow of traffic on the bridges and the distribution of traffic back into the road network. The eastern roundabout opened in 1952, while the western one did not open until December 1954. Guides on the usage of the roundabouts were published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began on a grade-separated partial cloverleaf interchange at the eastern end of <b>the</b> <b>Causeway.</b> The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Attack on Pearl Harbor and {{the entry}} of the United States into World War II stopped all work on <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> and the {{development}} of Virginia Key. After the war, Crandon pushed on with the development project. He got financier Ed Ball to buy six million (U.S.) dollars worth of bonds financing construction of <b>the</b> <b>causeway.</b> <b>The</b> <b>causeway</b> was named for Eddie Rickenbacker, World War I flying ace, and {{founder and president of the}} Miami-based Eastern Air Lines. Starting in 1951, the Mackle Construction Company offered new homes on the island for US$9,540, with just US$500 down. A U.S. Post Office contract branch was opened, the Community Church started holding services, and the Key Biscayne Elementary School opened in 1952.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> West <b>Causeway</b> is 470 m {{long and}} 20 m wide, running west from a {{junction}} with <b>the</b> South <b>Causeway.</b> Its construction {{is very similar}} to that of <b>the</b> North <b>Causeway.</b> It joins <b>the</b> ceremonial core of the site to Group 2.|$|R
50|$|Phase I of the SSRS {{project is}} the {{construction}} of <b>the</b> Bako <b>Causeway,</b> <b>the</b> first <b>causeway</b> in Sarawak. <b>The</b> construction involved creating a rock-filled closure across Loba Santubong on Jalan Bako and was completed in August 1993.|$|R

5|$|The above {{explanations}} all place <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> {{within a}} Roman military context. An alternative, or perhaps secondary, usage for <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> in Roman times {{is suggested by}} landscape author Michael Dunn and others, who state {{that it may have}} been constructed for the transport of jet inland from Whitby. Hayes and Rutter are dismissive, stating that the value of jet mined in the Roman period would not have justified the expense of the causeway's construction.|$|E
5|$|A wetland reserve {{has been}} created at Heron's Green Pool on the {{opposite}} side of <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (Calamagrostis) and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.|$|E
5|$|Although brine shrimp can {{be found}} in the arm of the lake north of <b>the</b> <b>causeway,</b> studies {{conducted}} by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources indicate that these are likely transient. Populations of brine shrimp are mostly restricted to the lake's south arm.|$|E

5|$|From Verbrandesmis a road runs north-west, {{parallel}} with the lower Steenbeek through Merckem to Luyghem, slightly above {{the level of the}} surrounding marshes. Machine-guns nests in the villages, commanded <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> from Drei Grachten; the ground everywhere in the peninsula was soaked and dotted with large numbers of blockhouses and pillboxes. The French artillery destroyed Verbrandesmis and it was quickly captured but the German garrisons at Jesiutengoed Farm and Kloostermolen held out for some time, before being driven out and forced back to Kippe and Aschhoop. German artillery bombarded the banks of the Steenbeek in front of Merckem and French troops rushed across on pontoon bridges, struggled through the mud to the objectives and then attacked towards Kippe and Luyghem. Kippe and Aschhoop were captured quickly but the German garrisons at Luyghem and <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> from Drei Grachten, resisted until afternoon before being overwhelmed.|$|E
5|$|In The Warlord Chronicles (1995–97), Bernard Cornwell makes Portland the Isle of the Dead, a {{place of}} {{internal}} exile, where <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> was guarded to keep the 'dead' (people suffering insanity) from crossing the Fleet and returning to the mainland. No historical evidence exists to support this idea.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Giant's <b>Causeway</b> Tramway, {{operated}} by <b>the</b> Giant's <b>Causeway,</b> Portrush and Bush Valley Railway & Tramway Company Ltd, was a pioneering [...] narrow gauge electric railway operating between Portrush and <b>the</b> Giant's <b>Causeway</b> on <b>the</b> coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The line, 9+1/4 mi long, was hailed at its opening as “the first long electric tramway in the world”. <b>The</b> Giant's <b>Causeway</b> and Bushmills Railway today operates diesel and steam tourist trains over {{part of the}} Tramway’s former course.|$|R

500|$|Seibal is a {{medium-sized}} site. The site core {{is divided into}} three principal hilltop groups (Groups A, C and D) connected by causeways and covers a little over 1km². <b>The</b> <b>causeways</b> were faced with masonry and had parapets in places. CausewayI is <b>the</b> western <b>causeway,</b> CausewayII is <b>the</b> south <b>causeway</b> and CausewayIII is <b>the</b> eastern <b>causeway.</b> GroupD is a fortress refuge concealed above the river frontage. GroupB is a small complex located about [...] from the site core. GroupA is smaller than GroupD but has most of the sculptured monuments. Various small housemound groups lie beyond the site core. They are spaced between [...] apart, extending for several kilometers to the north, south and west.|$|R

5|$|The Maler Causeway runs {{north from}} behind Temple I to Group H. A large {{bas-relief}} is carved onto limestone bedrock upon {{the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>causeway</b> just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. <b>The</b> <b>causeway</b> steps up to the top of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of <b>the</b> <b>causeway.</b>|$|E
50|$|A new {{bridge over}} the Ventura River also opened in 1913 when <b>the</b> <b>causeways</b> were {{complete}} being forerunners to the impact automobiles would have in the 1920s.|$|R

2500|$|On the far {{bank was}} an area of marshy land that troops could not penetrate, which meant that all {{movement}} was limited to <b>the</b> <b>causeways</b> or dikes {{on the banks of}} the river Adige, and <b>the</b> <b>causeways</b> on <b>the</b> banks of a small tributary called the Alpone River that flowed into it from the north. The Alpone was only [...] wide and [...] deep. In the difficult terrain, the French soldiers might have an advantage. Further, the Austrians would not be able to use their superior numbers in the restricted battlefield.|$|R
