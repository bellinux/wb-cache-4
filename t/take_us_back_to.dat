They would <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a meaner time when money was the measure of all things. We stand for the future that was sought and won and which must now be defended and enhanced.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, Kennedy faced {{the first serious}} {{re-election}} challenge of his career. The younger, telegenic, and well-funded Romney ran as a businessman who stated he had created ten thousand jobs and as a Washington outsider with a solid family image and moderate stances on social issues. When Kennedy tried to tie Romney's policies to those of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Romney responded, [...] "Look, I was an independent {{during the time of}} Reagan-Bush. I'm not trying to <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Reagan-Bush." [...] Romney stated, [...] "Ultimately, this is a campaign about change." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording a {{new album}} was, {{according}} to Robert, a [...] "natural progression" [...] after the band began playing together again. [...] "The thing that kind of introduces us back together is all those memories of the songs, and once you start playing those songs... it always takes us back to... 18 years now. It can <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our past and think about where we were when we were writing these songs, and that's a bond, I think, [...] will always keep us together as four people.... It just progressed into, 'Maybe it's {{time to make a}} new record.|$|E

5000|$|Khadhim {{says that}} after the invasion, [...] "Things started to get worse every year. There was infighting, corruption, killing, looting. Saddam has gone, but now in his place we have 1,000 Saddams. I feel like Iraq has been stolen from us. Bush and Blair are {{definitely}} liars.

60|$|That the {{tradition}} {{is not true}} no one can say. We know that the memory of an action or tragedy of a character to stir the feelings and impress the imagination may live unrecorded in any locality for long centuries.

"The good Captain," [...] he said, [...] "has {{been very}} kind in endeavoring to <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our school, and still intends {{to keep up}} the search for dear old Apple Island.

30|$|This {{extensive}} phenomenon, which <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{at least}} the Christian conquest of the Realm of Valencia in 1238, mobilised for generations {{a large number of}} men not only from the Gudar-Javalambre mountainous regions but also {{from the rest of the}} other villages of the southern part of the province, especially the Albarracin mountain range.|$|R
50|$|By similar argument, a {{discussion}} of time management or task management {{on a personal level}} quickly <b>takes</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{a discussion}} of PIM.

60|$|It all {{lies in the}} unchanging {{realm of}} the past--this land of my childhood. Its charm, its strange {{dominion}} cannot return save in the poet's reminiscent dream. No money, no railway train can <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it. It did not in truth exist--it was a magical world, born of the vibrant union of youth and firelight, of music {{and the voice of}} moaning winds--a union which can never come again to you or me, father, uncle, brother, till the coulee meadows bloom again unscarred of spade or plow.|$|E

A fog would have been even worse for us. As it is, {{it seems to me we}} cannot go very far wrong. I suppose the tide is about turning now; but if by daylight we find that we have been carried a long way past the island, we shall soon have the tide turning again, which will <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
60|$|The man who led our squad made us step along lively, and I {{must say}} that never having been in a drove before, Jone and I began to get restive long before we got through. As for the show, I like the British Museum a great deal better. There is ever {{so much more to}} see there, and you have time to stop and look at things. At Chatsworth they charge you more, give you less, and treat you worse. When it came to taking us through the grounds, Jone and I struck. We left the gang we was with, and being shown where to find a gate out of the place, we made for that gate and waited until our coach was ready to <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Buxton.|$|E

6000|$|... "These animal forms, {{in which}} a later myth saw the shapes assumed by the affrighted gods during the great war between Horus and Typhon, <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a remote prehistoric age, when the {{religious}} creed of Egypt was still totemism. They are survivals from a long-forgotten past, and prove that Egyptian civilisation was of slow and independent growth, the latest stage only of which is revealed {{to us by the}} monuments. Apis of Memphis, Mnevis of Heliopolis, and Pachis of Hermonthis are all links that bind together the Egypt of the Pharaohs and the Egypt of the stone age. These were the sacred animals of the clans which first settled in these localities, and their identification with the deities of the official religion must have been a slow process, never fully carried out, in fact, {{in the minds of the}} lower classes."** ...|$|E

Some little time ago I had remarked to our young friend here that free hydrogen was evolved from the geyser. The idea of a balloon naturally followed. I was, I will admit, somewhat baffled by the difficulty of discovering an envelope to contain the gas, but the contemplation of the immense entrails of these reptiles supplied me with a solution to the problem. Behold the result!" ...|$|E

But he is safe, uncle, and that is everything now, and so I came to say to you that I think it would be well for us to relieve this kind Captain Ichabod from the charges and labours he has taken upon himself for our sakes and, if it be possible, engage that ship yonder to <b>take</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Jamaica; she was sailing in that direction, and her captain might be induced to touch at Kingston.
