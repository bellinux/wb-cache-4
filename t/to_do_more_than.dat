5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. The singers are required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E

Buffalo Hump gathered a huge raiding party, at least 400 warriors, with wives and young boys along to provide comfort and do the work. Altogether {{as many as a}} thousand Comanche may have set out from West Texas on the Great Raid. On this raid the Comanches went {{all the way from the}} plains of west Texas to the cities of Victoria and Linnville on the Texas coast. In what may have been the largest organized raid by the Comanches to that point, they raided and burned these towns and plundered at will.|$|E

5|$|Following the Japanese {{invasion}} on 8 December 1941, the 8thDivision and its attached Indian Army units {{was assigned}} {{responsibility for the}} defence of Johore {{in the south of}} Malaya. As a result, it did not see action until mid-January1942 when Japanese spearheads first reached the state, having pushed back the British and Indian units defending the northern parts of the peninsula. By this time, the division's two brigades had been split up, with the 22nd having been deployed around Mersing and Endau on the east coast and the 27th in the west. The division's first engagement came on the west coast around Muar on 14 January, where the Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army was able to outflank the Commonwealth positions due to Bennett misdeploying the forces under his command so that the weak Indian 45thBrigade was assigned the crucial coastal sector and the stronger Australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas.

It was later explained that charging the Ottoman infantry would have required them to leave behind their cooking equipment and forage for their horses. The former was the more difficult problem because the 6th Cavalry Brigades regiments were made up primarily of Sikh and Hindus, both of whom would refuse to eat their food if it was cooked using local requisitioned or captured pots as their dietary laws conflicted with the native Muslim population.|$|E
25|$|As in 1643, Rupert {{was soon}} {{on his way}} to the north to {{retrieve}} the fortunes of his side. Moving by the Welsh border, and gathering up garrisons and recruits snowball-wise as he marched, he went first to Cheshire to give a hand to Byron, and then, with the utmost speed, he made for Newark. On 20 March 1644, he bivouacked at Bingham, and on the 21st, he not only relieved Newark but routed the besiegers' cavalry. On the 22nd, Meldrum's position was so hopeless that he capitulated on terms. But, brilliant soldier as he was, the prince was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> raid a few Parliamentary posts around Lincoln.

25|$|At the Rethel {{meeting on}} 17 August Lanrezac also thought that Sir John French, whose BEF only {{consisted}} of four infantry divisions {{rather than the}} planned six, intended to use the British cavalry on foot (it is thought likely that he had misunderstood Sir John’s intention to keep his cavalry in reserve). Whereas Sir John wanted Sordet's French cavalry to cover the assembly of the BEF, Lanrezac wanted them to gather tactical intelligence and was told by Joffre’s {{deputy chief of staff}} Berthelot on 17 August that this took priority. Nonetheless Joffre ordered Sordet to move up to Namur and Louvain to try to prevent the Belgians falling back on Antwerp. GQG were unfairly angered at Sordet’s “dilatoriness”, even though his horses were too tired <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> walk.

25|$|On June 10, {{the insurgents}} {{occupied}} buildings in northern Anahuac. Bradburn {{worried that the}} armed men wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> free the American prisoners; he suspected a full-scale revolt. Bradburn had Travis and Jack tied {{to the ground with}} weapons pointed at them. Bradburn threatened to shoot both men if the Texians attacked. Travis encouraged Johnson to lead an attack anyway. During the ensuing negotiations, the Texians offered to exchange the cavalry officers for Travis and the other prisoners. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody in exchange for the cavalry officers and for the withdrawal of the Texians to Turtle Bayou. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, between 15 and 30 of them remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and warned that he would begin firing on the village within two hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had lied to them just {{to get them out of}} the buildings they had occupied.

25|$|French led his {{men out of}} camp at 3am on 7 March, amid {{confusion}} as Kelly-Kenny’s Division, {{which was}} supposed to follow his, had started an hour earlier owing to unclear orders. The moon had set and French had to halt between 5am and 5.45am to await daybreak. By 7am he had reached Kalkfontein Dam, a march of 12 miles, and spent 45 minutes watering his horses. By 7.30am the Boers began to retreat from their position. Roberts later blamed French for failing to cut them off (and missing a chance to capture President Kruger). French argued that his horses were too weak <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> trot, and that he was not strong enough as Kelly-Kenny’s men had not yet arrived. He concentrated his Division for a pursuit, but even then was beaten off by the Boer rearguard. The Official History supported French’s decision, although some felt that French was giving less than wholehearted cooperation after his unjustified public rebuke over the fodder issue. Holmes suggests that French carried out a plan in which he had no confidence because of Roberts' reputation for ruthlessness with unsatisfactory officers.|$|E

25|$|Belgian {{military}} planning {{was based on}} an assumption that other powers would eject an invader but the likelihood of a German invasion, did not lead to France and Britain being seen as allies or for the Belgian government intending <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> protect its independence.

Belgian troops were to be massed in central Belgium, in front of the National redoubt of Belgium ready to face any border, while the Fortified Position of Liège and Fortified Position of Namur were left to secure the frontiers. On mobilization, the King became Commander-in-Chief and chose where the army was to concentrate. Amid the disruption of the new rearmament plan, the disorganised and poorly trained Belgian soldiers would benefit from a central position, to delay contact with an invader but it would also need fortifications for defence, which were on the frontier. A school of thought wanted a return to a frontier deployment in line with French theories of the offensive. Belgian plans became a compromise in which the field army concentrated behind the Gete river with two divisions forward at Liège and Namur.|$|E
