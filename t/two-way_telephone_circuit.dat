50|$|The {{properties}} of these signals differ between countries, but they typically have a frequency of 50 Hz, 12 kHz or 16 kHz, and a duration of several tens {{or hundreds of}} milliseconds. 50 Hz pulses are applied to the <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> as common-mode signals, with respect to ground, as applying them differentially would allow the talking parties to hear 50 Hz buzz tones. These pulses are applied at relatively high voltage to distinguish them from 50 Hz power-mains-induced signals. 12- and 16 kHz metering pulses are applied differentially across the <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit,</b> as these frequencies cannot be heard by listeners with conventional telephone instruments.|$|R
50|$|Most {{customers}} {{connected to}} the NCSS system using dial-up terminals and modems: 110 or 300 baud was typical for the early years; 1200 baud became more common after the mid 70s. Some customers installed conditioned <b>telephone</b> <b>circuits</b> for constant higher-speed access.|$|R

50|$|On 28 March 1988 an 8,000 <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> {{fibre optic}} cable, the longest unregenerated system in Europe, was inaugurated. In links Port Grenaugh to Silecroft in Cumbria, and was laid in September 1987. The cable {{was buried in}} the seabed along its entire length.|$|R
50|$|These were bell {{sets that}} could be used, either stand alone or {{attached}} {{to the base of}} a 232 type telephone or similar, to provide a complete telephone instrument, as Tele. 150s and Tele. 232s did not themselves have an integral <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> or bell. For this reason, although mostly black, they were available in the full range of colours to complement a coloured instrument.All these bellsets appeared identical externally, with a contoured, moulded cover which looked stylish alone, but would dock firmly underneath a 232. They were all based upon the same baseplate but differed in the type of bell and whether this was alone or accompanied by a capacitor, and / or an induction coil and any other <b>telephone</b> <b>circuit</b> components and wiring.|$|R
