El incorporated infinity symbols on her wrestling attire as a tribute to her mother.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> {{in men and}} women, {{mutations in}} BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E

30|$|Approximately 40 % {{of breast}} {{carcinoma}} cases {{and more than}} half of <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> deaths were due <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> diagnosed after the screening age. This was similarly evident in <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> detected in the study period 2000 – 2010 (potential follow-up time varying between 1 to 11  years) and in <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> detected solely during the year 2000 (potential follow-up time 11  years). In both settings, there were very few deaths due to in situ carcinoma. Also the proportion of deaths due to screen-detected cancers was small compared to the proportion they represented in the distribution of cancers (7 % vs. 23 %) whereas the proportion of deaths due <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> among non-attendants (7 % vs. 6 %) and due <b>to</b> interval <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> (9 % vs. 12 %) was more or less similar to that of cancer distribution.|$|R

25|$|A {{contemporary}} woman's life-time {{probability of}} developing {{breast cancer is}} approximately one in seven; {{yet there is no}} causal evidence that fat grafting to the breast might be more conducive <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> than are other breast procedures; because incidences of fat tissue necrosis and calcification occur in every such procedure: breast biopsy, implantation, radiation therapy, breast reduction, breast reconstruction, and liposuction of the breast. Nonetheless, detecting breast cancer is primary, and calcification incidence is secondary; thus, the patient is counselled to learn self-palpation of the breast and to undergo periodic mammographic examinations. Although the mammogram is the superior diagnostic technique for distinguishing among cancerous and benign lesions to the breast, any questionable lesion can be visualized ultrasonically and magnetically (MRI); biopsy follows any clinically suspicious lesion or indeterminate abnormality appeared in a radiograph.|$|E

30|$|BRCA {{mutations}} {{are known}} to be related <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> with distinct clinical and pathological features compared <b>to</b> sporadic <b>breast</b> <b>cancers</b> (Basu et al. 2008; Atchley et al. 2008). There are also known clinical and pathologic differences between tumors arising from inheritance of mutations of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes (Chappuis et al. 2000). In addition, studies in Western literature report potential epidemiological, clinical, and biological differences in <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> between Asian and Caucasian populations (John et al. 2007, Fackenthal and Olopade 2007). These data highlight the need to determine clinical and pathological characteristics in BRCA carriers in different populations, since these differences may affect future risk assessment, treatment planning, and outcomes.|$|R
25|$|A {{more recent}} {{application}} of PGD is to diagnose late-onset diseases and (cancer) predisposition syndromes. Since affected individuals remain healthy until {{the onset of}} the disease, frequently in the fourth decade of life, there is debate on whether or not PGD is appropriate in these cases. Considerations include the high probability of developing the disorders and the potential for cures. For example, in predisposition syndromes, such as BRCA mutations which predispose the individual <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> the outcomes are unclear. Although PGD is often regarded as an early form of prenatal diagnosis, the nature of the requests for PGD often differs from those of prenatal diagnosis requests made when the mother is already pregnant. Some of the widely accepted indications for PGD would not be acceptable for prenatal diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|O'Donnell, {{the third}} of five children, {{was born and raised}} in Commack, Long Island, New York. She is the {{daughter}} of homemaker Roseann Teresa (née Murtha) and Edward Joseph O'Donnell, an electrical engineer who worked in the defense industry. O'Donnell's father had immigrated from County Donegal, Ireland, during his childhood, and her mother was Irish American; O'Donnell was raised Roman Catholic. Her older brother is Daniel J. O'Donnell, now a member of the New York State Assembly. On March 17, 1973, four days before her 11th birthday, O'Donnell lost her mother <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> While she attended Commack High School, O'Donnell was voted homecoming queen, prom queen, senior class president, and class clown. During high school she began exploring her interest in comedy, beginning with a skit performed in front of the school in which she imitated Gilda Radner's character Roseanne Roseannadanna. After graduating in 1980, O'Donnell briefly attended Dickinson College, later transferring to Boston University before ultimately dropping out of college.|$|E
25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared <b>to</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E
