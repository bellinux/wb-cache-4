5|$|Operation Brevity {{would be}} carried out by the 22nd Guards Brigade and {{elements}} of the 7th Armoured Division. Its armoured component consisted of 29 cruiser <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment (2RTR) and 24 infantry <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> the 4th Royal Tank Regiment (4RTR). The Royal Air Force (RAF) allocated all available fighters and a small force of bombers to the operation.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{armoured}} vehicles, including tanks, {{were destroyed}} in the fighting. Before the conflict, Georgia possessed 230–240 tanks in total. At {{the time of the}} conflict, Georgia operated 191 T-72 <b>tanks,</b> <b>of</b> which 75 were deployed into South Ossetia. Georgia lost at least 10 T-72 tanks destroyed in and near Tskhinvali. After the end of hostilities, the Russian military seized a total of 65 Georgian tanks. 20 of those were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols mounted on the <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E

5|$|Because sea {{conditions}} were so rough, {{the decision was}} made for the 116th RCT to carry the DD <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> the 743rd tank battalion {{all the way to the}} beach, after 27 of the initial 29 DD <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> the 741st tank battalion swamped while wading to shore. Coming in opposite the heavily defended Vierville draw, Company B of the 743rd Tank Battalion lost all but one of its officers and half of its DD tanks. The other two companies landed to the left of B/743 without initial loss. On the 16th RCT front, the two DD tanks from the 741st tank battalion that had survived the swim ashore were joined by three others that were landed directly onto the beach because of their LCT's damaged ramp. The remaining tank company managed to land 14 of its 16 tanks (although three of these were quickly knocked out).|$|E
5|$|By early afternoon, the strong-point {{guarding}} the D-1 draw at Vierville was silenced by the navy. But without enough {{force on the}} ground to mop up the remaining defenders, the exit could not be opened.

5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked.

BOAC ordered 19 Comet 4s in March 1955, while American operator Capital Airlines ordered 14 Comets in July 1956. Capital's order included 10 Comet 4As, a variant modified for short-range operations with a stretched fuselage and short wings, lacking the pinion (outboard wing) fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> the Comet 4. However, because of financial problems and a subsequent takeover by United Airlines, Capital would never operate the Comet.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>of</b> VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines.

Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.|$|E
