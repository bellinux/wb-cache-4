5|$|As Emily's winds eased over land, various {{assessment}} teams left Fort Bragg, North Carolina, <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> damage. FEMA {{informed the}} North Carolina congressional delegation about the storm's {{threat to their}} constituents. The agency later received compliments for their timely preparations for storm-related operations. All airports on the Outer Banks were reopened by September1. In response to the extensive scale of the power outages, power companies flew a helicopter over the region to assess the damage. The power {{was expected to be}} out for two weeks. Six emergency vehicles were sent to Dare County to provide drinking water.|$|E

5|$|On August28, {{or about}} three days after Katrina struck the state, President George W. Bush {{declared}} a disaster area for Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which allocated federal funding for debris removal and other emergency services. Three days later, Monroe County was also declared a disaster areas, and {{on the same day}} the three counties were designated to receive funding for public assistance; this included aid to repair roads and bridges, water control facilities, public buildings, and recreation areas. The declaration was determined after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20State Emergency Response Teams <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> damage. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, President Bush declared a disaster area for seven counties along the Florida panhandle on September6; the counties were Bay, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, and Walton. In addition, Collier County in southwestern Florida was added to the list of disaster areas.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the Nicaraguan {{government}} {{declared a}} state of disaster in the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department. The government sheltered those made homeless in Bluefields along the Atlantic coast. Relief efforts were coordinated by the Comité Nacional de Emergencia to provide aid to the affected storm victims. Officials sent medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> damage. On August18, the government requested international assistance to cope from the disaster. In response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP sent US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme sent 72tons of food and milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter sent a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later sent US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community sent US$227,000 worth of food and medicine. After Tropical Storm Gert struck in early September, various other countries sent additional money, food, medicine, and other goods.|$|E
