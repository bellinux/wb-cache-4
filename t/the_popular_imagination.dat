5|$|Other kings had {{inspired}} more respect, {{but perhaps}} only Henry VIII had endeared himself to <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination</b> {{as much as}} this one. He was the playboy monarch, naughty but nice, the hero of all who prized urbanity, tolerance, good humour, {{and the pursuit of}} pleasure above the more earnest, sober, or material virtues.|$|E
5|$|While Gomułka's anti-Soviet {{image was}} exaggerated, it was {{justified}} in <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination</b> by his anti-Stalinist line in 1948 {{and years of}} subsequent internment. Thus, Polish communists found themselves unexpectedly {{at the head of}} a national liberation movement. The enthusiastic public support offered to Gomułka contributed to the legitimization of communist rule in Poland, which incorporated mass nationalist, anti-Soviet feelings into the prevailing power structures. In Hungary, social protest destroyed the political system; in Poland, it was absorbed within it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{national}} media began to report the extreme wealth of some Texans in magazines such as Life and Fortune. A stereotype emerged of the nouveau-riche Texas oil millionaire, popularized by the media. The popular image was often characterized by a rough and combative personality, heavy drinking, and extravagant spending. In 1956, the motion picture Giant helped to crystallize the image of Texans in <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination</b> as comical, eccentric figures. Glenn McCarthy was {{the inspiration for the}} character of Jett Rink in the film. Other films such as Boom Town and War of the Wildcats, and books such as The Lusty Texans of Dallas and Houston: Land of the Big Rich, also contributed to public perceptions of oil's influence in Texas and surrounding states.|$|E

5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination.</b> His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E
5|$|In the east, however, Manuel's {{achievements}} {{are more}} ambiguous. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks. Manuel was marching against Konya, the Turkish capital, when his forces were ambushed; the ensuing defeat has since entered <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination</b> as a legendary disaster. Exaggerated {{accounts of the}} battle often describe {{the destruction of the}} entire Byzantine army, and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence. However, the modern consensus among Byzantine historians is that, while the Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor, it was certainly not a catastrophe. Nor was it in any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier. In fact, much of the emperor's army emerged from the battle without serious damage. Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year. The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, a clear indication that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory. In 1177, the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley.|$|E

25|$|Chichen Itza entered <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination</b> in 1843 {{with the}} book Incidents of Travel in Yucatan by John Lloyd Stephens (with {{illustrations}} by Frederick Catherwood). The book recounted Stephens' visit to Yucatán and his tour of Maya cities, including Chichén Itzá. The book prompted other explorations of the city. In 1860, Désiré Charnay surveyed Chichén Itzá and took numerous photographs that he published in Cités et ruines américaines (1863).|$|E

25|$|In April 1663, Shivaji {{launched}} a surprise attack on Shaista Khan in Pune; {{accounts of the}} story differ in <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination,</b> {{but there is some}} agreement that Shivaji and band of some 200 followers infiltrated Pune, using a wedding procession as cover. They overcame the palace guards, breached the wall, and entered Shaista Khan's quarters, killing those they found there. Shaista Khan escaped, losing his thumb in the melee, but one of his sons and other members of his household were killed. The Khan took refuge with the Moghul forces outside of Pune, and Aurangzeb punished him for this embarrassment with a transfer to Bengal.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, {{the memory}} of the three crowns arms may have {{remained}} for a time with one Elizabethan variant of the harp, sometimes found on coins, maps and seals as early as 1562, using of the three harps, one replacing each of the three crowns of the lordship's arms. This {{appears to have been a}} creation of the newly established Ulster King of Arms and never captured <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination</b> sufficiently to replace the single Harp arms that was in use from the reign of Henry VIII. Thus, at the funeral cortège of Elizabeth I in 1603 depicted in a manuscript at the British Library, the Earl of Clanrickarde is shown carrying the banner of Ireland just as in the Wijnbergen Roll.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{interest}} in Paul {{is a recent}} phenomenon. Before the positive historical reevaluations of Jesus by some Jewish thinkers in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, he had hardly featured in <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> Jewish <b>imagination</b> and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars. Arguably, he is absent from the Talmud and rabbinical literature, although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic Toledot Yeshu (as a spy for the rabbis).|$|R
25|$|As Japanese society became pacified, {{the middle}} classes adopted many of the {{practices}} of the warrior class, {{in the case of}} shudō giving it a more mercantile interpretation. Male prostitutes (kagema), who were often passed off as apprentice kabuki actors and who catered to a mixed male and female clientele, did a healthy trade into the mid-19th century despite increasing restrictions. Many such prostitutes, as well as many young kabuki actors, were indentured servants sold as children to the brothel or theatre, typically on a ten-year contract. Relations between merchants and boys hired as shop staff or housekeepers were common enough, at least in <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination,</b> to be the subject of erotic stories and popular jokes. Young kabuki actors often worked as prostitutes off-stage, and were celebrated {{in much the same way}} as modern media stars are today, being much sought after by wealthy patrons, who would vie with each other to purchase their favors. onnagata (female-role) and wakashū-gata (adolescent boy-role) actors in particular were the subject of much appreciation by both male and female patrons, and figured largely in nanshoku shunga prints and other works celebrating nanshoku, which occasionally attained best-seller status.|$|E
25|$|While the Loch Ness monster {{is often}} {{reported}} as {{looking like a}} plesiosaur, it is also often described as looking completely different. A number of reasons have been presented for why a plesiosaurian identity is unlikely. These include {{the assumption that the}} water in the loch is too cold for a, for the sake of this argument, presumed cold-blooded reptile to be able to survive easily, the assumption that air-breathing animals would be easy to see whenever they appear at the surface to breathe, the fact that the loch is too small and contains insufficient food to be able to support a breeding colony of large animals, and finally the fact that the lake was only formed 10,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} last ice age, while the latest fossil appearance of plesiosaurs dates to over 66 million years ago. Frequent explanations for the sightings include waves, floating inanimate objects, tricks of the light, swimming known animals, and practical jokes. Nevertheless, in <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>imagination,</b> plesiosaurs have come to be identified with the Monster of Loch Ness. This has had the advantage of making the group better known to the general public, but the disadvantage that people have trouble taking the subject seriously, forcing paleontologists to explain time and again that plesiosaurs really did exist and are not creatures of myth or fantasy.|$|E
