500|$|Many feminists call {{attention}} to value judgments in economic analysis. This idea {{is contrary to the}} typical conception of economics as a positive science held by many practitioners. For example, Geoff Schneider and Jean Shackelford suggest that [...] "the issues that economists choose to study, <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> they ask, and the type of analysis undertaken all are a product of a belief system which is influenced by numerous factors, some of them ideological in character."

In this way, narrative constructions necessarily underlie all definitions of variables and statistics. [...] Therefore, economic research cannot escape being inherently qualitative, regardless of how it is labeled." [...] Feminist economists {{call attention}} to the value judgements in all aspects economics and criticize its depiction of an objective science.|$|E

Without the normal processes of decomposition to skeletonize the body, soft tissues, hairs, and organic grave goods are still often found (e.g., textiles, feathers, leather, fingernails). Grave goods include faience beads, cattle skulls, and pottery. Skeletal collections, like other archaeological evidence, continue to be re-examined and re-interpreted as new research questions arise.

50|$|Influenced by his father, {{he began}} his college career majoring in economics.

After attending this lecture, he {{realized that there was}} an entire science devoted to exploring <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> that had intrigued him as a child. His undergraduate years at Brandeis brought him closer to a number of respected psychologists, but Maslow was his primary mentor and had the biggest impact on his early academic career. Aronson earned his Bachelor's degree from Brandeis in 1954. He went on to earn a Master's degree from Wesleyan University in 1956, where he worked with David McClelland, and a Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University in 1959, where his doctoral advisor and mentor was the experimental social psychologist Leon Festinger.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Andrew Sanders of the University of Ulster noted that Pócs' [...] "examination and {{analysis}} are folkloric rather than anthropological", {{and that as}} a result, [...] "the great majority case studies in the book are examined in insufficient detail and contain inadequate information to answer <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> likely to be posed by anthropologists." [...] Furthermore, Sanders argued that [...] "the main problem of the book could be poor translation from the original Hungarian. At times the discussion is difficult to follow or to understand, because the account is ambiguous or contradictory and the meaning is unclear". Believing that Pócs went into [...] "bewildering detail" [...] over her categorisation of {{the different kinds of}} Hungarian magical practitioner, Sanders finally remarked that the book could have been improved with a [...] "more careful translation and/or presentation" [...] and the inclusion of an index.|$|E
30|$|As argued by Wilk and Włodarczyk [25]: “the way {{in which}} one {{collects}} information about an object decides {{the form of the}} corresponding information entropy”.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> {{asked by}} querents may vary widely {{according}} to their needs, and the methodology of the divination system. Some querents seek general advice trusting {{that they will be}} told what is most pertinent to their present situation. Others will ask questions that are only slightly more direct such as, [...] "Will I be rich?" [...] and [...] "What kind of person will I marry?" [...] Still others seek specific advice, although opinions are divided amongst practitioners of various divinatory arts as to what constitutes a 'good' question: some say that questions in the form of [...] "What would be likely to happen if I followed course of action X?" [...] are potentially more useful to a querent than [...] "Should I follow course of action X?". Yes-and-no questions are not always best because of the finality they represent, and usually most querents are after far more than just yes and no.|$|E
5000|$|Turning to the {{classics}} of Russian theatre, the MAT revived Griboyedov's comedy Woe from Wit {{and planned to}} stage three of Pushkin's [...] "little tragedies" [...] in early 1915. Stanislavski continued to develop his 'system', explaining at an open rehearsal for Woe from Wit his concept {{of the state of}} [...] "I am being". This term marks the stage in the rehearsal process when the distinction between actor and character blurs (producing the [...] "actor/role"), subconscious behaviour takes the lead, and the actor feels fully present in the dramatic moment. He stressed the importance to achieving this state of a focus on action ("What would I do if ...") rather than emotion ("How would I feel if ..."): [...] "You must ask <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> that lead to dynamic action." [...] Instead of forcing emotion, he explained, actors should notice what is happening, attend to their relationships with the other actors, and try to understand [...] "through the senses" [...] the fictional world that surrounds them.|$|E

Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincaré had begun in the 1890s.Measure theory was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the Lebesgue integral, Kolmogorov's axiomatisation of probability theory, and ergodic theory. Knot theory greatly expanded. Quantum mechanics {{led to the development of}} functional analysis. Other new areas include Laurent Schwartz's distribution theory, fixed point theory, singularity theory and René Thom's catastrophe theory, model theory, and Mandelbrot's fractals. Lie theory with its Lie groups and Lie algebras became one of the major areas of study.|$|E
