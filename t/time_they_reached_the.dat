5|$|In the FA Cup, Rovers {{have reached}} the quarter-final stage on three occasions. The first time was in 1950–51 when they faced Newcastle United at St James' Park {{in front of a}} crowd of 62,787, the record for the highest {{attendance}} at any Bristol Rovers match. The second <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> quarter final was in 1957–58, when they lost to Fulham, and the most recent appearance {{at this stage of the}} competition was during the 2007–08 season, when they faced West Bromwich Albion. They were the first Division Three team to win an FA Cup tie away to a Premier League side, when in 2002 they beat Derby County 3–1 at Pride Park Stadium.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, about 100 {{men of the}} 19th Infantry {{moved into}} the hills {{to the east of}} the town. They carried with them about 30 wounded, {{including}} several litter-bound patients too seriously wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> top of the mountain, officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a Red Cross brassard identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white Latin cross brassard, identifying him as a military chaplain in the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. The two who remained and the wounded were non-combatants under international law, as they carried no weapons.|$|E

25|$|On-board {{weather radar}} gave good {{information}} to the crew about the approach and movement of the severe weather system. The CVR contains details of repeated discussion of weather amongst the crew between 12:38 and 12:54. Initially, there was some doubt amongst the crew members whether the radar returns being displayed were ground echoes or were from inclement weather around the airfield. However, the crew soon realized that the weather radar was not showing ground echoes but was indicating adverse weather as confirmed by the co-pilot's exclamatory comments at 12:46 and at 12:47. They even discussed that the clouds were moving and hoped that the airfield would be clear of clouds by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> airfield.|$|E
25|$|McIntosh {{had planned}} to envelop Sigel's force from the {{northwest}} while Gates closed the trap on the south. However, McIntosh mistakenly took his 3,000-man cavalry brigade too far up a northerly road. After marching three miles out of his way, he turned his troopers onto the road leading east into the Little Sugar Creek valley. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> site where Sigel's northeast road met McIntosh's east-bound road, the Federal general's men had already passed the intersection thus avoiding a disaster. When the 3rd Texas Cavalry charged, they ran smack into Sigel's main line. The Confederates lost 10 killed and about 20 wounded to Federal artillery and rifle fire and the Union position held.|$|E

25|$|Once the Pit Stop is complete, {{the team}} is given their next clue and allowed to start racing again. Each team's Pit Stop was {{originally}} 12 hours long starting from the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> mat, or made longer with additional 24-hour segments as needed as to appear 12 hours long during broadcast. In more recent seasons, Pit Stop times have varied both longer or shorter to avoid teams loitering in airports or other areas. Penalties from the previous leg may also be applied to a team's Pit Stop time. Teams are responsible for being ready to leave at the correct time, and are given no time credit should they miss their departure time. In most cases, Teams leave from the same location they ended the previous leg at, but some Pit Stops have been on mobile housing, such as riverboats, with their point of departure changed {{during the course of}} the Pit Stop.|$|E
25|$|Quintus Fabius fought defensively {{to prolong}} the battle into a test of {{endurance}} {{and wait for the}} enemy to flag. Publius Decius fought more aggressively and ordered a cavalry attack, which drove back the Senone cavalry twice. The second <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> enemy infantry, but suffered a chariot attack and were scattered and overthrown. The line of the Decius’ infantry was broken by the chariots and the Senone foot attacked. Publius Decius decided to devote himself. This term referred to a military commander offering prayers to the gods and launching himself into the enemy lines, effectively sacrificing himself, when his troops were in dire straits. This act galvanised the Roman left which was also joined by two reserve contingents which Quintus Fabius had called in to help. On the right, Quintus Fabius told the cavalry to outflank the Samnite wing and attack it in the flank and ordered his infantry to push forward. He then called in the other reserves. The Samnites fled past the Senone line. The Senones formed a testudo (tortoise) formation – where the men aligned their shields in a compact formation covered with shields at the front and top. Quintus Fabius ordered 500 Campanian lancers to attack them at the rear. This was to be combined with push by the middle line of one of the legions and an attack by the cavalry. Meanwhile, Quintus Fabius took the Samnite camp by storm and cut off the Senones in the rear. The Senone Gauls were defeated. The Romans lost 8,700 men and their enemy 20,000.|$|E

The breakaway began to splinter on the Col d'Ornon, as the advantage over the main field continued to rise, to over five minutes. Alexey Lutsenko led over the climb for , ahead of the mountains classification leader Thomas Damuseau of [...] and Seeldraeyers.

500|$|... "Mr. Pitiful" [...] was {{recorded}} in December 1964 at the Stax studios. The song was written by both guitarist Steve Cropper and Redding, and was their first collaboration. It was inspired by and written {{as a response to}} a statement made by radio disc jockey Moohah Williams, who had nicknamed Redding [...] "Mr. Pitiful" [...] for sounding pitiful when singing ballads. Cropper heard about this and, while taking a shower, got the idea it would make a good song. In the car {{on the way to the}} studio, Cropper proposed the idea with a melody already in mind, humming it to Redding. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> studio, the song was written and they recorded it in two or three takes.

Eventually a five-rider breakaway was allowed to form, composed of Steve Cummings (MTN-Qhubeka), Peter Velits (BMC), Kristijan Đurasek (Lampre-Merida), Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step), and Cyril Gautier (Europcar), and they were soon joined by Miguel Ángel Rubiano (Colombia). The six riders gained a lead of over four minutes, but it was already being brought back by the peloton by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> Alto de Baeza, where Gautier was the first rider to the summit. Giant-Alpecin (on behalf of Dumoulin) and Movistar controlled the pace at the front of the peloton. With [...] remaining, as the roads began to go uphill, the lead was under a minute.

500|$|In 1948 Albion {{successfully}} {{applied for}} re-election to the League after finishing bottom {{for the first}} time. After several near misses, they were promoted as champions to the Second Division in 1958, and five years later, two successive relegations took them into Division Four. Former Tottenham Hotspur and England centre-forward Bobby Smith's 19 goals alongside Wally Gould's 21 made a major contribution to Albion winning the Fourth Division title in 1965, and seven years later the team made a brief return to Division Two. Peter Ward's 32 goals in 1976–77 helped return the team to the Second Division, and two years later, a 3–1 victory away at Newcastle United confirmed their promotion to the First Division. In 1983, for the first <b>time,</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> FA Cup Final, in which they played Manchester United. The scores were level at 2–2 until the last moments of extra time, when Albion's Gordon Smith had a clear chance to score a winning goal. Peter Jones's radio commentary on the moment became famous: [...] "and Smith must score...", he cried, just before Smith's shot was blocked by the goalkeeper's legs. Albion lost the replay 4–0, and were relegated that same season.|$|E
500|$|The men Arnold chose for his {{expedition}} were volunteers {{drawn from}} New England companies {{serving in the}} Siege of Boston. [...] They were formed into two battalions for the expedition; a third battalion was composed of riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia under Captain Daniel Morgan's command. [...] The trek through the wilderness of Maine was long and difficult. [...] The conditions were wet and cold, and the journey took much longer than either Arnold or Washington had expected. [...] Bad weather and wrecked boats spoiled much of the expedition's food stores, and about 500men of the original 1,100 turned back or died. [...] Those who turned back, including one of the New England battalions, took many of the remaining provisions with them. [...] The men who continued on were starving by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> first French settlements in early November. [...] On November9, the 600survivors of Arnold's march from Boston to Quebec arrived at Point Levis, on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence opposite Quebec City.

500|$|While {{this was}} going on, the United States was {{negotiating}} with Great Britain over compensation for losses inflicted by British ships knowingly sold to the Confederacy during the Civil War (the Alabama Claims). Peru {{had been involved in}} an undeclared war with Spain (the Chincha Islands War) in 1864–66 and the US was not willing to prejudice its claims against the United Kingdom by performing a similar action for a belligerent power. Negotiations over the issue delayed the departure of the two monitors until January 1869, after Peru bought two steamers, Reyes and Marañon to tow the monitors. They only reached Pensacola, Florida, before machinery breakdowns forced them to wait 30 days for repairs to be completed.

The monitor, short of coal and food, was forced to make port at Naranjo, Cuba, then held by rebels against the Spanish government. They allowed the ship to restock her supplies, but no coal was available so the crew loaded up enough wood to reach the Bahamas where they were able to send a local schooner to Nassau to inform the authorities of their plight.
