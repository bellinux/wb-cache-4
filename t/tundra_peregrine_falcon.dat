50|$|There are {{endangered}} species in Chile, including the South Andean huemul, <b>tundra</b> <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon,</b> puna rhea, Chilean woodstar, ruddy-headed goose, and green sea turtle. As of 2001, 16 species of mammals {{in a total}} of 91 were considered endangered. Of 296 breeding bird species, 18 were threatened with extinction. Also threatened were four types of freshwater fish and 268 plant species.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcon</b> was {{selected}} as the totem of Kintecoying Lodge. A native bird to New York City, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> is a symbol of strength, adventure, leadership and new beginnings. <b>Peregrine</b> <b>Falcons</b> are among the worldâ€™s most common birds of prey and live on all continents except Antarctica. They prefer wide-open spaces, and thrive near coasts where shorebirds are common, but they can be found everywhere from <b>tundra</b> to deserts. <b>Peregrines</b> are also found living on the bridges and skyscrapers of our city. Having been put on the endangered species list in the 1970s the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> is making a strong comeback with Day One Event Logopopulation numbers on the rise worldwide.|$|R
40|$|A {{population}} of <b>tundra</b> <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco peregrinus tundrius) was studied over 4 breeding seasons at Rankin Inlet, NWT, Canada. These data were combined {{with data from}} the 10 previous consecutive seasons. As the study area and methodology was consistent during the entire study, I summarized and analyzed information from all 14 years to investigate paradigms in avian biology. The toxicological assessment of peregrines and their prey revealed that the population is still likely to experience some contaminant related reproductive failure, however, the levels are not high enough to seriously affect production of the population. Contrary to predictions, no improvement in shell thickness was detected between decades and residue levels changed little. Results suggest that peregrines accumulate organochlorines on their wintering rounds, but also from contaminated aquatic species that range only within North America. The parentage of 55 peregrine broods (144 young total) was examined using both single-locus minisatellite and microsatellite DNA profiling to: (1) investigate the accuracy of traditional measures of an individual's reproductive success; (2) test predictions of the Paternity Assurance Hypothesis (PAH) in a dense raptor population; and (3) assess whether non-territorial adult peregrines contribute to their lifetime reproductive success before holding a territory. A low frequency (1. 3 % of young) of extra-pair paternity (EPP) was detected; justifying the use of traditional measures of reproductive success. Infrequent EPP is consistent with other studies of raptors, but fits poorly with the predictions of the PAH. Inconsistencies with the PAH, and the mechanism of social dominance and territoriality is discussed. The pattern of nesting territory occupancy and reproductive performance over 14 years was analyzed to identify the importance of density-dependent processes in regulation of the population, and test the predictions of two hypotheses explaining density-dependent fecundity. Breeding attempts at preferred (frequently occupied) territories produced young more often than attempts at avoided (infrequently occupied) territories supporting the hypothesis that occupation frequency is an indirect measure of habitat quality. Density-dependent fecundity {{was the result of}} proportionally more breeding attempts occurring at infrequently occupied territories where the frequency of failure was high; production at preferred territories did not decline with increasing density. This was consistent with the predictions of the "habitat heterogeneity" hypothesis, but not the "interference" hypothesis. 14 adult peregrines were removed from their territories for 24 hours to test whether breeding densities were limited and elucidate the relative importance of territory quality and territoriality in population limitation. Replacements at 11 territories provided evidence of 'floaters' and population limitation. All six vacancies for females, at 5 good and one poor quality territories, were filled; males were replaced at four good quality territories but only one of four poor quality territories. Mechanisms of population limitation are discussed. I analyzed capture and resighting records of colour-banded adult peregrines collected from 1982 to 1995 to provide accurate estimates of survival using Cormack-Jolly-Seber capture-recapture methodology and traditional turnover methodology. Results were indicative of little or no difference in survival between males and females. Differences between estimates from the two methods were minimal. Estimates represent minimum survival because of the confounding effects of emigration. Limitations and practical difficulties in the estimation of survival among peregrines and other raptors are discussed...|$|R

5|$|By 1975, <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, {{primarily}} as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> in captivity to later release to the wild were effective.

5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings for My Flight in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings for My Flight take place, only 324 pairs of <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the Rocky Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|R

5|$|The <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> {{became an}} {{endangered}} species primarily due {{to the use of}} organochlorine pesticides, especially DDT, the breakdown of which lowered estrogen levels in the bloodstream of female <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to grow thinner by up to 20 percent. Since <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcons</b> lay their eggs on rocky ledges rather than nests, the thinned shells break under the stress of both the rocky ledge and the weight of the parents during incubation. Following 1970, recovery efforts for the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> population have been successful. The agricultural use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1972, and recovery teams in the eastern United States were successful in breeding and training peregrines in captivity to later release to the wild, a procedure called hacking. In 1999, the <b>peregrine</b> <b>falcon</b> was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|R
