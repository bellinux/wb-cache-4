His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother to rise <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> the only time she did so during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|Sabina got <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> whereupon a policewoman {{attempted}} {{to persuade her}} {{to stay on the}} ground and receive further medical attention. Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the central reservation again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E

5|$|The basic garment for all Romans, {{regardless}} of gender or wealth, was the simple sleeved tunic. The length differed by wearer: a man's reached mid-calf, but a soldier's was somewhat shorter; a woman's fell <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> and a child's to its knees. The tunics {{of poor people}} and labouring slaves were made from coarse wool in natural, dull shades, with the length determined {{by the type of}} work they did. Finer tunics were made of lightweight wool or linen. A man who belonged to the senatorial or equestrian order wore a tunic with two purple stripes (clavi) woven vertically into the fabric: the wider the stripe, the higher the wearer's status. Other garments could be layered over the tunic.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, 23-year-old Italian Maria Spelterini was {{the only}} woman ever to cross the Niagara Gorge on a tightrope, making four {{crossings}} over 18 days. On July 12, she crossed wearing peach baskets strapped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> on July 19 blind-folded, on July 22 with her ankles and wrists manacled and finally on July 26. Tightrope crossings of the falls ended—by law—in 1896, when James Hardy crossed.|$|E
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E

25|$|The Princess's {{later life}} {{was marred by}} illness and disability. She had smoked {{cigarettes}} {{since at least the}} age of 15 and had continued to smoke heavily for many years. On 5 January 1985, she had part of her left lung removed; the operation drew parallels with that of her father over 30 years earlier. In 1991, she quit smoking, though she continued to drink heavily. In January 1993, she was admitted to hospital for pneumonia. She experienced a mild stroke in 1998 at her holiday home in Mustique. Early the following year the Princess suffered severe scalds <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> in a bathroom accident, which affected her mobility to the extent that she required support when walking and sometimes used a wheelchair. In January and March 2001, further strokes were diagnosed, which left her with partial vision and paralysis on the left side. Margaret's last public appearances were at the 101st birthday celebrations of her mother in August 2001 and the 100th birthday celebration of her aunt, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, that December.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fifth}} morning, Croatia's Sandra Perković {{became the only}} woman to defend an {{individual}} Olympic athletics title that year, topping the discus podium. Christian Taylor became {{the only man in}} the field events to defend his 2012 Olympic title, repeating his American 1–2 finish with teammate Will Claye. The United States was less successful in the men's 110 metres hurdles: its athletes failed to gain a medal {{for the first time ever}} (bar the 1980 boycott) while Jamaican Omar McLeod won by over a tenth of a second. Faith Kipyegon was a clear winner in the women's 1500 metres ahead of Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba. Derek Drouin won Canada's first Olympic gold in athletics in twenty years in the men's high jump. In the women's 5000m heats American Abbey D'Agostino and Nikki Hamblin of New Zealand fell during the race. D'Agostino stopped to help Hamblin <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> but then struggled herself with what would be diagnosed as a torn ACL, which led Hamblin to help in turn so the pair could finish. The pair were later given the Fair Play award by the International Fair Play Committee for their show of sportsmanship.|$|E

25|$|Rob Donovan reads {{an article}} in the {{newspaper}} about Johnny at the factory. He then requests a visit from Tracy and tells his prison cellmate that he plans for revenge on Tracy and Carla of how they disowned him and how they called the police and had him jailed. Tracy turned up to visit Rob and wondered why he had chosen to contact her after such time, however Rob confessed to being angry at first but could never stop loving her and he did not blame her for him being arrested. After Tracy's visit, Rob requested a visit from Johnny, and reveals that he is the father of Carla. He demands £10,000 from Johnny to keep it secret. Johnny told him that Tracy was with Robert Preston. Johnny does everything in his power to ensure that nobody finds out, but steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back.

After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> abruptly and gives chase. She jumps into the car, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the car drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious.
