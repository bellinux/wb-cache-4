5|$|After some time, Rodrigues is {{eventually}} taken {{to meet an}} older Ferreira. Ferreira says he committed apostasy while being <b>tortured,</b> and states that after 15 years {{in the country and}} a year in the temple, he believes Christianity is futile in Japan. Rodrigues repudiates him, but Ferreira is implacable. That night in his prison cell, Rodrigues hears five Christians being <b>tortured.</b> Ferreira tells him that they have already apostatized; it is his apostasy the Japanese demand. As Rodrigues looks upon a fumi-e, he hears an inner voice of Christ giving him permission to step on it, and he does.|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>torture</b> by the Bush {{administration}} has raised important {{questions regarding the}} strength of the <b>torture</b> taboo. Did US <b>torture</b> signal a regress of the <b>torture</b> prohibition? This article examines the attempts by the United States to re-define <b>torture</b> to better reflect its interests. However, rather than seeing this as a case of norm regression, I show how the United States failed in its revisionist attempts to legitimise its interpretation of <b>torture</b> in international society. The <b>torture</b> taboo remained resilient to US challenges, demonstrating not only the difficulty of norm revisionism but also the robustness of the <b>torture</b> taboo...|$|R
50|$|Psychological <b>torture</b> {{is a type}} of <b>torture</b> {{that relies}} {{primarily}} on psychological effects, and only secondarily on any physical harm inflicted. Although not all psychological <b>torture</b> involves the use of physical violence, there is a continuum between psychological <b>torture</b> and physical <b>torture.</b> The two are often used in conjunction with one another, and often overlap in practice, with the fear and pain induced by physical <b>torture</b> often resulting in long-term psychological effects, and many forms of psychological <b>torture</b> involving some form of pain or coercion.|$|R

As time progressed, 61% of Canadians still believed Afghan detainees were <b>tortured</b> in May 2010, according to an Ipsos-Reid poll. This poll also found that 52% of respondents believed that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring, and 75% believed senior military officials would have known about the problem. A poll done by Angus Reid during 5 January and 6, found that 38 per cent of Canadians believed that Harper used the 30 December 2009 prorogation to curtail the Canadian Afghan detainee issue.|$|E

40|$|<b>Torture</b> {{as a form}} of {{violence}} against the person of another that takes different forms which could be in the form of beating, rape, electrocution and other inhuman treatments of human beings. <b>Torture</b> is a grave violation of human rights and is rigidly prohibited, the use of <b>torture</b> strikes at the centre of civil and political freedoms. <b>Torture</b> {{was one of the first}} issues addressed by the United Nations (UN) in its development of human rights standards. Other regional Instruments have equally condemned <b>torture</b> and have called on nation States to take practical steps towards the prohibition of <b>torture.</b> In short <b>torture</b> and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment are prohibited under international law and cannot be allowed under any circumstances. The local legislation in Nigeria especially the Nigeria Constitution has prohibited <b>torture</b> and has asserted the right of every citizen against <b>torture,</b> inhumane and degrading treatment.

40|$|Steinhoff (On {{the ethics}} of <b>torture.</b> SUNY Press, Albany, 2013) defends the moral and legal {{permissibility}} of <b>torture</b> in a limited range of circumstances. This article criticizes Steinhoff’s arguments. The analogy between ordinary defensive violence and defensive <b>torture</b> which Steinhoff argues for is partly spoiled by the presence, within defensive <b>torture,</b> of opportunistic harm, in addition to eliminative harm. Steinhoff’s arguments that the mere legalization of defensive <b>torture</b> would not metastasize into a more full-fledged institutionalization of <b>torture</b> are also found wanting. As a minimal form of institutionalization, the mere legalization of <b>torture</b> would already be at risk of further entrenchment and growth...|$|R

Accordingly, there are four essential elements of the definition <b>torture,</b> which play a significant role in qualifying an “act ” or “conduct ” as <b>torture.</b> Apart from this, the paper has critically assessed the state obligation that flows from the definition provision. It has also discussed that the definition of <b>torture</b> is in continual process of evolution. In general, it is made clear that article one plays a pivotal in understanding the whole notion of the concept of <b>torture,</b> and implicating the state obligation with regard to <b>torture...</b>|$|R
