5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s {{at the height}} of the Cold War, the United States Army {{conducted}} a classified feasibility study that proposed the construction of a manned military outpost on the Moon called Project Horizon with the potential to conduct a wide range of missions from scientific research to nuclear Earth bombardment. The study included the possibility of conducting a lunar-based nuclear test. The Air Force, which at the time was in competition with the Army for a leading role in <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> developed its own similar plan called Lunex. However, both these proposals were ultimately passed over as <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program</b> was largely transferred from the military to the civilian agency NASA.|$|E

50|$|Since the Air Research and Development Command {{was destined}} to serve the Air Force and two non-Air Force clients in space (i.e., ARPA and NASA), {{effective}} coordination among the agencies was crucial to the early success of <b>the</b> <b>space</b> mission. Before <b>the</b> 6555th absorbed the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division's resources at the Cape in December 1959, most of the Air Force's participation in <b>the</b> Cape's <b>space</b> launch operations was managed by the WS-315A (THOR) Project Division under the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division's Assistant Commander for Missile Tests. The WS-315A Project Division was redesignated <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Project Division on 16 November 1959, and it became <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Projects Division under the 6555th Test Wing on 15 February 1960.Following the establishment of Air Force Systems Command, the 6555th's Test Directorate and Operations Directorate were transformed into <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Programs</b> Office and <b>the</b> Ballistic Missiles Office on 17 April 1961. Under that reorganization, the old Atlas Project Office's resources were divided roughly in half to create an Atlas Booster Branch and an Atlas Weapons Branch. The Atlas Booster Branch was placed under <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Programs</b> Office. <b>The</b> old Atlas Operations Division became the new Atlas Weapons Branch's Operations Section, and the new Atlas Weapons Branch was placed under the Ballistic Missiles Office. <b>The</b> <b>Space</b> Projects Division became <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Projects Branch under <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Programs</b> Office on 17 April, and its Thor Booster Branch (created on 17 March 1961) was removed and set up as a separate branch under <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Programs</b> Office.|$|R

5|$|At age seventy-seven, Barbree {{is one of}} the longest-serving network correspondents to work {{continuously}} on {{a single}} subject.

He has never missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along Cocoa Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically dead for several minutes. Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and still did not miss any launches.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In {{the aftermath of the}} Shuttle Columbia accident, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Program</b> Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).|$|E
5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's September 1962 speech, {{in which}} he {{described}} his goal of accomplishing a manned space flight to the moon {{by the end of}} the decade, <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program</b> grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral. Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase access to higher education on the Space Coast. With the help of former State Senate President William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125 on June 10, 1963, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida. The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for promising space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} of 35, which {{included}} Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support to <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Program,</b> and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded {{that it would be}} a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.|$|E

40|$|This work {{introduces}} <b>the</b> important emerging <b>space</b> {{powers of}} <b>the</b> world. Brian Harvey describes {{the origins of}} <b>the</b> Japanese <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> from rocket designs based on WW II German U-boats to tiny solid fuel 'pencil' rockets, {{which led to the}} launch of the first Japanese satellite in 1970. The next two chapters relate how Japan expanded its <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> developing small satellites into astronomical observatories and sending missions to the Moon, Mars, comet Halley, and asteroids. Chapter 4 describes how India's Vikram Sarabhai developed a sounding rocket program in the 1960 s. The following chapter describes the expansion of <b>the</b> Indian <b>space</b> <b>program.</b> Chapter 6 relates how <b>the</b> Indian <b>space</b> <b>program</b> is looking ahead {{to the success of the}} moon probe Chandrayan, due to launch in 2008, and its first manned launching in 2014. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 demonstrate how, in Iran, communications and remote sensing drive space technology. Chapter 10 outlines Brazil's road to <b>space,</b> begun in <b>the</b> mid- 1960 's with the launch of the Sonda sounding rockets. The following two chapters describe Brazil's satellites and space launch systems and plans for the future. Chapters 13 and 14 study Israel's <b>space</b> industry. <b>The</b> next chapters look at <b>the</b> burgeoning <b>space</b> <b>programs</b> of North and South Korea. The book ends by contrasting and comparing all <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>programs</b> and speculating how they may evolve in the future. An appendix lists all launches and launch attempts to date of <b>the</b> emerging <b>space</b> powers...|$|R

5|$|Due {{to reduced}} {{interest}} in his pre-war work, Coggins applied for a position teaching watercolor at Hunter College. He taught watercolor painting there from 1948 to 1952. In New York, {{as a result of}} his friendship with Fletcher Pratt, Coggins was introduced to the members of the Hydra Club, where he met Judith Merril and L. Ron Hubbard. Coggins was also invited to join Pratt's Trap Door Spiders club, where he became closely associated with L. Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov. The contact with such visionary thinkers complimented his exposure to the German V-2 rockets in Europe and served to strengthen his growing interest in space travel, rockets, and science fiction. In 1951 and 1952, Coggins collaborated again with Fletcher Pratt on two classic books: Rockets, Jets, Guided Missiles & Space Ships, and By Space Ship to the Moon. The books were released amidst the great wave of interest in space travel sweeping the United States and the rest of the world in the 1950s, and they were published in several countries and translated into other languages. These books made the prospect of space exploration seem a practical possibility. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientists used the books to demonstrate their ideas to Congressmen when seeking funding for <b>the</b> <b>space</b> <b>program,</b> and there are many NASA scientists today who retain fond memories of the influence the books had on their careers.|$|E
