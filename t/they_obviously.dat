5|$|In town, Creger {{watched as}} a forward element of the German {{infantry}} advanced, with weapons slung, into Lanzerath. <b>They</b> <b>obviously</b> {{did not expect to}} encounter any Americans. Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As he returned to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E
25|$|In Müllerian mimicry, a {{group of}} species benefit from each other's {{existence}} because they all are warningly colored {{in the same manner}} and are distasteful. The best examples of this phenomenon can be found within the Heliconius butterfly genus. Like in Batesian mimicry, the mimics are not necessarily related, although <b>they</b> <b>obviously</b> are in Heliconius.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has great}} {{importance}} in Boyle's films, {{as evidenced by}} the best-selling soundtracks for Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire, both of which feature a lot of pop and punk rock artists. In Boyle's view, songs can be “amazing things to use because <b>they</b> <b>obviously</b> bring a lot of baggage with them. They may have painful associations, and so they inter-breathe with the material you’re using”.|$|E

500|$|Contrary to the accusations, {{the band}} have always denied {{the notion that}} they are Satanists, with lead vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, doing so on-stage in the Live After Death concert video. Steve Harris has since commented that, [...] "It was mad. They {{completely}} got the wrong end of the stick. <b>They</b> <b>obviously</b> hadn't read the lyrics. They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists." [...] Harris has also stated that [...] "The Number of the Beast" [...] song was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching , and also influenced by Robert Burns' Tam o' Shanter. Furthermore, the band's drummer, Nicko McBrain, has been a born again Christian since 1999.|$|E
500|$|Actor Raphael Sbarge became {{attracted}} {{to join the}} series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world {{and the other in}} a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost [...] "in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and they kind of take them, effectively on a deep dive." [...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that <b>they</b> <b>obviously</b> recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{boost its}} declining readership, Deadline {{featured}} Tank Girl {{on its cover}} many times in 1994 and 1995 {{in anticipation of the}} film's release. Subsequently, Tom Astor said the release of the film: [...] "was very helpful, but it did not make up the difference, it lost some of its cult appeal without gaining any mainstream credibility." [...] The magazine ceased publication in late 1995. Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlett have since spoken negatively of their experiences creating the film, calling it [...] "a bit of a sore point" [...] for them. [...] "The script was lousy," [...] Hewlett recalled, [...] "me and Alan kept rewriting it and putting Grange Hill jokes and Benny Hill jokes in, and <b>they</b> <b>obviously</b> weren't getting it. They forgot to film about ten major scenes so we had to animate them... it was a horrible experience." [...] Talalay complained that the studio interfered significantly in the story, screenplay, and feel of the film. She said that she had been [...] "in sync" [...] and on good terms with Martin and Hewlett until the studio made significant cuts to the film, which she had no control over. Peter Milligan wrote an adaptation comic in 1995, and a novelization of the film by Martin Millar was published in 1996.|$|E

The reactions you got from the home crowd after routines were incredible. My mum went to the test event, and my grandma and grandpa went. They always say they're proud but I don't take it in – it's just me doing gymnastics. <b>They</b> <b>obviously</b> see {{it in a different}} way, as a major thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{called his}} team {{together}} {{the night before}} the Test began. His first words were [...] "Chaps, you have got to get stuck into this with me. I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it." [...] He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, <b>they</b> <b>obviously</b> could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.|$|E
2500|$|I {{spent a lot}} of {{time working}} on the project. I dug up hours of film, video, TV and radio {{material}} of John and Paul - so that Aidan and Jared could immerse themselves in the characters they were portraying. Much of the material was rare. What I especially wanted to give them were tapes of John and Paul talking when they were not [...] "on" [...] - but being themselves - as <b>they</b> <b>obviously</b> would be when the two of them were together without others around. We also spent hours discussing their characters and the dynamic of their relationship [...] Aidan and Jared were incredibly hard-working. They took their work very seriously. Neither of them planned to be IMPERSONATING their characters. They wanted to capture the ESSENCE of them more than anything.|$|E

2500|$|Judson {{was part}} of the company, but in many ways it was still very independent. [...] Financial backing came down from Pearl, but Judson still made {{decisions}} on their own, setting their own strategic goals independently of Pearl. [...] Whatever the decisions were at Judson, <b>they</b> <b>obviously</b> worked. [...] From the day Pearl acquired them, until they were sold off to members of the Atkinson's Candy family in 1983, Judson remained a profitable business. [...] When the Atkinsons bought Judson, the only real evidence of ownership by a larger company, and one in a completely different industry, was the office furniture and supplies. [...] Everything in the Judson offices were labeled with [...] "Property of the Pearl Brewing Company" [...] and items such as pencils, pens, ashtrays, notepads, and even first aid kits were branded with the Pearl logos.|$|E
2500|$|... "As a final {{observation}} {{it should}} be noted that because many of the scientific discoveries and theories referred to in the Bahá'í Writings were yet unknown to the contemporaries of Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá, <b>They</b> <b>obviously</b> could not have used the technical terms applied for their description nowadays. Instead, They had to make use of and sometimes redefine already existing concepts and terms (e.g. the ether concept or the idea of the four elements of ancient Greek philosophy) in a way that they would accurately explain what They had in mind. On a superficial level, this might give the impression that the Central Figures of the Faith did not actually formulate any new ideas about physical reality. [...] When we study Their Writings more closely, however, we come to realise that this only seems to be the case because Their references to such topics were purposely made in such a way that they would neither offend Their addressees who believed in certain (erroneous) contemporary scientific concepts, nor make use of a terminology that had not yet been developed by contemporary scientists." ...|$|E

6000|$|Before {{returning}} to business, the chiefs carefully inspected the black bottle, {{of which they}} had dispossessed William Bludger.
