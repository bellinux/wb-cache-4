50|$|The {{earliest}} corporate lineage for Cooper Tire was the M and M Manufacturing Company, {{founded in}} 1914 in Akron, Ohio by John F. Schaefer and Claude E. Hart, who were related by marriage. Their new company produced <b>tire</b> <b>patches,</b> <b>tire</b> cement and tire repair kits. They purchased The Giant Tire & Rubber Company of Akron, a tire rebuilding business, in 1920, and in 1922 moved {{the business to}} Findlay, Ohio, at a site {{at the intersection of}} Lima and Western avenues that is still occupied by Cooper Tire, adjacent to The Cooper Corporation facility. The Cooper name originates from 1919 when Cincinnati auto-parts dealer I. J. Cooper formed The Cooper Corporation in Findlay, to manufacture new tires. The Cooper Corporation, the M and M Company, and The Falls Rubber company merged in 1930 to form the Master Tire and Rubber Company. The company name was changed to Cooper Tire & Rubber Company in 1946.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tire</b> contact <b>patch</b> {{is readily}} changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may {{increase}} the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger. Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated. An increased tire pressure may decrease rolling resistance, and may also result in shorter stopping distances If tire pressure is too low, the <b>tire</b> contact <b>patch</b> is greatly increased. This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.|$|R
5000|$|The {{early days}} of motor travel took place on {{primitive}} roads that were littered with stray horseshoe nails. Punctures (flat tires) were all too common, and required the motorist to remove the wheel from the car, demount the <b>tire,</b> <b>patch</b> the inner tube, re-mount the tire, inflate the tire, and re-mount the wheel.|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} {{the percentage of}} front suspension braking anti-dive for outboard brakes, {{it is first necessary}} to {{determine the}} tangent of the angle between a line drawn, in side view, through the front <b>tire</b> <b>patch</b> and the front suspension instant center, and the horizontal. In addition, the percentage of braking effort at the front wheels must be known. Then, multiply the tangent by the front wheel braking effort percentage and divide by the ratio of the center of gravity height to the wheelbase. A value of 50% would mean that half of the weight transfer to the front wheels, during braking, is being transmitted through the front suspension linkage and half is being transmitted through the front suspension springs.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedA novel {{laboratory}} apparatus {{has been}} built to understand the key mechanisms behind spray emerging from a rolling tire. Several researchers have assessed the performance of spray suppression devices; however, there are no known efforts that address the question "what needs to be suppressed?" This investigation into how water in a tire groove evolves into a droplet field will ultimately contribute to driver safety.; Using high-speed imaging, water passing through a single circumferential groove was observed to leave the <b>tire</b> <b>patch</b> {{in the form of}} a thin liquid sheet, connecting the roadway and the tire. The sheet disintegrates into a droplet field and the breakup modes associated with this decay were identified with respect to Weber number.; Weber numbers based on the properties of water, tire speed and tire groove width were tested at 2700, 10900 and 24400. Measurements for the breakup length of the liquid sheet showed a dependence on Weber number proportional to We^(- 1 / 6). The lateral displacement of the water exiting the <b>tire</b> <b>patch</b> was also measured. These tests showed the overall size of the spray field grows with We; however, the maximum water volume for all We's was delivered to the same distance from the road.; Downstream from the <b>tire</b> <b>patch,</b> a determination of the droplet field was performed. From this study, the distribution of droplet sizes was determined as a function of Weber number. At We= 2, 700, droplet sizes between 80 and 9000 micrometers were detected, with a mean diameter near 800 micrometers. Both the range of droplet sizes and the mean diameter were found to decrease with Weber number by approximately We^(- 1 / 2). Based on these size distributions, Correlation Image Velocimetry (CIV) was used to estimate the distribution of droplet velocities as function of their size. These results reveal a strong correlation between droplet diameter and velocity which is comparable to that predicted for a simple sphere...|$|E

50|$|Some triathlon bikes use 650c wheels (a nominal {{diameter}} of 65 centimeters) {{rather than the}} conventional 700c wheels used on nearly all road bikes. The smaller wheels weigh less, have a smaller cross-sectional area (reducing wind resistance), and reduce the overall wind resistance of the bicycle by bringing the frame and cyclist closer to the ground.

40|$|An ABS control {{algorithm}} based on extremum seeking {{is presented in}} this brief. The optimum slip ratio between the <b>tire</b> <b>patch</b> and the road is searched online without having to estimate road friction conditions. This is achieved by adapting the extremum-seeking algorithm as a self-optimization routine that seeks the peak point of the tire force-slip curve. As an additional novelty, the proposed algorithm incorporates driver steering input into the optimization procedure to determine the operating region of the tires on the "tire force"-"slip ratio" characteristic-curve. The algorithm operates the tires near the peak point of the force-slip curve during straight line braking. When the driver demands lateral motion in addition to braking, the operating regions of the tires are modified automatically, for improving the lateral stability of the vehicle by increasing the tire lateral forces. A validated, full vehicle model is presented and used in a simulation study to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach.

40|$|Complex {{components}} like {{tires and}} flexible exhaust joints are subjected under customer usage conditions to large variations in magnitude and combination of multi-axial loading conditions and subsequent deformations. In order {{to evaluate the}} influence of the operational conditions on the functionability and the durability, the global multi-axial deformations need to be measured. The reliable determination of the complex deformation behavior of tires and flexible joints under service conditions is of great importance for the development of new tires and exhausts. The design and dimensioning, the verification of computer simulations as well as appropriate procedures for testing rely on such data. Analysis of occurring failure mechanisms and sources as well as the characterization of different design concepts are supported by the knowledge of the operational deformation conditions. Spring Loaded Deflection Transducers (SLDT) arranged in the different coordinate directions on the components can be applied to determine the multi-axial deformations. Inside of tires such sensors were installed between the tread and the rim. The deflection of the tread in radial, lateral and circumferential direction as well as the rotation of the <b>tire</b> <b>patch</b> can be calculated from the signals in a cross-section of the tire when driving. On flexible exhaust joints of passenger cars and light-trucks such deflection transducers were arranged between the two ends to measure the three dimensional deformations and rotations of the joints under different operational driving conditions. In this presentation the sensor concept, its adaptation to different measuring problems and the usage is described. Examples of measured deformations of passenger car and truck tires under different driving maneuvers are presented and discussed. Also the measured multi-axial deformations on flexible joints of a passenger car and a light truck are shown under different driving maneuvers being important for exhaust sys tems.

5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each <b>tire</b> contact <b>patch</b> there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting forward motion.

However, none of these structures have shown significant wear or deterioration or experienced failure. A total of five full-scale culvert specimens were constructed and tested in the University of Delaware Structures Laboratory. The dimensions of the first three specimens were 10 ft. x 2 ft. (3040 mm x 610 mm), Specimen 4 was 10 ft. x 11 ft 4 in. (3048 mm x 3454 mm), and Specimen 5 was 16 ft. x 2 ft. (4877 mm x 610 mm). The loading configuration varied between a single <b>tire</b> <b>patch</b> at mid-span and AASHTO tandem axle loading. The loading protocol consisted of loading the specimen to a specific load level and holding the load until the displacements and strains held constant. Subsequently, the specimen was unloaded to a small value before it was reloaded to a higher load. This was repeated until the specimens failed. The ultimate failure modes for Specimens 1, 2, 3, and 5 was shear which occurred after excessive deflections were present. In all cases, the regions with the maximum positive and negative bending moments were able to develop plastic hinges, i. e. yield moments were reached to form a mechanism. Specimen 4 failed in punching shear rather than flexural-mode due to the effective transverse load distribution. University of Delaware, Department of Civil and Environmental EngineeringM. C.

40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the physics of}} weight transfer. You will often hear instructors and drivers say that applying the brakes shifts weight {{to the front of}} a car and can induce oversteer. Likewise, accelerating shifts weight to the rear, inducing understeer, and cornering shifts weight to the opposite side, unloading the inside tires. But why does weight shift during these maneuvers? How can weight shift when everything is in the car bolted in and strapped down? Briefly, the reason is that inertia acts through the center of gravity (CG) of the car, which is above the ground, but adhesive forces act at ground level through the <b>tire</b> contact <b>patches.</b> The e#ects of weight transfer are proportional to the height of the CG o# the ground.
