5|$|Arnost Rosin (prisoner no. 29858) and Czesław Mordowicz (prisoner no. 84216) {{escaped from}} Auschwitz on 27 May 1944 and arrived in Slovakia on 6 June, {{the day of}} the Normandy landings. Hearing about the {{invasion}} of Normandy and believing <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> they got drunk to celebrate, using dollars they had smuggled out of Auschwitz. They were promptly arrested for violating the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|As {{the end of}} war {{approached}} and hostilities with the Sioux Indians loomed, Raynolds's knowledge of and experiences in the Great Lakes region became {{more important to the}} army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. As a result, he returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses in April 1864, and saw no further combat {{for the rest of his}} career. Before <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to brigadier general for meritorious service.|$|E

5|$|Despite her {{progress}} in the field, Alexander only ever considered radio astronomy a job {{and as soon as}} <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> she returned to her passion of geology, never again working in radio astronomy.

5|$|From late 1919 {{until the}} 1921 Treaty of Riga, Cooper {{was a member}} of a {{volunteer}} American flight squadron, the Kościuszko Squadron, which supported the Polish Army in the Polish-Soviet War. On July 13, 1920, his plane was shot down and he spent nearly nine months in a Soviet prisoner of war camp where the writer Isaac Babel interviewed him. He escaped just before <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> and made it to Latvia. For his valor he was decorated by Polish commander-in-chief Józef Piłsudski with the highest Polish military decoration, the Virtuti Militari.|$|E

5|$|The Marietta-class {{monitors}} were {{a pair of}} ironclad river monitors {{laid down}} {{in the summer of}} 1862 for the United States Navy during the American Civil War. Construction was slow, partially for lack of labor, and the ships were not completed until December 1865, after <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> However the navy did not accept them until 1866 and immediately laid them up. They were sold in 1873 without ever having been commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Although {{instrumental}} in drafting the Treaty of Vereeniging, Reitz personally {{did not want}} to swear allegiance to the British government, and he chose to go into exile. On 4 July 1902 he left South Africa and joined his wife and children in the Netherlands. To alleviate his financial troubles, Reitz set out on a lecture tour in the United States. Due to a waning interest in the Boer cause now that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> the tour failed, forcing Reitz to return to the Netherlands. Here his health failed him again, leading to hospitalisation and an extensive period of convalescing. During this time he was supported by his friends W.J. Leyds and H.P.N. Muller and the Nederlandsch Zuid-Afrikaansche Vereeniging (Dutch South-African Society).|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{returned}} to the United Kingdom via Sweden, after episodes of unruly behaviour in Oslo. In the United Kingdom he had a personal audience with King Haakon VII of Norway. During the audience, Andersen and the King lunched at the Norwegian Club in London, and Andersen entertained the exiled monarch with stories. The King promised {{to take care of}} Andersen once <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> Andersen then joined the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy and served on a Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) {{for the duration of the}} war. The MTB on which Andersen served repeatedly attacked shipping off the Norwegian coast.|$|E

5|$|He {{was more}} {{directly}} involved in the activities of the commissioned raiders, ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce. He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30, 1861. From then until after <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> the small group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; {{at first he}} had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back to}} the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was ordered}} into active duty {{military}} service on 1 September 1942 at Camp White, Oregon {{in preparation for}} deployment to Europe during World War II. During World War II, the regiment saw action in the European Theater, undertaking numerous bridging and mobility missions in Normandy, Northern France, the Rhineland and the Ardennes area. The Regiment was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service during the war. After <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over</b> in 1945, the regiment remained in the country until it was inactivated on 17 June 1946 in Germany. A year later, on 27 May 1947 the regiment was reactivated with its Headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. It was again inactivated on 31 December 1948 in Detroit.|$|E

5|$|Just as World War I had a {{significant}} impact on the college, World War II was pivotal in the college's history too. Within four days of the attack on Pearl Harbor, thirteen students withdrew from the college to join the military. The enrollment dropped from 2,077 students in 1940 to a low of 860 students (21% were men) in spring 1943. Faculty decreased to as low as 60 from 112 before the war had begun. Before <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> 3,500 SDSC graduates, students, former students, and faculty entered the armed forces, with 135 losing their lives. Not surprisingly for a city dominated by a naval base, a large majority joined the Navy. Others joined the Air Corps, participating in the Doolittle Raid over Japan and battles over the Philippines and the East Indies.|$|E
5|$|The United Kingdom and her Allies {{had been}} at war against Napoleon's French Empire since 1803, but by early 1814 Wellington's army had fought {{its way through the}} Peninsula to France, and the eastern Allies were {{threatening}} France's eastern borders. On 31 March 1814, allied armies entered Paris, and Napoleon abdicated on 6 April. Within a month of Napoleon's abdication, he had been exiled to Elba. It appeared that <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> and arrangements for the peace were discussed at the Congress of Vienna. But on 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France, where he raised an army.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the conflict in England gradually began to shift; by the late 1140s, the major fighting in <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> giving way to an intractable stalemate, with only the occasional outbreak of fresh fighting. Several of Matilda's key supporters died: in 1147 Robert of Gloucester died peacefully, and Brian Fitz Count gradually withdrew from public life, probably eventually joining a monastery; by 1151 he was dead. Many of Matilda's other followers joined the Second Crusade {{when it was announced}} in 1145, leaving the region for several years. Some of the Anglo-Norman barons made individual peace agreements with each other to secure their lands and war gains, and many were not keen to pursue any further conflict.|$|E
