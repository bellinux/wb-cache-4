5|$|The 15-inch turrets {{had been}} {{designed}} when the customary practice was to place the magazine above the shell room, {{and it was not}} cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement which was adopted after the Battle of Jutland demonstrated the dangers of exposing <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.|$|E
5000|$|Magazines are {{inserted}} into <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> well, {{which is located}} {{to the rear of}} the pistol grip. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> is inserted front-first into the well so that the notch on the front of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> is retained in <b>the</b> well. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> is then [...] "rocked" [...] into place by rotating the rear of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> upwards into <b>the</b> well (in a manner similar to the AK-47 series) until <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> release to <b>the</b> rear of the well is engaged. To release <b>the</b> <b>magazine,</b> <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> release is pressed rearward, and <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> pivoted forward and disengaged from the front recess.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> is {{more akin}} to European and American {{videogames}} magazines than Finnish ones with its focus on exclusive coverage on the latest games and extensive interviews {{with members of the}} development community. Game reviews are also a big part of <b>the</b> <b>magazine.</b> <b>The</b> <b>magazine's</b> tagline is [...] "for the love of gaming" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>magazine's</b> staff are hardcore gaming enthusiasts, which is evident in the passionate writing of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> features. <b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> was started because the people working on <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> felt there was no high quality games magazine available in Finland which would focus on console games rather than the PC. Another feature is the international vibe of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> via Japan- and US- based writers contributing to <b>the</b> <b>magazine.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite these additions, {{the ship}} was still felt to be too {{vulnerable}} to plunging fire and Renown was refitted in Rosyth between 1 February and mid-April 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> and over the steering gear.

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, however, Newton and Bourdin's star power had faded, and <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> was [...] "stuck in a rut".

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>magazine</b> has no {{ties with}} media groups or {{political}} parties. During the formative years <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> adhered to liberal Christian stance, but later it abandoned it. At {{the same time}} <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> {{was one of the}} media outlets, which expressed a culture of dissidence. By the late 1950s <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> began to adopt a progressive stance. The headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> was seized by the Francoist forces. During the 1970s it supported the democratic transition to end Francoist era.

5|$|FN's 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} {{cases are}} covered with a special polymer coating for easier extraction with the PS90 carbine due to the high chamber pressures and lack of case tapering. In addition, this coating ensures proper feeding and function in <b>the</b> <b>magazines.</b>|$|E
5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} blown up {{by her own}} guns. At the second board, eyewitnesses {{reported}} unusual types of discharge from the 15-inch guns of Hood, suggesting that a shell could have detonated within the gun, causing an explosion within the gunhouse. It is possible that, under the stress of combat, the safety measures, introduced after the disasters at Jutland to prevent such an explosion reaching <b>the</b> <b>magazines,</b> could have failed.|$|E

5|$|The turrets {{were placed}} on pear-shaped barbettes; the first six ships had this arrangement, but the last two, Caesar and Illustrious, had {{circular}} barbettes. The BII mountings {{in the first six}} ships allowed all-around loading from the supply of ready ammunition kept in the turret, but the guns had to return to the centerline to bring ammunition up from <b>the</b> <b>magazines,</b> as the ammunition hoists did not rotate with the turret. Caesar and Illustrious, with their circular barbettes, had BIII mountings with rotating hoists, and these allowed all-around loading from <b>the</b> <b>magazines.</b> Both the BII and BIII mounts had a range of elevation from 5degrees to 13.5degrees, with the loading angle at maximum elevation. During World War I, four of the Majestics were disarmed, and these guns were used to arm eight s. A further two turrets from Illustrious were later emplaced as coastal guns on the Tyne.|$|E
5|$|After Maine and Missouri entered service, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the North Atlantic Fleet, while Ohio, built on the West Coast of the United States, was instead sent to serve as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet based in the Philippines. In April 1904, a turret fire killed 36 men aboard Missouri, but the quick action of three men prevented the fire from reaching <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> and destroying the ship, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1907, Ohio returned from the western Pacific and joined her sisters in what was now the Atlantic Fleet. During this period, Maine served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907.|$|E
5|$|Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories were merged in 1930 as Wonder Stories, and the {{quarterly}} was renamed Wonder Stories Quarterly. <b>The</b> <b>magazines</b> were not financially successful, and in 1936 Gernsback sold Wonder Stories to Ned Pines at Beacon Publications, where, retitled Thrilling Wonder Stories, it continued for nearly 20years. The last issue was dated Winter 1955, {{and the title}} was then merged with Startling Stories, another of Pines' science fiction magazines. Startling itself lasted only {{to the end of}} 1955 before finally succumbing to the decline of the pulp magazine industry.|$|E

5|$|Bibliographers do {{not always}} agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of Amazing. For example, Gernsback was in control {{for the first three}} years, but Sloane {{performed}} all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in <b>the</b> <b>magazines,</b> with short notes added. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1949 Street & Smith, {{one of the largest}} pulp publishers, had shut down every one of their pulps. This format was dying out, though it took several more years before the pulps {{completely}} disappeared from the newsstands. Both Thrilling Wonder and Startling went quarterly in 1954, {{and at the end of}} that year Mines left. <b>The</b> <b>magazines</b> did not survive him for long; only two more issues of Thrilling Wonder appeared, both edited by Alexander Samalman. After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling Wonder was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E
5|$|Despite these additions, {{the ship}} was still felt to be too {{vulnerable}} to plunging fire and Repulse was refitted in Rosyth between 10 November 1916 and 29 January 1917 with additional horizontal armour, weighing approximately , added to the decks over <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> and over the steering gear. Repulse was the first capital ship fitted with a flying-off platform when an experimental one was fitted on 'B' turret {{in the autumn of}} 1917. Squadron Leader Frederick Rutland took off in a Sopwith Pup on 1 October. Another platform was built on 'Y' turret and Rutland successfully took off from it on 8 October. One fighter and a reconnaissance aircraft were normally carried.|$|E

5|$|He {{published}} for {{the first}} time under his own name in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E
5|$|If all turrets {{were on the}} {{centreline}} of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames {{were relatively}} low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and <b>the</b> <b>magazines</b> which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines. For these reasons, , which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Browne {{convinced}} Ziff-Davis to try {{a high-quality}} digest fantasy magazine. Fantastic, {{which appeared in the}} summer of that year, focused on fantasy rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both Amazing and Fantastic. Fantastic began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in <b>the</b> <b>magazines.</b>|$|E
