40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of health usage monitoring systems on helicopters, a lot of research has been undertaken for diagnosis of transmission components. However, most of these works are performed in laboratory environments and there are hardly any published works on in-service application. In this study, we present an experience in diagnosis of a helicopter gearbox bearing using actual service data gathered from AH 64 D helicopters belonging to the Republic of Singapore Air Force. A number of helicopters have been found with grease leak and radial play in the tail rotor gearbox output shaft during field maintenance. Subsequent tear-down inspections of the tail rotor gearboxes revealed that they had similar defects of bearing race spalling and widespread pitting of the rolling elements. Spectral analysis was carried out on the accelerometer data from these helicopters and correlated with the <b>tear-down</b> <b>inspection</b> findings. The fault patterns exhibited correspond well to progressing stages of bearing wear and are consistent across defective gearboxes from different helicopters. It is demonstrated that simple spectral analysis can be effective in tracking progressive stages of bearing damage using both low-frequency and high-frequency bandwidths. The observed fault patterns are extracted as features for diagnosis and used to determine the bearings' estimated time to failure for maintenance planning...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{testing was}} {{completed}} {{on the ground}} handling equipment for transporting the Ce/sup 144 / heat source container and loading the SNAP 1 A generator. Mercury shield fill and drain tests for the generator system and the collar shield were conducted. Heat-transfer tests of the isotope heat source shipping cask were conducted. Simulated rocket-launch environmental tests of vibration, acceleration, and shock were completed on the G- 2 generator. Analysis of the environmental test data was initiated. Final dssign studies for the G- 3 generator were completed, and a thermoelectric module concept was selected {{for use in the}} isotope-fueled generator. Development tests of thermoelectric modules in a module tester were initiated. Voltage breakdown tests were conducted on a porcelain enamel spray coat. The matenial was evaluated for application to the G- 3 generator inner skin as a possible second discrete barrier against hot junction electrical shorts. SNAP 3 generator 3 M- 1 G 10 completed 322 days of life test operation, and the power input was terminated after the generator was operated under a full range of external loads to obtain performance characteristics. Electrical power output after 322 days at steady-state heat source and external load conditions was 1. 92 watts, for an over-all efficiency of 2. 9 %. <b>Tear-down</b> <b>inspection</b> of the generator conformed previous indications of incrsased internal electrical resistance and thermal conductivity, which account for the gradual reduction in generator performance from the start-of-life electrical output of 3. 45 watts and 5. 2 % over-all efficiency. The SNAP 3 3 M- 1 G 5 generator was successfully fueled with Po/sup 210 /. Maximum electrical power output was 4 watts at an over-all efficiency of 5. 2 %. Radiological safety studies for space power were initiated. (For preceding period see MND-P- 3012 -I.) (auth...|$|E
40|$|Many {{structures}} continue {{being used}} despite the great time {{of life and}} the possibility presenting accumulated damages, or same it contend errors of project that will be able to originate future defects. Therefore, the ability to monitor the condition of these structures, in other words, its integrity structural, it has become in the last years a very important research area, mainly, for economic and security reasons. This area usually is called of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). There are several advantages for using a SHM system over traditional inspection cycles, such as reduced down-time, elimination of component <b>tear-down</b> <b>inspections</b> and the potential prevention of failure during operation. The idea of SHM consists in compare states of system in different times; with changes in these states, damages can be identified by detection indexes. Many researchers have studied SHM technologies integrating the state observer methodology because the state observers can reconstruct the states that were not measured or estimate the motion of the system that cannot be measured directly. In this context, this paper proposes to apply the state observer methodology, based in modal data, to damage detection in a steel structure of three floors...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} team of U. S. Government agencies and engine manufacturers are designing an experiment to test volcanic-ash ingestion by a NASA owned F 117 engine that was {{donated by the}} U. S. Air Force. The experiment is being conducted {{under the auspices of}} NASA s Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR) Program and will take place in early 2014 at Edwards AFB in California as an on-ground, on-wing test. The primary objectives are to determine the effect on the engine of several hours of exposure to low to moderate ash concentrations, currently proposed at 1 and 10 mg/m 3 and to evaluate the capability of engine health management technologies for detecting these effects. A natural volcanic ash will be used that is representative of distal ash clouds many 100 's to approximately 1000 km from a volcanic source i. e., the ash should be composed of fresh glassy particles a few tens of microns in size. The glassy ash particles are expected to soften and become less viscous when exposed to the high temperatures of the combustion chamber, then stick to the nozzle guide vanes of the high-pressure turbine. Numerous observations and measurements of the engine s performance and degradation will be made {{during the course of the}} experiment, including borescope and <b>tear-down</b> <b>inspections.</b> While not intended to be sufficient for rigorous certification of engine performance when ash is ingested, the experiment should provide useful information to aircraft manufacturers, airline operators, and military and civil regulators in their efforts to evaluate the range of risks that ash hazards pose to aviation...|$|R
40|$|Emergency diesel {{generators}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important contributors to the core damage failure rate of nuclear power plants. Current required testing and maintenance procedures are excessively strict and expensive without any real justification. Probabilistic risk assessment is used to propose a monitoring system and Technical Specification changes to reduce EDG unavailability without jeopardizing safety, and to ease the excessive deterministic requirements. The EDG fault tree is analyzed to identify the critical failure modes of the EDG, the failure of service water pumps, the failure of EDG building ventilation dampers, and the failure of the EDG "supercomponent," which includes the fuel oil, lubricating oil, cooling water, and starting air systems. We use data from the nuclear industry and the U. S. Navy to identify the most significant EDG supercomponent failure modes, including system fluid leakages, instrumentation & controls failures, electrical power output failures, and the fuel system governors. The monitoring system proposed includes instrumentation for twenty-one of the 121 basic events in the fault tree, for a total of 94. 9 % of EDG failure contributions. The failure modes identified with industry data are monitored, as are diesel engine mechanical failures currently assessed with teardown inspections. With a 50 % reduction in these twenty-one basic event failure rates, the EDG system failure rate is reduced by 41. 6 %, from 0. 097 per year to 0. 059 per year. With this reduced failure rate, we propose to extend the EDG surveillance interval from one month to twelve months, to lengthen the running tests from one hour to twenty-four hours, and to eliminate the <b>tear-down</b> <b>inspections</b> conducted during refueling outages. To fully assess the benefits of these proposed changes, the monitoring system should be installed on an EDG on a trial basis. The work reported here demonstrates the feasible gains which can be realized, and proposes, a method for evaluating the efficacy of the system as realized through experimentation.
