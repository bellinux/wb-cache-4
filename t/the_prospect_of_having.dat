5|$|The {{loss of the}} Cardiff Devils and the Newcastle Jesters in 2001 {{reduced the}} {{membership}} of the Superleague to seven; and when the Manchester Storm and the Scottish Eagles folded within a week of one another {{at the beginning of the}} 2002–03 season, there were just five remaining teams. In December 2002, the Bracknell Bees announced their intention to resign from the league to join the BNL at the end of the season; and uncertainty surrounded the future of the London Knights and their London Arena home; which ultimately led to the Knights folding in 2003. Owing a large debt to Ice Hockey UK and facing <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> only three members, the league placed itself into liquidation on 30 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|While {{the saga}} records that Frakökk was killed to avenge {{the burning of}} Óláfr, {{recently}} scholars Angelo Forte, Richard Oram, and Frederick Pedersen, stated that her fate was actually sealed by her support of Erlendr Haraldsson's bid for the earldom, over the claim of Haraldr Maddaðarson. Haraldr {{was the son of}} Earl Maddaðr, and Margrét Hákonardóttir (married in about 1134). Margrét was a niece of Frakökk, and Earl Maddaðr was possibly a cousin of the David I. The union between Earl Maddaðr and Margrét benefited the Scottish Crown by increasing Scottish influence in the north at the expense of Norwegian influence. Also, in the 1120s and 1130s, David I had faced challenges to his authority. A large part of the support for these challengers came from Moray and Ross—these lands were directly between the northern lands of Caithness and Orkney, and David's strength to the south. According to the Forte, Oram, and Pedersen, <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the son of one of his northern supporters as the earl of Caithness was too good for the king to pass up—especially since Haraldr was still a minor, and would thus be under the direction of an appointed tutor. As it turned out, the installation of Haraldr as an earl of Orkney and Caithness was a triumph for the Scottish Crown: in the 1140s, Sutherland and Caithness were further integrated into the kingdom, and the Norwegian influence in Orkney was neutralised.|$|E

25|$|Several guerrilla groups {{seeking to}} {{establish}} an independent Assamese state in northeast India have set up guerrilla bases in the forests of southern Bhutan, from which they launched cross-border attacks on targets in Assam.

25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{controversy}} {{erupted in}} the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began scrambling their programming and charging fees to home satellite dish owners who accessed the same satellite signals that cable operators received. Many satellite dish owners faced <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to purchase descrambling equipment {{at a cost of}} hundreds of dollars, as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.|$|E
25|$|Following defeat by Napoleon in 1805, Austria {{was forced}} to cede Tyrol to the Kingdom of Bavaria in the Peace of Pressburg. Tyrol, {{as a part of}} Bavaria, {{became a member of the}} Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. Consequently, King Maximilian I of Bavaria {{introduced}} far reaching economic, religious and administrative reforms. When in 1808 a new constitution for the Kingdom of Bavaria was introduced, Tyrol was integrated into South Bavaria, and divided into three districts, losing its special status in the kingdom. Furthermore, Tyroleans were now subjected to the Bavarian conscription levies, and faced <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to fight against Austrian troops. This, together with the economic decline under Bavarian rule, and the kingdom's religious reforms which were opposed by the Catholic population, led to a growing conflict between the Tyrolean population and the Bavarian authorities.|$|E

25|$|In his {{political}} career, Turner held several prominent Cabinet posts, including {{minister of justice}} and minister of finance, under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1968 to 1975. Amid a global recession and <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to implement the unpopular wage and price controls, Turner surprisingly resigned his position in 1975. After a hiatus from politics from 1975 to 1984, Turner returned and successfully contested the Liberal leadership. Turner held the office of prime minister for 79 days (the second shortest tenure in Canadian history after Sir Charles Tupper), as he advised the Governor General to dissolve parliament immediately after being sworn in as prime minister, {{and went on to}} lose the 1984 election in a landslide. Turner stayed on as Liberal leader and headed the Official Opposition for the next six years, leading his party to a modest recovery in the 1988 campaign; he resigned as Liberal leader in 1990 and stepped down as an MP at the 1993 election. Turner was Canada's first prime minister born in the United Kingdom since Mackenzie Bowell in 1896.|$|E

500|$|Crean's biographer Michael Smith {{suggests}} that Crean {{would have been}} a better choice for the polar party than Edgar Evans, who was weakened by a recent hand injury (of which Scott was unaware). Crean, considered one of the toughest men in the expedition, had led a pony across the Barrier and had thus been saved much of the hard labour of man-hauling. Scott's critical biographer Roland Huntford records that the surgeon Edward L Atkinson, who had accompanied the southern party {{to the top of the}} Beardmore, had recommended either Lashly or Crean for the polar party rather than Edgar Evans.

500|$|Attempting to form {{a viable}} white {{opposition}} to the Rhodesian Front, the UFP resurrected itself around Welensky, renamed itself the Rhodesia Party, and entered the Arundel and Avondale by-elections that had been called for 1 October 1964. Perturbed by <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to face the political heavyweight Welensky in parliament {{at the head of}} the opposition, the RF poured huge resources into winning both of these former UFP safe seats, and fielded Clifford Dupont, Smith's deputy, against Welensky in Arundel. The RF won both seats comfortably, and the Rhodesia Party soon faded away. Spurred on by this success, Smith organised the indaba for 22 October, and called a general independence referendum for 5 November 1964. Meanwhile, Wilson wrote a number of letters to Southern Rhodesian black nationalists, assuring them that [...] "the Labour Party is totally opposed to granting independence to Southern Rhodesia so long as the government of that country remains under the control of the white minority".|$|E

Parker said they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because [...] "we thought it was funny", and because they wanted to do something different from the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis.

500|$|Edward {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Wallis Simpson, an American citizen and wife of British shipping executive Ernest Aldrich Simpson, by Lady Furness on 10 January 1931. Ernest Simpson was Wallis's second husband; her first marriage, to U.S. Navy pilot Win Spencer, had ended in divorce in 1927. It is generally accepted that Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales became lovers in 1934, while Lady Furness (who was also {{in a relationship with}} the prince) was visiting relatives in America. However, Edward adamantly insisted to his father that he was not physically intimate with Simpson and that it was inappropriate to describe her as his mistress. Edward's relationship with Simpson further weakened his poor relationship with his parents. Although King George V and Queen Mary met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935, they later refused to receive her. Edward and Simpson were secretly followed by members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch, who produced reports on the nature of their relationship and their investigations into Wallis Simpson's private life that included the [...] "pursuit of vicious gossip" [...] and the identification of a [...] "secret lover". <b>The</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> an American divorcee with a questionable past having such sway over the heir apparent led to anxiety among government and establishment figures.|$|E
