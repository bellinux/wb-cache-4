5|$|Copies were {{leaked to}} the press via a Dutch news agency during the 1983 general {{election}} campaign. The U.S. State Department and British Government believed <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> be propaganda produced by the KGB (as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and The Sunday Times). Although the tape was produced anonymously, The Observer linked the tape with the band. Previously classified government documents made public in January 2014 under the UK's 'Thirty Year Rule' reveal that the prime minister was personally aware of the tape and had discussed it with her cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Peggy and Al {{return home}} and show <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> Steve and Marcy, who are {{embarrassed by the}} film, much {{to the delight of}} the Bundys. The Rhoades express their dismay that they were {{secretly}} recorded, but Steve points out that the Bundys may have been videotaped as well. Marcy and Al are upset by this violation of their privacy and propose physical violence against the owners of the motel. Steve and Peg, on the other hand, want to take action against the Hop-On-Inn and make money from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in United States v. Nixon, the Court ruled {{unanimously}} (8 to 0) that claims of executive privilege over <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> were void. (Then-Justice William Rehnquist—who {{had recently been}} appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served in the Nixon Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President <b>to</b> release <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released <b>the</b> subpoenaed <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public.|$|R

5|$|Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get {{inspiration}} {{for a new}} Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide to cut a demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night.|$|E
25|$|With Roger Ramey {{waiting in}} his office, Brown took <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> Jimmy Bowen, President of MCA Nashville at the time.

25|$|On November 16, the 9th Circuit Court {{rejected}} Anderson's {{appeal and}} ruled {{that he must}} return to prison for refusing {{to testify before the}} grand jury investigating Bonds. The court ordered him to report to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin by November 20. The court agreed with Judge Alsup, ruling there was ample evidence beyond <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> justify the grand jury's interest in questioning Anderson about Bonds. Anderson's lawyers announced they would seek an appeal before the entire 9th Circuit Court.|$|E
50|$|After {{an initial}} refusal to comply {{on the grounds}} of {{executive}} privilege, Nixon offered <b>to</b> remit <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> a respected U.S. Senator, John C.

25|$|In 1976, Prince {{created a}} demo tape with {{producer}} Chris Moon, in Moon's Minneapolis studio. Unable {{to secure a}} recording contract, Moon brought <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> Owen Husney, a Minneapolis businessman, who signed Prince, age 17, to a management contract, and helped him create a demo at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis (with producer/engineer David Z). The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney's ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies including Warner Bros. Records, A Records, and Columbia Records.|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, Bale {{flew into}} an angry tirade {{on the set}} of Terminator Salvation, while filming in New Mexico. In February 2009, the audio {{recording}} of the incident was released. The tirade was directed at Shane Hurlbut, director of photography for the film. According to Bale, Hurlbut had, for the second time, ruined his concentration by walking onto the set during a scene. The recording is of Bale directing profanities at Hurlbut, threatening and belittling him, and finally threatening to quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the offense without being fired for it. It was reported that Warner film executives sent <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> the insurer of the film in case Bale decided to quit the movie.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cassettes}} {{were made}} to play a continuous loop of tape without stopping. Lengths available are from around 30 seconds to a standard full length. They are used in situations where a short message or musical jingle is to be played, either continuously or whenever a device is triggered, or whenever continuous recording or playing is needed. Some include a sensing foil on <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> allow tape players to re-cue. From as early as 1969 various patents have been issued, covering such uses as uni-directional, bi-directional, and compatibility with auto-shut-off and anti-tape-eating mechanisms. One variant has a half-width loop of tape for an answering machine outgoing message, and another half-width tape on spools to record incoming messages.|$|E
50|$|Goldberg urged Tripp to {{take the}} {{resulting}} 20 hours of <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr who had a broad mandate to investigate improprieties by Clinton. Goldberg also brought <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of lawyers working on the Paula Jones sexual harassment case against Clinton. <b>The</b> <b>tapes</b> became crucial <b>to</b> Starr's investigation on whether Clinton committed perjury during a sworn deposition when he denied his affair with Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment by the House and acquittal by the Senate.|$|R
50|$|Philips {{developed}} an alternative noise reduction system known as Dynamic Noise Limiter (DNL) {{which did not}} require <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> be processed during recording; {{this was also the}} basis of the later DNR noise reduction.|$|R
50|$|Higelin was {{reportedly}} {{dissatisfied with the}} record, and wanted <b>to</b> destroy <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> avoid releasing it, but was persuaded otherwise by his friends, musicians Laurent Thibaut and Francis Moze. Higelin came later to appreciate it somewhat.|$|R
25|$|A video {{recording}} {{made by a}} UNIFIL soldier of Force Mobile Reserve (FMR) showed an unmanned drone and two helicopters in the vicinity {{at the time of}} the shelling. An Israeli government spokesman confirmed there was a drone in the area, but stated that it did not detect civilians in the compound. The IDF initially and repeatedly claimed, in response to the UN investigator, Dutch major-general Frank van Kappen's questioning, that no drone was flying in the area before or during the shelling. All eyewitnesses testified that during the attack a pilotless drone hovered over the camp. The truth only emerged when the UNIFIL soldier secretly delivered <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> Beirut-based journalist Robert Fisk. Fisk sent the video to his newspaper, The Independent, which published stills of the footage in an article that appeared on May 6.|$|E
25|$|The series The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa had a direct-to-video film named Around the World with Timon and Pumbaa, with Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella reprising {{their roles}} as Timon and Pumbaa respectively. The story tells of Pumbaa getting struck by {{lightning}}, losing all his memory, and Timon helps refrain every moment they spent. After Pumbaa gets his memory back, lightning strikes Timon losing his memory this time, making Pumbaa break the fourth wall by telling the viewers to rewind <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> start at the beginning, being {{it was the only}} way to help Timon remember. Several episodes from the series are featured in this film. Aside from this film, two other DVDs, Dining Out... and On Holiday... are an hour compilation of other episodes of the series. No DVDs have been released in the U.S. but were released on VHS.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Netanyahu confessed on live {{television}} to having {{had an affair}} with Ruth Bar, his public relations adviser, claiming that a political rival had planted a secret video camera that had recorded him in a sexually compromising position with Bar, and that he had been threatened with the release of <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> the press unless he quit the Likud leadership race. Benjamin and Sara repaired their marriage, and Netanyahu was elected to the leadership of Likud. In 1996, there were media reports of his 20-year friendship with Katherine Price-Mondadori, an Italian-American woman. During the 1990s, Netanyahu criticized this media intrusion into his private life, claiming that political rivals including David Levy had hired spies on him {{in order to try to}} gather evidence of alleged affairs, although it was noted that the Israeli public are generally not interested in their politician's private lives and would prefer they remained private.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, after Rick Wurpel re-opened his {{production}} business, he realised that {{neither he nor}} TTS had <b>the</b> master <b>tapes</b> in their inventory and feared {{that they had been}} lost. He discovered the Denver City Council possessed <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> among an inventory of 164 recordings. A former employee of Wurpel had been storing <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> and intended <b>to</b> dispose of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of <b>the</b> <b>tapes.</b> Legal proceedings subsequently ensued <b>to</b> return <b>the</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>to</b> Wurpel and U2.|$|R

25|$|The main {{contention}} of Anderson's appeal {{is that a}} secret, illegally recorded tape of him discussing Bonds' steroid use {{was the basis for}} the grand jury questions he refused to answer. Prosecutors, however, said the tape was legal and was made in a face-to-face meeting with Anderson. Although Judge Alsup dismissed Anderson's tape claim and others, the 9th Circuit Court sent Anderson's appeal back to the judge, saying Alsup's ruling regarding the tape was not clear enough. In clarifying his order, Alsup said he agreed with prosecutors that there was ample evidence beyond <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> question Anderson. Prosecutors also said the questions they wanted answered were based on athletes' secret testimony in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case and a search of Anderson's house that turned up drug records, some with Bonds' name on it. Other than the tape dispute, the 9th Circuit Court had rejected the merits of Anderson's appeal.|$|E
25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E
500|$|Vaughan and McCartney {{left before}} the evening show which started at 8 o'clock. During the {{performance}} there was an unexpected thunderstorm, which made the lights go out. Bob Molyneux, a young schoolmate from Quarry Bank, recorded part of the performance on his Grundig TK8 portable reel-to-reel tape recorder. The tape included versions of Lonnie Donegan's [...] "Puttin' on the Style" [...] and Elvis' [...] "Baby Let's Play House". In 1963, Molyneux offered <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>to</b> Lennon via Ringo Starr, but Lennon never responded, so Molyneux put the tape in a vault.|$|E

500|$|In January 1967, after {{both groups}} had split, Phillips and Rutherford {{continued}} to write together {{and proceeded to}} make a demo tape at a friend's home-made studio, inviting Banks, Gabriel, and Stewart to record {{with them in the}} process. The five recorded six songs: [...] "Don't Want You Back", [...] "Try a Little Sadness", [...] "She's Beautiful", [...] "That's Me", [...] "Listen on Five", and [...] "Patricia", an instrumental. When they wished to have them professionally recorded they sought Charterhouse alumnus Jonathan King, who seemed a natural choice as their publisher and producer following the success of his 1965 UK top five single, [...] "Everyone's Gone to the Moon".
