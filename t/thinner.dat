Analyzing the models using a <b>thinning</b> intensity defined as the volume removed in a previous <b>thinning,</b> as was used by Nishizono (2010) resulted in a poorer fit. The definition of <b>thinning</b> intensity that was implemented (volume removed divided by time since <b>thinning)</b> results in the effect of the <b>thinning</b> in the model dwindling over time.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 <b>Thinning</b> {{of young}} Douglas-fir forests has the {{potential}} to enhance structural diversity and improve habitat for wildlife. I examined the effects of <b>thinning</b> and <b>thinning</b> intensity on abundance and demographic characteristics of forest-floor small mammals in the Coast Range of Oregon 5 and 6 years after <b>thinning</b> had occurred. <b>Thinning</b> resulted in greater densities of Townsend's chipmunks (Tamias townsendii), creeping voles (Microtus oregoni), and Pacific jumping mice (Zapus trinotatus), and densities of chipmunks and creeping voles were greater in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands than in moderately <b>thinned</b> stands. Movement of female chipmunks was less in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands and movement of female deer mice was less in <b>thinned</b> stands. Sex ratios of deer mice and creeping voles were skewed toward females in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. Body mass of male deer mice was also greater in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. <b>Thinning</b> had neutral effects on density of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and on populations of Trowbridge's shrews (Sorex trowbridgii), Baird's shrews (Sorex bairdi), Pacific shrews (Sorexpacjflcus), and shrew-moles (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) were more abundant in unthmnned stands than in <b>thinned</b> stands 5 years after <b>thinning</b> had occurred. Greater amounts of small-diameter down wood and slash, and increases in percent cover of low shrubs after <b>thinning</b> may partially explain the increases in abundance of chipmunks, Pacific jumping mice, and creeping voles in <b>thinned</b> stands. <b>Thinning</b> young Douglas-fir forests appears to enhance habitat quality for most species of forest-floor small mammals.

The results of simulation were summarized as in the following : 1. The <b>thinning</b> intensity largely effected the stability of crowns. The risings of center of gravity accompanying with the tree-height-growth were reduced in accordance with an increasing in the <b>thinning</b> ratio. This result suggests the possibility of keeping the vertical stability of crowns by the execution of intensive <b>thinning.</b> The relative frequency of occurrence of the trees supplied with changing eccentricity during 5 years after the <b>thinning,</b> increased linearly with the <b>thinning</b> ratio. 2.

The cutting of the trees which were large enough to suppress the others was deemed to be effective to keep the horizontal stability of crowns. 3. The line <b>thinning</b> showed less effects on the individual foliage weight than other <b>thinning</b> systems did. Consequently, the planning of the <b>thinning</b> ratio by using the stand density control diagram was deemed to be inadaptable to the line <b>thinning</b> system. 4.
