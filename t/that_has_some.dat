5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} system <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> {{characteristics of a}} tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From an operational standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E

Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} system <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> {{characteristics of a}} tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E

25|$|To {{obtain a}} rough {{idea of what}} phases might occur, one can use a model <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> of the same {{properties}} as QCD, but is easier to manipulate. Many physicists use Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models, which contain no gluons, and replace the strong interaction with a four-fermion interaction. Mean-field methods are commonly used to analyse the phases. Another approach is the bag model, in which the effects of confinement are simulated by an additive energy density that penalizes unconfined quark matter.|$|E
25|$|Brewers in Düsseldorf {{used the}} pale malts {{that were used}} for the modern pale lagers, but {{retained}} the old ("alt") method of using warm fermenting yeasts. The first brewery to use the name Alt was Schumacher which opened in 1838. The founder, Mathias Schumacher, allowed the beer to mature in cool conditions in wooden casks for longer than normal, and laid the foundation for the modern alt – amber coloured and lagered. The result is a pale beer <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> of the lean dryness of a lager but with fruity notes as well.|$|E
25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the Fourier transform, in time-frequency analysis, one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals in a form <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the short-time Fourier transform or fractional Fourier transform, or other functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the continuous wavelet transform.|$|E

25|$|Extensional suffixes, a {{term used}} in the Igbo literature, refer to {{morphology}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> but not all characteristics of derivation. The words created by these suffixes always {{belong to the same}} lexical category as the root from which they are created, and the suffixes' effects are principally semantic. On these grounds, Emenanjo (2015) asserts that the suffixes called extensional are bound lexical compounding elements; they cannot occur independently, though many are related to other free morphemes from which they may have originally been derived.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{progressive}} aphasia (PPA), {{while its}} name can be misleading, {{is actually a}} form of dementia <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> symptoms closely related to several forms of aphasia. It {{is characterized by a}} gradual loss in language functioning while other cognitive domains are mostly preserved, such as memory and personality. PPA usually initiates with sudden word-finding difficulties in an individual and progresses to a reduced ability to formulate grammatically correct sentences (syntax) and impaired comprehension. The etiology of PPA is not due to a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), or infectious disease; it is still uncertain what initiates the onset of PPA in those affected by it.|$|E

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains {{induced by the}} preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|E

While he initially praised the game for its depth, he criticized the game by comparing Kuros to the previous games in the series, saying that he is [...] "still a good-looking knight with a useless sword which he holds as if it were his manhood when jumping" [...] and adding that he [...] "is {{still one of the most}} inept fighters in videogame history". He also criticizes the game for its lack of action and fighting, saying that it is [...] "more of a platforming game with the occasional boss fight". Other criticisms include slow and unresponsive controls and hard-to-defeat bosses. Overall, he says that Wizards & WarriorsIII [...] "isn't a bad game, just one <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> great ideas hampered by serious flaws".|$|E

Cashmere stated that the album was [...] "the toughest [...] heard Powderfinger sound". Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, he described Vulture Street as [...] "a rawer, louder" [...] album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five; it highlighted Fanning's [...] "talent as a lyricist" [...] and stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut". Zuel stated that there is a [...] "real energy here <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> connections to early Powderfinger," [...] and described [...] "On My Mind" [...] as having [...] "AC/DC meatiness", and [...] "Love Your Way" [...] as [...] "acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines".

500|$|Powderfinger's Vulture Street was {{released}} on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No.1 in Australia; while in New Zealand it reached No.17. Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for {{the location of the}} band's first recording room in West End, Brisbane. The Sydney Morning Heralds music critic Bernard Zuel approved of [...] "a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album" [...] with [...] "a real energy here <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>some</b> connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect"; he felt it had Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut" [...] album. Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having [...] "opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs". Middleton described the band's aim was to [...] "get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie, Zeppelin, Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s. We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record. It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape, of course. It's fairly organic in that sense". Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003: [...] "Album of the Year", [...] "Best Group", [...] "Best Rock Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art" [...] (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are: [...] "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind", [...] "Since You've Been Gone", [...] "Love Your Way", and [...] "Sunsets". Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004.|$|E
