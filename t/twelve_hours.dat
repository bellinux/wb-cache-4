5|$|Conducive {{atmospheric}} conditions around Nanmadol on November29 {{led to the}} development of a central dense overcast, followed shortly thereafter by the formation of an eye. Nanmadol was upgraded to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on November30 and became a typhoon <b>twelve</b> <b>hours</b> later, tracking near Satawal, Woleai, and Yap State during this intensification phase. Following the upgrade to typhoon status, intensification briefly slowed but continued soon thereafter. At 0600UTC on December1, Nanmadol reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg), still east of the Philippines. The typhoon maintained this strength for roughly <b>twelve</b> <b>hours</b> before slightly weakening as it neared Luzon.

40|$|Abstract: This {{is derived}} from work for a book we are {{currently}} writing on Women of the Coal Rushes, and {{the focus is on}} the impact that mining companies and changing shift patterns have had on women and communities. It includes the background to the move from five to seven day rosters, and then from eight to <b>twelve</b> <b>hour</b> shifts, why it was done, the perception of general decline in working conditions, and/or how <b>twelve</b> <b>hour</b> shifts have become embedded in the lives of the miners. It examines some or all of: the impact of these shift patterns on spouses, children, fatigue and well-being of families; and/or the decline of sporting clubs and the subsequent movement of spouses out of the mining communities to the coastal cities through drive-in-drive-out arrangements, the reasons for these and the impact this has on family relationships, road safety and community; since the move to <b>twelve</b> <b>hour</b> shifts. We also speculate on the implications of these changes for unionism; whether the shift changes have been experienced differently by gender between men and women; and then further differently between paid and un paid (mothers and wives) women workers; or have the <b>twelve</b> <b>hour</b> shifts opened a plethora of benefits for both sexes?Griffith Business School, Dept of Employment Relations and Human ResourcesFull Tex...|$|R

Peaking as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane, Hurricane Six tied Hurricane Four as the strongest tropical cyclone of the season. After reaching its peak intensity, Hurricane Six rapidly weakened, and passed 70mi (125km) southeast of Socorro Island with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Further weakening occurred, and the storm had dissipated on September 30.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Juliette {{can be traced}} back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September12. After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming steadily better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September27 and convection steadily increased; around 0000UTC on September19, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. <b>Twelve</b> <b>hours</b> later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette. Turning northwest as a result of an upper-level trough, the system attained its peak with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mb (hPa; 29.44inHg) at 1200UTC on September30. Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter, causing it to steadily weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000UTC on October2. <b>Twelve</b> <b>hours</b> later, the system degenerated into a remnant low. The low meandered several hundred miles off the coast of Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October5.|$|E

When Beryl made landfall early on August 15, all warnings were discontinued in Texas. All warnings issued in the Government of Mexico were discontinued six hours later when Beryl was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E

Now keep in mind, we were on two <b>twelve</b> <b>hour</b> shifts, but the policy-makers were only working eight to ten hours a day.

5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low <b>twelve</b> <b>hours</b> later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the state on August18.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25.

It continued to organize, and subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level circulation it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29.

5|$|About <b>twelve</b> <b>hours</b> after {{reaching}} typhoon status, Oliwa began to undergo unexpected explosive deepening. In a 24‑hour period, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as nearly doubling in intensity, from 85 to 160mph (140 to 260km/h 1-min winds), while the pressure dropped 69mbar {{to a minimum}} of 898mbar; based on the estimated intensity, the JTWC classified Oliwa as a super typhoon. The JMA, which is the official agency of the western Pacific, assessed Oliwa as reaching a peak of 115mph (185km/h 10-min winds), with a pressure of 915mbar. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated a possible eyewall mesovorticy, which is a small scale rotational feature found in the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone. Additionally, concentric eyewalls developed {{in the center of}} Oliwa, which typically occur in strong typhoons.|$|E
