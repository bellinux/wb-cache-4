40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} during this semi-annual reporting period are to test the effects of coating layer of the <b>thermal</b> <b>couple</b> on the temperature measurement and to screen out the significant factors affecting the temperature reading under different operational conditions. The systematic tests of the gasifier simulator on the {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} (HVOF) spray coated <b>thermal</b> <b>couples</b> were completed in this reporting period. The comparison tests of coated and uncoated <b>thermal</b> <b>couples</b> were conducted under various operational conditions. The temperature changes were recorded and the temperature differences were calculated to describe the thermal spray coating effect on the <b>thermal</b> <b>couples.</b> To record the temperature data accurately, the computerized data acquisition system (DAS) was adopted to the temperature reading. The DAS could record the data with the accuracy of 0. 1 C and the recording parameters are configurable. In these experiments, DAS was set as reading one data for every one (1) minute. The operational conditions are the combination of three parameters: air flow rate, water/ammonia flow rate and the amount of fine dust particles. The results from the temperature readings show the temperature of uncoated <b>thermal</b> <b>couple</b> is uniformly higher than that of coated <b>thermal</b> <b>couple</b> for each operational condition. Analysis of Variances (ANOVA) was computed based on the results from systematic tests to screen out the significant factors and/or interactions. The temperature difference was used as dependent variable and three operational parameters (i. e. air flow rate, water/ammonia flow rate and amount of fine dust particle) were used as independent factors. The ANOVA results show that the operational parameters are not the statistically significant factors affecting the temperature readings which indicate that the coated <b>thermal</b> <b>couple</b> could be applied to temperature measurement in gasifier. The actual temperature reading with the coated <b>thermal</b> <b>couple</b> in the gasification could be calibrated by a constant of temperature difference...|$|R

An optical pyrometer has great potential in these fields, because it can optically capture a body’s black body radiation and determine a temperature value {{of the body in}} question.

In this project a temperature sensor using Mentor Graphics was design, second a four level mask was made into one reticle.

A <b>thermal</b> <b>couple</b> is a device that can be constructed by micro machining and molding of microstructures to create a optical pyrometer (an optical temperature sensor).

5000|$|Finally, it is {{necessary}} to tune the <b>thermal</b> <b>coupling</b> between the TES and the bath; a low thermal conductance {{is necessary}} to ensure that incident energy is seen by the TES rather than being lost directly to the bath. However, the thermal link must not be too weak, as {{it is necessary}} to cool the TES back to bath temperature after the energy has been absorbed. Two approaches to control the thermal link are by electron-phonon coupling and by mechanical machining. At cryogenic temperatures, the electron and phonon systems in a material can become only weakly coupled. The electron-phonon thermal conductance is strongly temperature-dependent, and hence the thermal conductance can be tuned by adjusting Tc. Other devices use mechanical means of controlling the thermal conductance such as building the TES on a sub-micron membrane over a hole in the substrate or {{in the middle of a}} sparse [...] "spiderweb" [...] structure.|$|E
