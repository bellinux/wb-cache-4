5|$|In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and {{especially}} snapping <b>turtles,</b> {{have increased the}} predation of hatchlings. Outside the Southeast, where sliders are native, released pet red-eared slider <b>turtles</b> increasingly compete with painted <b>turtles.</b> In cities, increased urban predators (raccoons, canines, and felines) may impact painted <b>turtles</b> by eating their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Searching for water, food, or mates, {{the painted}} <b>turtles</b> travel {{up to several}} {{kilometers}} at a time. During summer, in response to heat and water-clogging vegetation, the <b>turtles</b> may vacate shallow marshes for more permanent waters. Short overland migrations may involve hundreds of <b>turtles</b> together. If heat and drought are prolonged, the <b>turtles</b> will bury themselves and, in extreme cases, die.|$|E
5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted <b>turtles</b> (C.guttata) and western pond <b>turtles</b> (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog <b>turtles</b> and wood <b>turtles</b> are closely related, but neither is directly related to spotted <b>turtles,</b> hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the very large and exceptionally rare Yangtze giant softshell <b>turtle,</b> several smaller <b>turtle</b> species {{are found in the}} Yangtze basin, its delta and valleys. These include the Chinese box <b>turtle,</b> yellow-headed box <b>turtle,</b> Pan's box <b>turtle,</b> Yunnan box <b>turtle,</b> yellow pond <b>turtle,</b> Chinese pond <b>turtle,</b> Chinese stripe-necked <b>turtle</b> and Chinese softshell <b>turtle,</b> which all are considered threatened.|$|R

50|$|Until recently, {{the genus}} Clemmys {{consisted}} of four species (bog <b>turtle,</b> spotted <b>turtle,</b> western pond <b>turtle,</b> {{and the wood}} <b>turtle).</b> Recent genetic analyses have revealed that the spotted <b>turtle</b> is distinct from the other three species. The bog <b>turtle</b> and the wood <b>turtle</b> were moved to the genus Glyptemys, while the western pond <b>turtle</b> has been renamed Actinemys. This makes the spotted <b>turtle</b> the sole member of the genus Clemmys.|$|R
5|$|According to a trade data study, painted <b>turtles</b> {{were the}} second most popular pet <b>turtles</b> after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, {{although}} Oregon forbids keeping them as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small <b>turtles</b> to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, painted <b>turtles</b> {{have been}} found about 50 miles south of New Mexico near Galeana {{in the state of}} Chihuahua. There, two expeditions found the <b>turtles</b> in the Rio Santa Maria which is in a closed basin.|$|E

5|$|The spotted <b>turtle</b> {{and painted}} <b>turtle</b> {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog <b>turtle.</b> The bog <b>turtle</b> is distinguishable from any other species of <b>turtle</b> by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted <b>turtle</b> is that the bog <b>turtle</b> has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|R
5|$|It was {{the first}} Teenage Mutant Ninja <b>Turtles</b> film made with computer-generated imagery (CGI), created by Imagi Animation Studios, {{as well as the}} first feature film in the {{franchise}} in 14 years.

5|$|Many U.S. state {{fish and}} game {{departments}} allow non-commercial taking of painted <b>turtles</b> under a creel limit, and require a fishing (sometimes hunting) license; others completely forbid the recreational capture of painted <b>turtles.</b> Trapping is not allowed in Oregon, where western painted turtle populations are in decline, and in Missouri, where there are populations of both southern and western subspecies. In Canada, Ontario protects both subspecies present, the midland and western, and British Columbia protects its dwindling western painted <b>turtles.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since {{at least}} 1958, the {{subspecies}} {{were thought to}} have evolved in response to geographic isolation during the last ice age, 100,000 to 11,000years ago. At that time painted <b>turtles</b> were divided into three different populations: eastern painted <b>turtles</b> along the southeastern Atlantic coast; southern painted <b>turtles</b> around the southern Mississippi River; and western painted <b>turtles</b> in the southwestern United States. The populations were not completely isolated for sufficiently long, hence wholly different species never evolved. When the glaciers retreated, about 11,000years ago, all three subspecies moved north. The western and southern subspecies met in Missouri and hybridized to produce the midland painted turtle, which then moved east and north through the Ohio and Tennessee river basins.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known <b>turtles</b> {{are from}} fossils in the Upper Triassic. These fossils are nearly indistinguishable from modern <b>turtles</b> anatomically. In these early fossils (mostly {{of the genus}} Proganochelys), the teeth have already been lost, and a keratin beak {{is suggested by the}} mandibles. Important differences between Proganochelys and modern <b>turtles</b> are the presence of the palatal teeth (lost in modern species), the inability to retract the head within the shell, and the lack of a trochlear pulley in the jaw closing anatomy.|$|E

5|$|The eastern box <b>turtle</b> (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's <b>turtle</b> {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the wood <b>turtle</b> and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the wood <b>turtle,</b> both Blanding's <b>turtle</b> and the eastern box <b>turtle</b> have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog <b>turtle</b> and spotted <b>turtle</b> are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the wood <b>turtle.</b>|$|R
5|$|Throughout the world, hawksbill sea <b>turtles</b> {{are taken}} by humans, {{though it is}} illegal to hunt them in many countries. In some parts of the world, hawksbill sea <b>turtles</b> are eaten as a delicacy. As far back as the fifth century BC, sea <b>turtles,</b> {{including}} the hawksbill, were eaten as delicacies in China.|$|E
5|$|While the hawksbill sea <b>turtles</b> mainly feed on sponges {{found on}} coral reefs, they also feed on crustaceans, algae, and fish. They are prey to large fish, sharks, and humans. The hawksbill sea <b>turtles</b> are {{endangered}} mainly due to human impact. These sea <b>turtles</b> mainly {{stay close to}} shorelines as this is where sponge-bearing coral reefs can be found, as well as beaches that provide nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern sea <b>turtles</b> probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea <b>turtles</b> except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E

25|$|Despite recent {{declines in}} the sea <b>turtle</b> populations, five species are known to nest in Burma at well known island and {{mainland}} beaches known as turtle-banks. These are the olive ridley sea <b>turtle</b> (Lepidochelys olivacea), the loggerhead sea <b>turtle</b> (Caretta caretta), the green sea <b>turtle</b> (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill sea <b>turtle</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata), and the leatherback sea <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea).|$|R
5|$|Another {{significant}} human {{impact is}} roadkillâ€”dead <b>turtles,</b> especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities {{have tried to}} limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting <b>turtles</b> across the road.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{is another}} method of stabilizing the bog turtles' numbers. The technique involves mating bog <b>turtles</b> indoors in controlled environments, where nutrition and mates are provided. Fred Wustholz and Richard J. Holub {{were the first}} to do this independently, during the 1960s and 1970s. They were interested in educating others about the bog turtle and in increasing its population, and over several years they released many healthy bog <b>turtles</b> into the wild. Various organizations, such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, have been permitted to breed bog <b>turtles</b> in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea <b>turtles,</b> including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult <b>turtles</b> {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea <b>turtles,</b> such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
