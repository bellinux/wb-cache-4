5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Mountain Division, {{together}} with the reinforced 125th Infantry Regiment, crossed the Struma river under great hardship, attacking along both banks and clearing bunkers until they reached their objective on 7 April. Heavy casualties caused them to temporarily withdraw. The 72nd Infantry Division advanced from Nevrokop across the mountains. Its advance was delayed by a shortage of pack animals, medium artillery and mountain equipment. Only {{on the evening of}} 9 April did it reach the area north-east of Serres. Most fortresses—like Fort Roupel, Echinos, Arpalouki, Paliouriones, Perithori, Karadag, Lisse and Istibey—held until the Germans occupied Thessaloniki on 9 April, at which point they surrendered under General Bakopoulos' orders. Nevertheless, minor isolated fortresses continued to fight for a few days more and were not taken until heavy artillery was used against them. This gave <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> retreating troops to evacuate by sea. Although eventually broken, the defenders of the Metaxas Line succeeded in delaying the German advance.The Metaxas Line, requiring 150,000 men, could have held out longer, but the bulk of the Greek army was facing the Italians in Albania.|$|E

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Motoi Sakuraba, who had composed {{for nearly all}} the previous Tales games, and his regular partner Shinji Tamura, the latter working under the alias Hibiki Aoyama. While creating the soundtrack, Sakuraba {{was caught in the}} transition between sequenced to prerecorded streamed music, the latter of which gave room for rearrangements and improvisation mid-production. Sequenced music had been used up to Abyss, so {{it was the first time}} in the series that Sakuraba used this method, although he had done so for all his other projects at the <b>time.</b> <b>For</b> <b>some</b> tracks, a heavy piano element was used, with Sakuraba playing the instrument. Tamura worked with Sakuraba to create different feelings for the various tracks: character themes were melodic, dungeon themes were given a simple and minimalist mood, while town themes struck a balance between these two approaches. In addition to original tracks, three remixed tracks from other Namco Bandai games were included.|$|E

25|$|The name Magnolia first {{appeared}} in 1703 in the Genera of Charles Plumier (1646–1704), for a flowering tree from the island of Martinique (talauma). English botanist William Sherard, who studied botany in Paris under Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, a pupil of Magnol, was most probably the first after Plumier to adopt the genus name Magnolia. He was at least responsible for the taxonomic part of Johann Jacob Dillenius's Hortus Elthamensis and of Mark Catesby's Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands. These were the first works after Plumier's Genera that used the name Magnolia, this <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> species of flowering trees from temperate North America. The species that Plumier originally named Magnolia was later described as Annona dodecapetala by Lamarck, and has since been named Magnolia plumieri and Talauma plumieri (and still {{a number of other}} names) but is now known as Magnolia dodecapetala.|$|E

2500|$|In this context, the {{particular}} {{importance of the}} [...] "Peștera cu Oase" [...] findings resides both in the mixture of modern human and archaic (Neanderthal) features and {{in the fact that}} they are sufficiently complete to be taxonomically diagnosed and directly dated. Thus, the Oase fossils overlap in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> 3000 years with late Neanderthals like those of Vindija Cave (Croatia) dated to ~32,000 radiocarbon years BP or less for Arcy-sur-Cure (France) at ~34,000 radiocarbon years BP. Besides, the notion that the Oase people are very close to the time of contact with Neanderthals is consistent with their archaic traits, and finds additional support in the patterns of spatio-temporal distribution of the latest Neanderthal remains.|$|E
2500|$|The risk of {{developing}} pyometra differs between dog breeds. Pyometra {{is a result of}} hormonal and structural changes in the uterus lining. [...] This can happen at any age, whether she has bred or not, and whether it is her 1st or 10th heat (although it becomes more common as the dog gets older). [...] The main risk period for a female is for eight weeks after her peak standing heat (or estrous cycle) has ended. Normally during this period, the cervix, which was open during her heat, begins to close, and the inner lining begins to adapt back to normal. [...] However, cystic hyperplasia of the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) [...] known as cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) [...] may occur at this <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> animals, as an inappropriate response to progesterone.|$|E

2500|$|At the Battle of Long Island, the Delaware Regiment {{fought with}} Colonel William Smallwood's Marylanders. Many thought {{these were the}} two best regiments in the Continental Army. They fought {{under the command of}} Brigadier General William Alexander, Lord Stirling, and were {{responsible}} for holding the Gowanus Road, the far right of the Continental Army line. They were immediately south of Brooklyn, with New York Harbor to their right. On August 27, 1776, the British sent much of their army well to the east, and under cover of darkness, easily turned the left flank of the Continental Army. Only on the right did the American's hold their own. McCullough again relates how Haslet later described [...] "how his 'Delawares' stood with 'determined countenance', on them all the while, and the enemy, 'though six times their number', not daring to attack". But they were nearly surrounded and, once ordered to leave, could only undertake a harrowing retreat by wading and swimming across Gowanus Bay.

[...] Evidence suggests that during the Sui dynasty, Li's own ancestors, at that <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reason classified socially as commoners, were forced into a form of exile from their original home (in what is now Gansu) to some location or locations further west.

2500|$|Helm was {{requested}} by the Board of Church Extension to formulate a plan including constitution and bylaws for establishing a Woman's Department of Church Extension for parsonage-building, to be submitted to the Board of Church Extension held in January, 1886. She did so and her paper was referred to a committee consisting of Bishop R. K. Hargrove (Chairman) and Rev. H. C. Settle and J. G. Carter, Esq. Her idea was to make provision in the constitution at that <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> phases of local home mission work, but this was strenuously opposed {{on the ground that}} it would embrace too much. In May, 1886, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South authorized the Board of Church Extension to organize the woman's organization known as the Woman's Department of Church Extension, until 1890, when it received a more definite title, Woman's Parsonage and Home Mission Society. Helm was appointed the General secretary of the department, and her work grew rapidly from the very beginning. Helm went from one Conference to another, organizing Parsonage Societies and inspiring the women with a zeal for the work. Letters poured into her office from the Indian Mission, Montana, Oregon, California, and all of the Southern states and she replied to all of them. In all her explanatory leaflets and articles, and in her plans for the establishment of new departments of the work she wrote clearly, accurately, and with a mastery of the subject.|$|E
