5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP is analogous <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Major land runs, {{including}} the Land Run of 1889, were held for settlers where certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time. Usually land {{was open to}} settlers on a first come first served basis. Those who broke the rules by crossing the border into the territory before the official opening time {{were said to have}} been crossing the border sooner, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> sooners, which eventually became the state's official nickname.|$|E
5|$|There is no widely agreed criterion-based {{definition}} of a heavy metal. Different meanings may be attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term,</b> depending on the context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined {{on the basis of}} density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E
50|$|Joinder {{agreements}} {{are commonly used}} in mergers and acquisitions to bind individual shareholders <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of an existing merger agreement or shareholder agreement, and in trust practice to bind a donor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> and conditions of the trust.|$|R

5|$|In 1882, {{a formal}} opinion by the Attorney General {{concluded}} that resignation from Congress does not free a member {{to be appointed}} to civil office because the Clause speaks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns. Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment {{to the position of}} United States Tariff Commissioner. In 1896, the Comptroller of the Treasury determined, after the fact, that former Senator Matthew Ransom's appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} redefinition was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer Phil Plait and NCSE writer Nick Matzke both {{wrote about}} why they thought the redefinition was not, in general, a good one. It defined a planet as orbiting a star, which would have meant that any planet ejected from its star system or formed outside of one (a rogue planet) {{could not have been}} called a planet, even if it fit all other definitions. A similar situation already applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the redefinition did not differentiate between planets and brown dwarf stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.|$|E
5|$|Weaker tornadoes, and {{at times}} even {{stronger}} tornadoes, can occasionally lift, meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground. The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> skipping tornado. These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the house-skipping effect is observed, except possibly {{at the time of}} the birth and organization of the tornado. This situation is not commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms, the process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying is known as cyclic tornadogenesis, thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell. This series of tornadoes is known as a tornado family.|$|E

5|$|With the {{advantages}} of incumbency and a generally popular record, Garrard garnered large majorities in the state's western counties, Jefferson County, and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky. Surprisingly, he even found support among some voters who had favored Logan four years earlier. The final voting showed Garrard the winner with 8,390 votes, followed by Greenup with 6,746, Logan with 3,996, and Todd with 2,166. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> limits imposed by the new constitution, Garrard was the last Kentucky governor elected to succeed himself until a 1992 amendment to the state constitution loosened the prohibition on gubernatorial succession, and Paul E. Patton was reelected in 1999. In 1801, Garrard nominated Todd to fill the next vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after the election. Similarly, he appointed Greenup to {{a position on the}} Frankfort Circuit Court in 1802.|$|E

25|$|Subjectivists, {{also known}} as Bayesians or {{followers}} of epistemic probability, give the notion of probability a subjective status by regarding it {{as a measure of}} the 'degree of belief' of the individual assessing the uncertainty of a particular situation.
