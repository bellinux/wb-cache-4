5|$|Disaster {{elements}} {{portrayed in}} Independence Day represented a significant {{turning point for}} Hollywood blockbuster films. With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed, such as 1998's Armageddon and Deep Impact. The trend continued throughout the 2000s and 2010s, evident in films like 2004's The Day After <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>and</b> 2012's The Avengers.|$|E

5|$|The World of Commerce and Industry {{was divided}} into {{domestic}} and foreign areas. The former was sited mainly south of American Way (the continuation of Thomas Street through the grounds), an area it shared with the World of Science. It included the Space Needle and {{what is now the}} Broad Street Green and Mural Amphitheater. The Hall of Industry and some smaller buildings were immediately north of American Way. The latter included 15governmental exhibitors and surrounded the World of <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>and</b> extended to the north edge of the fair.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in Hong Kong in 1992 to generally positive audience reception, {{but it was not}} as commercially successful as Woo's previous action films, such as A Better <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>and</b> The Killer. Reception from western critics was much more positive; many critics and film scholars have come to proclaim its action scenes as among the best ever filmed. In 2007, a video game sequel titled Stranglehold was released, which {{is in the process of}} being made into a film.|$|E
5|$|There was one {{change of}} driver before the race. Jon Wood, the {{grandson}} of retired driver Glen Wood, was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car, but withdrew {{because of a lack}} of experience with the Car of <b>Tomorrow,</b> <b>and</b> former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat. Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and his team had Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him if he could not compete.|$|E

5|$|Tkach did {{not have}} the charismatic {{personality}} of his predecessor. Unlike Armstrong, who kept a strong hold of the reins, Tkach delegated many tasks, including the presentation of the church-supported television broadcast, The World <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>and</b> the authoring of articles and booklets produced by the church. Although Tkach was not known as a theologian, and made no claims as such, eventually he was to have profound impact on the theological foundations of the WCG.|$|E
5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>and</b> include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} Worlds of Tomorrow, another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 {{that it would be better}} to have Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both Worlds of <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>and</b> Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue Worlds of Tomorrow was merged with If, though it was another year before Galaxy actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, If had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E

However, it was censored for political reasons at the time and was not published in its entirety until Virago Press reissued it in 1983.|$|E
