25|$|Modern Archaeognatha and Thysanura {{still have}} {{rudimentary}} appendages on their abdomen called styli, while more primitive and extinct insects known as Monura {{had much more}} developed abdominal appendages. The abdominal and thoracic segments in the earliest terrestrial ancestor of the insects {{would have been more}} similar to each other than they are today, and the head had well-developed compound eyes and long antennae. Their body size is not known yet. As the most primitive group today, Archaeognatha, is most abundant near the coasts, it could mean that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of habitat where the insect ancestors became terrestrial. But this specialization to coastal niches could also have a secondary origin, just as could their jumping locomotion, as it is the crawling Thysanura who are considered to be most original (plesiomorphic). By looking at how primitive cheliceratan book gills (still seen in horseshoe crabs) evolved into book lungs in primitive spiders and finally into tracheae in more advanced spiders (most of them still have a pair of book lungs intact as well), it is possible the trachea of insects was formed in a similar way, modifying gills at the base of their appendages.|$|E
25|$|A 'Welcome Home Ken Barrington' {{dance was}} {{arranged}} {{on his return}} from New Zealand where he was presented with a silver trophy to a standing ovation {{in front of the}} Surrey team. With the Ashes left in Australia the English press focused on Barrington's achievements and much was hoped for against the West Indies in 1963. Frank Worrell was the first full-time African-Caribbean cricketer to captain the West Indies and had a colourful team in the shape of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Basil Butcher, Lance Gibbs, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Barrington made 110 not out against them for Surrey (the next highest score was 22) and joked that the Test match would be over in three days as England had gone 13 Tests against the West Indies without defeat. The First Test was a rude awakening as he was out for 16 and 8 and England lost by an innings. The Second Test at Lord's is one of the Great Tests; the West Indies made 301 and Barrington top scored with 80 in England's reply of 297. The West Indies were out for 229 in the second innings and England needed 234 to win. Barrington made 60, added 99 runs with Colin Cowdrey (whose arm was broken by Wes Hall) and Brian Close and hit Gibbs for a six followed by another onto the Lord's balcony. A last minute collapse left England 228/9 with Cowdrey returning to the crease in the last over with victory, defeat, a tie or a draw still possible. As it was Dave Allen played for a draw. Fred Trueman's 12/119 won the Third Test at Edgbaston, but Barrington made only 9 and 1, followed by 25, 32, 16 and 28 as Worrell's team won the last two Tests and the series 3–1. For all the excitement provided by the tourists it was a bad series for Barrington as <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of cricket he had forsaken and his 275 runs (27.50) was less than what was expected of him. Even so, he published his first book with Phil Riley called Running in Hundreds, detailing his struggle to play for England and rise to fame.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, the Doctor behaves erratically, as he {{gradually}} gets used to his {{new body}} and tastes while developing a new personality. Willis stated that he [...] "finally clicks into place" [...] after picking out his new outfit." [...] The rooftop scene {{was not in the}} original script; the Doctor simply ran away from the ward and returned to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he did not really have a formal introduction, and that more could be made of the costume, as many previous Doctors had picked theirs out quietly. The main story arc is the Doctor meeting the grown-up Amy. Moffat felt that over time the relationships between the Doctor and his companions had become too adult. He wanted to create a childlike relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of relationship viewers had with the Doctor, regardless of their age. When the Doctor returns for Amy, she is a very different person from the seven-year-old he had met before. Moffat explains that she developed a tough element and had become distrustful and cynical due to him not returning as promised, forcing her to accept that he was an imaginary friend. Rory was completely in love with Amy, but Amy wanted adventures before admitting she loved him, too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary Doctor.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song were criticized with BBC's Nick Reynolds saying that {{although}} the group [...] "reinvent themselves as domestic goddesses for some lucky man", the song was neither convincing nor good. He further opined [...] "I thought {{they were supposed to}} be independent women?!" [...] juxtaposing it with the group's earlier song [...] "Independent Women" [...] (2000). Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone echoed his statements, writing [...] "Jerkins should hang his head in shame for having a hand in the maudlin 'Cater 2 U,' a saccharine tune about how low Knowles, Rowland and Williams will stoop to prove their devotion to their man... Since when did these independent women become so craven?". Sean Fennessey of Pitchfork Media also stated that [...] "their swan song of sorts... completely defies the winking empowerment most of their greatest jams provided". He further described the production as [...] "milky and slight", the chorus as [...] "limp" [...] and the song overally as [...] "a Prince mock-up of the worst kind". Jess Harvell of the same website offered similar criticism: [...] " [...] reneged on everything early DC stood for in a parade of kept-wifey pleas". Alex MacPherson of Stylus Magazine dismissed the sincerity of the lyrics classifying [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] as a [...] "queasy" [...] song. Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph panned it as [...] "cringe inducing, with lots of sensuous moaning". Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote, [...] "I thought <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of song bands recorded by mistake then hid guiltily in the attic".|$|E

Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You hear {{so much about the}} problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of dream that really was impossible.

For this leadership Abraham Lincoln was admirably fitted, {{better than any other}} American statesman of his day; for he understood the plain people, with all their loves and hates, their prejudices and their noble impulses, their weaknesses and their strength, as he understood himself, and his sympathetic nature was apt to draw their sympathy to him.|$|E
