40|$|An {{analysis}} of the <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> process revealed that an optimization of the process {{with regard to the}} tool machine life cycle can be achieved by avoiding power excess ensuring thereby {{at the same time a}} minimum rolling time for a given rolling performance. With the rolling power as the manipulated variable a trapezoid-shaped time function of the rolling power has been realized. The rolling power is derived from the pressure within the hydraulic feed zylinder. In series production, the life cycle of the <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>machine</b> is increased for 20 % by application of the power control. For <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> process monitoring and quality assurance as well as an essential prerequisite for process automatization, a microcomputer aided device has been developed and successfully tested.

50|$|The rods {{were cut}} into 22-foot lengths {{as they leave}} the last stand {{by means of a}} flying shear. The Savannah rods were air cooled to room {{temperature}} on the cooling bed and then were cold straightened in a Medart Straightener. Rods to be beta heat treated by-pass the cooling bed and were lifted into the beta heat treating furnace by means of a hoist, to be held at 1,320-1,365 °F for 11-20 minutes and then quenched in cold water. After quenching, these rods were conveyed to the Medart straightener for straightening. The rods were located in -inch Acme-Gridley automatic screw machines where slugs were cut from the rods. The Hanford slugs were then placed in the Heald machine, which cuts the slugs to desired lengths and finishes and radiuses the ends. The Savannah River slugs were reduced to exact dimensions of size, surface, and straightness on a centerless grinder after which a contour was placed on the surface by a <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>machine.</b> The slugs were numbered and put on a basket on a conveyor that passes through a degreasing tank, pickling tank, two rinse tanks and a hot air dryer before depositing the slug basket in the Inspection Department. The slugs were inspected for seams, striations, dimensions and handling defects with the good slugs being packed for shipment.|$|R

40|$|The work in {{this paper}} {{presents}} the effect of material and blank dimension on the dimensions of external rolled threads. This paper will be helpful for the auto industry, {{one of the largest}} fasteners markets, that typically consumes between 2800 to 3100 fasteners in the assembly of an average family vehicle. Externally threaded fasteners comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by <b>thread</b> <b>rolling.</b> The <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect <b>thread</b> <b>rolling</b> process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined. The size of the blank is dependent on material, surface finish, type of threads etc. This paper describes the effect of blank material and dimensions on nominal diameter of external rolled threads. The work has been carried out at M/s Gayatri Auto Industries on Master Reciprocating Dies Thread Rolling Machine using HSS die. Mild Steel (C 15), EN- 8 (C 40), and EN- 47 (Spring Steel) materials have been taken as blank material for the analysis to produce M 8 x 1. 25 6 g threads. The result indicates that the variation on surface roughness, carbon percentage and dimension of blank affects significantly the nominal diameter and PCD of threads.
