40|$|The {{temperature}} in the atmosphere is rising {{as a cause of}} human influence, and {{it was found that the}} building sector in 2012 emitted 18. 4 % of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the planet (Pachauri et al., 2014). A solution to reduce the GHG emissions in the sector is the zero emission building (ZEB) concept. Cost-optimisation of the heating and cooling system in a ZEB is a challenge, and therefore the NTNU-SINTEF Zero Emission Building activity and the International Energy Agency Annex 40 have been working on a design tool for the selection of renewable thermal energy supply systems for non-residential near Zero Emission Buildings (nZEB). This design tool is called Simulation tool for Nearly Zero Energy buildings heat Pump installations (NZEP) and has been developed through the work of three master theses and three project works. This thesis is an continuation of a project work, written in the fall of 2015, investigated the possibilities of comparing the components in the simulation model with measured data from the CC-system of Powerhouse Kjørbo (Skjerve, 2016). The main objective in this thesis is therefore to compare simulations performed on the main components of NZEP to field measurements from Powerhouse Kjørbo. These components are considered the heat pump block, storage <b>tank</b> <b>block</b> and ground source heat exchanger block, and the thesis therefore only deals with these components. Pressure losses and flow abilities for the chosen components are not investigated. Comparisons for single component and multiple component simulations have been performed. For both kinds of comparisons, the inputs are gathered from and the outputs are compared to measured values from the CC-system at Powerhouse Kjørbo. Based on the comparisons and the discussions presented in this thesis, it is concluded that: - The heat pump block simulates steady-state performance very well, but that the start-up of the block should be compared to measurements with a lower sample rate. - The storage <b>tank</b> <b>block</b> is producing temperatures with similar trends as the measured data, but that a sensor should be mounted in order to calibrate the simulation properly. - The GSHE block simulates similar temperatures out of the borehole in situations where the volume flow in the real borehole is constant. - The simulation of multiple components works very well, all though there are additional complications in implementing a control strategy for the system...|$|E

A comparative analysis of several programs is conducted to determine common developmental testing problems.

The thesis provides the reader with a current understanding of the Department of Defense (DoD) test structure, its relationship to the acquisition process, and the Department of the Army test agencies involved in Developmental Test and Evaluation.

These systems included: the Abrams Main Battle <b>Tank</b> <b>Block</b> II upgrade (M 1 A 2); the Javelin, a man portable antitank weapon, (AAWS-M); Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS); the Avenger, a mounted Air Defense system, the Kiowa Warrior, an armed scout helicopter; the Maneuver Control System (MCS), command and control system; and the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV).

40|$|International audienceFused-cast {{refractory}} materials {{are widely used}} in the glass industry, especially {{in the building of}} superstructures and side walls of fusion furnaces. The HZFC (High Zirconia Fused Cast) products are especially used as <b>tank</b> <b>blocks</b> for the fusion of highly corrosive glasses melted at very high temperature (such as LCD glass), due to their high corrosion resistance and their low generation of glass defects generation. The presence of this high amount of pure ZrO 2 in the refractory can be responsible for microdamage occurrence during the cooling step after melt casting (annealing), associated to the martensitic transition of zirconia. Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is well known as a reliable tool to investigate microstuctural evolution at a very small scale. In this work, a fused-cast ZrO 2 refractory has been investigated using a AE unsupervised pattern recognition procedure and a frequency-energy coupled analysis. Data gathering during thermal cycles at high temperature (typically 1500 °C) has been done thanks to an innovative self-developed testing device. The analysis of frequency and energy parameters makes it possible to detect and to characterize the occurrence and the chronology of microdamage in specific range of temperature. Hypothesis concerning different ways of microdamage formation below the temperature of the martensitic transformation of ZrO 2 during the cooling stage can be proposed related to thermo-mechanical properties and the microstructure of the material. In particular, intergranular and intragranular microcracks due to CTE mismatches occurring in the material have been also investigated...|$|R
