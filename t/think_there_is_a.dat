25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> growing {{distaste for}} the family duties among women â€¦ that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Roman conquest in AD43, there was an oppidum in the {{southern}} part of their territory, probably in the Selsey region. A number of archaeologists now <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong possibility that the Roman invasion of Britain in AD43 started around Fishbourne and Chichester Harbour rather than the traditional landing place of Richborough in Kent. According to this theory, the Romans were called to restore the refugee Verica, king of the Atrebates, who had been driven out by the Catuvellauni, a tribe based around modern Hertfordshire.|$|E

Tibbitt said [...] "it was a great idea I was just expecting maybe a 3D version of the painting but we got something totally different and it's very cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Van Hamel {{graduated}} from the school and was promoted straight into the National Ballet of Canada as a soloist in 1963. She has credited Celia Franca, the Artistic Director, as being an important influence and coach during her development as a ballet dancer. She was promoted {{to the rank of}} principal dancer in 1965. Early in her career, she struggled with her weight. In an interview with Rose Eichenbaum, Van Hamel said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> small window in your career when you have some control." [...] She explained she was [...] "about three pounds too heavy" [...] and used weight as [...] "a way of rebelling against all the forces that controlled my life." ...|$|E
500|$|... e.The immense {{scope of}} The Century caused {{headaches}} for those developing it. It survived three {{major changes in}} narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, {{all of the people}} interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. [...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. There {{are people out there who}} think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{investigation}} was headed by Detective Superintendent John Porter of Southampton Criminal Investigation Department (C.I.D.) In the 12months after the murder, police [...] "interviewed 30,000 people, took 2,500 statements and traced 500 {{people who were}} in the area {{on the night of the}} murder. At one point the list of possible suspects totalled 300 men." [...] Despite DeSimone's possessions being taken, police did not believe that robbery had been the motive; they were convinced that this was a red herring and that she was the victim of a [...] "vicious rape by a brutal and merciless killer". Police received two anonymous letters, postmarked 12 and 27 December in Southampton which gave information regarding the location of the killer. The writer was never identified, and the eventual arrest of Hodgson led police to dismiss them as a hoax at the time of Hodgson's trial. Nine months after the murder, while Hodgson was already in custody for an unrelated offence, two anonymous telephone calls were made to the police in which the caller confessed to killing DeSimone. Porter released a statement to the Southern Daily Echo at the time in which he said: [...] "The calls came from a man who said that he had committed the murder. He gave the impression that he was under severe strain and was asking for help and advice. From the nature of his conversation we <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> possibility that the calls could be genuine." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Watson is {{well known}} for his alleged 1943 statement, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> world market for maybe five computers," [...] there is scant {{evidence}} he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM. One of the very first attributions may be found in The Experts Speak, a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, Facts and Fallacies. Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a San Diego Evening Tribune writer who wrote: [...] "Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn't make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: 'I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> world market for about five computers. The earliest known citation on the Internet is from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> world market for about five computers' â€”Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943". All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the Annals of the History of Computing in ACS letters in 1985.|$|E

The New York Times columnist, Maureen Dowd, quoted two young, professional women saying they liked shows with female characters like themselves, single, even obsessed.

2500|$|Heller {{voted against}} the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. In April 2014, the United States Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to {{increase}} the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour {{over the course of}} a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Heller opposed the bill, arguing that Nevada already had a minimum wage higher than the federally mandated level and that he thought the minimum wage should be left up to the states. Heller said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> difference between North and South, East and West on what those minimum wages ought to be." ...|$|E

He added, [...] "I think Muslims are rational and rationality dictates that." [...] In an 2004 interview to an Israeli newspaper, {{he was asked about}} his friendship with Israel, which was described as [...] "unusual for an Islamic leader".
