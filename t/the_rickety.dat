25|$|Napoleon after 1799 {{paid for}} his {{expensive}} wars by multiple means, starting with the modernisation of <b>the</b> <b>rickety</b> financial system. He conscripted soldiers at low wages, raised taxes, placed large-scale loans, sold lands formerly owned by the Catholic Church, sold Louisiana to the United States, plundered conquered areas and seized food supplies, and levied requisitions on countries he controlled, such as Italy.|$|E
500|$|The river {{front was}} {{important}} {{in the development of}} the Great Fire. The Thames offered water for firefighting and the chance of escape by boat, but the poorer districts along the riverfront had stores and cellars of combustibles which increased the fire risk. All along the wharves, <b>the</b> <b>rickety</b> wooden tenements and tar paper shacks of the poor were shoehorned amongst [...] "old paper buildings and the most combustible matter of tarr, pitch, hemp, rosen, and flax which was all layd up thereabouts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richboro Port Halt 4:46.(Not to be {{confused}} with Richborough Castle Halt on SER Deal Branch); passenger services were never authorised over <b>the</b> <b>rickety</b> girder bridge across the River Stour.

60|$|As {{there was}} no {{duplicate}} key to apartment No. 12, citizen Rouget ordered his men to break in the door. It did not take very long: the house was old and ramshackle and <b>the</b> doors <b>rickety.</b> <b>The</b> next moment the party stood in the room which a while ago the Englishman had so accurately described to pere Lenegre in petite maman's hearing.|$|R
2500|$|In 1970, Shasta Fay Hepworth visits <b>the</b> <b>rickety</b> {{beach house}} of her ex-boyfriend, Larry [...] "Doc" [...] Sportello, a private {{investigator}} and hippie/dope head in Gordita Beach, a fictional town in Los Angeles County.

2500|$|Although {{there had}} been some missteps in Edwin Earhart's career up to that point, in 1907 his job as a claims officer for the Rock Island Railroad led to a {{transfer}} to Des Moines, Iowa. The next year, at the age of 10, Earhart saw her first aircraft at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines. Her father tried to interest her and her sister in taking a flight. One look at <b>the</b> <b>rickety</b> [...] "flivver" [...] was enough for Earhart, who promptly asked if they could go back to the merry-go-round. She later described the biplane as [...] "a thing of rusty wire and wood and not at all interesting".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Sanielevici {{demanded that}} Romanians revisit [...] "the ancestral law" [...] of Romanian Orthodoxy, {{and noted that}} the spread of militant atheism was a {{positive}} development. Călinescu sees Sanielevici, and [...] "any Jewish writer", as actually denouncing the antisemitic component of Sămănătorist nationalism. Sanielevici, he argues, was attacking virility in literature precisely because it highlighted the [...] "national preservation" [...] of Romanians, and actually raising awareness about the promised emancipation of the Jews. Călinescu also notes the controversy sparked once Sanielevici's exposed some leading voices of Romanian nationalism, beginning with Vasile Alecsandri, as secret Jews: [...] " [...] denunciation of various writers' foreignness shows subtle humor, pointing at <b>the</b> <b>rickety</b> nature of claims about one's ethnic novelty." [...] Călinescu's younger colleague Dumitru Micu issued a similar objection, arguing that the [...] "megalomaniac" [...] Sanielevici displayed a [...] "cosmopolitan hatred for the nation's past" [...] (an opinion in turn criticized by Jicu).|$|E
50|$|The Class 80 tank engines were German {{standard}} locomotives (Einheitsloks) {{with the}} Deutsche Reichsbahn. They {{were intended to}} replace <b>the</b> aging, <b>rickety</b> state railway line engines performing shunting duties in their dotage at large stations.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is well to {{be brave}} when one does not live in Rampur,' said one whose hut lay within {{a few miles of}} <b>the</b> Rajah's <b>rickety</b> palace. 'If we get a bad name among the Sahibs, none will employ us as shikarris any more.' ...|$|R

50|$|A huge, six-level {{press box}} was added in 1968 {{to the top}} of the west side grandstand, {{directly}} in front of Balch Fieldhouse, the former home of the basketball team.

60|$|We {{all went}} {{stumbling}} down <b>the</b> dark, <b>rickety</b> staircase, Laporte {{leading the way}} with Mme. la Marquise, who had M. le Vicomte tightly clasped in her arms.

60|$|Albinia went {{to inquire}} after the sick man at her first leisure moment, and while talking kindly to the wife, and hearing her troubles, was {{surprised}} at <b>the</b> forlorn <b>rickety</b> state of <b>the</b> building, the broken pavement, damp walls, and door that would not shut, because the frame had sunk out of the perpendicular.|$|R

60|$|There are men, no doubt, {{versed in}} finance, who might succeed in doing it. But {{they have a}} {{training}} that Tomlinson lacked.

When he threw a handful away, back came two in its place. And at every new coup the crowd applauded the incomparable daring, the unparalleled prescience of the Wizard.|$|R

5000|$|As {{the island}} is {{submerged}} during high tide, housing on the island consists of [...] "floating houses" [...] perched on wooden stilts 1 to 10 m above sea level. The main thoroughfares are narrow concreted pavements, whilst in the residential areas, <b>the</b> older <b>rickety</b> wooden plank bridges can still be seen. There are no cars on the island; bicycles, {{some of which are}} motorised, are the main means of transportation within the villages. There are no pavements linking the villages, the only means of transportation between villages is by boat. Daily ferry services link the island to Port Klang jetty on the mainland.|$|R

60|$|That ancient bridge-house pleased him, and {{he closed}} with his opportunity. The Hit or Miss was as {{attractive}} to an artistic as most public-houses are to a thirsty soul When the Embankment was made, the bridge-house {{had been one}} of a street of similar quaint and many-gabled old buildings that leaned up against each other for mutual support near the rivers edge. But the Embankment slowly brought civilization that way: <b>the</b> dirty <b>rickety</b> old houses were both condemned and demolished, till at last only the tavern remained, with hoardings and empty spaces, and a dust-yard round it.|$|R
50|$|Portuguese {{claimed the}} Cabo de Rama Fort after {{defeating}} the Raja (King) of Soonda and renovated it subsequently. In the past, the fort has switched hands between Hindu, Muslim monarchs and the Portuguese and witnessed many battles in history. <b>The</b> present <b>rickety</b> structure with turrets and rusty cannons is a leftover of the Portuguese. The Portuguese equipped it with 21 guns and military barracks, {{as well as}} commandant quarters and a chapel. It was abandoned when the Portuguese left this place. Later, this fort housed a government prison till 1955 and was abandoned again. Today, this fort is in ruins, but is a popular tourist attraction of Goa.|$|R
60|$|With a cry, the man toppled {{back upon}} those behind him.

With a creaking and rending of breaking wood it collapsed beneath the Arabs, leaving Tarzan, Abdul, and the girl alone upon the frail platform at the top.|$|R

60|$|When {{he awoke}} again and looked about him, his heart stood still with horror! The whole {{aspect of the}} chamber was changed. The walls were moldy and hung with ancient cobwebs; the {{curtains}} and beddings were rotten; <b>the</b> furniture was <b>rickety</b> and ready to fall to pieces. He sprang out of bed, but his quaking knees sunk under him and he fell to the floor.|$|R
50|$|The city of Vancouver {{was called}} Granville {{until it was}} renamed in 1886, but the former name was kept and given to Granville Street, which spanned the small inlet known as False Creek. False Creek in the late 19th century was more than twice today's size, and its tidal flats {{included}} a large permanent sandbar over which spanned <b>the</b> original, <b>rickety,</b> wooden Granville Street bridge. This sandbar, which would eventually become Granville Island, was first mapped by Captain George Henry Richards in the British Boundary Commission's naval expedition in 1858-59, and the island today conforms roughly to {{the size and shape}} documented at that time. A British Admiralty Chart of 1893 shows the island in greater detail and conforming even more accurately to today's Granville Island.|$|R
