5|$|The {{synthesis}} of the heavy isotopes 294Lv and 295Lv could be accomplished by fusing the heavy curium isotope curium-250 with calcium-48. The cross section of this nuclear reaction would be about 1picobarn, {{though it is not}} yet possible to produce 250Cm in the quantities needed for target manufacture. After a few alpha decays, these livermorium isotopes would reach nuclides at the line of beta stability. Additionally, electron capture may also become an important decay mode in this region, allowing affected nuclei to reach the middle of the island. For example, 295Lv would alpha decay to 291Fl, which would undergo successive electron capture to 291Nh and then 291Cn which is expected {{to be in the middle}} of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. A drawback is that the decay properties of superheavy nuclei <b>this</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.|$|E

25|$|During one OOF {{meeting in}} June, a Motion {{was made on}} behalf of Dr. Spong and OrcaLab to use OOF funds to {{contract}} commercial fishermen from the Namgis First Nation of Johnstone Strait, BC, to catch and provide wild salmon for Springer {{while she was in}} her seapen in Dongchong Bay, Hanson Island, the repatriation site and territory of the Namgis. If the money were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an out-of-season fishing permit from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. A member of OOF, together with a representative from NMFS present at the meeting, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations in the region were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters. It was argued that the logistics of feeding Springer wild fish was too much to take on for the team, particularly <b>this</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the capture date.|$|E

500|$|The {{hypothetical}} isotope 291Mc is {{an especially}} interesting case as it has only one neutron more than the heaviest known moscovium isotope, 290Mc.

500|$|Spector's {{role as a}} {{producer}} gave him the job of explaining the game to the publisher, which he called his [...] "biggest challenge". He explained that they [...] "didn't always get what the team was trying to do", and said, [...] "You don't {{want to know how}} many times the game came <b>this</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> being killed (or how late in the project)". According to Church, Looking Glass' internal management largely ignored System Shock, in favor of the concurrently-developed Flight Unlimited—the game [...] "that had to be the hit, because it was the self-published title". Spector organized a licensing deal between Electronic Arts and Looking Glass that gave the former the trademark to the game, but the latter the copyright. His goal was to ensure that neither party could continue the franchise without the other's involvement. While Cyberspace was originally conceived as a realistic hacking simulation—which could even be used to reimplement SHODAN's ethical constraints—it was simplified after Origin Systems deemed it too complicated. The game's star field system was written by programmer James Fleming. Marc LeBlanc was the main creator of the game's HUD, which he later believed was too complicated. He said that it was [...] "very much the Microsoft Word school of user interface", in that there was no [...] "feature that you [...] see on the screen and touch and play with".|$|E

2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1998, it was {{apparent}} that Kingdom of the Sun was not far along enough in production to be released in {{the summer of}} 2000 as planned. At this time, one of the Disney executives reportedly walked into Randy Fullmer's office and, placing his thumb and forefinger a quarter-inch apart, stated [...] "your film is <b>this</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> being shut down." [...] Fullmer approached Allers, and informed him of the need to finish the film on time for its summer 2000 release as crucial promotional deals with McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and other companies were already established and depended upon meeting that release date. Allers acknowledged that the production was falling behind, but was confident that, with an extension of between six months to a year, he could complete the film. When Fullmer denied Allers's request for an extension, the director decided to leave the project. On September 23, 1998, the project was dead with production costs amounting towards $25–30 million and twenty-five percent of the film animated.|$|E
2500|$|The Game {{began as}} a spec screenplay, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris in 1991. It was sold that year to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who put the project in turnaround, where it {{was picked up by}} Propaganda Films. Director Jonathan Mostow was {{originally}} attached to the project with Kyle MacLachlan and Bridget Fonda cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer. Producer Steve Golin bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct. Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in Andrew Kevin Walker, who had worked with him on Seven, to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone and trying to make the story work. According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on The Game. Michael Douglas' character was a [...] "fashionable, good-looking Scrooge, lured into a [...] situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from The Sting". He {{said in an interview that}} his film differs from others of that kind because [...] "movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is going to add up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies dole out information". Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about [...] "loss of control. The purpose of The Game is to take your greatest fear, put it <b>this</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> your face and say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'" [...] More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense. In 1996, Larry Gross and Walker were brought in to make further revisions to the script.|$|E
