He stated that it {{is in the interest of}} Americans to remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war". Later in the interview when Gilmore was asked if he believed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was credible, he stated, [...] "No, I don’t think he is particularly credible". On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's This Week and continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He reminded the audience that Thompson is [...] "a one-term senator" [...] and that [...] "he's well known because of his Law & Order appearance.

2500|$|A man {{who flew}} with him {{claimed that he}} would often [...] "give" [...] a victory to a new, green pilot, just to bolster his confidence. The new pilot would be taken out by the renowned Collishaw to [...] "bag one". Anxiously {{following}} the leader, he would find himself diving on {{the tail of a}} German reconnaissance plane. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> machine, so that the nose would stay still, he would find his gun-sight wobbling all over the sky. He would press the firing button, spraying bullets like a lawn sprinkler. Then suddenly Collishaw would appear alongside; there would be a short, deadly burst, and the new pilot would turn sick as he saw the enemy plane catch fire and plunge to earth. He would fly back to the aerodrome, where the flight commander would clap him heartily on the shoulder and insist [...] "You got one! Grand show, old boy!" [...] The new pilot, unable to speak, would nod timidly, and thereafter he would fly into battle with Collishaw anywhere. That was – according to the story – part of Collishaw's great quality of leadership.|$|E
2500|$|During the mid-1960s, {{relations}} between white liberals {{and the civil}} rights movement became increasingly strained; civil rights leaders accused liberal politicians of temporizing and procrastinating. Although President Kennedy sent federal troops to compel the University of Mississippi to admit African American James Meredith in 1962, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. toned down the March on Washington (1963) at Kennedy's behest, the failure to seat the delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party at the 1964 Democratic National Convention indicated a growing rift. President Johnson could not understand why the rather impressive civil rights laws passed under his leadership had failed to immunize Northern and Western cities from rioting. At the same time, the civil rights movement itself was becoming fractured. By 1966, a Black Power movement had emerged; Black Power advocates accused white liberals of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> civil rights agenda. Proponents of Black Power wanted African-Americans to follow an [...] "ethnic model" [...] for obtaining power, not unlike that of Democratic political machines in large cities. This put them {{on a collision course with}} urban machine politicians. And, on its most extreme edges, the Black Power movement contained racial separatists who wanted to give up on integration altogether—a program that could not be endorsed by American liberals of any race. The mere existence of such individuals (who always got more media attention than their actual numbers might have warranted) contributed to [...] "white backlash" [...] against liberals and civil rights activists.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the police}} were busy <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>the</b> crowds, some of the reporters warned the squatters that {{the police were}} {{planning}} something big, and the squatters quickly organized a plan to counter the upcoming attack. The 700 defenders were organized in six groups. [...] Each of the groups were charged with different parts of the defense. The barricades were divided into four sections, each with a group of defenders attached to it. [...] These four groups were the biggest of the six groups (about 130 people strong) and were named [...] "the standing units". The two other groups were named [...] "the mobile unit" [...] and [...] "the house unit". [...] The house unit was charged with defending the back entrance of the house and manning a lookout post on the roof. It was their responsibility to warn the others in case of an attack and to oversee many of the logistic tasks such as the making of more Molotov cocktails. They also had to prepare a final defense of the house in case the police broke through. The role of the mobile unit was as a reserve to support the standing units at the barricades. [...] It was not attached to any particular barricade, but was free to move from place to place and assist if the defenders were in danger of being overwhelmed. Many people in this unit were given helmets and clubs for hand-to-hand fighting.|$|E
