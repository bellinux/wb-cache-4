25|$|Koyczan {{describes}} how, following torment at school, {{he became}} a bully himself around the age of 14, {{an image of the}} thing he hated. He says that keeping communication channels open and clear between parents and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> help address bullying issues. He commented that he hopes the poem and the project will promote a connectivity between those who have suffered from bullying, that they might feel less isolated. The project aims to help schools engage better with bullying and child suicide.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, 2006, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{delivered}} {{a message of}} redress in the House of Commons, offering an apology in Cantonese and compensation for the head tax once paid by Chinese immigrants. Survivors or their spouses will be paid approximately $20,000 CAD in compensation. Although <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> not be offered this payment, Chinese Canadian leaders like Dr. Joseph Wong regarded it as an important and significant move in Chinese Canadian history. There are about 20 people who paid the tax still alive in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the bride}} and groom have to declare at the wedding which name they will use; and they have to declare which family name <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> get (which can be changed until the birth of the first child). Children can get either parent's surname, if it is on the {{marriage}} certificate, but all children must have the same surname. Since 2004 they can also get a hyphenated name, but only if both parents kept their birth names at least as one part of their new name. Children usually get their father's surname, but hyphenated names are becoming more common.|$|E

25|$|Artistically, {{the festival}} was a success. ("Something {{has taken place}} at Bayreuth which our grandchildren and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> still remember", wrote Tchaikovsky, {{attending}} the Festival as a Russian correspondent.) Financially, however, the festival was a disaster and did not begin to make money until several years later. Wagner abandoned his original plan to hold a second festival the following year, and travelled to London to conduct a series of concerts {{in an attempt to}} make up the deficit. Although the festival was plagued by financial problems in its early years, it survived through state intervention and the continued support of influential Wagnerians, including King Ludwig II of Bavaria.|$|E
25|$|Because {{development}} of CF in the fetus requires each parent {{to pass on}} a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often performed initially on one parent. If testing shows that parent is a CFTR gene mutation carrier, the other parent is tested to calculate the risk that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> have CF. CF can result {{from more than a}} thousand different mutations. As of 2016, typically only the most common mutations are tested for, such as ΔF508 Most commercially available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations. If a family has a known uncommon mutation, specific screening for that mutation can be performed. Because not all known mutations are found on current tests, a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have CF.|$|E
25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do well in school can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E

50|$|SCS is {{the most}} common {{craniosynostosis}} syndrome and affects 1 in every 25,000 to 50,000 individuals. It occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, and affects males and females equally. If a parent carries a copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 50% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> also carry a copy of the gene mutation, in which case, the child may or may not show signs of SCS. There is also a 50% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> have two working copies of the gene, and would therefore, not have SCS. If both parents carry a single copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 25% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> have two gene mutation copies (so child would develop severe SCS), a 25% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> would have two normal copies of the gene (so would be completely normal), and a 50% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> would carry one gene mutation copy and 1 normal copy (so child may or may not display SCS). In rare situations, two normal parents can have a child with SCS due to a de novo mutation. The exact cause of the de novo mutation is unknown, but it doesn't seem to be related to anything that the parents did or didn't do during the pregnancy. SCS due to a de novo mutation is so rare that the proportion of past cases is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the genetic}} {{disorder}} is incompletely recessive, {{a person with}} only one SCA allele and one unaffected allele will have a [...] "mixed" [...] phenotype: The sufferer will not experience the ill effects of the disease, yet will still possess a sickle cell trait, whereby some of the red blood cells undergo benign effects of SCA, but nothing severe enough to be harmful. Those afflicted with sickle-cell trait are also known as carriers: If two carriers have a child, there is a 25% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> have SCA, a 50% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>will</b> be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the <b>child</b> <b>will</b> neither have SCA nor be a carrier. Were {{the presence of the}} SCA allele to confer only negative traits, its allele frequency would be expected to decrease generation after generation, until its presence were completely eliminated by selection and by chance.|$|R
25|$|Due to the Stone Dogs virus, Draka forces {{ultimately}} succeed—if barely—in {{wiping out}} all significant Alliance populations and {{military forces in}} the Earth-Luna sphere. In the process, they lose 15 percent of the Citizen population and 22 percent of the serf population—300 million total. The Alliance, though suffering 400 million casualties and losing its Ceres command center, wins in trans-Lunar space, including the Belt. A truce is declared, allowing the Alliance remnants in the Belt to launch the starship, while giving other Alliance remnants in space limited Draka citizenship (the new Draka {{will not be able}} to vote, though <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> be). The war itself proves to be devastating to Earth. Though the Solar System belongs to the Draka, the planet's ecosystems were pushed nearly to the breaking point. The war causes a nuclear winter lasting for several years, a climatic disturbance so severe that ice forms in the Adriatic Sea, despite most nukes being 'clean' fusion weapons and Archon Eric von Shrakenberg, in an effort to limit damage to the planet, ordering no more nuclear weapons used within the atmosphere after a certain point in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|In the Imboden District by contrast, it is {{only used}} habitually by 22%, and is the {{language}} of best command for only 9.9%. Even within this district however, the presence of Romansh varies, with 41.3% in Trin reporting to speak it habitually. In the Sutselva, the local Romansh dialects are extinct in most villages, with a few elder speakers remaining in places such as Präz, Scharans, Feldis/Veulden, and Scheid, though passive knowledge is slightly more common. Some municipalities still offer Romansh as a foreign language subject in school, though it is often under pressure of being replaced by Italian. The notably exception is Schams, where it is still regularly transmitted to children and where the language of instruction is Romansh. In the Surmeir region, it is still the dominant every day language in the Surses, but has mostly disappeared from the Albula Valley. The highest proportion of habitual speakers is found in Salouf with 86.3%, the lowest in Obervaz with 18.9%. In these areas, many Romansh speakers only speak German with their spouses as an accommodation or because of a habit, though they sometimes speak Romansh to their children. In most cases, this is not because of a will to preserve the language, but because of other reasons such as Romansh having been their own childhood language or a belief that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> later find it easier to learn additional languages.|$|E

2500|$|Classics {{are often}} {{defined in terms}} of their lasting freshness. Clifton Fadiman thought that the works that become classic books have their start in childhood, saying that [...] "If you wish to live long in the memory of men, you should not write for them at all.

[...] Fadiman unites classic books through the ages in a continuum (and concurs with Goethe's thoughts on the vigor and relevance of the ancient Classics), when he states that classic books share a [...] "quality of beginningness" [...] with the legendary writer of the Iliad and the Odyssey – Homer himself. [...] Ezra Pound in his own tome on reading, ABC of Reading, gave his opinion when he stated, [...] "A classic is classic not because it conforms to certain structural rule, or fits certain definitions (of which its author had quite probably never heard). [...] It is classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness." [...] Michael Dirda, the 1993 Pulitzer Prize winning critic, concurred with Pound's view regarding the vitality of a classic when he wrote that [...] "...one of the true elements of a classic" [...] was that [...] "they can be read again and again with ever-deepening pleasure." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of The Mismeasure of Man, Bernard Davis, {{professor}} of microbiology at Harvard Medical School, said that Gould erected a straw man argument based upon incorrectly defined key terms—specifically reification—which Gould furthered with a [...] "highly selective" [...] presentation of statistical data, all motivated more by politics than by science. That Philip Morrison’s laudatory book review of The Mismeasure of Man in Scientific American, was written and published because {{the editors of the}} journal had [...] "long seen the study of the genetics of intelligence as a threat to social justice". Davis also criticized the popular-press and the literary-journal book reviews of The Mismeasure of Man as generally approbatory; whereas, most scientific-journal book reviews were generally critical. Nonetheless, in 1994, Gould contradicted Davis by arguing that of twenty-four academic book reviews written by experts in psychology, fourteen approved, three were mixed opinions, and seven disapproved of the book. Furthermore, Davis accused Gould of having misrepresented a study by Henry H. Goddard (1866–1957) about the intelligence of Jewish, Hungarian, Italian, and Russian immigrants to the U.S., wherein Gould reported Goddard's qualifying those people as [...] "feeble-minded"; whereas, in the initial sentence of the study, Goddard said the study subjects were atypical members of their ethnic groups, who had been selected because of their suspected sub-normal intelligence. Countering Gould, Davis further explained that Goddard proposed that the low IQs of the sub-normally intelligent men and women who took the cognitive-ability test likely derived from their social environments rather than from their respective genetic inheritances, and concluded that [...] "we may be confident that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>will</b> be of average intelligence, and, if rightly brought up, will be good citizens".|$|E
