40|$|In {{this thesis}} the author {{examines}} a 'revolution' {{taking place in}} the shipping industry brought on by the development of computerisation, electronic commerce and the change from paper documentation to electronic documentation in the carriage of goods by sea. The focus of the paper is on Bolero, a project of the European Community beginning in the early 1990 s and which has been used commercially since September 1999. In this paper the author follows the Bolero project from its inception as an experiment through to its commercial application. The question is asked to what extent Bolero has become an alternative to, or in fact replaced paper documentation in the carriage of goods by sea. As an introduction the author looks at the paper bill of lading and other forms of sea <b>transport</b> <b>documentation</b> with a focus on their advantages and disadvantages. He then examines the development of EDI and paperless sea <b>transport</b> <b>documentation,</b> in particular Bolero and the history of its development. Following this is an in depth investigation of the Bolero system in its current form, the contractual relations involved and the position of Bolero in the surrounding legal framework in a South African and international context.

30|$|Organisation of {{the rail}} {{transport}} of goods between Slovakia and Ukraine is a demanding and time-consuming process requiring the cooperation and coordination of all services to observe legal, technological, organisational and technical regulations. Establishing a common CIM/SMGS consignment note is a key goal {{in the implementation of}} fast, efficient and safe transportation of goods between the European Union and Ukraine. The introduction of a common CIM/SMGS consignment note will contribute to a greater legal certainty for all participants in the process of transportation of cargo in international traffic. Moreover the time of freight transport will be reduced, thus contributing to a reduction in transport costs and an improved quality of transport. Failings in electronic data processing of CIM and SMGS consignment notes greatly extend the processing time of <b>transport</b> <b>documentation,</b> leading to increased transportation costs. In the interests of offering customers a simpler method for organising transport between member states signatories to the CIM and SMGS, contract work to improve existing rules and introduction of new technical and technological innovations are needed. It is necessary to introduce an electronic information system that will enable the electronic processing of transport documents or electronic CIM/SMGS consignment notes. The system must be compatible with the system of the countries participating in the implementation of rail freight transport between Slovakia and Ukraine so as to accelerate the process of checking and issuing the documentation required when goods move from Ukraine to Slovakia, and vice versa. Electronic processing of <b>transport</b> <b>documentation</b> offers a flexible and efficient service with the information available in real time among all participants involved in the process of transporting goods by rail. The introduction of electronic processing of transport documents reduces the technological processing time for handling the wagons, speeds up the transport process and increases the efficiency of employees. According to the case study, if electronic waybills were to be applied, this would equate to a saving of 170  min or 66.7  % of the total time spent at border stations.|$|E
30|$|One {{important}} future {{potential market}} is in east-west direction corridors. Organising railway freight transport between Slovakia and Ukraine {{is an example}} where the potential for improvements is high, but traditional manual procedures increase lead times dramatically and thus limit the attractiveness of rail freight. Abramović et al. [1] present a method for optimising freight traffic procedures {{on the border between}} Slovakia (European Union) and Ukraine. The most important organisational aspect of transport in this case is the existence of two different procedures. In Slovakia, transport is organised according to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), and in Ukraine, transport is organised according to the Agreement on International Goods Transport by Rail (SMGS). Unfortunately, all procedures are carried out completely manually. This means that <b>transport</b> <b>documentation</b> is rewritten from SMGS to COTIF, or vice versa. This process is very labour-intensive and time-consuming. The authors performed a case study using the critical path method (CPM) for optimisation of the technological process for transport methodology at the Čierna (Slovakia) and Tisou (Ukraine) railway stations and proposed a method for electronic data exchange between the rail and customs authorities of Slovakia and Ukraine to cut down the whole process by 170  min or 66.7 % of the total time spent at the border stations.|$|E
40|$|Stroke is {{a common}} and serious health disorder, {{affecting}} approximately 795, 000 people in the United States every year. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) is the only FDA approved thrombolytic for treating acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours of symptom onset. Patients treated at rural health centers are often transported within hours to the closest primary stroke center. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the structure, process and outcomes related to the inter-facility transport of ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous rtPA. The Quality-Caring Model© was the guiding framework. A quantitative, retrospective, non-experimental analysis of inter-facility <b>transport</b> <b>documentation</b> was conducted. The study population included ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous rtPA at a North Carolina hospital and were subsequently transferred to the primary stroke center. The study correlated structural and process components (type of transport, time of transport, and adherence to protocol) in relation to patient outcomes (presence of post rtPA intracerebral hemorrhage and discharge disposition). The study sample size was considered too small to support statistical significance. However, the sample demonstrated the variation in terms of age, community and transport type. Factors associated with protocol adherence include: air medical transport, shorter transport times, and transporting with the intravenous rtPA infusing en route. Factors associated with protocol non-adherence include: night shift transport and transport times greater than or equal to 60 minutes. The research confirms the need for a state-wide guideline for inter-facility transport of ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous rtPA...|$|E
40|$|Investigations were {{performed}} to identify the thermal environment in three different types of broiler transport vehicles {{from the site of}} production to processing plants in Sweden and Denmark. Vehicles with mechanical ventilation systems (F-vehicles) had pressure fans in combination with adjustable openings in front, sides and back. F-vehicles were winter configured by turning the fans off and increasing the natural ventilation (FN-vehicles). The naturally ventilated vehicles (N-vehicles) had adjustable openings in front, back and sides of the vehicle. Tarpaulin vehicles (K-vehicles) were Danish vehicles constructed with solid roof and front, and detachable tarpaulin sides for summer and winter configurations. All broilers were mechanically harvested. Long term investigations {{were performed}} on <b>transport</b> <b>documentations</b> from 2, 310 Swedish vehicles during Oct. 2005 to Oct. 2006 (F- and FN-vehicles) and Apr. 2006 - Oct. 2006 (N-vehicles). The number of broilers dead on arrival (DOA) was 0. 14 % and 0. 39 % for F- and N-vehicles, respectively. Transport time up to 3. 5 h, ambient- and lorry temperature had no effects on DOA (R 2 = 0, 013), however a small increase was seen at ambient temperatures above 17 ºC (NS). Intensive studies of twenty three transports were performed during Jun. – Aug. 2006 and Dec. 2006 – Feb. 2007, where levels of temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in containers at different locations of the vehicles were measured during loading and transit. Loading practise had an impact on temperature development in the F-vehicle and to reduce heat stress they should be loaded back to front. Keeping both sides of the vehicle open during loading was important to avoid increasing temperatures in the containers. In F-vehicles with fans turned off the internal climate becomes unstable, especially in the trailer. In N-vehicles during summer temperatures were high, exceeding 25 °C in the lower, central parts of the trailer. In these certain parts of the vehicle air flow needs to be increased. During transport large internal climatic differences were found between containers in both F- and N-vehicle. A calculated temperature-humidity index (THI) was at acute dangerous levels in certain containers. In N-vehicles the drawers’ construction was limiting ventilation. K-vehicles had the most acceptable climate during summer, but unstable during winter with risk for temperatures down to 0 °C. In conclusion, the ventilation system designs in the vehicles are crucial for appropriate climate control and are in several cases in need of revising or reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|What are {{the core}} {{activities}} of the FSC? The FSC is an international non-profit organization that was founded in 1993 to introduce an international forest certification scheme and {{to act as an}} accreditation body. Forest certification is the process of inspecting particular forests or woodland to see if they are being managed according to an agreed set of strict ecological, economic and social criteria or standards. The FSC does not itself certify forest operations or manufacturers. These important activities are carried out by independent, FSC-accredited certification bodies in more than 30 countries. An important component of forest certification is product or chain-of-custody (CoC) verification. CoC is the process through which the source of a timber product is verified. In order to qualify for the FSC trademark, timber products must be traceable from the forest through all the steps in the production process until they reach the end user. The FSC provides producers with international labelling standards to facilitate this process. Over the past few decades, CoC labelling processes have greatly benefited from ICTs. How have CoC methods evolved? The oldest methods of wood labelling involved painting or chiselling company information and ID numbers onto a tree, or on one or both ends of a log. Such labels are commonly used in conjunction with paper records on tree or log species, dimensions and volume. More recently, ICTs are providing increasingly sophisticated means of labelling, as well as more efficient tools for tracking and storing additional information about timber products. The first major technological leap was the bar-coded label. Bar-coded data can be instantly read by a handheld scanner, stored electronically and transferred to a computer for analyses of stock inventories, for example. Bar-coded labels are increasingly being used to identify individual logs, particularly in countries that export high-value logs, and it is important to capture export revenues. Another key development has been the emergence of labels containing radio frequency identification (RFID) transceivers that receive and transmit data by radio signals. A handheld scanner can instruct any RFID label to transmit its data through a coded signal. The scanner may then be plugged into a computer and the data downloaded for further analysis. An important advantage of RFID systems for log tracking is that the data signals can be read rapidly, remotely and under difficult conditions. Also, RFID labels can store a large amount of data {{with a high level of}} security - they are difficult to counterfeit or tamper with. The tags come in a variety of forms, including plastic cards and tiny injectable transponders. On the down side, available radio frequencies vary from country to country, so there are currently no internationally standardized RFID technologies. What´s more, RFID labels are still too expensive for labelling individual logs and processed bundles of wood. What advanced technologies are now being used to capture data? CoC systems require careful documentation and record keeping, including files related to stock inventories and inspections, <b>transport</b> <b>documentation,</b> and retail and distribution records. The forestry industry has developed extensive databases to manage these records more effectively. Also, Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has had a major impact on this aspect of the CoC. GPS is commonly used in forest inventories to delineate the boundaries of forested areas and to determine field locations, but can also be used to track shipments of logs and timber products and to provide estimated delivery times. Microchip cards, or ´smart cards´, and magnetic strip cards are also very useful. These pieces of plastic can store large amounts of data and have built-in security features - they are ideal replacements for paper records and make the logistics of tracking timber products much more efficient. Finally, how is the FSC using ICTs to disseminate information? As an international network, the FSC relies on electronic communication to reach its 500 members and 33 national offices, in addition to annual face-to-face meetings. The FSC provides information in both Spanish and English to reach its stakeholders in the South, and has recently launched a new website and intranet. All relevant new developments are announced in the monthly FSC email newsletter News+Notes, which is sent to more than 4000 subscribers around the world. Moreover, the FSC has set up a hotline to answer questions, and has created a number of web-based forums so that stakeholders can more easily exchange information regarding the Council´s policies, consultations and other issues related to forest management. Taken together, these initiatives form part of a concerted, ongoing effort on the part of the FSC to increase awareness of the many benefits of forest certification - now and in the future. mailto:andra@fscoax. org Zandra Martinez is FSC media officer.

40|$|M. Ed. Over {{the past}} decade, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has had a}} devastating effect on many communities and families in South Africa. Many families have already lost, and many more will lose, primary caregivers to the disease. This could have a serious impact on the living conditions and emotional wellbeing of families, and especially of children and adolescents. As an intern educational psychologist working in the Eldorado Park community, the researcher {{became aware of the}} difficulties and needs experienced by families that are affected by HIV/AIDS. This study therefore aims to identify the needs of families affected by HIV/AIDS, in order to assist the educational psychologist by making recommendations for weaving a circle of care to support them, within an asset-based approach. To accomplish this, the study utilised a participatory research approach within a critical theoretical paradigm and case study design. Purposeful selection was employed and as the study is concerned with HIV/AIDS which requires the utmost confidentiality, the families were identified with the help of home-based care workers. The researcher interviewed three families and eight home-based care workers in the Eldorado Park community. Detailed data analysis and interpretation of the needs highlighted during these interviews revealed a number of common themes, which are indicative of the needs of families affected by HIV/AIDS in the Eldorado Park area. These families expressed a need for awareness, love and understanding from their communities. They also wish to have greater understanding and support from schools, as well as expressing the need for opportunities to share their experiences and raise community awareness by speaking at schools and churches, and through support groups. Families furthermore require assistance with the great economic difficulties they face, largely due to illness and unemployment. A need to gain greater access to medical care, social grants and burial societies, was expressed. Difficulties with <b>transport</b> and <b>documentation</b> seemed to create a major barrier in this regard. The need for psychological and spiritual counselling as well as legal advice was highlighted.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionTriage is an {{important}} aspect of the management of mass casualty incidents. This study describes the triage after the Turkish Airlines Crash near Amsterdam in 2009. The results of the triage and the injuries of P 3 casualties were evaluated. In addition, the role of the trauma mechanism and its effect on spinal immobilisation during transport was analysed. MethodsRetrospective analysis of investigational reports, ambulance forms, and medical charts of survivors of the crash. Outcomes were triage classification, type of injury, AIS, ISS, emergency interventions and the spinal immobilisation during <b>transport.</b> ResultsA minimal <b>documentation</b> of prehospital triage was found, and no exact numbers could be recollected. During inhospital triage 28 % was triaged as P 1, 10 % had an ISS≥ 16 and 3 % met the modified Baxt criteria for emergency intervention. 40 % was triaged P 3, 72 % had an ISS≤ 8 and 63 % was discharged from the Emergency Department after evaluation. In hospital over-triage was up to 89 %. Critical mortality rate was 0 %. Nine per cent of P 3 casualties and 17 % of ‘walking’ casualties had serious injuries. Twenty-two per cent of all casualties was transported with spinal immobilisation. Of the casualties diagnosed with spinal injury 22 % was not transported with spinal immobilisation. ConclusionAfter the Turkish Airlines Crash documentation of prehospital triage was minimal. According to the Baxt criteria the overtriage was high. Injuries sustained by plane crash survivors that seem minimally harmed must not be underestimated. Considering the high energy trauma mechanism, too little consideration was given to spinal immobilisation during transport...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} skilled staff are in short supply, it is {{essential}} to give consideration to the use of assistive systems in the care sector. Service robots can make a significant contribution to relieving the pressure on care staff. In order to identify the demand of the care workers for support, a requirements study in an elderly care facility has been conducted. This included interviews with members of the management and care workers as well as accompanying care workers during their work. The requirement analysis showed that care workers would specifically welcome assistance with their routine day-to-day activities, such as <b>transport</b> tasks and <b>documentation.</b> They also expressed the wish that new assistive systems should help to reduce their physical workload – especially in relation to the lifting of persons. In addition, it would be helpful if such systems could support and promote the independence of patients. The presentation will introduce several solutions that were designed and/or implemented by Fraunhofer IPA or their project partners, specifically a small and versatile transport vehicle able to independently pick up and transport containers and to assist care workers on night shift by carrying out patrols for them, a care trolley for automatically providing care staff with the necessary care utensils and documenting their use, a new lifter equipped with additional assistive features making operation by the care personnel easier, a service robot serving drinks to the residents. It can be predicted that the first products for this area of application will be made available in the coming years - e. g. transport robots or assistive systems equipped with robotic functions and easy-to-use control interfaces. In all cases, these systems are controlled and used by humans and not robots that independently administer care to patients or make their own decisions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Motorcycle crash victims form a high {{proportion}} of those killed or injured in road traffic crashes. Injuries to the head, following motorcycle crashes, are a common cause of severe morbidity and mortality. It seems intuitive that helmets should protect against head injuries but {{it has been argued that}} motorcycle helmet use decreases rider vision and increases neck injuries. This review will collate the current available evidence on helmets and their impact on mortality, and head, face and neck injuries following motorcycle crashes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of wearing a motorcycle helmet in reducing mortality and head and neck injury following motorcycle crashes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (up to April 2007), EMBASE (up to April week 16, 2007), CINAHL (January 1982 to February 2003), TRANSPORT (up to issue 12, 2006) (TRANSPORT combines the following databases: Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS) International <b>Transport</b> Research <b>Documentation</b> (ITRD) formerly International Road Research Documentation (IRRD), ATRI (Australian Transport Index) (1976 to Feb 2003), Science Citation Index were searched for relevant articles. Websites of traffic and road safety research bodies including government agencies were also searched. Reference lists from topic reviews, identified studies and bibliographies were examined for relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered studies that investigated a population of motorcycle riders who had crashed, examining helmet use as an intervention and with outcomes that included one or more of the following: death, head, neck or facial injury. We included any studies that compared an intervention and control group. Therefore the following study designs were included: randomised controlled trials, non-randomised controlled trials, cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. Ecological and case series studies were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened reference lists for eligible articles. Two authors independently assessed articles for inclusion criteria. Data were abstracted by two independent authors using a standard abstraction form. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-one observational studies were selected of varying quality. Despite methodological differences there was a remarkable consistency in results, particularly for death and head injury outcomes. Motorcycle helmets were found to reduce the risk of death and head injury in motorcyclists who crashed. From four higher quality studies helmets were estimated to reduce the risk of death by 42 % (OR 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 50 to 0. 68) and from six higher quality studies helmets were estimated to reduce the risk of head injury by 69 % (OR 0. 31, 95 % CI 0. 25 to 0. 38). Insufficient evidence was found to estimate the effect of motorcycle helmets compared with no helmet on facial or neck injuries. However, studies of poorer quality suggest that helmets have no effect on the risk of neck injuries and are protective for facial injury. There was insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether differences in helmet type confer more or less advantage in injury reduction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Motorcycle helmets reduce the risk of death and head injury in motorcycle riders who crash. Further well-conducted research is required to determine the effects of helmets and different helmet types on mortality, head, neck and facial injuries. However, the findings suggest that global efforts to reduce road traffic injuries may be facilitated by increasing helmet use by motorcyclists...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus in}} {{environmental}} management has {{during the last}} decades in many cases shifted to include all the phases in a product’s (or a service’s) life – the life-cycle perspective. The transport system has a large environmental pressure on the environment. Train traffic is habitually regarded as an environmentally preferable mean of transport, mainly depending on that trains often are driven by electricity. This view is also true when the operation phase alone is considered; at least if the electricity derives from renewable sources. In a life-cycle perspective the advantages of this mean of transport get less apparent. The extraction of the raw materials requires plenty of energy, energy which often is produced by fossil fuels. A dominating part of the material-related energy requirements in the railway infrastructure {{can be referred to}} a few materials. The main part of these materials {{can be found in a}} few products; rails, railway ties, ballast materials, cables and the contact wire system. It is here that the effort to reduce the environmental impact of the railway infrastructure should lie to become most efficient. The aim of the thesis is to investigate how the environmental pressure is affected by the service lives, i. e. the technical durability as well as the durability in practise, of the most energy-intense railway products, as well as reuse of them. The objective is to map estimated service lives and reuse in order to create scenarios representing the present state of how the products are used and reused in Sweden. The scenarios are used in order to analyse the importance of focusing on service lives and reuse when reducing environmental pressure. The objective is also to find out which possibilities and hindrances there are to increase the service lives and the reuse of the products. To investigate the environmental pressure of the railway infrastructure, embodied energy is used as indicator. Embodied energy represents the energy needed to produce a product, from extracting the materials to the production phase. The present state concerning service lives and reuse of the studied products are mapped through interviews with employees at Banverket and at VTI. The empirical material is analysed and scenarios are created in order to evaluate the environmental importance of service lives and reuse. Organizational issues concerning service lives and reuse are also investigated. The present state service lives varies between 25 and 100 years for the realistic scenarios for all the products. The estimated service lives varies between 25 and 100 years for the new technology scenarios. When it comes to the best-case scenarios the estimated service lives varies between 60 and 120 years, depending on railway product. The only products reused today are rails and railway ties. There are considerable improvements to be made by increasing service lives, and this pertains to all the studied products. The reductions in embodied energy per year go up to 75 % if the New-Technology Scenario is applied and to 33 % if the Realistic Scenarios are applied. If the Low Realistic Scenarios are applied the reductions goes up to 50 %. A great improvement potential exist for all the products if the New-Technology Scenarios are applied. The products where the main improvement potential when it comes to the Realistic and the Low Realistic Scenarios exist are the macadam-ballast, the cables, the rails and the railway ties. If the New-Technology Scenarios are applied for all the products the total improvement span is as much as 69 % altogether. If the Low Realistic Scenario instead is applied, the improvement span is calculated to 38 - 39 % (depending on the exchange level of macadam-ballast). If the Realistic Scenario is applied, the improvement span is calculated to 23 % and if the Best-Case Scenario is applied the span is calculated to 7 %, depending on that the most energy efficient strategy is to reuse the products possible to reuse. The main part of this improvement potential derives from the rails and the railway ties. In reducing the environmental pressure it is important to make use of the products as much as possible, i. e. to reuse them and use them as long as possible. If rails and railway ties are reused and made use of during their entire service life, all energy invested in the products is made use of. The most environmental sound alternative is to reuse the products which are reusable and to use these products as long as they last. This gives a need for embodied energy of 16 GJ/yr and km for the railway ties and 38 GJ/yr for the rails on the mainline track. The energy allocated to the tracks where the products are reused is calculated to 3 GJ/yr and km for the railway ties and to 7 GJ/yr and km for the rails. Actions of maintenance prolong the durability of the products, e. g. by increasing the stability in the embankment and hence reduce the wearing. The administration of the used material is the main problem in order to create a well-functioning reuse of railway articles. This includes <b>transports,</b> storage and <b>documentation</b> of products. Tradition and routines also stand in the way of creating a sustainable reuse of these products...|$|R
