5|$|The List of Florida hurricanes {{encompasses}} approximately 500tropical or subtropical cyclones {{that affected}} {{the state of}} Florida. More storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state, and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons passed without a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring {{prior to the start}} of Hurricane Hunters flights in 1943. Additionally, the cumulative impact from the storms totaled over $141billion in damage (2017USD), primarily from Hurricane Andrew and hurricanes in the 2004 and 2005 seasons.|$|E
5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 12:10 local time for a 15-minute warm-up session. It was due to run for 30 minutes but was first delayed by a light rain shower <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> area in the early morning. Then the session was prematurely ended when Barron drove into pit road with {{a large amount of}} fluid coming out from his car. Nakano was the fastest driver with a time of 32.280 seconds which was {{recorded}} on his second timed lap. Bräck took second, and Herta rounded out the top three.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, several sailors {{received}} medals {{for their}} conduct and actions under fire. Lieutenant Commander Samuel G. Fuqua, the ship's damage control officer, earned the Medal of Honor for his cool-headedness while quelling fires and getting survivors off the wrecked battleship. Posthumous awards of the Medal of Honor {{also went to}} two high-ranking officers who were on board the battleship when it was destroyed, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first flag officer killed in the Pacific war, and Captain Franklin Van Valkenburgh, who reached the bridge and was attempting to defend his ship when the bomb <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> onboard ammunition magazines destroyed it. Arizona was awarded one battle star for her service in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Klaus was a North Atlantic {{hurricane}} <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Leeward Islands {{from the}} west in November of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming from a broad {{area of low pressure}} on November 5, Klaus maintained a northeast movement throughout much of its path. After making landfall on extreme eastern Puerto Rico, it passed {{to the north of the}} Leeward Islands, resulting in strong southwesterly winds and rough seas. Klaus attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of 90mph (145km/h) before becoming extratropical over cooler waters on November 13. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding and light damage. Klaus caused heavy marine damage in the Leeward Islands, including wrecking at least three ships. The Virgin Islands experienced heavy damage as well.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} June15, {{although}} an unnamed storm developed {{about a week}} prior over the western North Atlantic Ocean. A later storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on June12 alleviated drought conditions in the south-central United States. Hurricane Anna developed in late July and hit Mexico. Tropical storms Carla and Ethel both formed near the Bahamas and moved northeastward until dissipating. The lone hurricane <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> contiguous United States was Hurricane Flossy. One of the final storms of the year, Greta, was an unusually large hurricane that produced high waves from Florida to the Lesser Antilles. It developed in the western Caribbean and moved {{across much of the}} southeastern United States, causing $24.8million in damage and 15deaths. There were also several tropical depressions, as well as one subtropical cyclone, in the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{types of}} soil where the Valley of the Kings is located are an {{alternating}} sandwich of dense limestone and other sedimentary rock (which form the cliffs {{in the valley}} and the nearby Deir el-Bahri) and soft layers of marl. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35–56 million years ago {{during a time when}} the precursor to the Mediterranean Sea covered an area that extended much further inland than it does today. During the Pleistocene the valley was carved out of the plateau by steady rains. There is currently little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional flash floods <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1970s, the United Kingdom was in a state of social unrest and {{widespread}} poverty as a result of the ineffective social politics of both Conservative and Labour Party governments during a three-year period of economic recession. As a consequence of deindustrialization, the unemployment rate was exceptionally high, especially among working class youth. It continued to rise in the early 1980s, peaking in February 1983. The discontent of so many people caused social unrest with frequent strikes, and culminated in a series of riots (see 1981 Brixton riot, 1981 Toxteth riots). During this period, the mass of young people, deprived of the prospect of even relatively low-skill jobs that were available to the previous generations, searched for different ways to earn money in the music and entertainment businesses. The explosion of new bands and new musical styles coming from the UK in the late 1970s was a result of their efforts to make a living in the economic depression <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> country before the governments of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{original}} monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq Al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Sir, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr Al-Abd (Castle of the Slave). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, {{all of which are}} barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> region in the year 362. Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources.|$|E

If quantum correlations are present, the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed image can be improved. In 2009 'pseudothermal ghost imaging' and 'ghost diffraction' were demonstrated by implementing the 'computational ghost-imaging' scheme, which relaxed the need to evoke quantum correlations arguments for the pseudothermal source case.|$|R

5|$|The Huskies {{were unable}} to match their early success {{in the second half}} of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, {{including}} one with 1:09 left in the game <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40–16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No.25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No.23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.|$|E
