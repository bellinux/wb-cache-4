5|$|A <b>topmost</b> floor, {{supported}} by the stacks framework itself, contains thirty-two rooms for special collections, studies, offices, and seminars.|$|E
5|$|Occipital condyles - Two knobs at {{the base}} of the skull fit into the <b>topmost</b> neck vertebra; most other tetrapods, in contrast, have only one such knob.|$|E
5|$|The barangays or villages, meanwhile, {{are headed}} by elected officials, the <b>topmost</b> being the Punong Barangay or the Barangay Chairperson (addressed as Kapitan; {{also known as}} the Barangay Captain). The Kapitan is aided by the Sangguniang Barangay (Barangay Council) whose members, called Barangay Kagawad (Councilors), are also elected.|$|E
5|$|The side altar {{located on}} the left hand side facing the altar is consecrated to the Santo Niño. Joining the statue of the Holy Child are 19th century images of Saint Anthony of Padua and Saint Blaise; and Saint Lucy on the <b>topmost</b> level. Another smaller neoclassical retablo housing a 19th-century image of Saint Mary Magdalene is {{located on the}} left side of the gospel retablo.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the <b>topmost</b> layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the <b>topmost</b> levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
5|$|Kronan {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{warships}} in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the <b>topmost</b> gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} side of the altar are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin of the altar {{opposite}} it, houses an image of a unidentified saint on the <b>topmost</b> level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally Madonna and Child) in the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with a crucifix in its central niche. On the doorframes of the sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|E
5|$|The {{forests of}} the region {{are known to be}} {{evergreen}} type with a preponderance of deciduous species with a levelled distribution. The <b>topmost</b> level consists of Garjan (Dipterocarpus alatus), Telsur (Hopea odorata), Chapalish (Artocarpus chaplasha), Chundul (Tetrameles nudiflora) and Koroi or the Moluccan albizia (Falcataria moluccana). The lower level consists of species of Jarul (Lagerstroemia speciosa), Toon (Toona ciliata), Jam (Syzygium cumini), Jalpai (Elaeocarpus robustus) and Glochidion. Lianas, epiphytes (mostly of orchids, asclepiads, ferns and leafy mosses) and herbaceous undergrowths are abundant. Savannah formations are found in the open, along the banks of rivers and swamps with common tall grasses like Kans (Saccharum spontaneum), Shon (Imperata cylindrica and I. arundincca) and Bena (Vetiveria zizanoides). Several species of Bamboo are cultivated that are common in Bangladesh including Bambusa balcooa (which is also common in Assam), B. vulgaris, B. longispiculata, B. tulda and B. nutans; the latter two also being common in the hills of the region.|$|E
5|$|The geology in Dwarf Fortress {{is fairly}} accurate. Rocks like olivine or gabbro can be dug up. The <b>topmost</b> layer usually {{consists}} of sand, clay or plain soil—this {{can be used}} for underground farming. Deeper levels will be layers of rock; minerals appear in layers or clusters around the right depth. Gems like tourmalines appear in rare clusters. Water is simulated like falling sand, every space can contain up to seven levels of it. A tile having one level of water is the lowest, while a tile with seven is full. There is a system for simulating temperature and heat. Fires can spread and burn dwarves and furniture. There are four basic seasons in an in-game year: spring, summer, autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr is {{the fifth}} highest non-imperial office (eighth overall), coming after the megas doux and before the megas logothetes. Its {{insignia}} of office {{were similar to those}} of the megas doux, i.e. a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapoton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again in red and gold and decorated with golden wire, with a portrait of the emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear. Only his staff of office (dikanikion) differed, with only the <b>topmost</b> carved knots in gold, and the rest in silver. The knobs in the staff remained gold, bordered with silver braid. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr retained some functions, mostly ceremonial, echoing his origin as a stable master: he carried the emperor's sword, he led the emperor's horse when he left the palace, although the actual responsibility for the emperor's horses now rested with the komēs tōn basilikōn hippōn ("count of the imperial horses"). In war, the prōtostratōr was responsible for the irregulars ("those who have neither order nor their own banner") and scouts who preceded the army.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} side of the altar are two retablos. The larger altar on {{the right side}} {{currently}} houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on the <b>topmost</b> level. On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center, and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches, respectively. The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion in the center, Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (originally St Joachim) on the left. The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style, respectively, with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper. The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also on this side of the church. The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros. An apocryphal account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes' tomb; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns, which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes.|$|E
5|$|Once inside, Roy {{is shown}} the true history of The Scouring. The dragons, despite their power, {{were unable to}} {{maintain}} their numbers due to how slowly they reproduced compared to humans. As the war came to a close, the surviving Fire Dragons captured a Divine Dragon named Idunn and sealed away her soul. Enslaved to their will, Idunn reproduced dragons at an incredible rate and {{became known as the}} Demon Dragon, but she was defeated by a warrior wielding the Binding Blade. Her power was locked away until Zephiel, disgusted at humanity's failings, released her out of his insane desire to return Elibe to the dragons. As she has no emotion or free will, Idunn continues to follow Zephiel's orders even after his death and threatens to raise a dragon army that will destroy everything on the continent. On the <b>topmost</b> floor of the temple, the Etrurian Army battles Idunn's endlessly spawning dragons, allowing Roy to deliver the final blow on her with the Binding Blade. This does not kill her, and Roy carries her out as the temple collapses behind him. In the war's wake, Elibe begins to rebuild itself. Guinivere is named the new ruler of Bern, while Elffin returns to Etruria after his long absence. Roy and Lilina become the new marquesses of Pherae and Ostia, while Idunn is taken to Arcadia and lives with Fae as her soul slowly returns to her.|$|E
25|$|The Runner Stone is the <b>topmost</b> {{of a pair}} of millstones. It {{is driven}} by the Stone Nut. The lower stone is called a Bedstone.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the secular}} songs in both manuscripts, {{including}} those by Perez de Gijón, are villancicos; {{most of them are}} for three voices, with the tune in the <b>topmost</b> voice.|$|E
25|$|For the <b>topmost</b> honour, Glo-CAF Player of the Year {{across the}} world, the contenders are Emmanuel Adebayor (Arsenal and Togo), Michael Essien (Chelsea and Ghana) and Mohamed Aboutrika (Al-Ahly and Egypt).|$|E
25|$|Abu Dhabi in the 1970s {{was planned}} for a {{predicted}} <b>topmost</b> population of 600,000. Following the urban planning {{ideals of the}} time period, the city has high-density tower blocks, and wide grid-pattern roads.|$|E
25|$|Every {{context-free}} grammar {{can be transformed}} into an equivalent nondeterministic pushdown automaton. The derivation process of the grammar is simulated in a leftmost way. Where the grammar rewrites a nonterminal, the PDA takes the <b>topmost</b> nonterminal from its stack and replaces it by the right-hand part of a grammatical rule (expand). Where the grammar generates a terminal symbol, the PDA reads a symbol from input when it is the <b>topmost</b> symbol on the stack (match). In a sense the stack of the PDA contains the unprocessed data of the grammar, corresponding to a pre-order traversal of a derivation tree.|$|E
25|$|In {{an online}} open poll, 2005, Ali al-Sistani was {{selected}} as the 30th <b>topmost</b> intellectual person in the world on the list of Top 100 Public Intellectuals by Prospect Magazine (UK) and Foreign Policy (US).|$|E
25|$|All {{crew were}} killed {{and most of the}} {{wreckage}} landed in the <b>topmost</b> lake although some can still be seen today. The only remains at the site are from the plane, as all bodies have been recovered.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} flag for hoisting from {{a horizontal}} pole (German: Hängeflagge; no. 4) is hoisted from a horizontal pole, normally {{attached to a}} building. The <b>topmost</b> stripe on the horizontal version of the flag faces away from the building.|$|E
25|$|Grenon's music shows {{aspects of}} both medieval and early Renaissance practice. His secular {{music is the}} most up-to-date, and {{includes}} examples {{of each of the}} prevailing formes fixes, the ballade, the virelai, and the rondeau. The melody is always in the <b>topmost</b> voice, and all are for three voices.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the plant}} is allowed to flower, it may produce seed pods {{containing}} small black seeds, which can be saved and planted the following year. Picking the leaves off the plant helps promote growth, largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the <b>topmost</b> leaves into new stems.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} flag for hoisting from a crossbar or banner (German: Bannerflagge; no. 5) {{is firmly}} {{attached to a}} horizontal crossbar from which it is hoisted, either by a vertical pole (no. 5a) or a horizontal one (no. 5b). The <b>topmost</b> stripe on the horizontal version of the flag normally faces to the left.|$|E
25|$|The {{walls and}} ceiling of the church were built from stone and white mortar. The stones of which Saint John the Baptist was built were brought from nearby Mount Matean. The ceiling was arched but the roof surface was {{elevated}} because the outside walls were built to {{the same level as}} <b>topmost</b> of the arched ceiling so that walls and roof meet at same level outside.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{point of}} this posture {{is that it is}} based on the six point star. Nataraja's head forms the <b>topmost</b> point of the star, while His {{spreading}} hair and right hand form the upper side points. His drape and raised left leg form the lower points, and His right leg that rests on the demon Myalagga forms the lowest point. Surrounding this is the arc of fire.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{new owners}} Doric was renamed Royal Odyssey. Before {{entering}} service for Royal Cruise Line, {{she received a}} four-month refit at the Greek shipyards of Perama and Neorion, where her funnel was rebuilt, her <b>topmost</b> deck expanded and a bulbous bow added below the waterline. Royal Odyssey entered service for Royal Cruise Line on 25 May 1982, and was used for cruises all around the world, including occasional cruises around the Pacific from Australia.|$|E
25|$|Chief Secretaries and Advisers to Administrators of Union Territories, in general, are {{junior in}} rank {{compared}} to the Chief Secretaries of States. The office bearers generally are of the rank Joint Secretary to Government of India and its equivalents. However, in NCT of Delhi and UT of Chandigarh, the <b>topmost</b> civil servant is either of the ranks of Secretary to Government of India and its equivalents or Additional Secretary to Government of India and its equivalents.|$|E
25|$|Modern terra sigillata is made {{by adding}} a {{deflocculant}} such as sodium silicate to a watery clay/water slip mixture and then allowing the clay particles to separate into layers by weight. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the <b>topmost</b> layers of slip, which contain the smallest and lightest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining heavier settled layers of deflocculated clay slip are discarded.|$|E
25|$|The second {{improvement}} {{introduced by}} Dowding {{was aimed at}} {{reducing the amount of}} information being sent to the pilots, and speeding its delivery. For this task, Dowding introduced a hierarchy of control and information flow which ensured that only the information the pilots needed was forwarded to them. At the <b>topmost</b> level was FCHQ filter room, located at Bentley Priory. FCHQ maintained an overall view of the entire battlespace. This information was then forwarded one step down a hierarchy, to the Groups.|$|E
25|$|The Mars Pathfinder {{conducted}} different investigations on the Martian soil {{using three}} scientific instruments. The lander contained a stereoscopic camera with spatial filters on an expandable pole called Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP), and the Atmospheric Structure Instrument/Meteorology Package (ASI/MET) which {{acts as a}} Mars meteorological station, collecting data about pressure, temperature, and winds. The MET structure included three windsocks mounted at three heights on a pole, the <b>topmost</b> at about one meter (yard) and generally registered winds from the West.|$|E
25|$|Uruk's {{agricultural}} surplus and large population base facilitated {{processes such as}} trade, specialization of crafts {{and the evolution of}} writing. Evidence from excavations such as extensive pottery and the earliest known tablets of writing support these events. Excavation of Uruk is highly complex because older buildings were recycled into newer ones, thus blurring the layers of different historic periods. The <b>topmost</b> layer most likely originated in the Jemdet Nasr period (3100–2900 BC) and is built on structures from earlier periods dating back to the Ubaid period.|$|E
25|$|Though {{some species}} are quite drab, the most {{conspicuous}} jewel bugs are often brilliantly colored, exhibiting {{a wide range of}} iridescent metallic hues that change with the view angle. The colors are the result of a combination of factors. Some species like Chrsyocoris stockerus and Scutellera nobilis display colors from multiple thin layers of pigmented chitin. The colors often change or become duller when the specimens are dried, due to the <b>topmost</b> chitinous layer becoming opaque and obscuring the colors of the bottom layer. The colors can be restored by moistening the surfaces with water.|$|E
25|$|Once an Accident, Out of Gas, or Flat Tire hazard {{has been}} played, and the {{appropriate}} remedy card played to correct it, the player must next play a Roll card {{in order to get}} moving again. A hazard can be played onto an opponent's battle area even if another one is already showing, but only the <b>topmost</b> hazard needs to be corrected before that player can use a Roll card. Playing a Roll against a Stop hazard corrects it and allows the player to start moving; a second Roll is not needed.|$|E
25|$|Mature human {{vocal folds}} are {{composed}} of layered structures which are quite different at the histological level. The <b>topmost</b> layer comprises stratified squamous epithelium which is bordered by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorally and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated.|$|E
25|$|The 24 tiles {{are laid}} out in four rows, the <b>topmost</b> of which {{contains}} only the four large numbers. The contestant may specify how many tiles to draw from each row, or simply state how many large and small numbers will be used; in the latter case, the assistant draws the tiles randomly. The numbers are usually placed on the board from right to left, starting with the small ones, but have occasionally been displayed in scrambled order. On rare occasions, the contestant has declined to make any choices, {{in which case the}} assistant selects the tiles.|$|E
