And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I felt it was improper to come <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E
5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

For their 2009 film, they immediately had the studio attain the licensing rights to the music, which was composed and originally performed by Harry Manfredini. They did not plan to use the score in its entirety, but they used Steve Jablonsky to compose a score that was reminiscent of Manfredini's and created the atmosphere for the 2009 film. Nispel contacted Jablonsky to score Friday the 13th after having worked with him on the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Nispel told Jablonsky [...] he wanted him to create something that Nispel could [...] "whistle when [...] left the theater", but was subtle enough that it would not immediately register while watching the film. Nispel said, [...] "I don't believe that, when you watch a Friday the 13th film, you want to feel like John Williams is sitting next <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> the London Symphony Orchestra".|$|E
500|$|As audio director, Klepacki {{also created}} many sound effects for Universe at War. For the alien Hierarchy, he {{cultivated}} an [...] "unnatural" [...] aesthetic through an [...] "arsenal of mangled noises". Klepacki used a [...] "combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts" [...] {{to give the}} faction's walkers a [...] "menacing machinelike breathing sound", and made up his own language to record [...] "various grunts, growls, mannerisms, and strange vocalizations. Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English, Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were [...] "telepathically speaking <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>with</b> a back-masking effect on their voices...as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain". The Novus effects were usually phased and involved [...] "mechanical movement, electricity, and metal sounds". He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who occasionally speak to one another. Lastly, he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari, describing their ambience as having [...] "more weight, thunder, heavy bass rumblings, vortex gusts..." [...] Klepacki directed the voice-acting to have a [...] "noble and strong" [...] feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic. He ultimately felt he did the work of [...] "three people" [...] with Universe at War, as the game's audio requirements changed constantly, requiring vigilance and programmer support. Divine Intervention was later nominated for a Game Audio Network Guild award, and the soundtrack was released as a free download after Petroglyph's efforts toward a traditional release were frustrated.|$|E
