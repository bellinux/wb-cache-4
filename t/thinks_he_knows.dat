5|$|At the school, the {{principal}} tells the legless man’s janitor guise {{that she was}} very worried when he did not show up that morning. Trevor, a bully who had earlier tormented Quinton, sees partially through the beggar's forms for a moment. Trevor later shows up at Quinton’s home to say he is sorry and says he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> who killed his father.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{introduces}} Mulder to Kritschgau, {{who claims}} that everything Mulder <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> about aliens is a lie. He {{tells him that}} his sister's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body he has just examined was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for {{the activities of the}} military–industrial complex. Mulder dismisses these claims until Scully tells him Kritschgau told her that she was given cancer to make him believe.|$|E
5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Fox Mulder. Both Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) eventually meet Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee who claims that everything Mulder <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> about aliens is a lie. Kritschgau tells Mulder that his sister Samantha Mulder's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, {{and that the}} alien body discovered in Canada was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for the military–industrial complex. Distraught by Kritschgau's claims, Mulder loses his faith. Later, the FBI investigates Mulder's apparent suicide. Scully confirms the unseen body's identity.|$|E

5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E
25|$|The Meditator {{finds it}} almost {{impossible}} to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.|$|E
500|$|After the robbery, Elaine still asks Jerry to {{give her}} the {{apartment}}. Jerry decides to have a look around the new apartment first. The apartment is great and Jerry takes it, allowing Elaine to move into the old apartment. Jerry is about to sign the lease to the apartment, but George tells him that if he was having second thoughts, he should not take it. This results in him thinking that George may want the new apartment for himself. The two have an argument resulting in neither of them wanting to move. They gamble for the apartment and Jerry wins. Meanwhile, Kramer claims that he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> where Jerry's stolen objects are, and suspects an Englishman along the hallway who denies having any [...] "stuff" [...] on him.|$|E

500|$|As Obama {{lived in}} Hyde Park, a more {{affluent}} neighborhood {{with a higher}} percentage of White voters {{than the rest of the}} district, the narrative of the race became [...] "the Black Panther against the professor" [...] Obama frequently came off as uptight. Rush criticized Obama: [...] "Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We’re not impressed with these folks with these Eastern elite degrees. Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> all about it." [...] Trotter said, [...] "Barack is viewed in part to be the white man in blackface in our community." [...] Though the Chicago Tribune endorsed Obama, many, including local officials, President Bill Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for President, endorsed Rush.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days before}} the season's premiere, Mel B made {{comments}} about the other judges, labelling them dishonest and boring. She said, [...] "I don't care much for the other judges...Ronan <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> it all [...] Natalie is just too nice and really dishonest. Guy could just be boring, like 'get on with it. Keep it moving, brother.'" [...] During a radio interview with The Kyle and Jackie O Show on 29 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte responded to Mel B's comments saying, [...] "I think it's in fun – I hope so otherwise she deserves a slap." [...] Mel B appeared on the same radio show the following day and said, [...] "They're all scared of me and I love it, there's got to be one bitch on the show so I might as well take that bloody crown." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a full four stars, and {{considered}} {{it among the}} four best Allen films. He described it as having a [...] "terrible fascination that lasts all the way through". Empire magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it Allen's best of his last half a dozen films, and recommended it even {{to those who are}} not fans of the director. Reviewers in the United Kingdom were generally less favourable. Philip French, writing in The Observer, criticised Allen's grasp of British idiom and the film's lack of humour, especially considering that two comic actors from the UK were cast in minor roles. Also, he called the dialogue [...] "rather lumbering" [...] and said that [...] "the lexicons of neither the City financier nor the London constable are used convincingly." [...] Tim Robey, writing in The Daily Telegraph, disdained the claim that the film was Allen's return to form. Although he acknowledged that the consensus was stronger this time, he called it [...] "as flat-footed a movie as Allen has ever made, a decent idea scuppered by a setting – London – which he treats with the peculiarly tin-eared reverence of a visitor who only <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> his way around." [...] He called Johansson's character [...] "the chain-smoking mistress from hell", but said the tennis net analogy has an [...] "unexpectedly crisp payoff" [...] and that the last act was well handled. Reviewing for the BBC's website, Andy Jacobs awarded the film four stars out of five, and called it Allen's best film since Deconstructing Harry (1997). He also criticised some other British reviewers whose dislike, Jacobs stated, was {{due to the fact that}} Allen presented an agreeable portrait of middle class life in London. He also praised the performances by Rhys Meyers and Johansson.|$|E

2500|$|The First Meditation, subtitled [...] "What can {{be called}} into doubt", opens with the Meditator {{reflecting}} {{on the number of}} falsehoods he has believed during his life and on the subsequent faultiness of the body of knowledge he has built up from these falsehoods. He has resolved to sweep away all he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> and to start again from the foundations, building up his knowledge once more on more certain grounds. He has seated himself alone, by the fire, free of all worries so that he can demolish his former opinions with care.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates repeats {{his claim}} that formal accusations of {{corruption}} and impiety shall not destroy him, but that he shall be harmed by the prejudiced gossip and slanders of his enemies. He tells the court of being unafraid of death, because his true concern is in acting ethically. That people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death {{might be a good}} thing, but that most people fear death as an evil thing, when they cannot possibly know death to be either good or evil. Socrates says that his wisdom is in being aware that he is ignorant: “I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> something, when he does not.” Apology, 21d.|$|E
2500|$|He had {{an ongoing}} rivalry with Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer and {{frequently}} withheld key {{information from the}} embassy. Reischauer favored Kennedy administration plans to give the island more autonomy and allow the Japanese government to provide the island with greater financial aid; Caraway opposed all such measures, believing that they would eventually strip the United States {{of one of its}} most strategic bases. Resichauer referred to Caraway as a [...] "bull-headed man" [...] and [...] "autocratic" [...] in his memoirs, with Caraway firing back that [...] "he's useless. He's a menace, because he <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> everything... and he knows nothing." [...] Caraway {{went so far as to}} accuse Resichauer of entering into a [...] "conspiracy with the Japanese" [...] to force American forces off the Ryukyus. In 1962, President of the United States John F. Kennedy began an effort to give the residents of the Ryukyu islands. One of his methods was to restrict Caraway's power of veto by allowing him to overrule the Ryukyu Legislature only when necessary to protect the security interests of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|The captivity storylines took a {{different}} route by using the characters of Ziva and Michael Rivkin to symbolize the [...] "two Israels American policy makers have faced over the years". Ziva is [...] "the cooperative and quiet Israeli, who has the technical and personal skills to be of enormous assistance in achieving the mission" [...] while Rivkin is [...] "bright and pro-American, {{but in this case}} tough, aggressive, <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> {{what is best for the}} United States better than the Americans, is sly and wily, and he doesn't heed the advice of his American counterparts". Both are received differently by the American agents—Ziva is respected and trusted by her colleagues; Rivkin is an object of suspicion. Steven L. Spiegel, Director of the Center for Middle East Development and Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), drew parallels between their interactions with their American counterparts and those of prominent Israeli politicians. Ziva, he reasoned, could be likened to Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, or Ehud Olmert in that she is able to agree with the American agencies on a more basic, fundamental level. Rivkin, he continued, was more like Yitzhak Shamir.|$|E
