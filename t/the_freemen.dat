5|$|The General Court was {{the chief}} {{legislative}} and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by <b>the</b> <b>freemen</b> from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a grand jury of sorts elected from <b>the</b> <b>freemen,</b> who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for credible accusations. The General Court, and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate decisions were made by a jury of freemen.|$|E
5|$|The colony's most {{powerful}} executive was its Governor, who was originally elected by <b>the</b> <b>freemen</b> but was later {{appointed by the}} General Court in an annual election. The General Court also elected seven Assistants to form a cabinet to assist the governor. The Governor and Assistants then appointed Constables {{who served as the}} chief administrators for the towns, and Messengers who were the main civil servants of the colony. They were responsible for publishing announcements, performing land surveys, carrying out executions, {{and a host of other}} duties.|$|E
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport {{at the south end}} of the island. <b>The</b> <b>freemen</b> of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E

5|$|Relics of the Dark Ages are {{uncommon}} {{within the}} Glamorgan area and secular monuments are still rarer. The few sites discovered {{from this period}} have been located in the Bro, or lowlands, leaving historians {{to believe that the}} Blaenau were sparsely inhabited, maybe only visited seasonally by pastoralists. A few earthwork dykes are the only structural relics in the Rhondda area from this period and no carved stones or crosses exist to indicate the presence of a Christian shrine. During the Early Middle Ages communities were split between bondmen and freemen. The bondmen lived in small villages centred on a court or llys of the local ruler to whom they paid dues; while <b>the</b> <b>freemen,</b> who enjoyed a higher status, lived in scattered homesteads. The most important village was the 'mayor's settlement' or maerdref. Maerdy in the Rhondda Fach has been identified as a maerdref, mainly on the strength of the name, though the village did not survive past the Middle Ages. The largest concentration of dwellings from this time have been discovered around Gelli and Ystrad in the Rhondda Fawr, mainly platform houses.|$|E

25|$|Another {{green space}} in Newcastle is the Town Moor, lying {{immediately}} {{north of the}} city centre.

The right extends to the pitch of St. James' Park, Newcastle United Football Club's ground; this is not exercised, although <b>the</b> <b>Freemen</b> do collect rent for the loss of privilege. Honorary freemen include Bob Geldof, King Harald V of Norway, Bobby Robson, Alan Shearer, the late Nelson Mandela and the Royal Shakespeare Company.

25|$|William Bradford became {{governor}} in 1621 upon {{the death of}} John Carver. On March 22, 1621, the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony signed a peace treaty with Massasoit of the Wampanoags.

25|$|Håkon the Good – {{the son of}} Harald Fairhair – {{assumed the}} crown in 930 and {{established}} two large things, assemblies in which the king met with <b>the</b> <b>freemen</b> to make decisions: Gulating for Western Norway and Frostating for Trøndelag. He also established the ledang, a conscription-based military. After his death in 960, war broke out between the Fairhair dynasty and the Earls of Lade in alliance with Danish kings.|$|E

In early 1172, Henry allowed de Lacy to take royal troops into Meath, where they plundered and burned the monastic towns of Fore and Killeigh.

25|$|These immigrants, {{who were}} mostly {{constituted}} of families, established {{several of the}} earliest colonies in New England, of which the Massachusetts Bay Colony was {{the largest and most}} economically important. They intended to build a society based on their religious beliefs. Colonial leaders were elected by <b>the</b> <b>freemen</b> of the colony, those individuals who had had their religious experiences formally examined and had been admitted to one of the colony's Puritan congregations. The colonial leadership were prominent members of their congregations, and regularly consulted with the local ministers on issues facing the colony.|$|E
25|$|The site of St James' Park was {{originally}} {{a patch of}} sloping grazing land, bordered by Georgian Leazes Terrace, and near the historic Town Moor, owned by <b>the</b> <b>Freemen</b> of the City, both factors that later affected development of the ground, with the local council being the landlord of the site. Leazes Terrace was built c1830 by notable Newcastle residents, architect Thomas Oliver and builder Richard Grainger. Once the residence of high society in Newcastle, {{it is now a}} Grade 1 listed building, and, recently refurbished, is currently being used as self-catering postgraduate student accommodation by Newcastle University. The site was also near the gallows of the city, last used in 1844, lending the Gallowgate End its name.|$|E
25|$|Catering to {{the needs}} of the city's growing population, the Coventry Corporation Act of 1927 reassigned Whitley Common, Hearsall Common, Barras Heath, and Radford Common as {{recreation}} grounds, and ended all the remaining traditional commoning rights on waste ground in Coventry, and <b>the</b> <b>freemen</b> of the city, who had been allowed to have up to three animals grazing on these areas since 1833, each received an annual sum of £100 as compensation. The Council had already purchased Styvechale Common from the Lords of Styvechale Manor following the First World War to create the War Memorial Park, and in 1927 a monument was built in the park to commemorate all Coventrians that died in that war, and since then later conflicts also.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, coal mining, {{alkaline}} {{production and}} glass making {{led to a}} boom in the town. The population increased from 12,000 in 1801 to 75,000 by the 1860s, bolstered by economic migration from Ireland, Scotland {{and other parts of}} England. These industries played a fundamental part in creating wealth both regionally and nationally. In 1832, with the Great Reform Act, South Shields and Gateshead were each given their own Member of Parliament and became boroughs, resulting in taxes being paid to the Government instead of the Bishops of Durham. However, the rapid growth in population brought on by the expansion of industry made sanitation a problem, as evident by Cholera outbreaks and the building of the now-listed Cleadon Water Tower to combat the problem. In the 1850s 'The Tyne Improvement Commission' began to develop the river, dredging it to make it deeper and building the large, impressive North and South Piers to help prevent silt build up within the channel. Shipbuilding (along with coal mining), previously a monopoly of <b>the</b> <b>Freemen</b> of Newcastle, became another prominent industry in the town, with John Readhead & Sons Shipyard the largest.|$|E
500|$|When the 1634 {{election}} {{was set to}} take place, delegations of freemen sent by the towns insisted on seeing the charter, from which they learned that the colony's lawmaking authority, the election of governor, and {{the election of the}} deputy all rested with <b>the</b> <b>freemen,</b> not with the assistants. [...] Winthrop acceded on the point of the elections, which were thereafter conducted by secret ballot by <b>the</b> <b>freemen,</b> but he also observed that lawmaking would be unwieldy if conducted by the relatively large number of freemen. [...] A compromise was reached in which each town would select two delegates to send to the general court as representatives of its interests. [...] In an ironic twist, Thomas Dudley, an opponent of popular election, won the 1634 election for governor, with Roger Ludlow as deputy. [...] Winthrop graciously invited his fellow magistrates to dinner, as he had done after previous elections.|$|E
