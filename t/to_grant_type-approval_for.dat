50|$|Finding club racing {{changing}} towards {{production models}} Norman next turned {{his hand to}} street models - first the PDQ Kawasaki and later a BMW K100. Norman set himself the task with the K100, to use as many standard parts as practical and make it handle and stop better. In the process the final product was 12lbs lighter than the standard unit and possessed all the advantages that BMW later claimed for the K series bikes. This HOSSACK-BMW conversion was popular in Germany where the design received a TUV <b>type-approval</b> <b>for</b> sale. One of Norman’s conversions was taken to BMW’s headquarters in Munich where it was shown to their management and run on their test track. Unfortunately for Norman, BMW were {{in the final stages}} of releasing their Telelever suspension system.|$|R
50|$|Changes to {{the diesel}} engined models saw the 2,495 cc Td5 (in-line direct-injected straight-five engine) introduced, {{in line with}} the updated Defender models. This {{electronically}} managed engine was smoother, producing more usable torque at lower revs than its 300Tdi predecessor. The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross bolted caps, different con rods, and different pistons. The blocks were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft. For the 2003 and 2004 model year Discovery II they changed to the 4.6-litre V8 (though the 4.0 continued as the only V8 option offered in the UK). ACE (Active Cornering Enhancement, an electronically controlled hydraulic anti-roll bar system) was fitted to some versions, which reduced cornering roll. Self-levelling air springs were fitted to some models and European <b>type-approval</b> <b>for</b> seven-seat vehicles was only given to air-sprung examples.|$|R
