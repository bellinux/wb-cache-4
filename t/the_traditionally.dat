5|$|Black {{tried to}} remain {{positive}} in his race, {{and focused on}} national issues rather than defending Stanley's administration. He touted his support of President Woodrow Wilson and declared {{his support for the}} United States' admission into the League of Nations. His support of Wilson hurt him with German American voters, and Wilson's handling of recent coal strikes hurt Black with <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> Democratic labor vote.|$|E

5|$|Clinton won the {{election}} on November 7 with 55 {{percent of the vote}} to Lazio's 43 percent, a difference larger than most observers had expected. Clinton won <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> Democratic base of New York City by large margins, and carried suburban Westchester County, but lost heavily populated Long Island, part of which Lazio represented in Congress. She won surprising victories in Upstate counties, such as Cayuga, Rensselaer, and Niagara, to which her win has been attributed.|$|E
5|$|However, Balfas {{writes that}} it is unjust to {{consider}} Sitti Nurbaya as only another forced marriage story, as the marriage of Nurbaya and Samsu would have been accepted by society. He instead writes that Sitti Nurbaya contrasts Western and traditional views of marriage, criticising <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> accepted dowry and polygamy.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Honda {{released}} restyled {{versions of}} the Cubs on some markets, with square lamps and plastic-covered handlebars and rear mudguard. On the domestic Japanese market the square style was optional, but in some places such as the UK they replaced imports of <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> styled round lamp Cub.|$|E
50|$|An anapsid is an amniote whose skull {{does not}} have {{openings}} near <b>the</b> temples. <b>Traditionally,</b> <b>the</b> Anapsida are the most primitive subclass of reptiles, the ancestral stock from which Synapsida and Diapsida evolved, making anapsids paraphyletic. It is however doubtful that all anapsids lack temporal fenestra as a primitive trait, and that all <b>the</b> groups <b>traditionally</b> seen as anapsids truly lacked fenestra.|$|R

5|$|Parker's attacks {{came too}} late to turn the election, however. On November 8, Roosevelt won in a {{landslide}} of 7,630,457 votes to Parker's 5,083,880. Roosevelt carried every northern and western state, including Missouri, {{for a total of}} 336 electoral votes; Parker carried only <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> Democratic Solid South, accumulating 140 electoral votes. Parker telegraphed his congratulations to Roosevelt that night and returned to private life.|$|E
5|$|The South West borough {{was home}} {{to much of the}} city's {{industry}} during the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th century. The borough included Goose Village and is home to <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> working-class Irish neighbourhoods of Griffintown and Point Saint Charles as well as the low-income neighbourhoods of Saint Henri and Little Burgundy.|$|E
5|$|The {{genre of}} Midas bears {{the marks of}} gender debates, as well, with Percy writing in <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> male-dominated form of the lyric and Mary {{focusing}} {{on the details of}} everyday life in her verse drama. Since the play's first publication in 1922, critics have paid more attention to Percy Shelley's lyrics than Mary Shelley's drama. However, in the last fifteen years or so, this trend has reversed itself as scholars explore works of Mary Shelley other than Frankenstein (1818).|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from {{effective}} Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming {{various degrees of}} autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled {{the north of the}} country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was {{in the hands of a}} group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen was troubled by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Azerbaijan and Armenia.|$|E
5|$|In recent history, on 5 January 2004, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune was vandalised by 150 {{members of}} the Sambhaji Brigade, an {{organisation}} promoting {{the cause of the}} Marathas. The organisation was protesting against a derogatory remark made by the American author James Laine, on Shivaji's Parentage in his book, Shivaji: A Hindu King in an Islamic Kingdom. BORI was targeted because Srikant Bahulkar, a scholar at BORI, was acknowledged in Laine's book. The incident highlighted <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> uncomfortable Brahmin-Maratha relationship. Recently, the same organisation demanded the removal of Dadoji Konddeo from the Statue of Child Shivaji ploughing Pune's Land at Lal Mahal, Pune. They also threatened that if their demands were not met, they would demolish that part of statue themselves.|$|E
5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} are generally more vulnerable to {{the force of the}} earthquake, but some of <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, unlike those of other castes, did not cover their head with the end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by younger women for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E
5|$|Shindler {{continued}} to pitch The Second Coming to other television networks while Davies sought other ventures. His next series {{was based on}} a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child. He saw the relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked the couple about their relationship to develop the show. After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay friends had shown, he realised he was creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them, and instead focused on telling a traditional love story and gave the couple <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper.|$|E

5|$|The Indo-Pakistani {{conflict}} was {{sparked by the}} Bangladesh Liberation war, a conflict between <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> dominant West Pakistanis and the majority East Pakistanis. In 1970, East Pakistanis demanded autonomy for the state, but the Pakistani government failed to satisfy these demands and, in early 1971, a demand for secession took form in East Pakistan. In March, Pakistan Armed Forces launched a fierce campaign to curb the secessionists, including the soldiers and police from East Pakistan. Thousands of East Pakistanis died, and nearly ten million refugees fled to West Bengal, an adjacent Indian state. In April, India decided {{to assist in the}} formation of the new nation of Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low {{to account for the}} {{formation of}} such large bodies from <b>the</b> <b>traditionally</b> accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.|$|E
5|$|The group {{released}} several successful albums, including December's Children (And Everybody's), Aftermath and Between the Buttons, but {{in their}} personal lives their behaviour was brought into question. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were arrested on drug charges and were given unusually harsh sentences: Jagger was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for possession of four over-the-counter pep pills he had purchased in Italy. <b>The</b> <b>traditionally</b> conservative editor of The Times, William Rees-Mogg, wrote an article critical of the sentences; and on appeal Richards' sentence was overturned and Jagger's was amended to a conditional discharge (although he ended up spending one night inside London's Brixton Prison). The Rolling Stones continued to face legal battles for the next decade.|$|E
