40|$|Employee {{training}} programs {{need to develop}} ways of increasing the likelihood that learned skills and behaviours are used when employees return to their jobs, i. e., that "transfer of training" occurs. One way to facilitate <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is to perform a post-training intervention designed to increase <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> This dissertation has four main purposes. The first purpose was to test the effects of two post-training interventions, relapse prevention and transfer enhancement, in a 2 x 2 experimental design. The two interventions were designed to increase <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> by increasing self-efficacy for the training task, or a person's belief {{in his or her}} ability to perform the training task. Subjects were 147 nurses from one hospital who participated in a two day workshop. Self-efficacy and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> were measured by both self-reports and supervisor reports at two and six months following training. Contrary to prediction, the two post-training interventions did not result in higher <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> than the control group. It is suggested that the training itself was effective in increasing self-efficacy and in leading to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> in control subjects, making post-training interventions redundant for this training program. The second purpose was to test the effect of "motivation to learn" on <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> Strong support was found for the hypothesis that "motivation to learn" is positively related to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> The third purpose of the dissertation was to examine the process by which <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> occurs. This study hypothesized that self-efficacy would be positively related to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> and strong support was found for this hypothesis.

The intended return on investments from training programmes will only be achieved to the extent that training is transferred, but the problem is, however, that the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is slight and below expectation (Brinkerhoff and Gill 1994). In their ongoing pursuit for creating shareholder value, management needs innovative, feasible and effective approaches to the improvement of the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> problem. This study is aimed at establishing how manager support for training impacts the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> proposing that there is a moderate to strong positive relationship between manager support and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> By means of an electronic questionnaire, trainees responded regarding their experiences of manager support and their own claims to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> This study found that there was a significant positive relationship between manager support and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> during a sales training programme for relationship managers at Standard Bank.

Quantitative and qualitative data were collected immediately after training using a retrospective pretest-then/posttest-now instrument developed to measure the participants' perceived transfer of learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected approximately 4 weeks after training also using a retrospective pretest-then/posttest-now instrument developed to measure the participants' perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> Quality assurance data generated by the organization for the first full month after the training program was completed were collected to measure the actual <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> A 13 -item version of the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MC-C) was included with the perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> survey to measure the potential for self-perception bias with the perceived transfer of learning and the perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data. ANOVA results for the perceived transfer of learning and perceived <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> data indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups.
