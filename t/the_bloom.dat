5|$|Observed in back-scattered {{light the}} main ring {{appears to be}} razor thin, {{extending}} in the vertical direction no more than 30km. In the side scatter geometry the ring thickness is 80–160km, increasing somewhat {{in the direction of}} Jupiter. The ring appears to be much thicker in the forward-scattered light—about 300km. One of the discoveries of the Galileo orbiter was <b>the</b> <b>bloom</b> of the main ring—a faint, relatively thick (about 600km) cloud of material which surrounds its inner part. <b>The</b> <b>bloom</b> grows in thickness towards the inner boundary of the main ring, where it transitions into the halo.|$|E
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. <b>The</b> <b>bloom</b> was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|By {{utilizing}} {{a place called}} <b>the</b> <b>Bloom</b> Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual; Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity, to strengthen their party. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill they already have, it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories; or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in battle to grant them Radiant Skills, permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons. These include passive effects, such as increased health or extended Session Attacks, as well as skills that can be performed in battle.|$|E

25|$|The small {{particles}} of iron produced {{in this way}} fall {{to the bottom of}} the furnace and become welded together to form a spongy mass of <b>the</b> <b>bloom.</b> The bottom of the furnace also fills with molten slag, often consisting of fayalite, a compound of silicon, oxygen and iron mixed with other impurities from the ore. Because <b>the</b> <b>bloom</b> is highly porous, and its open spaces are full of slag, <b>the</b> <b>bloom</b> must later be reheated and beaten with a hammer to drive the molten slag out of it. Iron treated this way is said to be wrought, and the resulting nearly pure iron wrought iron.|$|E

25|$|The {{irradiation}} process adopted involves pumping {{of surface}} water through irradiation chambers fitted on the boat, removal of organic material such as litter of leaves, and then subjecting the water surface to the UV irradiation.

The entire process takes about 5 hours and a success rate of 99% removal of the algae is reported, killing all cells over an initial treatment of two days. Unlike other methods of treatment, no chemical contamination is produced in the UV radiation process.|$|E
