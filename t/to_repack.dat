Four RAAF C-130s transported the company group and its equipment that morning, though loading the aircraft took longer than expected due to a shortage of pallets and specialist loading staff. Once at Norfolk Island, the company group had <b>to</b> <b>repack</b> its equipment into smaller containers, as those originally used could not be carried by the Navy's Wessex helicopters. These helicopters transferred the Army force onto Tobruk during the night, which was dangerous as they were not equipped for night flying. The soldiers were not familiar with the ship, and the process of unpacking and storing their equipment was also slow.|$|E
2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need <b>to</b> <b>repack</b> their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} Seventies, {{two groups of}} enthusiasts: the Larkspur Canyon Gang, from Larkspur (long-time speed-riders down Mount Tamalpais), and later members of Velo-Club Tamalpais from Fairfax and San Anselmo in Marin County, California began group rides in the canyons and over ridges, {{up and down the}} fireroads around Mount Tamalpais, later racing bikes {{downhill}} in a race they called [...] "Repack" [...] because the ride was so grueling that riders had <b>to</b> <b>repack</b> their coaster brakes with grease after each run. The off-road terrain was rocky and the steep mountainside helped riders attain high speeds as they bounced and slammed over rocks and mud. Such harsh treatment caused regular road bikes to crumble, so the racers searched for a more durable and affordable alternative. They soon discovered that old balloon-tired [...] "clunkers" [...] (as they called them) could be had for $5.00 at a garage sale and would endure tremendous punishment. Soon, riders were snapping up these old cruisers, stripping off the heavy fenders and trim, and souped them up to improve downhill performance. Derailleur gears were added by Russ Mahon of [...] The Morrow Dirt Club in Cupertino at the 1974 Marin County cyclo-cross and Gary Fisher's 1975 used a tandem rear hub (from a flea market) with internal steel drum brake and threaded for a freewheel derailleur cluster to his old Schwinn Excelsior bike, enabling him to ride up the mountain, as well as down. About the same time, another rider named Joe Breeze began tinkering with his own Schwinn Excelsior, making it more suited to the [...] "Repack" [...] course. Soon, both of them began to build and sell custom mountain bikes to fellow enthusiasts, launching a worldwide cycling phenomenon.|$|E

She had read of people walking in circles when they have no light or guidance, and that troubled her until she bethought herself of the little compass on her watch chain. By that she kept her direction. She wished very much she had timed herself across the waste, so that she could tell when she approached the ridge.|$|E

60|$|Next {{in order}} of events, as we rode up the winding trail through the spruce forest, we met Teague's cow and calf, which he had kept all summer in camp. For some reason neither could be left. Teague told us to ride on, and an hour later when we halted {{to rest on the}} Flattop Mountain he came {{along with the rest of}} the train, and in the fore was the cow alone. It was evident that she was distressed and angry, for it took two men to keep her in the trail. And another thing plain to me was the fact that she was going to demoralize the pack horses. We were not across the wide range of this flat {{mountain}} when one of the pack animals, a lean and lanky sorrel, appeared suddenly to go mad, and began to buck off a pack. He succeeded. This inspired a black horse, very appropriately christened Nigger, to try his luck, and he shifted his pack in short order. It took patience, time, and effort <b>to</b> <b>repack.</b> The cow was a disorganizer. She took up as wide a trail as a road. And the pack animals, some with dignity and others with disgust, tried to avoid her vicinity. Going down the steep forest trail on the other side the real trouble began. The pack train split, ran and bolted, crashing through the trees, plunging down steep places, and jumping logs. It was a wild sort of chase. But luckily the packs remained intact until we were once more on open, flat ground. All went well for a while, except for an accident for which I was to blame. I spurred my horse, and he plunged suddenly past R.C.'s mount, colliding with him, tearing off my stirrup, and spraining R.C.'s ankle. This was almost a serious accident, as R.C. has an old baseball ankle that required favoring.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{maintaining}} an approximate solution for one-dimensional bin packing when items may arrive and depart dynamically is studied. In accordance with various work on fully dynamic algorithms, and {{in contrast to}} prior work on bin packing, {{it is assumed that}} the packing may be arbitrarily rearranged to accommodate arriving and departing items. In this context our main result is a fully dynamic approximation algorithm for bin packing MMP that is 5 / 4 -competitive and requires Θ(log n) time per operation (i. e., for an Insert or a Delete of an item). This competitive ratio of 5 is nearly as good as that of the best practical off-line algorithms. Our algorithm utilizes 4 the technique (introduced here) whereby the packing of an item is done with a total disregard for already packed items of a smaller size. This myopic packing of an item may then cause several smaller items <b>to</b> be <b>repacked</b> (in a similar fashion). With a bit of additional sophistication to avoid certain “bad” cases, the number of items (either individual items or “bundles” of very small items treated as a whole) that needs <b>to</b> be <b>repacked</b> is bounded by a constant...|$|R
