I found it where <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> would, but it was among 27,000 others, and I told myself that here, Niven, were 27,000 reasons why you should keep your mouth shut after the war.|$|E

The singer recounted that it almost was not released: [...] "In 2003, I had my first solo album. But when I played it through for my record label, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E

In 2013, he {{slightly}} improved when he was briefly in Chase for the Sprint Cup contention. A blown engine early in the Coke Zero 400 caused him to be knocked out of the Chase with a few races left before the Chase began. In the season-ending Ford EcoBoost 400, Menard's tire exploded upon stopping in his pit box; Menard stated, [...] "About a lap later, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was on fire.

2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was very difficult for me in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Show creator William J. Bell {{introduced}} {{the role of}} psychiatrist Dr. Taylor Hamilton Hayes, played by actress Hunter Tylo, during the episode dated June 6, 1990. According to Variety, Bell created Taylor as [...] "a romantic leading lady {{but also as a}} character who could facilitate social issues — and directly partake in a few, too". Previously, Tylo was dismissed from two other soaps, All My Children and Days of Our Lives. The actress noted that her [...] "crazy sense of humor" [...] and [...] "funny business" [...] could have won her the role of Taylor, and she said: [...] "After the audition, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was the only one right for the role. I think they liked my 'a woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do' attitude." [...] Sherilyn Wolter temporarily replaced Tylo in 1990. Tylo vacated the role in May 1994 to pursue other projects, but the soap opera left the door open for her to return, which she did months later. During her absence, the character was presumed to be dead. In March 1996, following Taylor's decreased airtime and rumors circulating of her exit, it was confirmed that the actress was to leave The Bold and the Beautiful after her contract expired that June, to pursue a primetime role on the Fox television drama Melrose Place. Taylor's final appearance was in May 1996. However, in July 1996, Tylo was controversially fired from Melrose Place on the grounds of being pregnant and was replaced by Lisa Rinna. In response, she sued that show's executive producer Aaron Spelling and Spelling Productions for millions of US dollars, and won her case. It was immediately reported that she would return to The Bold and the Beautiful, with head writer and executive producer Bradley Bell issuing the statement: [...] "I am certain that Hunter's talent and ability will continue to be an asset to the show." ...|$|E
