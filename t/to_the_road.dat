As the song finishes the view again returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Small spaceships (similar to the one from the middle 8) gather at either side as the city is left behind and the road gradually disappears.|$|E
5|$|A small {{gasworks}} a {{short distance}} {{to the south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed.|$|E

5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest of the country is Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E
5|$|Banagher is an {{important}} crossing point on the River Shannon and consequently experiences a large volume of through traffic. Two regional roads meet in Banagher; the R356, which links the N62 and N65 national primary roads and is known as Harbour Street in Banagher and the R439 which links Birr with Banagher and is known as Main Street in Banagher. Harbour Street leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to Shannon Harbour and Main Street begins at the hill at the southern entrance to the town and leads down to the bridge crossing the Shannon.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the Domesday Book, Camberwell was already a {{significant}} settlement. The town remained a popular resort for Londoners due to its believed medicinal wells.

5|$|In 1963 it was {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} bridge with a modern development containing seven floors of shops, office space, hotel rooms and leisure facilities supported above the river, but the plans were abandoned because of costs. With the exception of alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> layout and the balustrade, the design and appearance of the current bridge has remained almost unchanged since 1907. The bridge today {{is an important part}} of London's road system and carries the A202 road across the Thames.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface, vibrations in {{a motorcycle}} {{can be caused}} by the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

5|$|Pearlman's and Steve Schenk's {{managerial}} {{efforts were}} rewarded when Blue Öyster Cult were hired for some gigs in Greece in July 1987. After a nine-month layoff, the band returned to activity and Allen Lanier re-joined. The European shows were a success, and the reformed line-up of Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Jon Rogers and drummer Ron Riddle {{worked very well}} together on stage. Blue Öyster Cult returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> in 1987 and 1988 with renewed enthusiasm, but without a new album to promote, until the release of Imaginos.|$|E
5|$|Portions of SR 20 {{are built}} near the routing {{of what was}} first a wagon road and later a turnpike {{in the late nineteenth}} century. This road was {{extended}} through the state highway system all the way to Ukiah in the early twentieth century, and the missing link near Clear Lake was completed in 1932 before the official designation of this highway as SR 20 in 1934. There have been subsequent improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> such as the conversion of the Grass Valley portion of the route to freeway standards.|$|E
5|$|Route 64, {{a highway}} from Mecca to Blythe, {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1919. In 1935, Pierce Street from Route 26 near Oasis to Avenue 66, and Avenue 66 from Route 26 to Mecca were added to the state highway system. Two years later, Pierce Street was {{designated}} as Route 203, and Avenue 66 was designated as Route 204. By 1926, the road existed east of Mecca to Blythe, but was unpaved; by 1930, the road connected from Mecca <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> along the western side of the Salton Sea to Indio and points further west.|$|E

5|$|The Red Mountain Freeway {{begins at}} the Mini Stack {{junction}} with Route 51 and Interstate 10 before heading east into Tempe. Route 143 and Loop 101 intersect the Red Mountain Freeway at various points in the city prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> entering the northern reaches of Mesa, where it had temporarily ended at Power Road. The final segment of the Red Mountain Freeway from Power Road to University Drive opened on July 21, 2008. The freeway then continues due southward towards US 60, until it bisects it at the SuperRedTan Interchange, beyond which Loop 202 becomes the Santan Freeway.|$|E
5|$|The Wellington bypass was {{constructed}} by contractor M. J. Gleeson Ltd, from 1973 to 1975. Many problems {{followed in the}} two years after completion; the rigid concrete carriageway broke up, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> being built on a poor subbase with rigid concrete along a historically heavily mined route. The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original carriageway had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{underwent a}} series of repairs and redecoration, {{carried out by the}} Steel Coleman Davis Partnership in the early 21st century. These included a significant structural repair, as the main supporting roof truss was badly damaged. The frontage was also upgraded to withstand the weathering effects of being north-facing, and the damage caused by being so close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Services continue to be held at the Unitarian Chapel, and as of March 2015, are held twice a month, on the first and third Sundays of each month.|$|E

The Capon Chapel property consists of the church structure (c. 1852), and its associated cemetery, which is enclosed partly by the historic wrought iron fence and partly by a chain link fence. A flagpole stands {{at the center of}} the cemetery's eastern perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The gorge is {{susceptible}} to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 {{the flow of water}} washed large boulders down the gorge, damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave and washing away cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through the gorge, was closed for several weeks following damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface during extensive flooding.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the road}} matches its winding route, but {{actually}} derives from the emblem of the Snake Inn, {{one of the few}} buildings on the high stretch of road. In turn, the pub's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. In the early 21st century, the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that the inn now refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> that referred to itself.|$|E
