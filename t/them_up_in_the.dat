5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming {{that there was a}} bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Upstairs, Stewie takes drastic {{measures}} to protect his plans, programming the machine {{to go back in}} time before he drew <b>them</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> bar, Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that the bar is burning. When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While he is getting ready, Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more teething pain.|$|E
25|$|The coiled {{condenser}} tubes inside will provide more surface area for cooling {{and for this}} reason it is most favorable to use but the drawback of this condenser is that as the vapors get condensed, it tends to move <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tube to evaporate which will also lead to the flooding of solution mixture.|$|E

25|$|The drums {{are set up}} in an arc {{around the}} performer.

25|$|In {{the third}} season premiere, Leonard and Penny finally started a romantic {{relationship}} and had intercourse for the first time. However, the relationship ended after eight months, after Leonard told Penny he loved her and took umbrage at her inability to reciprocate, which led to friction that was exploited by guest star Wil Wheaton who appeared as a fictionalized version of himself, who observed and exacerbated {{it in order to}} break <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a bowling match Wheaton's team was having against Leonard, Penny, Sheldon, Howard and Raj.|$|E
25|$|The IMF {{originates}} on the Sun, {{linked to}} the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind.

50|$|Abadox (Abadokkusu) is a {{video game}} for the NES, subtitled The Deadly Inner War. It is a side-scrolling shoot <b>'em</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vein of Gradius and R-Type. The game is notable for its unique visual design, as the game takes place inside the {{intestinal}} tract of a giant alien organism. Abadox is also known to be difficult, since it takes one hit from an enemy projectile to be killed. In Abadox, if a player is killed, one must restart from a checkpoint passed before death.|$|R

25|$|Brown was a leg-spinner in his youth, {{but turned}} to medium paced bowling after the war. He {{was able to}} turn or cut the ball with his large hands and was a wicket taker rather than a {{container}} of batsmen, but sometimes lost his line and length. As a pace bowler he was more accurate, was able to tie down even the best batsmen and proved adept at breaking solid partnerships. In particular {{he was able to}} dismiss the stonewalling Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. He still used his leg-spin when required by conditions or the frailties of the batsmen, sometimes mixing <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same over. His bucket hands made him a good catcher and he once caught and bowled Keith Miller in both innings of a Test, so the Australian all-rounder nicknamed him 'C and B'. As a batsman he stuck to the simple expedient of blocking the good balls and thumping the bad ones. With his height, weight and strength he could strike the ball as hard as anyone and once hit a six into the Lord's Pavilion. His first-class centuries were noted for their plentiful boundaries and this was another reason why his was popular with the crowds.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{had kept}} Ross and Rachel from being together throughout the first season, eventually bringing {{them together in}} the second-season episode [...] "The One Where Ross Finds Out", only to split <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following episode. Writer Alexa Junge incorporated many of her own experiences into the script, in particular Phoebe's line about Ross and Rachel being [...] "lobsters", something Junge's husband once said. Aniston wore a false nose for the scenes in the video while Cox wore a [...] "fat suit". While a previous episode had already established Monica as being overweight as a child, {{this was the first}} on-screen appearance of [...] "Fat Monica" [...] (the fat suit made frequent return appearances). [...] Rachel's large nose was added because Junge believed that the characters [...] "were so good-looking, you wanted to feel they had some realness in their past".|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count {{indictment}} that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized credit charges that defrauded $1million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The National Caucus of Labor Committees was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, [...] "we are going to stall, tie <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts ... just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal". Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year, and investigators were allegedly given false information. On June 30, 1987, the U.S. grand jury in Boston indicted LaRouche on one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.|$|E

500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna and her {{supporting}} dancers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory {{were dressed}} as old women in fluffy dressing gowns with dollar signs and curling pins in their hair. Singing the song {{with a strong}} mid-western accent, they got up and revealed a frivolish pink dress underneath their gown, in which they danced around. On some dates Madonna replaced the words [...] "experience has made me rich" [...] with [...] "experience has made me a bitch". After singing, she produced dollar bills out of her corsage and threw <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air for the audience to catch. Two different performances were taped and released on video, Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. During the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, a general setlist was decided where the show rehearsals would start with [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] from American Life, [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". But [...] "Dress You Up" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] were later dropped from the show. Hence [...] "Material Girl" [...] was transferred as the closing song of the military segment of the show, and was re-arranged as an electric guitar version. Madonna wore military themed clothes and sang the song while {{standing in front of}} a microphone and playing an electric guitar. The backdrops displayed mathematical equations along with DNA helixes rushing through the screens.|$|E

Marsellus retrieves Maynard's shotgun, and shoots Zed. Marsellus informs Butch that they are even, {{as long as he}} tells no one about the rape and departs Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed's chopper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{game is a}} {{vertical}} shoot <b>'em</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Galaga and Phoenix, but with eight-way movement across the screen and parallax scrolling for the stars backgrounds. At the player's disposal to fight the approaching enemies, some of them made in pseudo-depth 2.5D graphics with scaled sprites, is a small space fighter capable of firing two types of projectiles: the unlimited but slow rockets and the fast laser shots that are limited by draining the ship's power. The power can be refilled, and the ship itself upgraded, through collecting the power-ups that appear after destroying certain enemies.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} musically complex songs on Sgt. Pepper, it was {{recorded}} by the Beatles on 17 February 1967 with overdubs on 20 February (organ sound effects), 28 March (harmonica, organ, guitar), 29 March (more organ effects) and 31 March. Lennon wanted the track to have a [...] "carnival atmosphere", and told producer George Martin that he wanted [...] "to smell the sawdust on the floor". In the middle eight bars, multiple recordings of fairground organs and calliope music were spliced together to attempt to produce this request. [...] In a 1968 interview, Martin recalled that he achieved this [...] "by playing the Hammond organ myself and speeding it up". In addition to Hammond organ, a 19th century steam organ was found for hire to enhance the carnival atmosphere effect. After {{a great deal of}} unsuccessful experimentation, Martin instructed recording engineer Geoff Emerick to chop the tape into pieces with scissors, throw <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, and re-assemble them at random.|$|E
2500|$|The creators had {{intended}} Cheers to be a comedy about [...] "family" [...] of {{characters in a}} Boston bar, but quickly realized that the [...] "Sam and Diane" [...] romance was popular and decided that every episode would depict it. Burrows told the others several weeks after filming began, [...] "Sam & Diane – that's your show." [...] The [...] "Sam and Diane" [...] romance dominated the show for five years. As Burrows hypothesized, the couple would have diminished the importance and relevance of the bar setting if Long had not left the show in 1987. While the writers were developing the sexual {{tension between the two}} characters in the first season, the Charles brothers recognized that the relationship had to mature, so they paired <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first-season finale. With the exceptions of Long's last regular episode [...] "I Do, Adieu" [...] (1987) and the series finale [...] "One for the Road", every season finale that primarily focuses on Sam and Diane ends with a cliffhanger. With Long leaving Cheers, producers planned to revamp the show without losing its initial premise, and credited Long's departure for saving the series from cancellation. As Les Charles observed, Sam was a [...] "straight man" [...] to Diane; after Long's departure, he became more [...] "carefree" [...] and a [...] "goof-off" [...] in later seasons.|$|E
2500|$|In 1230 Gregory IX ordered St. Raymund of Pennafort {{to make a}} new {{collection}}, {{which is}} called the [...] "Decretals of Gregory IX" [...] (Decretales Gregorii IX).

Boniface VIII published a similar code on 3 March 1298, called the [...] "Sixth Book of the Decretals" [...] (Liber Sextus), including the Regulæ Juris. John XXII added to it the last official collection of Canon law, the [...] "Liber Septimus Decretalium", better known under the title of [...] "Constitutiones Clementis V", or simply [...] "Clementinæ" [...] (Quoniam nulla, 25 October 1317). Later on the canonists added to the manuscripts of the [...] "Decretals" [...] the most important constitutions of succeeding popes. These were soon known and quoted as [...] "Extravagantes", i. e. twenty constitutions of John XXII himself, and those of other popes to 1484.
