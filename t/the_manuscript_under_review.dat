40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of estimating quantiles when data are received sequentially (data stream). For real life data streams, {{the distribution of the}} data typically varies with time making estimation of quantiles challenging. We present a method that simultaneously maintain estimates of multiple quantiles of the data stream distribution. The method is based on making incremental updates of the quantile estimates every time a new sample from the data stream is received. The method is memory and computationally efficient since it only stores one value for each quantile estimate and only performs one operation per quantile estimate when a new sample is received from the data stream. The estimates are realistic {{in the sense that the}} monotone property of quantiles is satisfied in every iteration. Experiments show that the method efficiently tracks multiple quantiles and outperforms state of the art methods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Disclosure of {{financial}} {{conflicts of interest}} (COI) is intended to help reviewers {{assess the impact of}} potential bias on the validity of research results; however, there have been no empiric assessments of how reviewers understand and use disclosures in article evaluation. We investigate reviewers' perceptions of potential bias introduced by particular author disclosures, and whether reviewer characteristics are associated with a greater likelihood of perceiving bias. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of the 911 active reviewers from the Annals of Emergency Medicine, 410 were randomly selected and invited to complete our web-based, 3 -part survey. We completed descriptive analysis of all survey responses and compared those responses across reviewer characteristics using 2 × 2 analyses and the Fisher exact test. We had a response rate of 54 %. The majority of reviewers surveyed reported a high level of skepticism regarding financial relationships between authors and industry without a clear or consistent translation of that skepticism into the self-reported actions that characterize manuscript assessment. Only 13 % of respondents believed physician consultants authoring articles based on company data are likely to have unlimited data access. 54 % believed that bias most likely exists with any honorarium, regardless of monetary amount. Between 46 % and 64 %, depending on the type {{of financial}} relationship disclosed, reported that their recommendation for publication remains unchanged. Respondents reporting personal financial ties to industry were less likely to perceive bias in industry relationships and less likely to believe that bias exists with any monetary amount of honoraria. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the monetary amount of all financial relationships be reported with manuscript submissions, lead authors certify that they have unrestricted access to data, and reviewers disclose any financial ties to industry whether or not they are related to <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> <b>under</b> <b>review.</b> Further research is required to better understand reviewers' perceptions of financial relationships between authors and industry in order to develop clear and consistent guidelines for incorporating the perception of potential bias into manuscript assessments...|$|E

Isotopic ratios and concentrations of the alkaline earth metals Mg and Sr in biogenic calcite are of great importance as proxies for environmental parameters. In particular, the Mg/Ca ratio as a temperature proxy has had considerable success. It is often hard to constrain, however, which parameter ultimately controls the concentration of these elements in calcite. Here, multiple Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca transects through a belemnite rostrum of Passaloteuthis bisulcata (Blainville, 1827) are used to isolate the effect of calcite precipitation rate on incorporation of Mg and Sr into the calcite. With increasing calcite precipitation rate Mg/Ca ratios decrease and Sr/Ca ratios in the rostrum increase. In the studied specimen this effect {{is found to be}} linear for both element ratios over a precipitation rate increase of ca. 150...|$|R

In Experiment 1, priming with low frequency, phonetically related spoken words inhibited target recognition, as predicted by the Neighborhood Activation Model. In Experiment 2, the same prime-target pairs were presented with a longer inter-stimulus interval {{and the effects of}} priming were eliminated. In both experiments, predictions derived from the Neighborhood Activation Model regarding the effects of neighborhood density and word frequency were supported. The results are discussed in terms of competing activation of lexical neighbors and the dissociation of activation and frequency in spoken word recognition. 6 1989 Academic Press, Inc A fundamental problem in research on spoken word recognition concerns the processes by which stimulus information in the speech waveform is mapped onto lexical representations in long-term memory. Clearly, given the enormous size of the adult mental lexicon, isolating the sound pattern of one word from among tens of thousands of others in memory is no trivial matter for the listener.

40|$|Magnetic field induced {{drastically}} augmented {{thermal conductivity}} of magneto nanocolloids involving magnetic oxide nanoparticles, viz. Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, Nickel oxide (NiO), Cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4), dispersed in different base fluids (heat transfer oil, kerosene, and ethylene glycol) have been reported. Experiments reveal the augmented thermal transport under the external applied magnetic field, with kerosene based MNCs showing at relatively low magnetic field intensities {{as compared to}} the heat transfer oil and EG based MNCs. A maximum thermal conductivity enhancement of 114 % is attained at 7. 0 vol. % concentration and 0. 1 T field intensity for Fe 3 O 4 /EG magneto nanocolloid. However, a maximum of 82 % thermal conductivity enhancement is observed for Fe 3 O 4 /Kerosene magneto nanocolloid for the same concentration but relatively at low magnetic field (600 G). Thereby, a strong effect of fluid as well as particle physical properties on the chain formation propensity, leading to enhanced conduction, in such systems is observed. Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles show insignificant effect on the thermal conductivity enhancement of MNCs due to their minimal magnetic moment. An analytical approach has been proposed to understand the mechanism and physics behind the thermal conductivity enhancement under external applied magnetic field, in tune with near field magnetostatic interactions as well as Neel relaxivity of the magnetic nanoparticles. Furthermore, the analytical model is able to predict the phenomenon of enhanced thermal conductivity as a function of physical parameters such as chain length, size and types of nanoparticles, fluid characteristics, magnetic field intensity, saturation magnetic moment, nanoparticle concentration etc. and good agreement with the experimental results has been observed.

40|$|Background Socioeconomically-disadvantaged {{adults in}} {{developed}} countries experience a higher prevalence {{of a number of}} chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and some forms of cancer. Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for these diseases. Lower socioeconomic groups have a greater prevalence of overweight and obesity and this may contribute to their higher morbidity and mortality. International studies suggest that socioeconomic groups may differ in their self-perceptions of weight status and their engagement in weightcontrol behaviours (WCBs). Research has shown that lower socioeconomic adults are more likely to underestimate their weight status, and are less likely to engage in WCBs. This may contribute (in part) to the marked inequalities in weight status observed at the population level. There are few, and somewhat limited, Australian studies that have examined the types of weight-control strategies people adopt, the barriers to their weight control, the determinants of their perceived weight status and WCBs. Furthermore, there are no known Australian studies that have examined socioeconomic differences in these factors to better understand the reasons for socioeconomic inequalities in weight status. Hence, the overall aim of this Thesis is to examine why socioeconomically-disadvantaged group experience a greater prevalence of overweight and obesity than their more-advantaged counterparts. Methods This Thesis used data from two sources. Men and women aged 45 to 60 years were examined from both data source. First, the longitudinal Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle (AusDiab) Study were used to advance our knowledge and understanding of socioeconomic differences in weight change, perceived weight status and WCBs. A total of 2753 participants with measured weights at both baseline (1999 - 2000) and follow-up (2004 - 2005) were included in the analyses. Percent weight change over the five-year interval was calculated and perceived weight status, WCBs and highest attained education were collected at baseline. Second, the Candidate conducted a postal questionnaire from 1013 Brisbane residents (69. 8 % response rate) to investigate the relationship between socioeconomic position, determinants of perceived weight status, WCBs, and barriers and reasons to weight control. A test-retest reliability study was conducted to determine the reliability of the new measures used in the questionnaire. Most new measures had substantial to almost perfect reliability when considering either kappa coefficient or crude agreement. Results The findings from the AusDiab Study (accepted for publication in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health) showed that low-educated men and women {{were more likely to be}} obese at baseline compared to their higheducated respondents (O. R. = 1. 97, 95 % C. I. = 1. 30 - 2. 98 and O. R. = 1. 52, 95 % C. I. = 1. 03 - 2. 25, respectively). Over the five year follow-up period (1999 - 2000 to 2004 - 05) there were no socioeconomic differences in weight change among men, however socioeconomically-disadvantaged women had greater weight gains. Participants perceiving themselves as overweight gained less weight than those who saw themselves as underweight or normal weight. There was no relationship between engaging in WCBs and five-year weight change. The postal questionnaire data showed that socioeconomically-disadvantaged groups were less likely to engage in WCBs. If they did engage in weight control, they were less likely to adopt exercise strategies, including moderate and vigorous physical activities but were more likely to decrease their sitting time to control their weight. Socioeconomically-disadvantaged adults reported more barriers to weight control; such as perceiving weight loss as expensive, requiring a lot of cooking skills, not being a high priority and eating differently from other people in the household. These results have been accepted for publication in Public Health Nutrition. <b>The</b> third <b>manuscript</b> (<b>under</b> <b>review</b> in Social Science and Medicine) examined socioeconomic differences in determinants of perceived weight status and reasons for weight control. The results showed that lower socioeconomic adults were more likely to specify the following reasons for weight control: they considered themselves to be too heavy, for occupational requirements, on recommendation from their doctor, family members or friends. Conversely, high-income adults were more likely to report weight control to improve their physical condition or to look more attractive compared with those on lower-incomes. There were few socioeconomic differences in the determinants of perceived weight status. Conclusions Education inequalities in overweight/obesity among men and women may be due to mis-perceptions of weight status; overweight or obese individuals in loweducated groups may not perceive their weight as problematic and therefore may not pay attention to their energy-balance behaviours. Socioeconomic groups differ in WCBs, and their reasons and perceived barriers to weight control. Health promotion programs should encourage weight control among lower socioeconomic groups. More specifically, they should encourage the engagement of physical activity or exercise and dietary strategies among disadvantaged groups. Furthermore, such programs should address potential barriers for weight control that disadvantaged groups may encounter. For example, disadvantaged groups perceive that weight control is expensive, requires cooking skills, not a high priority and eating differently from other people in the household. Lastly, health promotion programs and policies aimed at reducing overweight and obesity should be tailored to the different reasons and motivations to weight control experienced by different socioeconomic groups. Weight-control interventions targeted at higher socioeconomic groups should use improving physical condition and attractiveness as motivational goals; while, utilising social support may be more effective for encouraging weight control among lower socioeconomic groups...|$|R
