5|$|The French brought Thames into Brest, where sailors from Allemand's {{squadron}} looted the frigate. The British {{officers were}} imprisoned {{for the next}} two years. The frigate was commissioned into the French Navy as <b>Tamise,</b> and Uranie was renamed Tartu in honour of her deceased captain. Both vessels then served with the French Atlantic Fleet, <b>Tamise</b> until 8 June 1796, when the British recaptured her off the Scilly Isles, and Tartu until 30 December 1796 when the British captured her during the Expédition d'Irlande.|$|E
5|$|Uranie {{lost four}} killed, {{including}} Captain Tartu, and seven wounded, including three seriously, and the frigate arrived at Rochefort soon afterwards, where {{in honour of}} the captain's death, she was renamed Tartu. It was subsequently incorrectly reported in Britain that the ship's name was changed to Tortue (tortoise) to disguise its identity after being defeated by Thames. Thames was taken into French service as <b>Tamise,</b> and participated in the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 the following year. The French lost both frigates in 1796. HMS Santa Margarita recaptured <b>Tamise</b> in an engagement near the Scilly Isles between British and French frigate squadrons at the Action of 8 June 1796. Some six months later, the ship of the line HMS Polyphemus captured Tartu on 30 December {{in the aftermath of}} the disastrous Expédition d'Irlande.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamises</b> {{range in}} size from 6 to 16 in and the mesh is {{available}} in different gauges. The nylon mesh is more resilient than wire and keeps its shape better. It is the best (preferably medium-coarse) mesh to use for fruit purées, which are liable to become discolored and tainted by wire. A wire mesh is sharper and stronger than nylon, but it will rust if not dried carefully after each use. Horsehair mesh <b>tamises</b> were previously common, but are now difficult to find outside of an antique store.|$|R
50|$|Because the tamis' mesh is flat, {{downward}} pressure {{can be applied}} with little effort simply by scraping with a horizontal motion. In comparison, a chef using a chinois must push down through the tip. A tamis should be used with the inner hoop , first because it holds more, and second so that the bowl below will rest on the hoop rather than the mesh. <b>Tamises</b> sift and grate ingredients finer than any other utensil, and {{the texture of the}} strained material is evenly consistent.|$|R
5000|$|A tamis (pronounced [...] "tammy", {{also known}} as a drum sieve, or chalni in Indian cooking) is a kitchen utensil, shaped {{somewhat}} like a snare drum, that acts as a strainer, grater, or food mill. A tamis has a cylindrical edge, made of metal or wood, that supports a disc of fine metal, nylon, or horsehair mesh. To use one, the cook places the tamis above a bowl and adds the ingredient to be strained {{in the center of the}} mesh. The food is then pushed through using a scraper or pestle. <b>Tamises</b> have been in use since the Middle Ages.|$|R
25|$|At 13:00 the British frigates {{were close}} enough that both <b>Tamise</b> and Tribune could open fire with their stern-chasers, inflicting {{considerable}} damage to the sails and rigging of the British ships and causing them to fall back despite occasional fire from the British bow-chasers. This tactic bought the French frigates three hours, but at 16:00 {{it became clear that}} the slower <b>Tamise</b> would be overhauled by Santa Margarita; Williams had already instructed Martin to focus on <b>Tamise</b> as he intended to attack the larger Tribune himself. Under fire from Martin's ship and wishing to both avoid this conflict and hoping to inflict severe damage on Santa Margarita, Fradin turned away from the former and across the bows of the latter, intending to rake Santa Margarita. In response Martin brought his frigate alongside <b>Tamise.</b> Running at speed away from their compatriots, <b>Tamise</b> and Santa Margarita exchanged broadsides for 20 minutes until Fradin, his ship badly damaged and his crew suffering heavy casualties, was forced to strike his colours.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposing}} forces were approximately equal in size, but the French, under orders to operate against commerce, not engage British warships, attempted to retreat. The British frigates pursued closely {{and over the}} course of the day gradually overhauled the French squadron. At 16:00 Santa Margarita caught <b>Tamise</b> and a furious duel ensued in which the smaller <b>Tamise</b> was badly damaged and eventually forced to surrender. Tribune continued its efforts to escape, but was finally caught by Unicorn at 22:30 and defeated in a second hard-fought engagement. Légėre took no part in the action and was able to withdraw without becoming embroiled in either conflict.|$|E
25|$|Martin was {{promoted}} to captain on 5 November 1793 and given command of the fifth-rate HMS Modeste, a frigate recently captured from the French, and saw action in operations off Toulon {{at an early stage}} of the French Revolutionary Wars. He went on to command the fifth-rate HMS Artois and saw action at the siege of Bastia in April 1794. Martin was then transferred to the Channel Fleet and stationed off Ireland in HMS Santa Margarita, in which he captured the French frigate <b>Tamise</b> at the Atlantic raid of June 1796: in the engagement, <b>Tamise</b> was badly damaged and suffered heavy casualties while HMS Santa Margaritas losses were only two killed and three wounded.|$|E
25|$|On 4 June 1796, a French {{squadron}} was dispatched from Brest on a raiding cruise. This force {{included the}} 40-gun frigates Tribune under Franco-American Commodore Jean Moulston, Proserpine under Captain Etienne Pevrieux and <b>Tamise</b> under Captain Jean-Baptiste-Alexis Fradin, the latter formerly a Royal Navy ship named HMS Thames {{which had been}} captured in an engagement in the Bay of Biscay by a French frigate squadron in October 1793. With the frigates was the 18-gun corvette Légėre under Lieutenant Jean Michel-Martin Carpentier. <b>Tamise</b> in particular had proven a highly effective commerce raider, recorded as capturing twenty merchant ships since her enforced change of allegiance. Prosperine separated from the other ships {{during a period of}} heavy fog on 7 June, sailing independently to the rendezvous off Cape Clear in Southern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In May 1946 Irish Willow was {{returned}} to Egon Jurgenson. She was sold to Cia. de Vapores Veraguas and renamed Veraguas with a Panamanian registry. She continued to trade for a further 14 years. At {{the end of her}} 42-year career she was scrapped at <b>Tamise,</b> Belgium in July 1960.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Navy {{commissioned}} HMS Espion in March 1794 {{under the}} command of Commander William Hugh Kittoe, for the Channel. On 22 July 1794 <b>Tamise</b> and two other French frigates captured Espion south of the Isles of Scilly. Kittoe was so outnumbered and outgunned that he struck without resistance. The French Navy took her into service as the corvette Espion.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, Empire Bombardier {{was sold}} to the British Tanker Co Ltd and renamed British Bombardier. Her port of {{registry}} was changed to London. In 1955, the British Tanker Company was renamed to BP Tanker Company. She served until 1959, when she was sold for scrap to a firm in <b>Tamise,</b> Belgium. She arrived for scrapping on 15 March 1959.|$|E
25|$|The four sail were a {{squadron}} of French frigates, Cornélie, Rhin, Uranie, and <b>Tamise,</b> and possibly some corvettes that had sortied in the night from Toulon. The French also captured the transport. Redbridges actual captor was Cornélie. Admiral Nelson attempted to send into Toulon a boat under a flag of truce offering the French a prisoner exchange, but the French refused his letter and proposal.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantic raid of June 1796 {{was a short}} {{campaign}} containing three connected minor naval engagements {{fought in}} the Western Approaches comprising Royal Navy efforts to eliminate a squadron of French frigates operating against British commerce during the French Revolutionary Wars. Although Royal Navy dominance in the Western Atlantic had been established, French commerce raiders operating on short cruises were having a damaging effect on British trade, and British frigate squadrons regularly patrolled from Cork {{in search of the}} raiders. One such squadron comprised the 36-gun frigates HMS Unicorn and HMS Santa Margarita, patrolling {{in the vicinity of the}} Scilly Isles, which encountered a French squadron comprising the frigates Tribune and <b>Tamise</b> and the corvette Légėre.|$|E
2500|$|The engagements were {{relatively}} evenly matched: <b>Tamise</b> and Santa Margarita carried similar weight of shot ( [...] to [...] ) although <b>Tamise</b> had seventy more crew members (306 to 237) and Santa Margarita was {{slightly more than}} a third larger (993bm to 656bm). Naval historian William James credits Santa Margaritas larger size as giving her the advantage. In the second action, Tribune also had a much larger crew than Unicorn (339 to 240) and was substantially larger (916bm to 791bm), but Unicorn, equipped with 18-pounder long guns, massed a far larger weight of shot ( [...] to [...] ), which proved decisive. Both engagements saw similar casualty ratios, with <b>Tamise</b> losing 32 killed and 19 wounded, some of whom later died, and Tribune suffering 37 killed and 15 wounded, including Moulston, while losses on Santa Margarita and Unicorn were two killed and three wounded and none at all respectively.|$|E
2500|$|According to 16th century {{antiquarian}} John Leland, {{the bridge}} {{existed in the}} centuries when Anglo-Saxon England existed (after Roman Britain and before 1066). He wrote [...] "And yn the old tyme the commune saying ys that the bridge where the commun passage was over the <b>Tamise</b> was lower on the ryver then it is now. And when men began the new town in the Saxons tymes they toke from the very clive of Comeparke [...] side {{to build on the}} <b>Tamise</b> side; and sette a new bridge hard by the same." [...] However, it is also claimed that the first Kingston Bridge was constructed in the 1190s.|$|E
2500|$|Santa Margarita {{captured}} <b>Tamise</b> in {{an action}} that would ultimately yield her crew a clasp to the NGSM. Legere escaped. Dryad captured the fourth vessel in Moulston's squadron, the 26-gun frigate Proserpine, which had earlier parted company with her companion vessels in a fog. The British took Proserpine into service as [...]|$|E
2500|$|On 7 June, Unicorn and Santa Margarita {{captured}} a large ship flying Swedish colours and carrying Dutch goods from Surinam, {{which turned out}} to be the Gustavus Adolphus. [...] The commander of the prize crew, a lieutenant from Unicorn, advised Admiral Sir Robert Kingsmill, commander in chief of the Cork station, that when he had last seen Unicorn and Santa Margarita they were chasing three French vessels, the frigates, <b>Tamise</b> and Tribune, and the corvette Legere.|$|E
2500|$|The last {{survivor}} of the squadron, Légėre, remained at sea for another nine days, capturing six merchant ships, before the corvette was intercepted at [...] in the Western Approaches by the frigates HMS Apollo under Captain John Manley and HMS Doris under Captain Charles Jones. All of the captured ships were taken to Britain and were subsequently purchased for the Royal Navy, <b>Tamise</b> restored as HMS Thames, Tribune with the same name, Proserpine as HMS Amelia as there was already an HMS Proserpine in service and Légėre anglicised as HMS Legere.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>Tamise</b> and Santa Margarita fought, Unicorn {{continued}} {{the pursuit of}} Tribune. Without the need to support the slower <b>Tamise,</b> Moulston was able to spread more sail and Tribune pulled ahead of her opponent during the afternoon the ships passing Tuskar Rock on the Wexford Coast. The French frigate's stern-chasers continued to inflict damage on Unicorns rigging, at one point snatching away the main topsail {{and it was only}} when night fell, and the wind with it, that Williams was able to gain on the French ship through the use of studding sails. At 22:30, following a chase of [...] northwards into St George's Channel, Unicorn was finally able to pull alongside Tribune. For 35 minutes the frigates battered at one another from close range. Under cover of smoke, Moulston then attempted to escape by pulling Tribune back and turning across Unicorns stern, seeking to rake the British frigate and move to windward. Realising Moulston's intent, Williams hauled his sails around, effectively throwing Unicorn in reverse. As the British ship sailed suddenly backwards she [...] crossed Tribunes bow, raking the French ship with devastating effect. From this vantage point the fire from Unicorn succeeded in collapsing the foremast and mainmast on Tribune and shooting away the mizen topmast, rendering the French ship unmanageable. With no hope of escape and casualties rapidly mounting, the wounded Moulston surrendered to Williams.|$|E
2500|$|At the Action of 8 June 1796 she {{captured}} the French <b>Tamise,</b> which {{had previously been}} the [...] Santa Margarita had two killed and three wounded in the action. She went on to capture the 16-gun privateer Buonoparte on 24 October 1796, and the 18-gun privateer Vengeur the following day. Vengeur (or Vengeance) was the former packet King George. Santa Margarita sent both into Cork. Vengeur was armed with 18 guns and had a crew of 110 men. She was nine days out of Brest when Santa Margarita captured her. Vengeur had {{captured the}} ship Potomah, which had been sailing from Poole to Newfoundland with a cargo of merchandise; the British recaptured the Potomah.|$|E
2500|$|While <b>Tamise</b> and Tribune {{met their}} fates in the Channel, Prosperine had {{continued}} unmolested to the cruising ground off the Cork coast. At 01:00 on 13 June, [...] southeast of Cape Clear Island, Pevrieux' crew sighted a sail approaching from the northeast. Pevrieux {{was searching for}} Moulston's squadron, and allowed his ship to close with the newcomer before discovering {{that it was the}} patrolling 36-gun British frigate HMS Dryad under Captain Lord Amelius Beauclerk. On realising the danger, Pevrieux tacked away from Dryad and attempted to escape to the southwest. This chase lasted most of the day, Beauclerk gradually gaining on his opponent until Pevrieux opened fire with his stern-chaser guns at 20:00.|$|E
