2500|$|Species in {{the bird}} order Procellariformes have {{nostrils}} enclosed in double tubes which sit atop or {{along the sides}} of the upper mandible. These species, which include the albatrosses, petrels, diving petrels, storm petrels, fulmars and shearwaters, are widely known as [...] "tubenoses". A number of species, including the falcons, have a small bony <b>tubercule</b> which projects from their nares. The function of this <b>tubercule</b> is unknown. Some scientists suggest it may act as a baffle, slowing down or diffusing airflow into the nares (and thus allowing the bird to continue breathing without damaging its respiratory system) during high-speed dives, but this theory has not been proved experimentally. Not all species that fly at high speeds have such tubercules, while some species which fly at low speeds do.|$|E

This subsection differes from the subsection Carinata by possessing a callus, or <b>tubercule</b> on the midlobe of the lip. In 1861, Reichenbach recognized 22 species in this subsection.

The scrotum is developmentally homologous to the labia minora and labia majora. The raphe {{does not exist in}} females. Reproductive organs and tissues develop in females and males begin during the fifth week after fertilization. The gonadal ridge grows behind the peritoneal membrane. By the sixth week, string-like tissues called primary sex cords form within the enlarging gonadal ridge. Externally, a swelling called the genital <b>tubercule</b> appears over the cloacal membrane.|$|E

50|$|Yersin {{was born}} in 1863 in Aubonne, Canton of Vaud, Switzerland, to a family {{originally}} from France. From 1883 to 1884, Yersin studied medicine at Lausanne, Switzerland; and then at Marburg, Germany and Paris (1884-1886). In 1886, he entered Louis Pasteur's research laboratory at the École Normale Supérieure, by invitation of Emile Roux, and participated {{in the development of}} the anti-rabies serum. In 1888 he received his doctorate with a dissertation entitled Étude sur le Développement du <b>Tubercule</b> Expérimental and spent two months with Robert Koch in Germany. He joined the recently created Pasteur Institute in 1889 as Roux's collaborator, and discovered with him the diphtheric toxin (produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacillus).|$|E
50|$|Warp yarns were {{strengthened}} {{by the addition of}} size - a substance made from flour and tallow or china clay. High humidity was required to weave sized yarn and to minimise the size dust in the air. This was especially important when cloth companies were forced to use Indian Surat cotton instead of Sea Island cotton from South Carolina in 1862 during the American Civil War. The war occurred at a time of market collapse, and the resulting cotton famine caused speculation and restructuring. American cotton was then subject to a blockade, and although some long staple cotton was grown along the Nile (being called Egyptian cotton), short staple Surat was introduced into the mix in most Lancashire mills. This was far harder to weave; the weavers, who were paid by the piece, at first gladly accepted the artificially induced humidity. Humidity was frequently achieved by injecting steam through pipes into the weaving sheds. The resulting damp conditions caused health risks and considerable discomfort to cotton workers, especially in sheds with poor ventilation. The water was recycled, creating favourable conditions for the propagation of contagious diseases and the accumulation of toxic substances in dyes. Robert Koch discovered the <b>tubercule</b> bacillus in 1882, though {{the way in which the}} bacillus was transmitted was not yet understood, allowing the potential question that steaming might be associated with the transmission of tuberculosis.|$|E
5000|$|In 1880, the Commission {{concluded}} that the solution of yellow fever causality must await further progress in the new science of bacteriology. Sternberg was soon sent to New Orleans to investigate the conflicting discoveries of Plasmodium malariae by Alphonse Laveran, and of Bacillus malariae by Edwin Klebs and Corrado Tommasi-Crudeli. His report (1881) declared that the Bacillus malariae had no part in the causation of malaria. The same year—simultaneously with Louis Pasteur—he announced {{the discovery of the}} pneumococcus, eventually recognized as the pathogenic agent of lobar pneumonia. He was the first in the United States to demonstrate the Plasmodium organism as cause of malaria (1885) and to confirm the causitive roles of the bacilli of tuberculosis and typhoid fever (1886). He was the first scientist to produce photomicrographs of the <b>tubercule</b> bacillus. He was also the earliest American pioneer in the related field of disinfection in which he began with experiments (1878) with putrefactive bacteria. This work was continued in Washington and in the laboratories of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, {{under the auspices of the}} American Public Health Association. For his essay [...] "Disinfection and Individual Prophylaxis against Infectious Diseases" [...] (1886), later translated into several languages, he was awarded the Lomb Prize. He oversaw creation the US Army enlisted hospital corps ("medics") in 1887.|$|E

5000|$|E. catillus {{has been}} placed in E. subg.Amphiglottium Lindl. (1841) by Reichenbach. [...] Like other members of this subgenus, E. catillus has thin stems which show no {{tendency}} to produce pseudobulbs, covered with tight, tubular sheathes which bear distichous leaves on {{the upper part of}} the stem, a long apical peduncle covered from its base with tight tubular sheathes, and a lip which is adnate to the column to its apex. The plant height is variable, from 0.2 m to 1 m. The leathery leaves grow as long as 7.5 cm, and as wide as 3.5 cm. The inflorescence is usually a raceme, although paniculate inflorescences have been observed; the flowers are born close together near the end of the raceme. The flowers are red to violet and white, and open fully. The oblong sepals are grow to 1.5 cm long, the petals are somewhat smaller. As is typical of E. sect. Schistochila, the lip has lateral lobes and a medial lobe, which divides in two in this species. As is typical of E. subsect. Tuberculata, the lip margins are crenulate to lacerate, and the lip bears an irregularly-shaped tubercule; in this species, the large <b>tubercule</b> extends much of the way down the medial lobe and into the lateral lobes, is mostly white, and is accompanied by two small colored calli, one on either side of the column apex.|$|E

40|$|Growth of mycobacterial {{species is}} {{controlled}} by a gene, Bcg (candidate Nramp). Bcg acts at the macrophage level and is thought to control some aspect of macrophage priming for activation. Infection of Mycobacterium bovis BCG-susceptible (Bcgs) mice with several different mycobacterial species results {{in the growth of}} the microorganisms, while the growth of the same organisms is controlled in BCG-resistant (Bcgr) mice. The capacity of Bcg to control the growth of M. tuberculosis has not been extensively explored. The purpose of this investigation, therefore, was to compare the growth of M. tuberculosis in Bcgr and Bcgs mice. We found that the growth of <b>tubercule</b> bacilli was different in the lungs and spleens of Bcgr and Bcgs mice when they were inoculated with fewer then 10 (3) CFU of the mycobacterium. The differences in growth were more easily distinguished in the lungs then in the spleens. The growth of the microorganisms in both strains of mice peaked between 35 and 43 days, and a latent infection was established by 65 days after infection. Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis resulted in reactivation of the growth of M. tuberculosis in both Bcgr and Bcgs mice. Greater numbers of <b>tubercule</b> bacilli were isolated from lungs than from spleens following reactivation. The utility of this mouse model {{in the study of the}} establishment of latency and reactivation of M. tuberculosis is discussed...|$|E
