He wanted calm conversation, analysis and explication.’ Critics agreed that he achieved this. In 1979, Time referred <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Considered</b> as ‘surely the most literate, trenchant and entertaining news program on radio.” ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} doctors ought <b>to</b> make <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered</b> value {{judgments}} {{about what is}} best for their patients. It illustrates some of the shortcomings of the model of doctor as 'fact-provider'. The 'fact-provider' model fails to take account of the fact that practising medicine necessarily involves making value judgments; that medical practice is a moral practice and requires that doctors reflect on what ought to be done, and that patients can make choices which fail to express their autonomy and which are based on mistaken judgments of value. If doctors are properly to respect patient autonomy and to function as moral agents, they must make evaluations of what their patients ought <b>to</b> do, <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered.</b> This paper argues for 'rational, non-interventional paternalism'. This is a practice in which doctors form conceptions of {{what is best for}} their patients and argue rationally with them. It differs from old-style paternalism in that it is not committed to doing what is best...|$|R

40|$|I {{argue that}} rule consequentialism {{sometimes}} {{requires us to}} act in ways that we lack sufficient reason to act. And this presents a dilemma for Parfit. Either Parfit should concede that we should reject rule consequentialism (and, hence, Triple Theory, which implies it) despite the putatively strong reasons that he believes we have for accepting the view or he should deny that morality has the importance he attributes to it. For if morality is such that we sometimes have decisive reason to act wrongly, then {{what we should be}} concerned with, practically speaking, is not with the morality of our actions, but with whether our actions are supported by sufficient reasons. We could, then, {{for all intents and purposes}} just ignore morality and focus on what we have sufficient reason <b>to</b> do, <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered.</b> So if my arguments are cogent, they show that Parfit’s Triple Theory is either false or relatively unimportant in that we can, for all intents and purposes, simply ignore its requirements and just do whatever it is that we have sufficient reason <b>to</b> do, <b>all</b> <b>things</b> <b>considered...</b>|$|R

50|$|In the mid-to-late 1990s, Spring Hill College {{officials}} took {{exception to}} some news reports on National Public Radio about {{subjects such as}} abortion rights and homosexuality.
