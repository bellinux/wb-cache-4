5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} to <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible under state law, which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on the north end of <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Institute of Technology {{can be traced}} back to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the {{industrial}} base of the Southern United States.

By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed to <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Institute of Technology to reflect its evolution from an engineering school to a full technical institute and research university.|$|E
