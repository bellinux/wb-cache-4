5|$|Linguistically, {{the text}} of Rawlinson B 512 is similar to Harley 5280, {{especially}} at the beginning; {{and there are also}} innovations in common with the Book of Leinster, showing that the redactor clearly had more than one manuscript at his disposal. In one instance the diction seems to come closer to the form of the original than any other surviving manuscript. An interpolation concerning Cú Roí points to this version's origin in Munster. In spite of some miscomprehension of <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the revisionist scribe, the literary style as a whole is somewhat smoother than in the earlier version, which Rudolf Thurneysen points out is of help for the understanding of the tale.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt about going to the same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall, and the other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable {{of which was the}} death of his father in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E

500|$|Preservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) {{received}} generally poor reviews. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> albums {{involved an}} anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 {{was the first}} album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk. [...] The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage. Musicologist Eric Weisbard: [...] " [...] Davies expanded the Kinks into a road troupe of perhaps a dozen costumed actors, singers and horn players.... Smoother and tighter than on record, Preservation live proved funnier as well." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{interest}} of shortening the adaptation, approximately one-third of the story was eventually edited out; entire subplots and characters were removed.

[...] She focused <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relationship between Griet and Vermeer, deciding what other storylines were [...] "... distracting and had to be jettisoned.

The line, appearing in both French and English is: « Les hivers de mon enfance étaient des saisons longues, longues.

500|$|The media's {{response}} to the second attack was more sensational. Major American newspapers such as the Boston Herald, Chicago Sun-Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Washington Post and San Francisco Chronicle placed <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front page. The New York Times headline read, [...] "Shark Kills Bather Off Jersey Beach". The growing panic had cost New Jersey resort owners an estimated $250,000 ($ in [...] ) in lost tourism, and bathing had declined 75percent in some areas. A press conference was convened on July 8, 1916, at the American Museum of Natural History with scientists Frederic Augustus Lucas, John Treadwell Nichols, and Robert Cushman Murphy as panelists. To calm the growing panic, the three men stressed that a third run in with a shark was unlikely, although they were admittedly surprised that sharks bit anyone at all. Nevertheless, Nichols—the only ichthyologist in the trio—warned swimmers {{to stay close to}} shore and {{to take advantage of the}} netted bathing areas installed at public beaches after the first attack.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>story,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} though some critics looked past these flaws.

[...] Destructoid noted that [...] "Resonance of Fate builds its world mostly through inference and implication rather than exposition" [...] and added [...] "the main plot being somewhat threadbare, it never really ascends {{to the kind of}} epic scale one would expect from the genre." [...] RPGamer praised the storytelling, stating that it uses [...] "a futuristic sci-fi setting as a backdrop {{to tell the story of}} its main characters" [...] who are [...] "trying to survive in a futuristic world gone mad." [...] It chose the game as the runner-up for its Best Script award, for bringing the [...] "characters to life" [...] and [...] "doing an amazing job with the localization."
