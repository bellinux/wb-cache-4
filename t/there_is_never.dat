5|$|Zelda now {{claims to}} be {{in direct contact with}} Christ, William the Conqueror, Mary Stuart, Apollo and all the stock {{paraphernalia}} of insane-asylum jokes... For what she has really suffered, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> a sober night that I do not pay a stark tribute of an hour to in the darkness. In an odd way, perhaps incredible to you, she was always my child (it was not reciprocal as it often is in marriages)... I was her great reality, often the only liaison agent who could make the world tangible to her.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces. The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated {{by members of the}} Holy Family; early works, especially from the Sienese or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel's figures. Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 Miraflores Altarpiece and c.1452 Braque Triptych. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels. From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs, the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{artificial}} insemination (AI) {{is a very}} important reproductive tool used on dairy facilities. AI, is the process by which sperm is deliberately delivered by dairy managers or veterinarians into the cow’s uterus. Bulls “donate” semen at a stud farm but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> any physical contact between the cow and the bull when using this method.|$|E
25|$|Mixing by gas separation: a {{nitrogen}} permeable membrane is used {{to remove}} some of the smaller nitrogen molecules from low pressure air until the required mix is achieved. The resulting low pressure nitrox is then pumped into cylinders by a compressor. Limited range of mixes are possible, but the equipment is quick and easy to operate and relatively safe, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> high partial pressure oxygen involved.|$|E

25|$|Short draw {{spinning}} is used {{to create}} worsted yarns. It is spun from combed roving, sliver or wool top. The spinner keeps his/her hands very close to each other. The fibres are held, fanned out, in one hand, and the other hand pulls a small number from the mass. The twist is kept between the second hand and the wheel. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> any twist between the two hands.|$|E
25|$|In primates, {{the pelvis}} {{consists}} of four parts - {{the left and the}} right hip bones which meet in the mid-line ventrally and are fixed to the sacrum dorsally and the coccyx. Each hip bone consists of three components, the ilium, the ischium, and the pubis, and at the time of sexual maturity these bones become fused together, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> any movement between them. In humans, the ventral joint of the pubic bones is closed.|$|E
25|$|If a piece which cannot retreat or move to {{the side}} {{advances}} to the far rank, {{so that it would}} otherwise have no further legal move, it is trapped. These pieces are the pawn, knight, iron general, and lance. In practice this would never occur for pawns or lances, which promote to pieces which keep their old moves, so that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> any reason to defer their promotion, as stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player.|$|E

The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26 January 2002 Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank officer of the IAF.|$|E
25|$|The {{libretto}} {{was derived}} from several sources, including songs and poems written by Tolkien, phrases from the screenplay (often sung against the corresponding dialogue or recitation) as well as original and adapted material from Shore and from screenwriters Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, and others, all translated by Salo while stressing good choral sounds. The vocal music serves primarily to give texture and cultural aesthetic to the score; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> any translation of the lyrics in the on-screen presentation, {{and in some cases}} only fragments of the source texts are used for their sound more so than their meaning, although overall the use of the choral text remains mostly coherent.|$|E
25|$|In ontological hermeneutics, {{a horizon}} {{is used to}} {{identify}} an individual's past experiences, personal beliefs and opinions, cultural background, intentionality, and overall life direction. In simpler terms, to refer to an individual's horizon is to refer to an individual's future goals, as informed by their past experiences and personal belief system. Since goals, beliefs, and experiences are plural, there can be horizons within a larger horizon, similar to how there can be multiple thoughts within a core belief in CBT, or how there can be multiple experiences of high school within the overall experience of high school. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> one masterful, overarching horizon that governs all the others.|$|E

25|$|Territorial {{males of}} this species perch upon {{prominent}} vegetation at high elevation (1500m or higher) and chase intruders away. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> more than one individual in each territory {{for more than a}} few minutes. Every so often, the landowning male wasp will make short regular flights out from its perch. Intruding visitors are common among this species, as males jockey for the best territory. On occasion, the intruder engages in aerial combat with the territory owner over possession of the perch, a tree or bush. The two males will clash wings and spiral vertically upwards engaging in an aerial contest for the territory.|$|E
25|$|Fisher House Foundation is {{best known}} for a network of comfort homes where {{families}} can stay at no cost while a loved one is receiving treatment. These homes are located at major U.S. military and VA medical centers nationwide, close to the medical center or hospital it serves. Fisher Houses have up to 21 suites, with private bedrooms and baths. Families share a common kitchen, laundry facilities, a dining room and a living room. Fisher House Foundation ensures that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> a fee. Since inception, the program has saved military and veteran families an estimated $200 million in out of pocket costs for lodging and transportation.|$|E
25|$|In the {{reference}} {{frame of the}} interface between two surfaces, static friction does no work, because <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> displacement between the surfaces. In the same reference frame, kinetic friction is always in the direction opposite the motion, and does negative work. However, friction can do positive work in certain frames of reference. One can see this by placing a heavy box on a rug, then pulling on the rug quickly. In this case, the box slides backwards relative to the rug, but moves forward relative to the frame of reference in which the floor is stationary. Thus, the kinetic friction between the box and rug accelerates the box {{in the same direction}} that the box moves, doing positive work.|$|E

25|$|The nest {{is always}} {{part of a}} colony but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> more than one nest in a tree. Sometimes the colony can cover quite {{extensive}} areas with a single nest in each tree (usually juniper, live oak or pine). There are usually 3–4 eggs laid, quite early in the season. Incubation is usually 16 days. The male bird normally brings food near to the nest, and the female flies to him to receive it and take back to the nest to feed the chicks that fledge around 3 weeks later. Young are normally fed only by their parents, but once they reach near-fledging size they can sometimes receive a meal from any passing member of the colony, which can continue for some time after leaving the nest.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{power is}} more {{predictable}} than wind power and less variable – while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> any solar power available during the night, {{and there is}} a reduction in winter, the only unknown factors in predicting solar output each day is cloud cover, frost and snow. Many days in a row in some locations are relatively cloud free, just as many days in a row in either the same or other locations are overcast – leading to relatively high predictability. Wind comes from the uneven heating of the earth's surface, and can provide about 1% of the potential energy that is available from solar power. 86,000 TW of solar energy reaches the surface of the world vs. 870 TW in all of the world's winds. Total world demand is roughly 12 TW, many times less than the amount that could be generated from potential wind and solar resources. From 40 to 85 TW could be provided from wind and about 580 TW from solar.|$|E
500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens {{wrote the}} opinion, which affirmed the {{decision}} of the Illinois Appellate Court, and upheld Taylor's conviction. He began by addressing the position of the state of Illinois, who argued that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>never</b> a Compulsory Process Clause concern when preclusion of a witness is used as a discovery sanction. The Court had held the converse view, Stevens wrote that [...] "few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense". This strong footing of Sixth Amendment values forced the Court to reject the State's absolutist argument.|$|E
