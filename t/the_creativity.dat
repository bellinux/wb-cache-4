He altered his tactics and built a stubborn team, which lacked <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost a quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to investigate: (1) which of the CTL and the AfL-based direct learning approaches canresult in a better learning achievement in Mathematics; (2) which of the students with <b>the</b> high <b>creativity</b> level, those with <b>the</b> medium <b>creativity</b> level, and those with <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> level can achieve a better learning achievement in Mathematics; and (3) which of the students with <b>the</b> high <b>creativity</b> level, those with the mediumcreativity level, and those with <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> level can achieve a better learning achievement in Mathematics {{in each of the}} CTL and the AfL-based direct learning approaches; and (4) which of the CTL and the AfL-based direct learning approaches can result in the students’ learning achievement in Mathematics in each of the categories of the students’ creatvity level. This research used the quasi-experimentmethod with the factorial design of 2 x 3. The population of this research was the 8 th -grade students of the state junior secondary schools within the territory of Sukoharjo Regency, as many as 41 junior secodary schools, in the academic year of 2010 / 2011. The sampling used the stratified cluster random sampling. The samples of this research consisted of 211 students, who were divided into the Experiment Group 1 and the Experiment Group 2. The Experiment Group 1 consisted of 36 students of Class VIII A of SMP Negeri 1 Kartasuraas the group of students with <b>the</b> high <b>creativity</b> level, 38 students of Class VIII E of SMP Negeri 3 Grogolas the group of students with <b>the</b> medium <b>creativity</b> level, and 33 students Class VIII D of SMP Negeri 1 Bakias the group of students with <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> level. <b>The</b> students in the Experiment Group 1 were taught with the CTL learning approach. The Experiment Group 2 consisted of 35 students of Class VIII B of SMP Negeri 1 Kartasurawith <b>the</b> high <b>creativity</b> level, 35 students of Class VIII D of SMP Negeri 3 Grogrolas the group of students with <b>the</b> medium <b>creativity</b> level, and 34 students of Class VIII E of SMP Negeri 1 Bakias the group of students with <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> level. <b>The</b> studens in the Experiment Group 2 were taught with the AfL-based direct learning process. The dataof this research were gathered through the instruments of documentation, test, and questionnaire. The test of the students’ learning achievement in Mathematics consisted of 27 questions and the questionnaire on <b>the</b> students’ <b>creativity</b> levels consisted of 39 items. Prior {{to the use of the}} instruments for gathering the data, the content validity of the instruments of test and questionnaire was verified. The reliability of the test was verified by using the KR- 20 formula and that of the questionnaire was verified by using the Alpha formula. The analysis pre-requisites consisted of the Lilliefors test to test the normality, the Barlett test to test the homogeneity, and the T test to test the balance. stakaan. uns. ac. id digilib. uns. ac. id commit to user xiii The data were then analyzed by using the Two-way Analysis of Variance with unequal cells at the significance level of 0. 05. Based on the analysis of this research, conclusions are drawn that: (1) the learning process with the CTL approach results in an equal learning achievement in Mathematics to that with the direct learning process with the AfL-based direct learning approach; (2) the learning achievement in Mathematics of the students with <b>the</b> high <b>creativity</b> level is better than that of those with <b>the</b> medium <b>creativity</b> level, <b>the</b> learning achievement in Mathematics of the students with <b>the</b> high <b>creativity</b> level is better than that of those with <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> level, and <b>the</b> learning achievement in Mathematics of the students with <b>the</b> medium <b>creativity</b> level is better than that of those with <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> level; (3) in the learning process with the CTL approach, the students with <b>the</b> high <b>creativity</b> level have a better learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the mediumand <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> levels and <b>the</b> students with <b>the</b> medium <b>creativity</b> level have an equal learning achievement to those with <b>the</b> low <b>creativity</b> level.

5|$|Many {{argue that}} the ideas characterizing the Renaissance had their origin in late 13th-century Florence, in {{particular}} with the writings of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) and Petrarch (1304–1374), {{as well as the}} paintings of Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). Some writers date the Renaissance quite precisely; one proposed starting point is 1401, when the rival geniuses Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi competed for the contract to build the bronze doors for the Baptistery of the Florence Cathedral (Ghiberti won). Others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, and Masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking <b>the</b> <b>creativity</b> of the Renaissance. Yet it remains much debated why the Renaissance began in Italy, and why it began when it did. Accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.|$|E

In 1931, manager Leslie Knighton led the club to their first FA Cup Final, which they lost 2–1 to Second Division club West Bromwich Albion. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, with much reliance placed on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs {{to make up for the}} lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1939, the last full season before the Football League was abandoned for the duration of the Second World War.|$|E
