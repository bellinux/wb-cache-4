This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vet</b> not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E

The most commonly heard in domestic rats is bruxing, or teeth-grinding, which is most usually triggered by happiness, but can also be 'self-comforting' in stressful situations, such as a visit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vet.</b> The noise is best described as either a quick clicking or 'burring' sound, varying from animal to animal.|$|E

The {{relationship}} goes smoothly until Peter berates Chris for treating her too well. Peter tells him that women like bad boys, so Chris calls Anna a [...] "bitch" [...] on their next date, thinking that will improve the relationship. Instead, she breaks up with him. After hearing what happened, Lois, angry at Peter, tells {{him to try to}} comfort Chris, but Peter fails to cheer up Chris when Peter gives him a bullfrog which died when Peter poked holes on its back. When Lois tells Chris that the only person he should turn to in this situation is himself, Chris beats Brian with a chair as an excuse to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vet,</b> sees Anna there, and apologizes to her. She forgives Chris and they renew their relationship, while Brian collapses to the floor in pain. Brian asks for help but Stewie comes in and kicks Brian in his stomach, before leaving him there.|$|E

Drew does not see Kate's note and assumes Lucky is a stray. He takes it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>vet</b> to get it shaved and neutered. When Kate sees the dog, she fears that she, Drew and Mr. Wick will be fired. She finds an advertisement for a pure bred Hungarian Puli, but it costs $4,500.

Inspired by The Full Monty, the guys decide to perform a striptease at The Warsaw Tavern to make the money they need. Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) backs out of the performance at the last minute, but Larry Almada (Ian Gomez) steps in as his replacement.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> {{inability}} of <b>VET</b> <b>to</b> provide training places implicitly undermined the legitimation of <b>the</b> <b>VET</b> system. Since no entrance qualification—at a formal level—was required <b>to</b> enter <b>the</b> dual <b>VET</b> system, in <b>the</b> past {{it was considered}} as a pathway to qualification and participation in society for children of the lower classes. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>VET</b> during <b>the</b> past 20 years the implied assurance of social integration of the lower classes, including many migrants nowadays, is called into question. One important reason is the increasing social structuring of dual VET according to occupations and levels of general education. This might {{be considered to be}} a response by firms to higher qualification requirements and the increased supply of graduates with Abitur. The result is a social segmentation of vocational education and training.|$|R
