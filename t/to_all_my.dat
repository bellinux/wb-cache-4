When ABC received the rights <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children in 1975, it also received the kinescopes from Nixon {{with a promise}} that the network will archive them. However, {{that proved to be}} short-lived, because most of them were lost in a warehouse fire later that year. As mentioned above, a few early episodes survive.|$|E

25|$|Large scale {{natural history}} studies and further {{intervention}} studies {{were introduced in}} the 1970s and 1980s, leading to widespread use of prophylaxis against pneumococcal infections amongst other interventions. Bill Cosby's Emmy-winning 1972 TV movie, <b>To</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Friends on Shore, depicted {{the story of the}} parents of a child suffering from sickle-cell disease.

25|$|In Joe Keller, Arthur Miller creates just a {{representative}} type. Joe {{is a very}} ordinary man, decent, hard-working and charitable, a man no one could dislike. But, like the protagonist of the ancient drama, he has a flaw or weakness. This, in turn, causes him to act wrongly. He is forced to accept responsibility – his suicide is necessary to restore the moral order of the universe, and allows his son, Chris, to live free from guilt and persecution. Arthur Miller later uses the Everyman in a criticism of the American Dream in Death of a Salesman, which {{is in many ways}} similar <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Sons.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Riegel {{agreed to}} return <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children with Tamara Braun. Braun came on as Reese Williams, Bianca's new lover/girlfriend and later wife. Bianca first aired on October 17, 2008. Reese {{followed}} on October 30, 2008. Riegel's return was partly {{to minimize the}} effect of Alicia Minshew's absence on the show while Minshew took a two-month hiatus to get married. Reese and Bianca's union made history when it resulted in the first legal same-sex marriage in American daytime television. Riegel left the show again in February 2009, but also confirmed {{in an interview with}} Soap Opera Digest that she would be returning in spring 2009 to conclude the Reese and Bianca story.|$|E

25|$|In September 2010, Daytime Emmy winner Vincent Irizzary's character, David Hayward, was murdered. On the November 22, 2010, episode, David waltzed {{into the}} {{courtroom}} during Greenlee's trial (for which she was just {{sentenced to life in}} prison for murdering him) at the tail end of it, confirming rumors that he was going to return all along. Soap Opera Digest confirmed soon after that the show had planned this all along from the start. On September 16, 2010, Adam Mayfield (Scott Chandler) and Brittany Allen (Marissa Tasker) were announced to be leaving the show. ABC reports that they wanted to take both the characters in a different direction. On September 22, 2010, it was announced that Daniel Cosgrove (ex-Scott, All My Children; ex-Bill, Guiding Light; ex-Chris, As the World Turns) would return <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children and replace Adam Mayfield (Scott) as Scott Chandler. On October 28, 2010, it was announced that Sarah Glendening (ex-Lucy, As the World Turns) would be taking over the role of Marissa Tasker. Glendening debuted on December 27 and Cosgrove debuted on December 29.|$|E
25|$|Gretel on {{the three}} other ABC daytime dramas at the time — All My Children, General Hospital, and Port Charles — in an {{extended}} crossover storyline {{which was the first}} time a daytime character had ever appeared on four series. Gretel's search for the child she had given up for adoption takes her <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children, where she discovers in 2000 that her own birth mother is Pine Valley's Myrtle Fargate. Following clues to Port Charles and General Hospital, Gretel finally finds her daughter back in Llanview on One Life to Live: Skye Chandler, herself a former All My Children character who had relocated to One Life to Live in 1999. Skye's adopted All My Children father Adam Chandler appears on One Life to Live in 2001, and Gretel initially identifies Skye's biological father as Alan Quartermaine of General Hospital. Both women subsequently appear on that series, with Skye moving to General Hospital full-time in 2001 and Gretel returning to One Life to Live until 2004, making some appearances on General Hospital later in 2002 and 2003.|$|E

25|$|On April 14, 2011, it was {{announced}} that ABC canceled All My Children after 41 years on the air due to low ratings. On July 7, 2011, ABC sold the licensing rights of All My Children to third-party production company Prospect Park with the show set to continue on the internet as a series of webisodes. The show taped its final scenes for ABC on August 30, 2011, and its final episode on the network aired on September 23, 2011, with a cliffhanger. On September 26, 2011, the following Monday, ABC replaced All My Children with a newly debuted talk show The Chew. Prospect Park had suspended its plan to revive the series on November 23, 2011, due to lack of funding and unsuccessful negotiation with the union organizations representing the actors and crews. On January 7, 2013, Prospect Park officially brought back its project to restore All My Children as a web series. The show taped its first scenes for Prospect Park TOLN on February 18, 2013, and its first episode on the network aired on April 29, 2013. However, the new series faced several behind-the-scene obstacles throughout its run. On November 11, 2013, several All My Children cast members announced that Prospect Park had closed production and canceled the series again. ABC regained the rights <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children in December 2016.|$|E
25|$|Riegel was {{nominated}} for three Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series (2001, 2002, 2004) before finally winning the award in 2005. She won two Soap Opera Digest Awards in 2001 for Outstanding Female Newcomer, and in 2005 for Outstanding Younger Lead Actress. Later that year, Riegel, along with best friend and co-star Elizabeth Hendrickson, exited All My Children, with their last show airing on February 24, 2005. Riegel then moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue other acting ventures. She made a brief return to the soap opera when her television mother (Erica) marries in May 2005, and returned for an extended stay from December 16, 2005 to January 10, 2006. Bianca's daughter, Miranda, was aged accordingly. Riegel returned again for a short visit from May 24, 2006 until mid-June, in a storyline connected with Bianca's sister Kendall's (Alicia Minshew) pregnancy and coma. In August 2006, Riegel's return <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children as a contract player was announced. The actress taped her first scenes on September 12, which first aired on October 11. Riegel commuted {{back and forth between}} her home and family in Los Angeles and New York, where All My Children tapes. In 2007, she parted ways with the show once again, but reappeared in the episode dated August 14, 2007, when Bianca phones in to check on Kendall from Paris, and in December for a Christmas visit.|$|E

500|$|Nelson's fleet reached Syracuse in Sicily on 19 July {{and took}} on {{essential}} supplies.

I cannot find, or at this moment learn, beyond vague conjecture where the French fleet are gone <b>to.</b> <b>All</b> <b>my</b> ill fortune, hitherto, has proceeded from want of frigates." [...] Meanwhile, the French were securing Egypt by the Battle of the Pyramids. By 24 July, the British fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again {{in the direction of the}} Morea. [...] On 28 July, at Coron, Nelson finally obtained intelligence describing the French attack on Egypt and turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, HMS Alexander and HMS Swiftsure, sighted the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.|$|E
500|$|His father's last {{move was}} in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong {{attended}} Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield.

Armstrong {{was active in the}} Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the Moon inside the Columbia, Armstrong greeted the Scouts: [...] "I'd like to say hello <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo11 would like to send them best wishes". [...] Houston replied: [...] "Thank you, Apollo11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news. Certainly appreciate that."
