5|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> {{about whether}} Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old}} as <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was a predator; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{interesting}} and radical themes of <b>the</b> <b>debating</b> societies was <b>the</b> continued and varied debate on men and women and their interactions. The presence of women in the societies meant that <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> had a chance of accurately representing contemporary women's own viewpoints on their role in society, not simply those of men, making <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> a significant marker of popular thought and opinion.|$|R

5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> over the rise of America as a world power; he expects <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> {{at large}} traces its roots {{back to the}} end of World War II, the current debate began in 1992 with the {{retirement}} of the last active Iowa-class battleship, , {{as a result of the}} reduced demand for naval artillery, the rise of ship and submarine-launched missiles and aircraft-launched precision guided munitions (such as laser-guided bombs, which can accurately strike and destroy an enemy target with a single strike). The most striking point of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> in the United States centers on battleships: owing to the longtime maintenance and upkeep that the four completed Iowa-class battleships have undergone during their time in the navy's active and mothball fleets, many still view battleships as viable solutions for gunfire support, and these members have questioned if the navy can adequately replace the gunfire support provided by a battleship's main guns with the smaller guns on its current fleet of cruisers and destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Based on his {{participation}} in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> and his reputation, Hoffmann received the commission to design the new building. Without any kind of competitive bidding or restrictions, he was commissioned to design it with space for approximately 1,000 employees. In 1900, the prosperous city decided the building should feature a tower. Hoffmann's design was accepted in 1901, and demolition of the existing buildings began. The cornerstone was laid in 1902.|$|E

5|$|Bryan {{had been}} a dark horse {{candidate}} with little support in the convention.

5000|$|While <b>the</b> <b>debating</b> {{societies}} of18th century London were prominent fixtures of {{the public}} sphere, and not initially restricted by the government, they were not without their critics. Andrew describes some of the negative reaction to the societies thus: The active presence {{of women in the}} societies inevitably raised some eyebrows among more traditional types, and <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> on religious matters could not have been met with mere acceptance by the church and the clergy. Andrew cites the example of Bishop Porteus who called <b>the</b> <b>debating</b> societies, [...] "schools of infidelity and popery." [...] The political bent of many of <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> was seen as increasingly threatening as the French Revolution heightened the political climate.|$|R

5|$|Hal {{is riding}} {{the school bus}} home one day when he is {{approached}} by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has {{dropped out of high}} school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual abstinence in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b>|$|E
