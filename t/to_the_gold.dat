5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give a blunt 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E
5|$|In July 1897, {{the first}} {{news of the}} Klondike gold strike reached Seattle, Washington, {{triggering}} the Klondike Gold Rush. Thousands of people boarded steamships heading north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> fields. Some of these travelers sailed around the western tip of Alaska and up the Yukon River to Dawson City (site of the gold fields) rather than take an arduous overland trip across the Boundary Ranges.|$|E

Goldfinger hints he does not intend <b>to</b> steal <b>the</b> <b>gold,</b> and Bond deduces Goldfinger will detonate a dirty bomb inside <b>the</b> vault, designed <b>to</b> render <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> useless for 58 years. This will increase the value of Goldfinger's own <b>gold</b> and give <b>the</b> Chinese an advantage from the potential economic chaos.|$|R

This is then roasted at a small smelter outside Kalgoorlie-Boulder <b>to</b> liberate <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> from <b>the</b> tellurides, with doré bars poured.|$|R

5|$|After {{leaving office}} as Indian Affairs Superintendent, Palmer worked his farm on his land claim and {{operated}} his sawmill {{and several other}} enterprises. Between 1858 and 1861 he spent time in British Columbia as a merchant to prospectors in the gold rushes of the Thompson River, Similkameen Valley, and Fraser River. Palmer blazed a route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> fields of the Okanogan Valley and the upper portions of the Columbia River from Priest Rapids in 1860. In 1862, {{he was elected to}} the Oregon House of Representatives to represent Yamhill County. Now a member of the Republican Party, he was named Speaker of the House during that session.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{were divided}} on the {{monetary}} issue. Their eventual nominee, Parker Watkins Hardin, {{was known to be}} a free silver supporter, but he pledged to abide by whatever platform the convention adopted. That platform was ambiguous with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> and silver question; it praised President Grover Cleveland and his treasury secretary, native Kentuckian John G. Carlisle, both gold supporters, and endorsed the national Democratic platform of 1892. Most believed this meant the platform favored gold, although silverites like Ollie M. James contended that the 1892 platform favored silver. Consequently, most Democrats left the convention not knowing where their nominee would stand on the money question.|$|E

5|$|Even {{within the}} Bond canon, Goldfinger is acknowledged; the 22nd Bond film, Quantum of Solace, {{includes}} an homage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> body paint death scene {{by having a}} female character dead on a bed nude, covered in crude oil. Outside the Bond films, elements of Goldfinger, such as Oddjob and his use of his hat as a weapon, Bond removing his drysuit to reveal a tuxedo underneath and the laser scene have been homaged or spoofed in works such as True Lies, The Simpsons, and the Austin Powers series. The US television programme MythBusters explored many scenarios seen in the film, such as the explosive depressurisation in a plane at high altitudes, the death by full body painting, an ejector seat {{in a car and}} using a tuxedo under a drysuit.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his second}} NHL season, Kariya {{was named to}} Canada's team for the 1996 World Championships in Vienna. During the round-robin, he scored a hat-trick against the United States, helping Canada to a 5–1 win, {{qualifying}} them for the quarterfinals. During their semifinal against Russia, Kariya scored in the shootout to help Canada to a 3–2 win. Advancing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> medal game, they lost 4–2 to the Czech Republic. Kariya finished the competition with four goals and seven points over eight games, earning him a spot as Canada's lone representative on the Tournament's First All-Star Team. Over three World Championship appearances, Kariya recorded 28 points (11 goals and 17 assists) over 24 games, which at the time, ranked him at third all-time among Canadian scorers, behind Steve Yzerman's 39 points and Marcel Dionne's 32.|$|E

Following this, he won his third World Half Marathon title, setting a Championship record of 59:35 and also winning a silver medal with Eritrea in the team competition. The gold medal over the half marathon distance made him the second runner ever to win a World Championship medal in cross country, track and road racing all in the same year, a feat achieved previously by only Paul Tergat.|$|E
5|$|In June 2009 Hunt {{expressed}} a desire to leave the NRL and it was speculated he would play rugby overseas.

In 2010, while contracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gold</b> Coast, he played a season with Biarritz Olympique in the French Top 14 rugby union competition. After beginning his AFL career, Hunt was named in the Courier Mail 2011 Queensland Australian rules football Team of the Year. Overall, however, his 4-year stint in the AFL received mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Paul {{served on the}} House Banking Committee, where he blamed the Federal Reserve for {{inflation}} and spoke against the banking mismanagement {{that resulted in the}} savings and loan crisis.

5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the First World War, Britain's economy enjoyed a brief boom. Businesses rushed to replenish stocks and re-establish peacetime conditions of trade, and while prices rose rapidly, wages rose faster and unemployment was negligible. By April 1920 this boom had given way to Britain's first post-war slump, which ushered in an era of high unemployment. Britain's adoption of generally deflationary economic policies, including a return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> standard in 1925, helped to ensure that the percentage of the workforce without jobs remained at around 10% for the rest of the 1920s and beyond, well above the normal pre-war levels. During the world recession that began in 1929 and lasted until 1932, the percentage of unemployed peaked at 22%, representing more than 3 million workers.|$|E

Making his international debut against Russia, he scored his first goal for Canada in a 5–3 win. In the quarterfinal against Switzerland, he was named the player of the game, having scored his second goal of the tournament. He scored again in the semifinal against the United States to help Canada advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> medal game, where they were defeated 5–3 by Russia. Johansen finished with three goals and nine points, third in team scoring behind Brayden Schenn and Ryan Ellis, and was named to the Tournament All-Star Team.|$|E

The U.S. qualified for the 2004 Olympic Games on August 30 with an 87–71 win over Puerto Rico, where McGrady was involved in an altercation with Puerto Rico's Eddie Casiano, with fans throwing drinks and debris on the court when it happened. America eventually advanced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> medal game, where they defeated Argentina. For the tournament, McGrady averaged 12.6 points and 2.9 rebounds a game on 54.4 percent shooting overall and 42.1 percent three-point shooting.|$|E

This plan would have been prepared by Diego Abad de Santillán, {{one of the most}} fervent adversaries of Negrín; however, this is considered inaccurate by the libertarian historian Francisco Olaya Morales, who argues that <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> reserves were transferred to Cartagena not for security purposes, but because of a preconceived intention <b>to</b> send <b>the</b> <b>gold</b> <b>to</b> Moscow.|$|R
