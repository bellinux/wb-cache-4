5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E

Bruns stayed with his grandparents in Ohio and told <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> he knew about the murders, and flew back to Tucson to help with the investigation.|$|E

25|$|The FBI {{investigated}} {{rings of}} German saboteurs and spies {{starting in the}} late 1930s, and had primary responsibility for counterespionage. The first arrests of German agents were made in 1938 and continued throughout World War II. In the Quirin affair, during World War II, German U-boats set two small groups of Nazi agents ashore in Florida and Long Island to cause acts of sabotage within the country. The two teams were apprehended {{after one of the}} men contacted the FBI and told <b>them</b> <b>everything.</b> He was also charged and convicted.|$|E
25|$|These later divided Gotland {{into three}} parts, so that Graip the eldest got the {{northern}} third, Guti the middle third, and Gunfjaun the youngest had the south.

So they selected every third person by lot to leave, with the right to keep and take away with <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> they owned except for their land. They were unwilling to leave then, but went to instead Torsburgen and settled there. But afterwards the country (i.e. Gotland) would not tolerate them, and drove them away.|$|E
25|$|The {{success that}} Fenton, Murray and Wood enjoyed {{because of the}} high quality of their {{workmanship}} attracted the hostility of competitors, Boulton and Watt. The latter firm sent employees William Murdoch and Abraham Storey to visit Murray, ostensibly on a courtesy visit, but in reality to spy on his production methods. Murray, rather foolishly, welcomed them, and showed <b>them</b> <b>everything.</b> On their return they informed their employers that Murray's casting work and forging work were much superior to their own, and efforts were made to adopt many of Murray's production methods. There was also an attempt by the firm of Boulton and Watt to obtain information from an employee of Fenton, Murray and Wood by bribery. Finally, James Watt jnr purchased land adjacent to the workshop in an attempt to prevent the firm from expanding.|$|E

25|$|In April 2005, Diehl-Armstrong {{confided to}} a state trooper that she had {{information}} about the Wells' case and after meeting with FBI agents, said she would tell <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> she knew if she was transferred from Muncy State Penitentiary to a minimum-security prison in Cambridge Springs. During a series of interviews, Diehl-Armstrong admitted to providing the kitchen timers used for the bomb and said that Rothstein was the mastermind of the plot and that Wells had been {{directly involved in the}} plan. In late 2005, Kenneth Barnes, an ex-television repairman in jail on unrelated drug charges and friend of Diehl-Armstrong, was turned in by his brother-in-law after revealing details of the crime to him. Barnes told investigators that would tell them the whole story in return for a reduced sentence. He told them that Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that she wanted the money to pay Barnes to kill her father, whom she believed was wasting her inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, Kathy {{has escaped}} Gavin, and she {{contacts}} her old friend Tracey (Jane Slaughter), at The Queen Vic, giving her {{an address to}} pass on to Phil. Gavin follows Phil to a small hotel. He reaches Kathy first and takes her to a small airfield, with the intent of flying away from England. Phil and Ronnie intercept them and convince Kathy to come back to Walford with them. While Phil arranges a hotel for her to stay in, she hides in The Arches, where she comes face to face with Sharon, who is stunned to find she is alive. They have an angry confrontation which leads to a physical fight, before Phil moves Kathy to a nearby hotel. Within a week, Kathy is revealed to have Gavin hidden in her bathroom, with him controlling her again. After Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) talks him out of suicide, Ian is shocked to see Kathy is alive and has witnessed the event. As Ian crosses the road to meet Kathy, he is hit by an oncoming car and rushed to hospital. Ian eventually regains consciousness and breaks down in happiness when he realises that Kathy is alive, but reveals he wants answers for her faking her death. As Ian is leaving hospital, Jane threatens Kathy to stay away from Walford in a bid to protect Ian. Ian demands to see Kathy and she explains to him that Gavin forced her to go on the run with him as part of an insurance scam and he had controlled her for years and she felt she had no choice. Ian persuades her to go to the police and she agrees, however, she lies about why she is there when she enters the station by claiming her handbag is stolen and later tells Ian that she told <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> and they are looking for Gavin. She then secretly meets Gavin who reminds her of their plan.|$|E
500|$|Al Aronowitz, a New York-based {{journalist}} {{and a friend}} of the Harrisons, later expressed his surprise at the failure of their marriage, saying: [...] "I never saw the breakup coming … around <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> seemed magical." [...] Harrison and Boyd met on the set of the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night in 1964 and were married two years later. By the late 1960s, however, they had begun to grow apart due to Harrison's preoccupation with meditation and other spiritual pursuits. In an effort to regain her husband's attention, in 1970, Boyd responded to Clapton's long-held infatuation with her, only to reject his advances at that time. Unable to conceive a child, and with Harrison averse to adoption, Boyd resumed her career as a fashion model in May 1971, an activity that sat at odds with his spiritual convictions. According to Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley, the first public signs of a rift in the marriage came in August 1972. That month, Harrison travelled alone through Europe to Portugal to visit Gary Wright, who then [...] "played the diplomat" [...] by fending off press speculation regarding Boyd's absence.|$|E

The lepers are bundled into Avaris, the former capital of the Hyksos, where Osarseph prescribes for <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> forbidden in Egypt, while proscribing everything permitted in Egypt. They invite the Hyksos to reinvade Egypt, rule with them for 13 years – Osarseph then assumes the name Moses - and are then driven out.|$|E

[...] Newt Gingrich said, [...] "All the Occupy movements starts with the premise that we all owe <b>them</b> <b>everything.</b> Now, that is a pretty good symptom of how much the left has collapsed as a moral system in this country and why you need to reassert something as simple as saying to them, go get a job right after you take a bath."

2500|$|U-2 {{pilots were}} told if captured, Knutson later said, [...] "to tell <b>them</b> <b>everything</b> that they knew", {{because they were}} told little about their {{missions}} other than targets on maps. Otherwise, Powers had little instruction {{on what to do}} during an interrogation. Although he had been told that he could reveal everything about the aircraft since the Soviets could learn what they wanted from it, Powers did his best to conceal classified information while appearing to cooperate. His trial began on 17 August 1960. Powers—who apologized on advice of his Soviet defense counsel—was sentenced to three years in prison, but on 10 February 1962 the USSR exchanged him and American student Frederic Pryor for Rudolf Abel at Glienicke Bridge between West Berlin and Potsdam, Germany. Two CIA investigations found that Powers had done well during the interrogation and had [...] "complied with his obligations as an American citizen during this period". Although the government was reluctant to reinstate him to the USAF because of its statements that the U-2 program was civilian, it had promised to do so after CIA employment ended. Powers resolved the dilemma by choosing to work for Lockheed as a U-2 pilot.|$|E
