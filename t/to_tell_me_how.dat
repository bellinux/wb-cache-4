2500|$|An early {{internet}} leak of Civil War was {{a source}} of some controversy. Aaron Hale-Williams, a writer for the online publication Racket Magazine, was given a password-encoded streaming media version of the album by Fat Wreck Chords so that he could publish a review prior to its release. Hale posted the password and a link to the album stream on the music news website Punknews.org, and the album soon spread onto peer-to-peer networks after the streaming audio was converted into MP3 format. Racket Magazine Editor Jonathan Yost learned of the leak from Hale and contacted Fat Wreck Chords: [...] "He called me <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> good it was, and mentioned that he gave it to 'two or three' people. I scoped it on PunkNews {{and saw that it was}} all over the place, so [...] dropped Fat a line to change the password before it got too far out of control." [...] Meanwhile, Hale had been submitting samples of his writing to Scott Heisel, Music Editor for Alternative Press and former editor for Punknews.org. Heisel had been covering news of Civil Wars recording and development for Alternative Press and learned of the album leak, which he called [...] "illegal...immoral and immature." [...] He contacted Fat Wreck Chords to inform them of the situation at about the same time as Yost, and learned that the Hale was the suspected source of the leak: ...|$|E

"Indeed! {{you must}} have passed no small part of your short life {{in the study of}} geography, to be so well informed," [...] {{returned}} the lieutenant; [...] "perhaps, sir, your cunning is also equal <b>to</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> long we shall sojourn together, if I make you a prisoner, in order to enjoy the benefit of your wit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Treated them well! Scooping them up, {{keeping them}} in a cage, giving them grass and raw meat <b>to</b> eat? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> speak to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Luke," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> exactly <b>how</b> {{it was that}} you came <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Bill <b>to</b> write that letter to Mr. Wakefield?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{he began}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> hard a soldier's life was, how hard the soldier was drilled.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him and from him to Giuliana, and my eyes most clearly invited her <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> she would have me act.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{has been}} most kind, making {{arrangements}} about getting Ogden's portrait painted. But, bother Lord Mountry. How did we get sidetracked on <b>to</b> him? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you got Ogden away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|When his {{excitement}} had somewhat calmed down, he cried to the boy, 'Whether {{you are really}} my son matters nothing <b>to</b> me; <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>how</b> can I repay {{you for what you}} have done for me?' ...|$|R
60|$|You see, I {{expected}} a pompous couple who {{knew all about}} everything and were going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> exactly <b>how</b> Egypt ought to be governed. A Member of Parliament doesn't inspire confidence in the worried bosom of a Government official.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, not yet, Mr. Petter," [...] said she; [...] "I {{want you}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{you came to}} have that little turret over the {{thatched}} roof." ...|$|E
60|$|He went on <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> a swift ship goes hunting whales with a bomb-gun and explodes shells {{into their}} insides {{so that they}} perish at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have very}} much <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>How</b> is it you come from the westward, and where is your compañero?" [...] she asked; and once more Maxwell was wholly misled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was greatly}} grieved," [...] {{he said after}} the first greetings, [...] "to hear of your brother's death. I felt it {{as if he had}} been a near {{relative}} of my own. I had hoped to see you both; and that affair concerning which my cousin wrote <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> cleverly you had discovered a plot against the queen's life, showed me that you would both be sure to make your way. Your father and mother must have felt the blow terribly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Grace {{went about}} {{the room with a}} leaden weight in every fibre, putting the place in order, and Mrs. Maynard did not speak again till she had finished. Then she said, [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> just <b>how</b> bad Dr. Mulbridge thinks I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane!" [...] he cried, [...] "God {{has been}} good <b>to</b> us, indeed. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you escaped--what form Providence took to save you for--us." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{can think}} of my emotion, my friends, as I listened to these words. I embraced the brave Fourneau, and implored him <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I could assist him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean, {{and if you}} won't be serious I shall {{think there is no}} {{seriousness}} in you. I want you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> it can be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, young man," [...] said Sir Alexander, [...] "you have {{purchased}} this article. Will {{you be so}} good as <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you propose it should be paid for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It 's odd <b>to</b> {{hear you}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be happy. I don't {{think you know}} yourself, dear uncle. Now, does that sound brutal?" ...|$|R
60|$|That one glance round {{was enough}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> exactly <b>how</b> I was situated. I had been betrayed by these peasants {{into the hands}} of an outpost of guerillas. There were eight of them, savage-looking, hairy creatures, with cotton {{handkerchiefs}} under their sombreros, and many-buttoned jackets with coloured sashes round the waist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry," [...] I said, {{stretching}} {{out my hand}} to her. [...] "This is the lady I told you about. You remember the letter. Now go along, and settle matters with the proprietor. Sit down, Minnie, I want to talk <b>to</b> you. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you came here, and why you left England, won't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he went on}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> Marx had met him on {{his return}} after his long absence and had taken him to see his wife, who {{believed}} him dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "What Sergeant Wilks meant, when he {{said that}} he had called <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{grateful}} he felt to you for saving his little grandchild's life. I am proud of you, Jim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Earl, the Vicar of Arnscombe. He {{has promised}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{we can be}} of use here. I believe there is great want of a lady at the Sunday school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} see what I can do, Susan. I can't let that poor little thing go back <b>to</b> Mrs. Conover. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> wash and dress it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, your chicquing it, you're faking it," [...] said Mrs. March, {{borrowing}} the verbs severally {{from the}} art editor and the publisher of Every Other Week. [...] "You have got <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> just <b>how</b> much and how little there really is of her before I go any further with them. Is she stupid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Do write <b>to</b> us and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> {{your sister}} is, and also {{how you are}} in spirits and towards the things of the world? Give her my love--will you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You’ll find it’s quite true," [...] said Gannett; [...] "when I {{come back}} that bird’ll be able <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> you’ve been and all about you. Everything you’ve done during my absence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Abersouth," [...] said I, {{rising on}} tiptoe {{so as to}} {{overlook}} the lower slopes of Mrs. Braddon, [...] "will you be good enough <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> long {{this thing is going}} on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody {{has so much}} {{influence}} with Frank as I. Just do you write to me to-morrow, and the next day,--and the day after,--a mere line, you know, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> the land lies here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stranger! I {{have told}} to thee, [...] 125 All the tale I have to tell-- Stranger! canst thou <b>tell</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>How</b> to 'scape {{the powers of}} Hell?-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why should I be frightened?" [...] {{said the}} little queen;—"and {{do you suppose}} that I have no better manners than <b>to</b> laugh? Only <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> I must behave; and I will do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I'd got sober. I'd no {{business}} to drink to-night. But it's {{in my head}} yet--worse'n when we started here. I'm all in a muddle; can't recollect anything of it, hardly. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> Joe--HONEST, now, old feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--'pon my soul and honor, I never meant <b>to,</b> Joe. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful--and him so young and promising." ...|$|R
