The aircraft and personnel of <b>the</b> 456th <b>FIS</b> were reassigned to <b>the</b> 437th <b>FIS,</b> and <b>the</b> 456th was inactivated {{as part of}} this consolidation by the now renamed Aerospace Defense Command (ADC). On 30 September 1968, <b>the</b> 437th <b>FIS</b> was discontinued and redesignated as the 460th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, because <b>the</b> 460th <b>FIS</b> was regarded by ADC of having a more distinguished history.|$|R
5|$|Peter N. Myhre {{stated in}} 2008 {{that the line}} would be {{extended}} to the ski resort before <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, but no action was taken as neither Ruter nor the city council wanted to allocate the required 150million NOK.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>FIS</b> Cross-Country World Cup {{has been}} hosted three times, in 1993, 2000 and 2002, all in February or March. <b>The</b> <b>FIS</b> Nordic Combined World Cup has been hosted seven {{times at the}} stadium, in 1998, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010.

It has also hosted the Norwegian Nordic Ski Championships in 1993. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. Birkebeineren will host cross-country, Nordic combined and biathlon events.|$|E
5|$|The {{hill was}} {{scheduled}} to host two FIS Ski Jumping World Cup events in January 1991, {{but they had to}} be cancelled due to lack of snow. In 1993, the hills hosted a single large hill World Cup event. Since 1997, Tremplin du Praz has been used annually for <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Ski Jumping Grand Prix, the premier international summer ski jumping tournament. Originally it consisted of a single competition in the large hill, but from 2010, a qualification run was introduced the day before the main event. The venue has hosted <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Ski Jumping Continental Cup four times, in 2000, 2002, 2010 and 2011. In February 2006, the venue hosted two FIS Cup competitions in the normal hill.

The venue has been a popular training venue for national teams, and Germany often holds summer training in Courchevel.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after joining}} the wing, <b>the</b> 58th <b>FIS</b> {{converted}} from F-86 to F-94 aircraft. Although it remained {{assigned to the}} wing until February 1953, <b>the</b> 59th <b>FIS</b> moved to Goose Bay Airport, Labrador on 28 October 1952 and was detached from the wing to Northeast Air Command until it was reassigned. In November its place at Otis {{was taken by the}} newly activating 437th <b>FIS.</b> <b>The</b> same month <b>the</b> 48th <b>FIS</b> activated at Grenier to replace <b>the</b> 133d <b>FIS,</b> which was inactivated and returned to the control of the ANG.|$|R

5|$|The {{world record}} stayed in Planica for four years, {{during which the}} K-point at Velikanka bratov Gorišek was {{upgraded}} to 165m {{in time for the}} inaugural Ski Flying World Championships in 1972, which eventually superseded International Ski Flying Week. This new event was sanctioned a year earlier by <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> at their 28th International Ski Congress in Opatija, Croatia (then a part of Yugoslavia). Much like in 1938 when the discipline received official recognition from <b>the</b> <b>FIS,</b> another milestone had been reached as ski flying was now granted its own world championship-level event on par with the Ski Jumping World Championships, having spent almost four decades as a mere 'special attraction' alongside its older and more prestigious sibling.|$|E
5|$|Vikersundbakken opened as Northern Europe's only {{ski flying}} hill in March 1966. The hill was later renovated and {{expanded}} ahead of <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Ski-Flying World Championships 1977 and again ahead of <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Ski-Flying World Championships 1990. Holmenkollen National Arena and Holmenkollbakken were declared the national venue for Nordic skiing in 1997, ahead of Granåsen in Trondheim and Lysgårdsbakken in Lillehammer. By then ideas had been launched {{to build a}} national ski flying hill in Rødkleiva. However, it was rejected both by Holmenkollen director Rolf Nyhus and ski jumping director Odd Hammernes, who stated that a new ski flying hill would be too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Big Thunder was {{a regular}} site for <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Nordic Ski Jumping World Cup, and {{arranged}} a world cup round, typically with two jumps, every season from 1980 through 1991. Nordic combined was, {{in addition to the}} World Championships, hosted twice, in 1989 and in 1994. The last World Cup tournament was held in 1994 as a Pre-World Championship tournament.|$|E
5000|$|In March, <b>the</b> 57th <b>FIS,</b> flying Northrop F-89 Scorpions was {{activated}} at Presque Isle as the group's second operational squadron.

A second swap of units began when the 82d Fighter Interceptor Squadron arrived from Iceland the same day <b>the</b> 74th <b>FIS</b> left, and also converted to [...] "Scorpions". [...] <b>The</b> 57th <b>FIS</b> then moved to Iceland and was reassigned away from the group in November of the same year.

2500|$|In April 1959, {{the group}} gained its second {{operational}} squadron, <b>the</b> 322d <b>FIS,</b> which moved {{to what was}} now Kingsley Field from Larson Air Force Base, Washington and immediately began converting to McDonnell F-101 Voodoo aircraft. [...] The Voodoo was equipped with data link to communicate directly with Semi-Automatic Ground Environment computers at Combat Direction Centers. [...] Three months later, <b>the</b> 518th <b>FIS</b> inactivated without ever having {{been more than a}} paper unit at Kingsley. [...] At the end of September 1968, <b>the</b> 322d <b>FIS</b> inactivated and was replaced by <b>the</b> activating 59th <b>FIS,</b> which took over its personnel and equipment.

5|$|Seeking to co-operate on hill {{design and}} event organisation, the venues at Kulm, Oberstdorf and Planica formed the KOP working group in 1962 (KOP being an {{abbreviation}} of Kulm/Oberstdorf/Planica). This group {{would go on}} to consult with <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> in all aspects of ski flying, celebrating their 50th anniversary in 2012. In 1953, Kulm hosted the first International Ski Flying Week, which would be the premier event in ski flying until 1972.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>FIS</b> Nordic World Ski Championships {{have been}} held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women.

5|$|The only FIS-sanctioned {{event to}} take place at Igman was ski jumping and Nordic {{combined}} at the 1984 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping competitions doubled {{as a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Ski Jumping World Cup. The normal hill event was won by East Germany's Jens Weißflog ahead of Nykänen. The two reversed top places in the large hill event. The Nordic combined event was won by Norway's Tom Sandberg ahead of Finland's Jouko Karjalainen and Jukka Ylipulli.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1954, [...] "Project Arrow" [...] {{replaced}} <b>the</b> 445th <b>FIS</b> with <b>the</b> 497th <b>FIS</b> {{that was}} moved up from Portland, Oregon. <b>The</b> 445th <b>FIS</b> was transferred, on paper only, to Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan in 1955 performing air defense duties over the Great Lakes area and upper Midwest equipped with F-89D Scorpions. <b>The</b> 445th <b>FIS</b> was upgraded {{to the new}} F-89G Scorpion in March 1956 (the first F-89G squadron in ADC); and upgraded to the F-89J in September 1957.|$|R
50|$|As ADC realigned {{during the}} year. <b>the</b> 113th <b>FIS</b> was reassigned {{directly}} to Central Air Defense Force.

5|$|The {{sport of}} {{cross-country}} skiing encompasses {{a variety of}} formats for cross-country skiing races over courses of varying lengths according to rules sanctioned by the International Ski Federation and by various national organizations, such as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA) and Cross Country Ski Canada. International competitions include <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Nordic World Ski Championships, <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Cross-Country World Cup, and at the Winter Olympic Games. Such races occur over homologated, groomed courses designed to support classic (in-track) and freestyle events, where the skiers may employ skate skiing. It also encompasses cross-country ski marathon events, sanctioned by the Worldloppet Ski Federation, and cross-country ski orienteering events, sanctioned by the International Orienteering Federation. Related forms of competition are biathlon, where competitors race on cross-country skis and stop to shoot at targets with rifles, and paralympic cross-country skiing that allows athletes with disabilities to compete at cross-country skiing with adaptive equipment.|$|E
5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. <b>The</b> <b>FIS,</b> still wary of the rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to host <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building a large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building a small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1955, <b>the</b> 465th <b>FIS</b> was {{assigned}} to Griffiss with F-89 Scorpion all-weather fighters.

5|$|By December 1998, Mohn's {{successor}} Jan Jensen {{was supporting}} granting Vikersundbakken national venue status {{in preparation for}} it hosting <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Ski-Flying World Championships 2000. By December, a limited company had been established to continue the planning and construction of the hill. In July 1999, Vikersundbakken was granted a national venue status for ten years, which secured both state grants {{and the right to}} hold all World Cup ski flying events the following ten years. After the 2000 World Championships, Vikersundbakken's Torstein Haugerud protested that Bertil Pålsrud, who was both managing director of Rødkleiva Skiflyging {{and a member of the}} Norwegian Ski Federation's ski jumping committee, was using his position in the federation to promote the Rødkleiva project.|$|E
5|$|Cortina d'Ampezzo was {{the host}} town of the 1956 Winter Olympics. The 1944 Winter Olympics were also {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Cortina, but were cancelled because of World War II. The 1927 Nordic, 1941 Nordic and 1941 Alpine World Skiing Championships were held in Cortina as well, although the 1941 Nordic championships were withdrawn by <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> in 1946.

Financing issues for the event were also clarified. The next scheduled update occurred at <b>the</b> <b>FIS</b> Autumn Meeting in Zurich during the week of 24 September 2007. Progress was given by Organizing President Neumannová and Executive Director Marek Rejman while at Zurich, including updates on the venues (shown in the next section), and focused on the sports organization (including the technical directors); and the marketing and promotion of the test events. Liberec had also confirmed their support of the governmental financing for the university campus which served as the village for the teams in 2009.|$|E
