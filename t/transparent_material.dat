The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E

25|$|The Jones matrix due to {{passage through}} a <b>transparent</b> <b>material</b> is {{dependent}} on the propagation distance as well as the birefringence. The birefringence (as well as the average refractive index) will generally be dispersive, that is, it will vary as a function of optical frequency (wavelength). In the case of non-birefringent materials, however, the 2×2 Jones matrix is the identity matrix (multiplied by a scalar phase factor and attenuation factor), implying no change in polarization during propagation.|$|E
25|$|A lens is a {{transmissive}} {{optical device}} that focuses or disperses a light beam {{by means of}} refraction. A simple lens consists of {{a single piece of}} <b>transparent</b> <b>material,</b> while a compound lens consists of several simple lenses (elements), usually arranged along a common axis. Lenses are made from materials such as glass or plastic, and are ground and polished or moulded to a desired shape. A lens can focus light to form an image, unlike a prism, which refracts light without focusing. Devices that similarly focus or disperse waves and radiation other than visible light are also called lenses, such as microwave lenses, electron lenses, acoustic lenses, or explosive lenses.|$|E
25|$|Macroscopic optical {{elements}} and active optical components {{as well as}} large area hot mirrors, cold mirrors, lenses and beam splitters all with optimal geometry can be made quickly and at low cost via the sol-gel route. In the processing of high performance ceramic nanomaterials with superior opto-mechanical properties under adverse conditions, {{the size of the}} crystalline grains is determined largely {{by the size of the}} crystalline particles present in the raw material during the synthesis or formation of the object. Thus a reduction of the original particle size well below the wavelength of visible light (~500nm) eliminates much of the light scattering, resulting in a translucent or even <b>transparent</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Barton's design {{called for}} a spherical vessel, as a sphere is the best {{possible}} shape for resisting high pressure. [...] The sphere had openings for three [...] windows made of fused quartz, the strongest <b>transparent</b> <b>material</b> then available, as well a 400-pound/181.436 kilogram entrance hatch {{which was to be}} bolted down before a descent. [...] Initially only two of the windows were mounted on the sphere, and a steel plug was mounted in place of the third window. [...] Oxygen was supplied from high-pressure cylinders carried inside the sphere, while pans of soda lime and calcium chloride were mounted inside the sphere's walls to absorb exhaled CO2 and moisture. [...] Air was to be circulated past these trays by the Bathysphere's occupants using palm-leaf fans.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{important}} research breakthrough {{came from}} Turner Whitted in 1979. Previous algorithms traced rays from the eye into the scene until they hit an object, but determined the ray color without recursively tracing more rays. [...] Whitted continued the process. [...] When a ray hits a surface, it can generate {{up to three}} new types of rays: reflection, refraction, and shadow. A reflection ray is traced in the mirror-reflection direction. The closest object it intersects is what will {{be seen in the}} reflection. [...] Refraction rays traveling through <b>transparent</b> <b>material</b> work similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material. [...] A shadow ray is traced toward each light. If any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and the light does not illuminate it. [...] This recursive ray tracing added more realism to ray traced images.|$|E
2500|$|To {{prevent the}} shells from {{collapsing}} {{at the long}} light slots at their apexes, concrete struts were inserted at 10-foot (3 m) intervals. [...] A relatively thick concrete arch was added to {{each end of the}} shells to stiffen them further. [...] To make it clear that the curved shells are supported only at their four corners and not by the walls at the ends of the vaults, thin arcs of <b>transparent</b> <b>material</b> were inserted between the curve of the shells and the end walls. [...] Because the stiffening arches of the shells are thicker at the top, the transparent strips are tapered, thinner at the top than at the bottom. In addition, a linear transparent strip was placed between the straight bottoms of the shells and the long exterior walls to show that the shells aren't supported by those walls either. [...] In addition to revealing the building's structure, these features bring additional natural light into the galleries {{in a way that is}} safe for the paintings.|$|E

6000|$|... 15. There are six {{candles on}} the board of the Automaton during exhibition. The {{question}} naturally arises--"Why are so many employed, when a single candle, or, at farthest, two, would have been amply sufficient to afford the spectators a clear view of the board, in a room otherwise so well lit up as the exhibition room always is--when, moreover, if we suppose the machine a pure machine, there can be no necessity for so much light, or indeed any light at all, to enable it to perform its operations--and when, especially, only a single candle is placed upon the table of the antagonist?" [...] The first and most obvious inference is, that so strong a light is requisite to enable the man within to see through the <b>transparent</b> <b>material</b> (probably fine gauze) of which the breast of the Turk is composed. But when we consider the arrangement of the candles, another reason immediately presents itself. There are six lights (as we have said before) in all. Three of these are on each side of the figure. Those most remote from the spectators are the longest--those in the middle are about two inches shorter--and those nearest the company about two inches shorter still--and the candles on one side differ in height from the candles respectively opposite on the other, by a ratio different from two inches--that is to say, the longest candle on one side is about three inches shorter than the longest candle on the other, and so on. Thus it will be seen that no two of the candles are of the same height, and thus also the difficulty of ascertaining the material of the breast of the figure (against which the light is especially directed) is greatly augmented by the dazzling effect of the complicated crossings of the rays--crossings which are brought about by placing the centres of radiation all upon different levels.|$|E
