It is this, rather than Markan priority, which forms the distinctive feature of the 2SH as against rival theories. The existence of Q follows from the conclusion that, as Luke and Matthew are independent of Mark in the double tradition, the connection between them must be explained by their joint but independent use of a missing source or sources. (That <b>they</b> used <b>Q</b> independently of each other follows from the fact that they frequently differ quite widely in their use of this source).|$|R
