40|$|P 1 ParA is {{a member}} of the Walker-type family of {{partition}} ATPases involved in the segregation of plas-mids and bacterial chromosomes. ATPases of this class interact with DNA non-specifically in vitro and colocalize with the bacterial nucleoid to generate a variety of reported patterns in vivo. Here, we directly visualize ParA binding to DNA using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This activity depends on, and is highly specific for ATP. DNA-binding activity is not coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Rather, ParA undergoes a slow multi-step conforma-tional transition upon ATP binding, which licenses ParA to bind non-specific DNA. The kinetics provide a <b>time-delay</b> <b>switch</b> to allow slow cycling between the DNA binding and non-binding forms of ParA. We propose that this time delay, combined with stimula-tion of ParA’s ATPase activity by ParB bound to the plasmid DNA, generates an uneven distribution of the nucleoid-associated ParA, and provides the motive force for plasmid segregation prior to cell division...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{security}} of networked control systems (NCSs) {{has been an important}} challenge for many researchers. Although {{the security}} schemes for networked control systems have advanced in the past several years, there have been many acknowledged cyber attacks. As a result, this dissertation proposes the use of a novel <b>time-delay</b> <b>switch</b> (TDS) attack by introducing time delays into the dynamics of NCSs. Such an attack has devastating effects on NCSs if prevention techniques and countermeasures are not considered in the design of these systems. To overcome the stability issue caused by TDS attacks, this dissertation proposes a new detector to track TDS attacks in real time. This method relies on an estimator that will estimate and track time delays introduced by a hacker. Once a detector obtains the maximum tolerable time delay of a plant’s optimal controller (for which the plant remains secure and stable), it issues an alarm signal and directs the system to its alarm state. In the alarm state, the plant operates under the control of an emergency controller that can be local or networked to the plant and remains in this stable mode until the networked control system state is restored. In another effort, this dissertation evaluates different control methods to find out which one is more stable when under a TDS attack than others. Also, a novel, simple and effective controller is proposed to thwart TDS attacks on the sensing loop (SL). The modified controller controls the system under a TDS attack. Also, the time-delay estimator will track time delays introduced by a hacker using a modified model reference-based control with an indirect supervisor and a modified least mean square (LMS) minimization technique. Furthermore, here, the demonstration proves that the cryptographic solutions are ineffective in the recovery from TDS attacks. A cryptography-free TDS recovery (CF-TDSR) communication protocol enhancement is introduced to leverage the adaptive channel redundancy techniques, along with a novel state estimator to detect and assist in the recovery of the destabilizing effects of TDS attacks. The conclusion shows how the CF-TDSR ensures the control stability of linear time invariant systems...|$|E

40|$|Flagella are hair-like {{projections}} {{from the}} surface of eukaryotic cells, and they {{play an important role in}} many cellular functions, such as cell-motility. The beating of flagella is enabled by their internal architecture, the axoneme, and is powered by a dense distribution of motor proteins, dyneins. The dyneins deliver the required mechanical work through the hydrolysis of ATP. Although the dynein-ATP cycle, the axoneme microstructure, and the flagellar-beating kinematics are well studied, their integration into a coherent picture of ATP-powered flagellar beating is still lacking. Here we show that a <b>time-delayed</b> negative-work-based <b>switching</b> mechanism is able to convert the individual sliding action of hundreds of dyneins into a regular overall beating pattern leading to propulsion. We developed a computational model based on a minimal representation of the axoneme consisting of two representative doublet microtubules connected by nexin links. The relative sliding of the microtubules is incorporated by modeling two groups of ATP-powered dyneins, each responsible for sliding in opposite directions. A <b>time-delayed</b> <b>switching</b> mechanism is postulated, which is key in converting the local individual sliding action of multiple dyneins into global beating. Our results demonstrate that an overall nonreciprocal beating pattern can emerge with time due to the spatial and temporal coordination of the individual dyneins. These findings provide insights in the fundamental working mechanism of axonemal dyneins and could possibly open new research directions in the field of flagellar motility...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHematopoiesis is {{a highly}} {{complicated}} biological phenomenon. Improving its mathematical modeling and analysis are essential steps towards consolidating the common knowledge about mechanisms behind blood cells production.

Thus, the main approach for stability analysis under arbitrary switching relies on the use of a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the LMI approach for constructing a common Lyapunov function [40]. In fact, getting such a function becomes more complicated even for switched linear systems. Consequently, few results have been obtained for continuous-time <b>switched</b> nonlinear <b>time-delay</b> systems [40].|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{consensus}} problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks {{with and without}} time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connec-tivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This re-quired the generalization {{of the notion of}} algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs {{play a key role in}} addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of con-sensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

A switching strategy able to guarantee stability of the feedback interconnection of a switching linear subsystem and a linear stable norm-bounded perturbation is developed. the new version of SGT is specially important to solve two different problems. the first one concerns the possibility of enhancing the robustness of a feedback control system by appropriately orchestrating the switches among a set of given linear regulators. the second problem is {{the design of a}} stabilising <b>switching</b> strategy for <b>time-delay</b> <b>switched</b> systems.

Remarkably, since the sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are delay-dependent, they are less conservative with respect to previous results in the literature. the theory is illustrated by means of academic examples.
