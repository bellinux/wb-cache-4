5|$|To {{finance the}} scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, {{president}} of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that he needed much more money than he had to attempt <b>the</b> <b>squeeze</b> and Barney declined to provide funding. Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers {{were able to find}} plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>squeezed</b> branch pile {{is a kind}} of {{frictional}} {{end bearing}} pile which is variable cross-section, a new type of pile foundation with characteristics of high bearing capacity and low settlement. In order to explore vertical settlement regularity of <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> branch pile, this paper carries out the theoretical analysis and experimental research on the consolidation settlement law of <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> branch pile through the numerical method and static load test. The results of numerical analysis and experimental research show that vertical consolidation settlement is reduced along with increase of <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> branch pile diameter, and the settlement of <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> branch pile is given priority to consolidation...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>squeezed</b> {{states are}} states of minimum uncertainty, {{but unlike the}} {{coherent}} states, in which the uncer-tainty in the position and the momentum are the same, these allow to reduce the uncertainty, either in the position or in the momentum, while maintaining the principle of uncertainty in its minimum. It seems that this property of <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> states would allow you to get the position eigenstates as a limit case of them, doing null the uncertainty in the position and infinite at the momentum. However, there are two equivalent ways to define <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> states, which lead to different expressions for the limit states.

25|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip vortices, streamline contraction, and squeeze jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to cavitation. <b>The</b> <b>squeeze</b> jets are formed when the valve is closing and the blood between the occluder and valve housing is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense vortices with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} cavitation.|$|E
25|$|While many British {{passenger}} ships {{had been}} called into duty for the war effort, Lusitania remained on her traditional route between Liverpool and New York.

Her First Class accommodations, for which she was quite famous on the North Atlantic Run, were booked at just over half capacity at 290. Second Class was severely overbooked with 601 passengers, far exceeding the maximum capacity of 460 which had been designated to Second Class. While a large number of small children and infants helped reduce <b>the</b> <b>squeeze</b> into the limited number of two and four berth cabins, the situation was ultimately rectified by allowing some Second Class passengers to occupy empty First Class cabins. In Third Class, the situation was considered to be the norm for an eastbound crossing, with only 373 travelling in accommodations designed for 1,186.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{action in}} baseball is either (for the offence) to advance runners {{around the bases}} or (for the defence) to halt that advance. As simple as this is in principle, in practice it generates a remarkably large range of strategies. Any given situation—the number of runners on base, the bases they occupy, their skills as runners or base-stealers, the count on the hitter, the number of outs, the specialties of the pitcher and the batter, the catcher's skill at throwing out runners, the positioning of fielders, which inning is being played, and so on—allows for a considerable variety of possible plays, {{on either side of}} the ball. At any moment, one manager may be calculating how to advance his runners (whether to call for the steal, the hit-and-run, sacrifice bunt, sacrifice fly, a double steal, <b>the</b> <b>squeeze,</b> and so on) while the opposing manager is calculating how best to thwart his opponent (not only through the pitching approach and positioning of fielders, but by, say, calling for a pitch-out when a steal is anticipated, and so on). Since the variables that determine which strategies are possible or advisable change from pitch to pitch, and according to all the varieties of play situation that may come about in any game, the game played between the two managers is the most intricate aspect of the game, and for many followers of the sport is considered the true 'inner game'.|$|E
40|$|Among {{the three}} methods of {{defining}} <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> states of <b>the</b> harmonic oscillator, only two, i. e. the minimum uncertainty and ladder-operator methods were extended to investigate <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> states of <b>the</b> general symmetry systems.

However, for output radiation the correlation of the quadrature operators evaluated at different times also exhibits <b>squeezing,</b> which is <b>the</b> reason for quenching of the overall noise in one of the quadrature components of <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> spectrum even when the oscillator is coupled to a vacuum reservoir. Moreover, coupling the oscillator to <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> vacuum reservoir enhances <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> exponentially and it also increases the mean photon number.

40|$|We examine subnatural phase-dependent linewidths in the {{fluorescence}} {{spectrum of}} a three-level atom damped by a narrow-bandwidth squeezed vacuum in a cavity. Using the dressed-atom model approach of a strongly driven three-level cascade system, we derive the master equation {{of the system}} from which we obtain simple analytical expressions for the fluorescence spectrum. We show that the phase effects depend on the bandwidths of <b>the</b> <b>squeezed</b> vacuum and <b>the</b> cavity relative to the Rabi frequency of the driving fields. When <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> bandwidth is {{much larger than the}} Rabi frequency, the spectrum consists of five lines with only the central and outer sidebands dependent on the phase. For a squeezing bandwidth much smaller than the Rabi frequency the number of lines in the spectrum and their phase properties depend on the frequency at which <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> and cavity modes are centered. When <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> and cavity modes are centered on the inner Rabi sidebands, the spectrum exhibits five lines that are completely independent of <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> phase with only the inner Rabi sidebands dependent on <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> correlations. Matching <b>the</b> <b>squeezing</b> and cavity modes to the outer Rabi sidebands leads to the disappearance of the inner Rabi sidebands and a strong phase dependence of the central line and the outer Rabi sidebands. We find that in this case the system behaves as an individual two-level system that reveals exactly the noise distribution in <b>the</b> input <b>squeezed</b> vacuum.

25|$|In both sports, {{strategy}} {{varies with}} the game situation. In baseball, pitcher, batter and fielders all play far differently in the late innings of a close game (e.g., waiting for walks, trying for stolen bases or <b>the</b> <b>squeeze</b> play to score a decisive run) than they do early, or when one team has already scored many more runs than the other (where batters will be likely to swing at many more pitches and try for extra-base hits and even home runs). The number, speed, and position of baserunners, which have no equivalent in cricket, all dramatically change the strategies used by pitcher and batter. A runner on first base must decide how large a lead {{to take off the}} base—the larger the lead, the greater the chance of advancing on a stolen base or batted ball, but also the greater the risk of being picked off by the pitcher. In leagues which do not allow designated hitters, strategic thinking also enters into substitutions. For example, in the double switch, the substitution of a relief pitcher is combined with the substitution of a pinch hitter who takes the pitcher's spot in the batting order so that the new pitcher will come to bat later (as almost all pitchers are poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). Since players may not return to the game after being substituted for, a manager cannot take lightly the decision when and if to substitute a better-fielding but worse-hitting player if his team is ahead.|$|E
