5|$|Bred {{throughout}} France, the Selle Français {{has been}} exported worldwide, with additional stud books formed in Great Britain and the United States. Horses {{registered with the}} stud books must undergo inspections which judge their conformation, gaits and performance. Horses of other breeds who pass <b>the</b> <b>inspections,</b> including those of Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter bloodlines, {{may be used for}} breeding, with the progeny able to be registered as Selle Français. Selle Français have proven successful at the international level of competition in many equestrian disciplines. They are most commonly seen in show jumping, eventing and dressage, although they are also seen in combined driving, equestrian vaulting and competitive trail riding competitions. Selle Français and their riders have won numerous medals in the Summer Olympics and World Equestrian Games, including making up the entire gold-medal French teams in show jumping at the 2002 World Equestrian Games and eventing at the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, {{permission to use}} the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles.

5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of <b>the</b> <b>inspections.</b> The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{a design}} of a general {{automated}} visual inspection application is proposed. The system is intended {{to work in a}} production environment, being able to perform quality control on precision parts, rejecting defective objects and reporting on the flaws that were found. As a part of this system, a new tool is also proposed, that can verify the presence and shape of features that occur in multiple instances in the image of <b>the</b> object under <b>inspection.</b> <b>The</b> work is based on a study of available commercial solutions for automated visual inspection and attempts to increase the user s overview and understanding of how <b>the</b> <b>inspection</b> is built up. The application consists of an inspection interface and a configuration interface. The user configures <b>the</b> <b>inspection</b> in <b>the</b> configuration interface by selecting a set of predefined tools that perform measurements based on an image of <b>the</b> object under <b>inspection</b> and intermediate results, and configuring them to suit his/her needs.
