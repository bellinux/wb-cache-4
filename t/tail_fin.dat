5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E

5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E
5|$|A typical fish is ectothermic, has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has {{two sets of}} paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a <b>tail</b> <b>fin,</b> has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs.|$|E

5|$|The {{long black}} and white <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> can be up {{to a third of}} body length. Several {{hypotheses}} attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any cetacean. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{version of}} the B.1. Larger, thinner wing than the B.1 (Phase 2C wing) and fitted with Olympus 201-202 engines of 17,000 lbf (76 kN) each, or Olympus 301 engines of 20,000 lbf (89 kN) each. Uprated {{electrics}} with Auxiliary Airborne Power Plant (AAPP) (Auxiliary power unit) and Ram Air Turbine (RAT). ECM similar to B.1A. Terrain-Following Radar (TFR) in nose thimble radome fitted to most aircraft in mid-60s. New Radar warning receiver aerials on <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> giving it a square top from the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E
5|$|To evade enemy {{detection}} and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were {{operated by the}} air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E

50|$|The BAT 9 did {{away with}} the marked wing lines of the {{previous}} models in favour of a cleaner, more sober line. The <b>tail</b> <b>fins,</b> which {{in the other two}} models had a real wing-like look, were sized down into two small metal plates, much like the <b>tail</b> <b>fins</b> in production on American and some European cars of the time.|$|R

5|$|He {{claimed his}} {{first of two}} aerial {{victories}} in the Battle of France on 20May 1940. Ostermann had been entrusted with leading a Rotte, an element of two aircraft, with Unteroffizier (non-commissioned officer) Fritz Marcks as his wingman. The Schwarm (flight) led by Oberleutnant (Senior Lieutenant or First Lieutenant) Günther Scholz engaged eight French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406's fighters near Amiens with Ostermann, Marcks and Scholz claiming one each. His second aerial victory was achieved over a Curtiss Hawk-75 on 26May 1940. In a head on firing pass two 20mm shells tore off {{large parts of the}} aircraft's <b>tail</b> <b>fin,</b> which then collided with Osterrmann's starboard wing. The French pilot was observed to bail out with Ostermann managing to make a safe landing.|$|E
5|$|Uladzimir Karvat, a {{military}} pilot, was flying his training aircraft Sukhoi Su-27p on May 23, 1996. The plane caught fire and Karvat {{was ordered to}} eject to safety. Unknown to the ground crew, the plane would have crashed in an area full of civilians. Seeing the civilians on the ground, Karvat steered the plane away until it crashed onekilometer from the Brest Voblast settlements of Arabawshchyna and Vyalikaye Hatsishcha, killing him instantly. President Alexander Lukashenko issued Decree Number 484 on November 21, 1996, which posthumously awarded Karvat the title Hero of Belarus. The crash site has been converted to a memorial for Karvat, where a copy of Lukashenko's decree is on the <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> of the Sukhoi Su-27p.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the third}} prototype, several design {{improvements}} were developed and incorporated into further aircraft. Because of excessive smoke emissions by the RD-93 engine, the air intakes were widened. Reported control problems found in testing resulted in alterations to the wing leading edge root extensions (LERX). The vertical <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> was enlarged to house an expanded electronic warfare equipment bay in the tip. The redesigned aircraft had a slightly increased {{maximum take-off weight}} and incorporated an increased quantity of Chinese-sourced avionics; however PAF had selected Western avionics for their aircraft, postponing PAF deliveries from late 2005 until 2007. Pakistan evaluated British, French, and Italian avionics suites, the winner of which {{was expected to be}} finalised in 2006. PT-04, the fourth prototype and the first to incorporate the design changes, was rolled out in April 2006 and made its first flight on 28 April 2006.|$|E

5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} fairing {{at the tip of}} the <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This is of great advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the <b>tail</b> <b>fin.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the <b>tail</b> <b>fin</b> are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E
