60|$|In the United Kingdom, {{on the rim}} of the Western Ocean, {{live the}} English folk. They are a consummately civilised people. Their capital amounts to at least 300 pounds per head. They gain their food, not by hunting and fishing, but by toil at colossal artifices. For the most part, they suffer from lack of shelter. The greater number of them are vilely housed, do not have enough fuel to keep them warm, and are insufficiently clothed.

There are 40,000,000 of the English folk, and 939 out of every 1000 of them die in poverty, while a constant army of 8,000,000 struggles on the ragged edge of starvation. Further, each babe that is born, is born in debt to the sum of 22 pounds. This is because of an artifice called the National Debt.|$|E

First, net capital inflows are procyclical (i. e., external borrowing increases in good <b>times</b> <b>and</b> falls in <b>bad</b> <b>times)</b> in most OECD and developing countries. Second, fiscal policy is procyclical (i. e., government spending increases in good <b>times</b> <b>and</b> falls in <b>bad</b> <b>times)</b> {{for the majority of}} developing countries. Third, for emerging markets, monetary policy appears to be procyclical (i. e., policy rates are lowered in good <b>times</b> <b>and</b> raised in <b>bad</b> <b>times).</b> Fourth, in developing countries - and particularly for emerging markets - periods of capital inflows are associated with expansionary macroeconomic policies and periods of capital outflows with contractionary macroeconomic policies. In such countries, therefore, when it rains, it does indeed pour. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract These days, {{workers in}} a {{construction}} site conduct a rebar bending process with a machine. This bending process has some problems such as long processing <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> quality of the rebar. In order to manufacture a rebar having precision and machinability, we should study on Spring-back phenomenon. This phenomenon affects a shape of rebar after unloading due to restoration ability of material and it is influenced by bending angle, bending radius and a rebar diameter. The change of spring-back ratio according to the change of the parameters are analyzed by FEM. Consequently, Spring-back increases around 0. 1 ° as bending angle increases 10 °. and it also increases around 0. 6 ° as diameter of rebar increases from φ 10 mm to φ 16 mm...|$|R
60|$|And so, {{in a less}} degree, {{with people}} who fret and are anxious. They {{may be in a}} great bustle, but they do not get their work done. They run hither and thither, trying this and that, but leaving {{everything}} half done, to fly off to something else. Or else they spend time unprofitably in dreaming, and expecting, and complaining, which might be spent profitably in working. And they are always apt to lose their heads, and their tempers, just when they need them most; to do in their hurry the very last things which they ought to have done; to try so many roads that they choose the wrong road after all, from mere confusion, and run with open eyes into the very pit which they have been afraid of falling into. As we say here, they will go all through the wood to cut a straight stick, and bring out a crooked one at last. My friends, even in a mere worldly way, the men whom I have seen succeed best in life have always been cheerful and hopeful men, who went about their business with a smile on their faces, and took the changes and chances of this mortal life like men, facing rough and smooth alike as it came, and so found the truth of the old proverb, that 'Good <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> times, and all times pass over.' Of all men, perhaps, who have lived in our days, the most truly successful was the great Duke of Wellington; and one thing, I believe, which helped him most to become great, was that he was so wonderfully free from vain fretting and complaining, free from useless regrets about the past, from useless anxieties for the future. Though he had for years on his shoulders a responsibility which might have well broken down the spirit of any man; though the lives of thousands of brave men, and the welfare of great kingdoms-- ay, humanly speaking, the fate of all Europe--depended on his using his wisdom in the right place, and one mistake might have brought ruin and shame on him and on tens of thousands; yet no one ever saw him anxious, confused, terrified. Though for many years he was much tried and hampered, and unjustly and foolishly kept from doing his work as he knew it ought to be down, yet when the time came for work, his head was always clear, his spirit was always ready; and therefore he succeeded in the most marvellous way. Solomon says, 'Better is he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.' Now the Great Duke had learnt in most things to rule his spirit, and therefore he was able not only to take cities, but to do better still, to deliver cities,--ay, and whole countries--out of the hand of armies often far stronger, humanly speaking, than his own.|$|E
