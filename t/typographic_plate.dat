2500|$|Like for the 30 & 60 lepta stamps, the Chief-Engraver {{supervised}} the company: Charles-Dierrey, 6 & 12, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs in Paris, on the manufacturing of the postal stationery <b>typographic</b> <b>plate,</b> composed of 24 pure copper [...] "clichés", {{by using a}} galvanic method.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} {{the contrast between the}} dark and the light parts of the printing, a blanket was inserted below the sheet to be printed and the <b>typographic</b> <b>plate.</b> This method allowed to get much better overall results without however reaching the quality of the first Athens fine printings or obviously, the one of the Paris printings...

25|$|For a {{long period}} of time, one {{believed}} that it was due to the cleaning of the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> as the named of these printings is referring to. In fact, it is not the case at all, as the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> have been cleaned only in 1870. This pale/dull aspect is coming from the usage of a new blanket ("blanchet") much thicker as demonstrated by Louis Basel.|$|R

5000|$|Starting May 1862, the Greek {{printers}} stopped totally {{the usage}} of the hard printing method ("tirage à sec"), and used another one, (named the soft printing method or [...] "au blanchet") much more easier to put in place.In order to increase {{the contrast between the}} dark and the light parts of the printing, a blanket was inserted below the sheet to be printed and the <b>typographic</b> <b>plate.</b> This method allowed to get much better overall results without however reaching the quality of the first Athens fine printings or obviously, the one of the Paris printings... This method was giving a strong [...] "foulage" [...] to the stamps, in particular at the shadow lines of the neck, with, very often, a relief ("foulage") visible {{on the back of the}} stamp.At the beginning of these printings (1862/1863), the shadow lines of the cheek are continued and straight before becoming ticker after...The [...] "control numbers" [...] are fine but lighter than on the first Athens printings.|$|E
5000|$|In 1875, at {{the same}} time of the 30 & 60 lepta stamps order, the Greek postal {{administration}} asked to Désiré-Albert Barre to realize the necessary equipment to print the first postal stationery (carte-correspondence) of the Kingdom.For the realization of the die of the effigy of the stamp of the postal stationery, the Chief-Engraver took the same medallion-die used, in 1861, to create the large Hermes head stamps and engraved a new framework (see the illustrations of the pre-project and the mock-up, below).Like for the 30 & 60 lepta stamps, the Chief-Engraver supervised the company: Charles-Dierrey, 6 & 12, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs in Paris, on the manufacturing of the postal stationery <b>typographic</b> <b>plate,</b> composed of 24 pure copper [...] "clichés", by using a galvanic method.And like for the 30 & 60 lepta stamps, the sheets were printed in typography on Bristol paper, by the company: J. Claye & Cie, 7, rue Saint Benoît, in Paris, on April 13 & 14, 1876.5.000, or 8.000, sheets of 24 postal stationaries (cartes-correspondence) with 15 lepta value have been printed. The documents exchanged between Désiré-Albert Barre and the Greek government, are indeed contradictories regarding the exact quantity ordered: 5.000 or 8.000 sheets (?)...|$|E

25|$|The <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> counted 300 stamps, sub-divided in six {{panels of}} 50 stamps (5 × 10) mounted in two columns of three rows.|$|R
25|$|Like in 1861, after a first {{printing}} {{of the two}} values, done in Paris, all the following ones {{have been done in}} Athens with the same <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> sent from Paris.|$|R
2500|$|The nine {{values of}} the [...] "large Hermes head" [...] have been printed from the same nine <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> (one per value) during {{more than twenty years}} (from 1861 to 1882).|$|R
25|$|Then, {{and as soon}} as in November 1861, the printings {{have been}} done in Athens from the same seven <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> sent, by Désiré-Albert Barre to the Greek postal {{administration}} during the summer 1861.|$|R
2500|$|Then he {{manufactured}} {{also the}} seven <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> {{of the first}} seven values of the [...] "large Hermes head", using the method developed in 1858/1859: the [...] "direct striking in the coining press" [...] method.|$|R

All further printings took place in Athens and the stamps remained in use until the introduction of the Small Hermes heads in 1886-1888.|$|R
25|$|From {{the same}} die used in 1861 {{to build the}} <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> of the first seven values, Désiré-Albert Barre has created the plates for the 30 lepta (brown) and the 60 lepta (green) {{necessary}} for the international mail.|$|R
25|$|Désiré-Albert Barre {{started by}} {{engraving}} the necessary dies for the manufacturing of the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates.</b> As an engraver and to validate his work, he printed {{four types of}} die-proofs, two types of progressive die-proofs and two types of final die-proofs.|$|R
25|$|The {{drawing of}} the mock-up, the {{engraving}} of the dies {{as well as the}} manufacturing of the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> of the first seven values have been realised between July 1860 and September 1861 by the Chief Engraver of the Paris Mint: Désiré-Albert Barre (1818–1878).|$|R
2500|$|Unlike {{the seven}} first <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> {{realised}} in 1861 with the [...] "direct striking in the coining press" [...] method, these two new plates have been manufactured, {{under the supervision}} of Désiré-Albert Barre, with the [...] "Galvanoplasty-type" [...] method, by the company: Charles-Dierrey, 6 & 12, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs in Paris.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875, {{following}} Greece {{entrance to}} the Union Générale des Postes (U.G.P.), ancestor of the Union postale universelle (U.P.U.), the Greek postal administration launched two new values (30 & 60 Lepta [...] ).From the same die used in 1861 to build the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> of the first seven values, Désiré-Albert Barre has created the plates for the 30 lepta (brown) and the 60 lepta (green) necessary for the international mail.Unlike the seven first <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> realised in 1861 with the [...] "direct striking in the coining press" [...] method, these two new plates have been manufactured, {{under the supervision of}} Désiré-Albert Barre, with the [...] "Galvanoplasty-type" [...] method, by the company: Charles-Dierrey, 6 & 12, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs in Paris.These two values have been printed the printer J.

25|$|The {{stocks of}} stamps {{received}} from Paris became empty very quickly, {{in particular in}} the main post offices (Athens, Piraeus, Syros or Patras...), though starting the month of November 1861, the Greek postal administration was obliged to start to use the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> received from Paris, in order to print its own first sheets of stamps.|$|R
5000|$|As the Paris {{printing}}s of 1861, this printing is very fine. These two new values do {{not have}} any [...] "control number" [...] on their back.

2500|$|It exists {{the same}} type of [...] "small problems" [...] on some French {{classical}} stamps build {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, in the same French Mint, under the responsibility of the Chief Engravers: Jacques-Jean Barre , then his son, Désiré-Albert Barre, [...] who has also realised the dies and the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> of the [...] "large Hermes head" [...] of Greece.|$|R
5000|$|The nine {{values of}} the [...] "large Hermes head" [...] have been printed from the same nine <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> (one per value) during {{more than twenty years}} (from 1861 to 1882).If the final {{printing}} is dated in 1882, the stamps of the [...] "large Hermes head" [...] stayed in circulation up to 1886 and were then replaced by the new type of stamp: the [...] "small Hermes head".|$|R
2500|$|The nine {{values of}} the stamps of the [...] "large Hermes head" [...] are printed during {{more than twenty years}} (from 1861 to 1882) from the same nine <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> and stayed in {{circulation}} for 25 years (from 1861 to 1886) before to be used again, overprinted, in 1900/1901. The first set was issued on October 1, 1861. It consisted of seven denominations (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 lepta). The 30 and 60 lepta stamps were introduced in 1876.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second type}} of the Greek posts is also with the Hermes effigy. It is called the [...] "small Hermes head" [...] and has been issued from 1886 to 1899.They depict Hermes in profile, but with a smaller head and a rounder helmet. The design was by Henri Hendrickx (1817-1894) and it was {{engraved}} by Albert Doms, Atelier de Timbre, Belgium.The <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> counted 300 stamps, sub-divided in six panels of 50 stamps (5 × 10) mounted in two columns of three rows.|$|R
5000|$|The nine {{values of}} the stamps of the [...] "large Hermes head" [...] are printed during {{more than twenty years}} (from 1861 to 1882) from the same nine <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> and stayed in {{circulation}} for 25 years (from 1861 to 1886) before to be used again, overprinted, in 1900/1901. The first set was issued on October 1, 1861. It consisted of seven denominations (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 lepta). The 30 and 60 lepta stamps were introduced in 1876.|$|R
5000|$|The last printings {{done from}} 1875 to 1882 are {{remarkable}} by their paper of cream colour, very easily recognisable {{by looking at}} the back of the stamp.The <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> have not been cleaned for several years, the printing is more and more heavy.After fifteen years of usage, the [...] "control numbers" [...] plates is giving very thick figures without any distinction between the downstrokes and the upstrokes.A very large number of [...] "control numbers" [...] errors is existing in this issue. The [...] "control numbers" [...] are disappearing in 1880 for the last two issues.|$|R
5000|$|Indeed, these breaks are not {{appearing}} on the progressive and final proofs (to {{the exception of the}} only numeral proof known today and which have been realised {{at the end of the}} process).It exists the same type of [...] "small problems" [...] on some French classical stamps build in the middle of the 19th century, in the same French Mint, under the responsibility of the Chief Engravers: Jacques-Jean Barre , then his son, Désiré-Albert Barre, who has also realised the dies and the <b>typographic</b> <b>plates</b> of the [...] "large Hermes head" [...] of Greece.|$|R

Thus, the result was disappointing, {{the background of the}} medallion was not uniform anymore, the Hermes head was very often circled by a whitish halo and the four spandrels were also often [...] "unclear". The shadow lines of the cheek and the nape are now continued and thicker than on the Paris printings.|$|R
