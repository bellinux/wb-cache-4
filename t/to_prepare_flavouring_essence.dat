5000|$|Lemon myrtle {{is one of}} {{the well}} known bushfood {{flavours}} and is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Queen of the lemon herbs". The leaf is often used as dried flakes, or {{in the form of an}} encapsulated <b>flavour</b> <b>essence</b> for enhanced shelf-life. It has a range of uses, such as lemon myrtle flakes in shortbread; flavouring in pasta; whole leaf with baked fish; infused in macadamia or vegetable oils; and made into tea, including tea blends. It can also be used as a lemon flavour replacement in milk-based foods, such as cheesecake, lemon flavoured ice-cream and sorbet without the curdling problem associated with lemon fruit acidity.|$|R

The same name is given to a <b>flavouring</b> <b>essence</b> resembling bitter almonds, and also to a light biscuit.

As {{for the effort}} involved in the materials development, {{in addition to the}} ALS findings already mentioned (ALS, 1998), Rumble (2001, p. 79) reviews a study by Sparkes (1984, p. 219) who states that an academic needs between 2 to 10  h <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a conference, 1 to 10  h <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a small group session, 3 to 10  h <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a video recording, 50 to 100  h <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a text, around 100  h <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a live TV session, 200  h <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> a tutorial and about 300  h <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> an interactive software, not counting the time of the technical staff supporting the process. Many faculty would agree that these figures are not far from current ones, being the expertise of the academic and the possibility of repurposing available resources what makes the difference. Rumble points out that one way of keeping production costs within an acceptable range is by using an author-editor model with advisors supporting the author, rather than having permanent staff in charge of producing materials. He also states (p. 80) that because the quality of materials is critical, to achieve cost-efficiency, it is better to seek savings in recurrent costs such as course promotion.|$|R
