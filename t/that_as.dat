5|$|A cap copying the French Kepi was the {{prescribed}} headgear {{for all three}} branches of the land service, adorned with the various branch of service colors, but Confederates preferred the slouch hat and surviving photographs show <b>that</b> <b>as</b> many or more men wore some type of slouch hat than wore {{the prescribed}} cap, especially as the War progressed.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{relativistic}} effect is <b>that</b> <b>as</b> atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result}} of the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there is}} a {{relative}} absence of objects with semi-major axes below 39 AU that cannot apparently {{be explained by the}} present resonances. The currently accepted hypothesis for the cause of this is <b>that</b> <b>as</b> Neptune migrated outward, unstable orbital resonances moved gradually through this region, and thus any objects within it were swept up, or gravitationally ejected from it.|$|E

He confronts Quinn, who confesses. To prevent her from being suspended, Will lies to Figgins that no culprit has been found, but convinces him <b>that</b> <b>as</b> no new lists have been posted, the matter should be dropped.|$|E
5|$|All {{candidate}} theories {{still have}} major formal and conceptual problems to overcome. They also face the common problem <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> yet, {{there is no}} way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would enable it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E

5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a scientist she would normally share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of her husband's election, some sources {{anticipated}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans. Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week, but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.|$|E

5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} <b>that</b> <b>as</b> the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent {{that with the}} Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue <b>that</b> <b>as</b> only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it would hardly be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|Burger King {{was founded}} in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King by Keith J. Kramer and his wife's uncle, Matthew Burns. Their first stores were centred around a piece of {{equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler, which was very effective at cooking burgers. It proved so successful <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> they grew through franchising, they required all of their franchises to carry the device.|$|E
