50|$|Eight MiGs came at {{us out of}} the sun. I did not {{see them}} at first, and my No. 4, 'Smoo' Ellis, gave a break when he noticed tracer {{streaming}} past his fuselage.We all turned towards the MiGs and commenced a 'scissors'. It soon became apparent that four MiGs were after each section of two Furies, but by continuing our break turns, we presented impossible targets. They made no attempt to bracket us. One MiG came at me head on. I saw his heavy <b>tracer</b> <b>shells.</b> I fired a burst, then he flashed past me. I believe Carl got some hits on him too. This aircraft then broke away, and went head on to my Nos 3 and 4, Lieutenant Pete Davies and 'Smoo' Ellis. They were seen to get good hits on one who broke away with smoke coming from him.|$|R
50|$|Just at {{this time}} a {{training}} flight of Fw 190s from JG 26 was airborne {{to the north of}} Amiens. It was redirected to investigate a raid heading towards them. Leading the German formation was Oberleutnant Waldemar Radener, who ordered his men to drop below the cloud layer to look for the raiders. At 12.04 hours Radener and Feldwebel Wilhelm Mayer descended out of the cloud layer and spotted several Mosquitos and Typhoons beneath them. Radener quickly slipped unseen behind the Typhoon of Flying Officer Renaud of 174 Squadron and shot it down without the other RAF pilots even noticing. Mayer, meanwhile, slipped in behind six Mosquitos below him and attacked the last aircraft in the formation. Pickard apparently saw the <b>tracer</b> <b>shells</b> fly past him as he immediately put his Mosquito into a hard banking turn to the left. Meyer followed. Regaining a firing position, he let go with a second burst. This time the rear of Pickard's wooden fuselage was caught in a stream of cannon shells. The fuselage shattered and the tail section broke clean away, causing the Mosquito to flip over onto its back and crash into the ground. The combat was over less than a minute after Meyer had broken cloud cover.|$|R
5000|$|Leixner was an {{engaging}} writer. He had {{a doctorate in}} German literature from the University of Graz, with a thesis entitled Mohammed in German Poetry. [...] Leixner was himself a poet, and his descriptions of battle are almost blank verse. Here he writes of the fighting at Wegierska Gorka in Poland:"We capture another height. For a moment the view astounds us: Blue twilight has descended on the Sola Valley, so soft and elegant, as though ignorant of the death and destruction below. The twilight battles the red glow of innumerable gun barrels, eerily illuminated by the azure hour. <b>Tracer</b> <b>shells</b> race in thick, endless streams toward the concrete bunkers. The tracers spin an arrow-like web of threads into a glowing green net of devastation over Wegierska Gorka. A thousand fire-spitting steel pipes become a sinister organ blaring out an unsettling fugue of war."Leixner writes with ironic wit: [...] "Our motorized advance division roars through Jelesnia. We pass the village church, where fifty colorfully dressed town virgins cower, as though {{in front of the}} big bad wolf; little lambs shaking fearfully {{in the presence of the}} high and mighty. With a horrified conspiratorial glance one moves her hand in greeting, while another grasps a bowl of holy water, with which German iniquity can be washed away. Otherwise, heaven forfend, we might avail ourselves of the pious local girls, for whom we have not the slightest feeling or interest. A primitively comic picture: we shake with laughter kilometers further on."Leixner is especially talented at portraying grim soldier humor:“Is that the Polish border, Herr Lieutenant?” asks a rifleman. “It was the Polish border,” is the answer.|$|R
5000|$|The two {{opposing}} task forces clashed in the Battle of Tassafaronga. American destroyers launched torpedoes {{as the enemy}} range came within 5 mi of Pensacola′s cruiser formation. Now gun flashes, <b>tracers,</b> and star <b>shell</b> candles stained the inky darkness. —hit many times—was afire and exploding. [...] took two torpedo hits that blasted her bow downward like an immense scoop and left her forecastle deck awash, but she continued to fight on. [...] closed on Minneapolis, {{and ran into the}} track of a torpedo that ripped off the forward part of the warship.|$|R
50|$|The guns firing {{together}} {{are capable of}} firing up to 210-240 fragmentation and armour-piercing <b>tracer</b> (AP-T) <b>shells</b> per minute, with a practical rate of fire of between 100 and 140 rounds per minute. Muzzle velocity is 1,000 m/s. Each clip has 4 rounds, each of which weighs 6.6 kg; the charge in each round consists of 1.2 kg of 11/7 nitrocellulose powder, a projectile weighs 2.8 kg. Maximum horizontal range is 12 km (with an effective range against ground targets of up to 4 km / 2.5 miles. Maximum vertical range is 8.8 km with a maximum effective vertical range of 4.5 km / 14,750 ft). Fragmentation rounds have a safety-destructor which activates between 12 and 16 seconds after being fired to ensure the shells won't fall back to ground, so the maximum slant range of anti-aircraft fire is 6.5-7 km. BR-281 armour-piercing rounds are able to penetrate 110 mm armour at 500 m or 70 mm armour at 2,000 m (at 90° impact angle).|$|R
5000|$|At 1908 on 11 June, the {{transport}} - at general quarters and [...] "on {{the lookout for}} low-flying bogies" [...] - sighted a [...] "Jill" [...] or [...] "Sonia" [...] off her port side at 1,500 feet. The transport {{and all of the}} other ships in the area immediately opened fire, [...] "engulfing the plane and vicinity with <b>tracer</b> fire and <b>shell</b> bursts." [...] The plane roared past William Ward Burrows, Bowditch, an LSD, and a Liberty ship, making a banking turn over the nearby Katsuren Hanto peninsula, and crashed at 1911, about 700 yards astern of Burrows.|$|R
50|$|The {{first issue}} was ammunition. Before the war it was {{recognised}} that ammunition needed to explode in the air. Both high explosive (HE) and shrapnel were used, mostly the former. Airburst fuses were either igniferious (based on a burning fuse) or mechanical (clockwork). Igniferious fuses were not {{well suited for}} anti-aircraft use. The fuse length was determined by time of flight, but the burning rate of the gunpowder was affected by altitude. The British pom-poms had only contact-fused ammunition. Zeppelins, being hydrogen-filled balloons, were targets for incendiary shells and the British introduced these with airburst fuses, both shrapnel type-forward projection of incendiary 'pot' and base ejection of an incendiary stream. The British also fitted <b>tracers</b> to their <b>shells</b> for use at night. Smoke shells were also available for some AA guns, these bursts were used as targets during training.|$|R
50|$|The first armor-piercing round was the 6.32 kg M72 AP-T, a plain {{uncapped}} armor-piercing round whose performance {{dropped off}} as range increased due to poor aerodynamics. The M72 {{was replaced by}} the 6.63 kg (14.62 lb) M61 armor-piercing capped ballistic capped high explosive with <b>tracer</b> (APCBC-HE-T) <b>shell.</b> The blunt armor-piercing cap, made of a softer metal, helped to prevent shell shatter at higher velocities and against sloped and face-hardened armor. The aerodynamic ballistic cap acted as a windscreen and improved ballistic performance, maintained velocity, and hence increased penetration at longer ranges. Once the projectile had penetrated the target, a small explosive charge contained in a cavity {{at the base of the}} shell would detonate, shattering the shell and increasing damage inside the enemy vehicle. The tracer helped in the aiming of a second shot. In practice, the majority of M61 rounds were shipped without the explosive filler. The M61A1 used an improved method of attaching the ballistic cap to the shell. The M61 had a muzzle velocity of 617 m/s (2024.28 ft/s) and was credited with the ability to penetrate 81 mm of rolled homogeneous armor plate at 0° from vertical at 500 yards range, which was a quite acceptable performance by the standards of 1942. This ammunition type proved lethal to the Panzer III and IV (up to Ausf. F2), as these tanks were protected by a maximum of 50 mm of face-hardened armor with little slope, which the 75 mm M3 with M61 was capable of penetrating from at least 1500 m. However, in March 1942, the Germans introduced the Ausf. G verson of the Panzer IV, which was armed with the 48-caliber long KwK 40 gun, and had frontal hull armour increased to 80 mm - however, its turret and gun mantlet retained their 50 mm thickness. This was somewhat compensated by the M4 Sherman's improved armor over the earlier M3 Lee making up for the 75mm M3's diminishing battlefield dominance; Wa Pruef 1 estimated that the M4's glacis was impenetrable to the KwK 40 when standing at a 30-degree side angle, while the 75 mm M3 could penetrate the Ausf G's hull from 100 m in the same situation.|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} processes acting over an intertidal flat (Hythe, UK) {{located in}} Southampton Water, Hampshire, UK are investigated {{on the basis}} of hydrodynamic, morphological and sediment transport field measurements. Bed level changes, patterns of suspended sediment transport and shell movement over the tidal flats were examined in order to identify sediment transport pathways and salt marsh–mudflat morphological changes. Overall, sediment transport patterns at Hythe can be described in terms of suspended sediment and bedload-shell transport. The hydrodynamic complexity of the tidal flow over the flats determines the patterns of suspended sediments transport. During the young flood phase, tidal currents present a SW orientation (shoreward). About 1 h into the flood, a change occurs and the currents start flowing in a SE direction (estuary mouthward). This veering of the tidal current controls the hydrodynamic pattern over the mudflat inducing sediment transport towards the estuary mouth. Conversely, <b>shell</b> <b>tracer</b> experiment showed a net landward movement. Shells are transported over the mudflat, deposited {{at the base of the}} cliff, and eventually transported over the salt marsh where they form extensive chernier deposits. Shell transport rates can reach up to 0. 7 m/tide over the upper mudflat. Shell movement over the salt marsh (on cheniers) occurred only during storms (up to 3 m in a storm event). Shell-induced erosion can become an important parameter on morphological changes of a coastal area. Shell transport and deposition over the salt marsh surface can contribute to vegetation deterioration, as shell deposits migrate over the marsh surface. As a result, the seaward limit of the salt marsh showed deteriorated vegetation, which leads to scouring and consequent surface lowering. In terms of bed level changes, no seasonal pattern was observed. A relationship between mudflat bed erosion and cliff retreat is suggested. During periods of high cliff erosion there was a tendency for the mudflats to be stable and, conversely, mudflat bed erosion was greatest when cliff retreat rates were lowest. Hence, morphological characteristics of Hythe intertidal area appear to be controlled by a combination of prevailing hydrodynamic conditions and shell transport over the salt marsh. <br/...|$|R
