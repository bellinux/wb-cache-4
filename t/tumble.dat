5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and <b>tumble</b> downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E

40|$|Some mutants {{defective}} in chemotaxis show incessant <b>tumbling</b> {{behavior and}} are called <b>tumbling</b> mutants. Previously described <b>tumbling</b> mutations lie in two genes, cheB and cheZ (41. 5 min on Escherichia coli map). Genetic analysis of various <b>tumbling</b> mutants, however, revealed that two more genetic loci, cheC (43 min) and cheE (99. 2 min), could also mutate to produce <b>tumbling</b> mutants. The genetic map around cheC was revised: his flaP flaQ flaR flbD flaA (= cheC) flaE. flbD {{is a new}} gene. When cells were starved for methionine, the <b>tumbling</b> mutants changed their swimming behavior depending on the che gene mutated. cheZ mutants, like wild-type bacteria, ceased <b>tumbling</b> shortly after removal of methionine. The <b>tumbling</b> of cheB or cheE mutants was depressed after prolonged methionine starvation {{in the presence of}} a constant level of an attractant. cheC <b>tumbling</b> mutants appeared unique in that they did not cease <b>tumbling</b> even when cells were deprived of methionine. By contrast, arsenate treatment of the <b>tumbling</b> mutants resulted in smooth swimming of the cells in every case. These results suggest that two different processes are involved in regulation of tumbling; one requiring methionine and the other requiring some phosphorylated compound...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Effects {{of breast}} piece weight (thickness) on yield after <b>tumbling</b> {{in water and}} aqueous {{solutions}} of acetic acid, NaCl, and soybean oil for 10 and 20 min were determined. Thickness of the piece had no affect on yield when the samples were <b>tumbled</b> in water but addition of acetic acid, NaCl, or oil to the <b>tumbling</b> solution resulted in significant (P<. 05) correlations in many cases. Increased sample thickness resulted in smaller cooking loss in those samples <b>tumbled</b> in 10 % acetic acid,. 5 and 1 % NaCl, or 5 and 10 % soybean oil. This resulted in improved net yield as sample weight increased. Addition of NaCl (. 5 or 1. 0 %), acetic acid (5 or 10 %), or soybean oil (5 or 10 %) to the <b>tumbling</b> solution did not affect peak values but addition of 5 or 10 % soybean oil reduced shear values in the samples after 10 min <b>tumbling.</b> Oil in the solution had no affect after <b>tumbling</b> for 20 min. Increasing the <b>tumbling</b> time from 10 to 20 min produced lower peak values and shear values in samples <b>tumbled</b> in water, NaCl, and oil. Combination of. 5 % NaCl, 5 % acetic acid, and 5 % soybean oil to produce various <b>tumbling</b> solutions resulted in no changes in peak values or shear values and when <b>tumbling</b> time was increased from 10 to 20 min, shear parameters were not reduced.

5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and <b>tumble</b> down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, <b>tumble</b> dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
40|$|Results from an {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} low-speed <b>tumbling</b> characteristics of twelve generic flying-wing models are summarized. There is a concern that airplanes with flying-wing planforms could inadvertently enter an out-of-control <b>tumbling</b> motion under certain conditions. The objectives of this investigation were to: 1) identify the geometric and mass-related parameters that cause flying wings {{to be capable of}} sustained <b>tumbling,</b> 2) analyze some of the driving mechanisms that cause <b>tumbling,</b> and 3) determine the feasibility of using computer simulations to predict the <b>tumbling</b> characteristics of flying wings. Free-tumble and free-to-pitch tests were conducted with dynamically-scaled, generic flying wing models. The use of computer simulations as a predictive tool for <b>tumbling</b> was explored. Results indicated that center-of-gravity location, mass distribution, and geometric aspect ratio strongly affected the <b>tumbling</b> characteristics of the models tested and that positive static stability did not necessarily preclude <b>tumbling.</b> The magnitude of dynamic effects were found to be of the same order as static effects for the models undergoing autorotation-in-pitch. The simulations indicated that the dynamic terms in the equations of motion used to predict <b>tumbling</b> must be obtained using experimental methods that account for the large amplitude/high pitch-rate environment that characterizes <b>tumbling...</b>|$|R

However, histidine-starved cheZs hisF strains were not defective in flagellar function or the <b>tumbling</b> mechanism since freshly starved auxotrophs <b>tumbled</b> {{in response to a}} variety of repellents. <b>Tumbling</b> in histidine-starved S. typhimurium could be restored in 13 s by addition of adenine or in 4 min by addition of histidine.

The adenosine 5 '-triphosphate concentration dropped rapidly during the course of starvation, falling to less than 5 % of the initial level as the cells ceased <b>tumbling</b> entirely. The change to smooth motility was prevented by 2 -thiazolealanine, which inhibits phosphoribosyltransferase, thereby preventing adenine depletion during histidine starvation.

The midfielder won a challenge with Heskey in the 17th minute and sent the ball in the direction of Fredrik Ljungberg, who in turn passed it to Henry. The Frenchman went around Westerveld and shot the ball goalwards, which was cleared off the line by Stéphane Henchoz. Television replays later showed the ball hitting Henchoz's arm before going wide; although Henry appealed for a penalty, it was turned down as the incident was missed by both the referee and his assistant. Owen came close to scoring in the 20th minute, but for his shot to be blocked by Martin Keown. Arsenal continued to find the best openings, but struggled to split open the Liverpool defence.
