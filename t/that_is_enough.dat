25|$|Periodically, {{velocities}} {{may increase}} dramatically or even reverse due to atmospheric storms raising the local surface eddy kinetic energy, which gets partially transmitted down to abyssal depths in episodes called benthic storms. These velocities may reach magnitudes well above 40cm/s and vary significantly {{depending on the}} specific location. At the lower continental rise, south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and at the lower slope around the Faeroe Islands these velocities may reach up to 73cm/s and 75cm/s, respectively. Bottom-current flow velocities have been measured as high as 300cm/s in the Strait of Gibraltar. These benthic storms occur only 5 to 10 times per year and usually last between 3 and 5 days, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> to heavily erode benthic sediment and keep the finer grains in suspension even after flow velocities return to normal and the bedload has been deposited. During benthic storms, the eroded sediment may be transported over thousands of kilometers and deposited rather quickly (i.e. ~1.5cm/month) once the storm wanes. However, the net sedimentation rate over thousands of years may be much smaller (i.e. ~5.5cm/year) due to the intense periods of erosion during benthic storms.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of Talk That Talk, Giovanny Caquias of CultureBlues placed the song in a [...] "slut-core quartet" [...] {{alongside}} [...] "Cockiness (Love It)", [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] and [...] "Watch n' Learn". He explained that [...] "Roc Me Out" [...] "is more developed than the others, but still much too mediocre to become Rihanna's twelfth number-one single." [...] Reem Buhazza of The National wrote that [...] "Roc Me Out" [...] together with [...] "You da One" [...] and [...] "Talk That Talk" [...] are [...] "the winning combination of made-for-radio pop sensibility". Laurence Green from MusicOMH labeled the track as [...] "a surprising late-album standout". Edward Keeble from Gigwise called [...] "Roc Me Out a [...] "vibrant track" [...] {{and concluded that the}} co-production by Rob Swire of Pendulum is [...] "evident on all facets of it". Tuyet Nguyen of The A.V. Club criticized the song by describing it as [...] "almost laughable". However, he also explained that [...] "Rihanna is a performer, not a songwriter", and what she sings is [...] "less relevant than what she sells: a provocation <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> to seem empowering, but not so radical that it’s alienating." [...] Maz Halima from Flavour Magazine was unfavorable of the song in her album review of Talk That Talk, stating that when she heard it, she was [...] "a bit [...] off" [...] because of its similar sound to Rihanna's single [...] "Rude Boy".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{enforced}} the Tenure of Office Act, signed {{earlier by}} President Monroe in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized {{the president to}} remove and appoint political party associates. Jackson believed that a rotation in office was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will. Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was [...] "a leading principle in the republican creed". Jackson noted, [...] "In a country where offices are created solely {{for the benefit of}} the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another." [...] Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes. Jackson, however, did use his image and presidential power to award loyal Democrats by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership Jackson stated [...] "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> ... <b>enough</b> for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the {{day after}} the wedding, Rev. Charles Smith, District Superintendent of the Northern California District of the Church of the Nazarene, {{contacted}} Norris and advised him that he had no right under Nazarene polity to conduct the wedding of a person who had divorced unless adultery was the grounds, and that he would [...] "unfrock him for marrying a person divorced on grounds outside those recognized by the church". Norris was confident he would be exonerated after Nazarene authorities investigated the situation. On Monday, January 28, 1929, Norris met with Wedge in the bridal suite on the seventh floor of the Hotel Oakland, and quarreled about the wedding. Norris initially refused to file the paperwork for the wedding, as he claimed Wedge had lied to him about the marital status of Holloway, creating the impression that she was a widow. After Wedge threatened to file a mandamus suit against him, Norris filed the paperwork at the hall of records. Wedge indicated that: [...] "To save his own ecclesiastical hide, Norris would like to get me out on a limb and then saw the limb off". Wedge insisted that even if the church did not recognize the legality of his wedding, that [...] "we are married in the eyes of God and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>enough</b> to satisfy me". Wedge also indicated that while he expected never to be given a pastorate again, that {{he had no intention of}} resigning from the church: [...] "They may keep me from preaching, but they won't kick me out of the church". Wedge planned to train and manage his son, who was a promising amateur boxer, but on January 30, 1929, Hugh informed his father that he had decided not to sign a contract with him, and to remain in high school and then work in a foundry. After this argument with his son, Wedge indicated that he lost control and contemplated throwing himself out of his hotel window to spare his bride anymore humiliation.|$|E
