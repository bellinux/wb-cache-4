The break was not total, though, since Pascu continued to appear on Animat Planet. In a 2007 interview, reflecting on that show's impact, he stated, [...] "I'm not much of a fan of political humor. I simply like the impromptu kind of humor [...] If [...] happens to be political, it is because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have to do in this series." [...] In 2012, he asserted that his break with political humor was definitive, and against the consensus in Divertis—in 2007, Pascu noted there was already a disagreement between him and Toni Grecu. Shortly after his departure, a conflict between Grecu and the other Divertis actors broke Divertis into competing halves.|$|E
500|$|In March 1930, Garrett {{was posted}} as adjutant/quartermaster to the 3rd Light Horse Regiment at Mount Gambier, South Australia. As a speaker at Mount Gambier's Anzac Day commemorations on 25 April 1934, he was {{reported}} as {{warning of the}} poor state of Australia's preparedness for war, admonishing: [...] "We shall {{not have the time}} that we had before the last war, and we shall not be fighting for our homes thousands of miles away. We shall be fighting at our own back door. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have to prepare for." [...] In August that year he was transferred to the 4th Light Horse Regiment at Warrnambool, Victoria, as adjutant/quartermaster. Garrett was posted to the staff of Army Headquarters, Melbourne, in March 1936, and departed for England in November the following year to attend the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to major in July 1938, and returned to Australia upon the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E

[...] Results fluctuated with impressive victories over the likes of Everton, Bolton and Sunderland being mixed with heavy defeats to Leeds United, Coventry City and West Ham United. [...] Eventually finishing fifth (out of ten teams) in their division, manager John Pemberton described the season as [...] "another successful one for everyone associated with the Academy.

One can play with the processes that might occur in the future, but one is really always writing about the present because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> know. It's largely an image of television as I know it". Sean Day-Lewis, writing in The Daily Telegraph, hailed the programme as a [...] "highly original play written with great force and making as many valid points {{about the dangers of}} the future as any science fiction I can remember—including 1984!". The Year of the Sex Olympics was watched by 1.5 million viewers. Audience Research Report indicated that many viewers found the play impenetrable. It was repeated on BBC1 in 1970 with 15 minutes cut from the running time, as part of The Wednesday Play strand.|$|E
500|$|The team {{held two}} Organized Team Activities (OTAs) {{prior to the}} draft, in {{addition}} to 12 throughout May and June. The OTAs were voluntary, however, most players did attend.

A week prior {{to the end of}} OTAs Mike Tomlin said he was happy with the team's progress during the sessions. Also stating, “We are having a productive off-season and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are here for. We are here to get better individually and collectively and I think we are doing that.” Limas Sweed experimented on special teams play for the first time ever, with a concentration in punt blocking. On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E

His first major problem in this sphere was in 1961 when on the orders of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall was erected to stop East Germans escaping to West Germany via West Berlin. Home wrote to his American counterpart, Dean Rusk, [...] "The prevention of East Berliners getting into West Berlin has never been a casus belli for us. We are concerned with Western access to Berlin and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> must maintain." [...] The governments of West Germany, Britain and the US quickly reached agreement on their joint negotiating position; it remained to persuade President de Gaulle of France to align himself with the allies. During their discussions Macmillan commented that de Gaulle showed [...] "all the rigidity of a poker without its occasional warmth". An agreement was reached, and the allies tacitly recognised that the wall was going to remain in place. The Soviets for their part did not seek to cut off allied access to West Berlin through East German territory.|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but I think he can become a central striker again. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> will try to develop together." ...|$|E
