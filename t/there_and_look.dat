500|$|Boulter {{starred in}} two films in 2008, Daylight Robbery by filmmaker Paris Leonti, and Donkey Punch {{directed}} by Olly Blackburn. Boulter portrayed a character named [...] "Sean" [...] in Donkey Punch, who tags along with character [...] "Josh" [...] as the [...] "quiet brother ... who hits {{it off with}} Tammi". Boulter guest starred on a two-part episode arc [...] "Wounds" [...] in May 2008 of the television series Waking the Dead as character [...] "Jimmy Dearden". He appeared on the television series Survivors as [...] "Neil" [...] in November 2008. He had a recurring role in ten episodes of the television series Casualty in 2010, as [...] "Kieron Fletcher". He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor is a strange experience. Pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking you through procedures and giving you the confidence to stand <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> like you know what you're doing." [...] Boulter starred in the 2011 film Mercenaries directed by Paris Leonti.|$|E
500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an emotionally disturbed girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

60|$|She checked herself <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> suspiciously at {{the door}} of Mr. Gracedieu's room.|$|R
60|$|Standing <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> up {{into his}} eyes, {{there was no other}} answer for her to make.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps come, {{perhaps not}} come; perhaps scout up valley first see {{if some of}} us <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> for horses. Perhaps some come up path; but crawl up slow, not know whether {{look-out}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't got {{the grit}} to go <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at {{a paper in}} cold blood," [...] he told Anne. [...] "I'm just going to wait until {{somebody}} comes and tells me suddenly whether I've passed or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you indeed? O I {{wish you}} had come with mamma! So Elliot has been provoking, and told you," [...] she added, {{stopping}} <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> significant.|$|R
5000|$|The {{surveyor}} first {{identified a}} central viewpoint, the umbilicus agri or umbilicus soli. He then {{took up his}} position <b>there</b> <b>and,</b> <b>looking</b> towards the west, defined the territory with the following names: ...|$|R
60|$|He watched {{where it}} stopped, <b>and</b> went <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked.</b> But {{it must have}} fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last {{repetition}} was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know, you know. Not {{much good}} lugging the prefects into it, is there? I mean, apart from {{everything}} else, {{not much of}} a catch for me, would it be, having to sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> on. I'm a prefect, too, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He died {{six months}} ago,' said the rich brother, 'and he left you, as your portion, the old wooden chest {{that stands in}} the loft. You had better go <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> for it; I have no more time to waste.' And he went his way.|$|E
60|$|Charlie Ward. Is it die and {{all that}} porter about? Well! you have done enough praying, go over <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> for the basket. Who was it set him praying, I wonder? I am {{thinking}} {{it is the first}} prayer he ever said in his life.|$|E
60|$|Jon screwed his {{features}} into a scowl. They got in--with two other beasts!--oh! heaven! He tipped the porter unnaturally, in his confusion. The brute deserved nothing for {{putting them in}} <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> {{as if he knew}} all about it into the bargain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, then," [...] said Tom, [...] "I {{shall have}} playfellows at last," [...] and he swam {{on to the}} buoy, and got upon it (for he was quite out of breath) <b>and</b> sat <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> round for water-babies: but there were none to be seen.|$|R
50|$|The {{club was}} open from Wednesday to Saturday, 11 pm till 4 am. Area {{attracted}} many celebrities.

6000|$|A {{burst of}} {{laughter}} filled {{the rear of}} the building when one of Hudson's supporters pulled him down by main force, and held him fast, observing, [...] "You just sit right <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> wise instead of talking too much. I guess you've said enough already to mix everything up." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Goodman didn't answer 'im because 'e was {{joining in}} the chorus with one side of 'is mouth and keeping 'is cigar alight with the other. He just nodded at 'im; but 'e looked so 'appy that Sam {{felt it was a}} {{pleasure}} to sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at 'im.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me think," [...] said Mr. George. Then after a moment's reflection, he added, [...] "I {{should like}} to have you take a sheet of paper, and draw this little table up to the window, and take your seat <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> out, and {{whenever}} you see any thing remarkable, write down what {{it is on the}} paper." ...|$|E
60|$|As Bold walked silently {{over the}} lawn, Mr Harding did {{not at first}} {{perceive}} him, and continued to draw his bow slowly across the plaintive wires; but he soon found from his audience that some stranger was <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> up, began to welcome his young friend with frank hospitality.|$|R
60|$|The {{country people}} {{were filled with}} {{surprise}} when they saw {{a child in the}} mill-house, and wondered where it came from; but the miller would answer no questions, and as year after year passed away they forgot to enquire how the child came <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> upon her as the miller's own daughter.|$|R
6000|$|Well, I warn't long {{making him}} {{understand}} I warn't dead. I was ever {{so glad to}} see Jim. I warn't lonesome now. I told him I warn't afraid of HIM telling the people where I was. I talked along, but he only set <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at me; never said nothing. Then I says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at this bread. I {{sit here}} and look at you, and I hold this bread. And you stop still, and I stop still, while I count three. Now then--uno--" [...] the dog couldn't bear these numerals, with their awful slowness. He {{snatched}} desperately. The man yelled and lost the bread, the dog, gulping, turned to creep away.|$|E
6000|$|... "And then," [...] {{continued}} Lumley, not {{noticing the}} interruption, [...] "if you do marry her {{you can never}} more return to the civilised world, for she is utterly ignorant of its ways, and would feel so ill at ease <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> so much out of place, {{that you would be}} obliged to take to the woods again, and live and die there--and--what would your father say to that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Neither bride nor groom had {{anything}} particular {{to do with}} the sea, yet that wedding might have easily been mistaken for a fisherman's wedding-- as well as a semi-public one, so numerous were the salts--young and old--who attended it; some with invitation, and others without. You see, the ceremony being performed in the old parish church, any one who chose had a right to be <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> on.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{learning}} that her adoptive mother has written information about Lauren's adoption in a diary that she {{stored in the}} attic, Lauren discreetly goes <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> through the diary, where she finds that she was adopted from Marchfield Adoption Agency in Vermont, run by Taylor Tarsen; also noted down is the name [...] "Sonia Holtwood".|$|R
60|$|Then Claude must needs {{photograph}} them all, as they sat, {{and group}} them first {{according to his}} fancy; and among his fancies was one, that Valencia should sit as queen, with Headley and the Major at her feet. <b>And</b> Headley lounged <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> into the grass, and thought it well for him could he lie there for ever.|$|R
50|$|Still {{searching for}} X she {{arrives at the}} Eatons Centre {{shopping}} mall where she tries to avoid drawing {{the attention of the}} security guards.

6000|$|... "I'll {{not take}} {{much of your}} time, sir,--not over half an hour at the most," [...] was the reply from Hooker Montgomery. [...] "But all of the {{documents}} and letters and photographs are in my room, on the second floor. Kindly come up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at them." [...] And the man started up the stairs. Dave hesitated for a moment, wondering {{if it would be}} best to go up, and then followed.|$|E
60|$|In this, {{however, they}} were not {{altogether}} confirmed. As they drew nearer and nearer to the place they saw {{in front of the}} buffet, which was apparently closed, one of the iron garden-seats with curly backs that had adorned the gardens, but much longer, running almost the whole length of the frontage. Presumably, it was placed so that visitors might sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at the sea, but one hardly expected to find anyone doing it in such weather.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, peg {{number one}} goes in here, where I have picked a hole between the stones. Then I've made this other log into a mallet, and with two cracks {{there it is}} firm fixed, {{so that you can}} put your weight on it. Now these two go in the same way into the holes above here. So! Now, you see, you can stand up <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> out of that window without asking too much of your toe joint. Try it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It {{came about}} {{by just a}} lot of people saying, 'how come the Sprints and Midgets have a Hall of Fame and the dirt Late Models, which {{obviously}} have ten times more cars, doesn't have one?'" [...] explained Bill Holder. [...] "I got to talking with CJ (Rayburn) and them and everyone was standing <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at me <b>and</b> said, 'why don't you do it?' (laughs)." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{made him}} no answer. She stood <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at him; looked her last entreaty--perhaps her last farewell. His eyes gave her back no {{answering}} glance: they wandered from her mercilessly to the sleeping boy. She turned speechless from the bed. Without {{a look at}} the child--without a word to the two strangers breathlessly watching her--she kept the promise she had given, and in dead silence left the room.|$|R
