40|$|Background and Objectives: Over {{the last}} three decades {{environmental}} pollutions became a more noticeable problem in all around of the world. In many countries, noise pollution as a basic problem has a great importance. Development of the city, increasing of industrial centers, increasing vehicles, other annoying noise resources and also little information about the noise pollution of Tabriz city, has led to the doing of this research. Materials and Methods: Sampling and measuring of noise pressure levels was done 180 times According to <b>the</b> EPA <b>standards,</b> measuring was done simultaneously in two stations(commercial-residential areas), three times a day (morning 7 : 30 - 9 : 30 am, midday 12 : 30 - 14 : 30 pm and night 19 : 00 - 21 : 00 pm) and 30 days in month. Results: Sound pressure level in both stations was higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> and <b>the</b> highest average level with 71. 4 db was recorded in Raste-koche station at midday. Also lowest calculated average value with 68. 5 db was measured in Golbad station at the morning time that is 8. 5 db higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards.</b> Conclusion: Average measured sound pressure level in two stations was higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards.</b> <b>The</b> results show that Tabriz has a noise pollution in commercial and residential - commercial areas. It is suggested that other noise pollution resources identified and the proper management actions for its reduction be done...|$|R

5|$|There {{were two}} unusual {{features}} of the design: {{the first of which}} was the setting of the crank axles at 135°, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> 90° of other locomotive types. This design necessitated four sets of valve gear, and gave rise to eight beats per revolution, rather than the usual four, designed to give a more even draw on the fire and less chance of wheelslip when starting. The second difference was that fire grate was in two sections, the rear portion was horizontal and the front sloped away sharply.|$|E

For most purposes, they discarded their coats and, adopting the Indian traditions, wore their shirts out, rather than tucked in; shirts were also dyed. The 52nd also developed turbans to wear over their standard-issue forage caps. Following the mutiny, regiments returned to the standard red clothing.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} of the other GNP stations, the station {{building}} was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> red glazed terracotta. This was due to planning regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with the other parts of the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first floor level was constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the platform levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.|$|E
5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> of living.
