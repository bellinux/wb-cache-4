5|$|In October 2007, the {{division}} was renamed the 104th Division (Leader Training). This change reflected {{a change in}} {{the division}}'s mission, specifically training officer and non-commissioned officer candidates in <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> fields.|$|E
5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{have the}} option of trading their picks to other teams in {{exchange}} for different picks, players, money, or a combination thereof. It is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. Of the players selected in each draft and throughout its history, East Carolina has had 63 players picked.|$|E

5|$|The {{offensive}} {{began at}} 05:00 with {{the advance of}} ground forces from their assembly areas surrounding <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> operational areas. About 06:35, five squadrons of Luftwaffe bombers, including Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers, began bombing targets within Drvar and Bosanski Petrovac. A total of 440 sorties were flown on 25 May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Troops {{are divided}} into five classes: Scouts, Shocktroopers, Engineers, Lancers and Armored Soldier. Troopers can switch classes by {{changing}} <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> weapon. Changing class does not greatly affect the stats gained while in a previous class. With victory in battle, experience points are awarded to the squad, which are distributed into five different attributes shared by the entire squad, a feature differing from early games' method of distributing to different unit types.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{operational}} doctrine {{developed by the}} RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon {{the effectiveness of their}} individual tactics to reach and successfully attack <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise {{the operational}} lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.|$|E

5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups split off {{and headed for}} <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> targets. By this time, some 15 miles off the Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors {{who refused}} noncombatant service during World War I were imprisoned in {{military}} facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). The government assumed that COs could {{be converted into}} soldiers once they were exposed to life in <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> military camps. Simultaneously the Justice Department was preparing to indict 181 Mennonite leaders for violating the espionage act because of a statement they adopted against performing military service. The draftees' refusal {{to put on a}} uniform or cooperate in any way caused difficulties for both the government and the COs. The treatment received by nearly 2000 of these absolute COs included short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse so severe as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees.|$|E

5|$|Each unit is {{assigned}} a character class, while affects <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> weapon, strengths and weaknesses, and range {{and speed of}} movement on the battlefield. These classes range from axemen and swordsmen to thieves, to mounted units and magic users such as healers. Some characters, such as main protagonist Leif, have unique classes. Classes also naturally evolve {{during the course of}} the story. Mounted units have the option of dismounting their steeds to fight on-foot. Weapons within a unit's selected character class can be freely swapped out for more powerful versions: when mounted units dismount, they swap spears for axes or swords. Weapon effectiveness is governed by the Weapons Triangle: swords are strong against axes, axes against spears, and spears against swords.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, unbeknown {{to their}} commanders and each other, and having lost communications, the seven landing craft {{that had been}} {{reported}} missing made for <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> beaches, determined to press on with the attack. In the end two parties landed, one party consisting of six craft carrying approximately 120 men under Captain R.L Willis landed on the beach opposite Le Petit Berneval {{to the east of}} the battery—Yellow I—while the other, consisting of only one craft of 20 men from No. 6 Troop under Captain Peter Young landed to the west at Yellow II.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional {{floating}} world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.|$|E
5|$|The player {{initially}} must {{enter their}} name into the device, which then displays {{a series of}} past lives the player has lived. The name is converted into its numerological equivalent. Above and below the central chamber are two other areas, called Kether and Malchut respectively, each of which houses a display screen with a mask-like face that provides the player with information about the next task. The motivations of the two organizations represented by the faces are murky, although it becomes clear they are acting in opposition to each other. Both masks refer to the player by <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> number.|$|E
5|$|Whilst outnumbered, the Muslims {{gained the}} early {{initiative}} {{and forced the}} Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a serious mistake was committed by {{a part of the}} Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of Muhammad's orders by the Muslim archers, who left <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan cavalry, led by Meccan war veteran Khalid ibn al-Walid, which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslims further, but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.|$|E

5|$|Yet {{even as the}} Americans were {{attempting}} to clear the tunnels, heavy hand-to-hand fighting broke out above ground and Haldane was later awarded the Silver Star for his actions when he rushed a bunker while under fire armed only with a pistol, {{in order to give}} first aid to a number of wounded soldiers. His courage inspired his men to complete the assault, and ultimately helped ensure the successful evacuation of the casualties and the capture of their objective. That evening the battalions of US 3rd Infantry Brigade had completed searching <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> area of operation, and the following morning they were withdrawn from the operation. The brigade's involvement in Crimp had been limited, losing six killed and 45 wounded, while 22 Viet Cong had been killed. It was subsequently redeployed on Operation Buckskin.|$|E
5|$|Alms {{sent the}} {{captured}} Alliantie back to Britain {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Patrick Tonyn of Stag and gave despatches to the Admiralty to Lieutenant William Huggell of Reunion to deliver. He himself remained at sea with the squadron, completing <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> patrol. British casualties included four killed and 13 wounded on Stag, one killed and three wounded on Reunion and two wounded on Isis. Only Vestal escaped without any damage or casualties. Batavian casualties in the engagement are not known due to the failure of Alms to record Allianties losses in his report to the Admiralty, an omission which James criticises him for. It is known that Argo lost two men killed and 15 wounded in the chase. The surviving Batavian ships remained at anchor in the Eigerøya channel until the spring of 1796 when they successfully returned to the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Although the French {{troops would}} have a higher {{proportion}} of motorised units than their German adversaries, in view of the respective distances to be covered, they could not hope to reach <b>their</b> <b>assigned</b> sector advancing in battle deployment before the enemy did. Their only prospect of beating the Germans to it lay in employing rail transport. This implied they would be vulnerable in the concentration phase, building up their forces near Breda. They needed the Dutch troops in the Peel-Raam Position to delay the Germans for a few extra days to allow a French deployment and entrenchment, but French rapid forces also would provide a security screen. These consisted of the reconnaissance units of the armoured and motorised divisions, equipped with the relatively well-armed Panhard 178 armoured car. These would be concentrated into two task forces named after their commander: the Groupe Beauchesne and the Groupe Lestoquoi.|$|E
