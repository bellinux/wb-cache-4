5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, 100,000 {{copies of}} <b>The</b> <b>Beacon</b> Street Collection had been sold, over three times as many as their first album, No Doubt. These sales were mostly due to the release of Tragic Kingdom, which was {{released}} seven months after <b>The</b> <b>Beacon</b> Street Collection in October 1995. Tragic Kingdom was a massive commercial success, reaching sales of over 10 million in the United States and 16 million worldwide, peaking at number one on several charts and being certified Diamond (10,000,000 units) in the US and Canada and Platinum in the UK and Australia. This success created an extensive interest in the band's back catalog so, in October 1997, <b>The</b> <b>Beacon</b> Street Collection was re-released on Interscope.|$|E

5|$|The {{authorities}} had initially {{planned for the}} replica to replace the red Berlayer Beacon, but the Singapore Heritage Society was against the decision, saying <b>the</b> <b>beacon</b> was itself a heritage site {{and should not be}} destroyed because <b>the</b> <b>beacon</b> has been at Labrador Park since the end of World War II.

30|$|In {{vehicular}} {{cyber-physical system}} (VCPS), beaconing mechanism is commonly deployed for the solar-powered roadside infrastructure to detect available passing-by vehicles for data dissemination. <b>The</b> traditional <b>beaconing</b> mechanism {{would cause a}} higher energy consumption due to <b>the</b> periodical <b>beaconing</b> procedure. To tackle this problem, we propose a new data dissemination strategy for roadside infrastructures by adjusting <b>the</b> <b>beaconing</b> interval to reduce the energy consumption. We model <b>the</b> <b>beaconing</b> procedure as a Markov model by observing <b>the</b> periodical <b>beaconing</b> results and then using the modeling result to obtain the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>beaconing</b> interval and <b>the</b> expectation of the single-vehicle discovery time. Then, with the average data transmission rate requirement, we can calculate <b>the</b> maximum <b>beaconing</b> interval. We also introduce a satisfaction degree based on the Sigmoid function to combine the decreased energy consumption and the decreased data rate. The satisfaction degree function allows the roadside infrastructure to obtain <b>the</b> optimal <b>beaconing</b> interval based on the required quality of service. The analysis of {{the results show that}} careful tuning of key parameters leads to improved energy efficiency and increased data rate of the data dissemination strategy.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{energy-efficient}} data dissemination strategy for roadside infrastructure in VCPS.

The impact of the system parameters on the data dissemination strategy is investigated via extensive simulation study.
