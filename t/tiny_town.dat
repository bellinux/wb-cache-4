5|$|<b>Tiny</b> <b>Town,</b> in Springfield, Missouri, was {{the first}} city built in {{miniature}} and had over a thousand structures. A smaller village version was completed in 1919, while the larger full version was completed in 1925. It was motivated primarily by a local homebuilding promotion. The project involved 10,000 students from eighteen Springfield public high schools. The superintendent {{of the school system}} was a key instigator of the project and used it as a teaching aid to instruct students in government, home-ownership and citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Prizes {{were awarded}} {{for the best}} structures, the best art posters, and the best cutout books made by {{students}} about <b>Tiny</b> <b>Town.</b> The prizes were available only to vocational-training students and students otherwise involved in the project. Student officials were in charge during the awards at the Springfield convention center. The carpentry of the framing and exterior of the homes was done primarily by the boys. The supervisor of the art department of the participating schools had an interior home-decoration contest to involve the girls, who made draperies, furniture, and floor coverings and beautified the homes' interiors.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Monks line-up performed {{together for}} the last time at the Rockaround event in Las Vegas, in 2004. Later in the year, Johnston died in November after a lengthy battle with lung cancer. A further set of reunions took place in England and Germany in 2006 and 2007 before the Monks officially disbanded. On January 10, 2008, Day died from a massive heart attack at the age of 66. Burger began a solo career thereafter, performing mostly with the Monks' repertoire until 2009. In 2014, Burger, who was mayor of the <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> of Turtle River, Minnesota since 2006, died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 72.|$|E

5|$|The {{miniature}} city project involved {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. The students, who were learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. The miniature buildings and houses were built according to standard construction plans, and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half inch to the foot. <b>Tiny</b> <b>Town,</b> with water mains and electric lights, was laid out on streets like a real city.|$|E
5|$|Today, major {{cultural}} {{institutions in the}} Riverina include the Museum of the Riverina, the Riverina Theatre Company and the Wagga Wagga Art Gallery, all located in the regional centre of Wagga Wagga with outreach to the smaller towns. Many regional towns including Hay, Deniliquin and Gundagai house museums of significant regional interest. The HotHouse Theatre group, based in Albury takes live theatre to small towns throughout the Riverina. The <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> of Morundah holds an annual night at the opera, hosting performances by OzOpera and the Victorian Opera. Popular music groups from the Riverina include one of Australia's most distinctive and popular bands of the '90s and 2000s, Spiderbait who come from the southern Riverina town of Finley.|$|E

Gripp flees, driving across Mars to another <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> to spend his life happily alone, avoiding all contact with Genevieve and ignoring any phone he hears ringing.|$|E
5000|$|Greenville {{once had}} a Boston & Maine Railroad trestle. Before it was {{dismantled}} for safety reasons, local residents turned out one sunny afternoon to watch Bronson Potter, Mason resident and inventor, fly a private airplane underneath the span on a wager. The railroad depot, which still stands, was once an important landmark that put the <b>tiny</b> <b>towns</b> of Mason and Greenville [...] "on the map." [...] It has since {{been turned into a}} Chinese restaurant and lounge.|$|R
60|$|She {{stayed at}} {{two or three}} places a day {{for at least one}} meal--hotels in <b>tiny</b> <b>towns</b> she had never heard of, and in larger towns that were fumbling for metropolitanism. She sought out all the summer resorts that were open so early. She talked to travelers, men and women; to hack-drivers and to grocers {{supplying}} hotels; to proprietors and their wives; to clerks and waitresses and bell-boys, and unconsidered, observant porters. She read circulars and the catalogues of furniture establishments.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} a {{composite}} of multiple locations; before making the film, Pixar sent a group of fifteen artists with Carburetor County sheriff and Oklahoma historian Michael Wallis as guide to take photos, talk to Route 66 people and learn the history of <b>tiny</b> <b>towns</b> along more than 1200 miles of road through five states. In one restaurant, John Lasseter ordered one of every item on the menu for the Pixar group and spent four hours talking to the owner, absorbing information on the efforts to rebuild the historic byway to its neon-lit heyday.|$|R
25|$|Subotica {{probably}} {{first became}} {{a settlement of}} note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the Tatar invasions of 1241â€“1242. However the settlement has surely been older. It has been established that people inhabited these territories even 3000 years ago. When Zabadka / Zabatka was first recorded in 1391, it was a <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Later, the city belonged to the Hunyadis, {{one of the most}} influential aristocratic families in the whole of Central Europe.|$|E
25|$|SH 349 runs {{generally}} northward {{from its}} originating junction with U.S. Highway 90 at the <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> of Dryden (population 13) near the Rio Grande, {{the southern border}} of the state. The road passes west of the Fort Lancaster State Historical Park to Sheffield and a junction with Interstate 10. SH 349 then runs along the Pecos River to Iraan, where it is co-routed for a few miles with U.S. Highway 190. The road then proceeds northward to a junction and brief co-routing with U.S. Highway 67 at Rankin. SH 349 continues northward to the relatively heavily populated area of Midland.|$|E
25|$|A {{stroke of}} luck came Wetzlar's way in 1689 when the Holy Roman Empire's highest court, the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court) was moved from Speyer to Wetzlar after Speyer had been devastated by the French in the War of the Palatinate Succession. Besides Vienna (residence of the Emperor) and Regensburg (seat of the Imperial Diet) Wetzlar thus gained a central {{function}} within the Holy Roman Empire and although it remained a <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> it was {{regarded as one of}} its capitals. The court became the town's main employer; at the Empire's dissolution in 1806, it had a staff of about 150 including 20 judges, while a further 750 derived their income from it.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} seasons, the Globetrotters needed to play every night {{just to make}} ends meet, because the team often netted less than $50 a night. Accommodations on the road were sparse and hotels often wouldnâ€™t allow blacks. On one occasion, when the players couldnâ€™t find a hotel in Des Moines, Iowa, they snuck up the fire escape and slept in Sapersteinâ€™s room. Saperstein was {{relentless}} in booking games; in the teamâ€™s first seven years, the Globetrotters played more than 1,000 games, with Saperstein driving the players to <b>tiny</b> <b>towns</b> throughout the Midwest in his unheated Ford Model T.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of 7 September, the Pakistan Navy {{launched}} its assault on Western Indian shores. Dwarka was chosen for its proximity (200km from Karachi Port), its lower defences and historical relevance. The plan called for a fleet of 7 naval vessels of Pakistan to bomb the <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> of Dwarka. It was aimed at luring the heavy ships anchored in Bombay into attacking the Pakistani ships. The intention was that the submarine PNS Ghazi lurking in the Arabian Sea would then engage and sink the Indian ships. Accordingly, a fleet of seven ships comprising PNS Babur, PNS Khaibar, PNS Badr, PNS Jahangir, PNS Alamgir, PNS Shah Jahan and PNS Tipu Sultan set sail for Dwarka and bombarded the town.|$|E
25|$|Agents for the Tidewater Railway quietly struck {{deals with}} the landowners and various {{communities}} all along the way. Many were small towns and villages that had been passed by when the big railroads were choosing routes and building 20â€“25 years earlier, and the new railroad was welcomed. At several key points, negotiations were especially sensitive. Roanoke was one such place, as the Norfolk & Western had virtually put Roanoke on the map only 20 years earlier when it had been only a <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> known as Big Lick. However, {{in the spirit of}} free enterprise, the leaders of the City of Roanoke agreed to provide the needed right-of-way through the city along the north bank of the Roanoke River. This was only a short distance from N's general offices and principal shops.|$|E
25|$|The Village of Wish: This is the <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> of Wish, where Lyra {{lives with}} her parents, Fidget and Faye, and her grandparents, Tangle and Aeval. Itâ€™s an insular place, far from cities and civilization. The town is {{surrounded}} by tall walls, not to keep the residents inside, for they {{have no desire to}} leave the safety and warmth of their community. The walls are there to keep the outside world outside, and are secured with complex weighted locks first seen in Dream Chronicles. The streets are cobbled, lined with colorful dwellings and stores. Beyond the walls of Wish lie lush forests and winding roads that, eventually, lead to other larger towns. But the folk of Wish have little desire to visit those distant places. Their homes are secure in their beloved village where, they believe, no harm can come to them.|$|E

Do you recall that out from the <b>tiny</b> <b>towns</b> which lay along the coast, came salty strangers seeking cod, tanned and laughing as we, plundering the bay with net and fishing rod? Do you recall that when the west waxed pink again homeward we turned the tiller, and as we came around with sails set full for shore, lights flashed from a world forgotten on Nantucket Sound...|$|R

25|$|Helsinki was {{established}} as a trading town by King Gustav I of Sweden in 1550 as the town of Helsingfors, which he {{intended to be a}} rival to the Hanseatic city of Reval (today known as Tallinn). Little came of the plans as Helsinki remained a <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> plagued by poverty, wars, and diseases. The plague of 1710 killed the greater part of the inhabitants of Helsinki. The construction of the naval fortress Sveaborg (In Finnish Viapori, today also Suomenlinna) in the 18th century helped improve Helsinki's status, {{but it was not until}} Russia defeated Sweden in the Finnish War and annexed Finland as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 that the town began to develop into a substantial city. During the war, Russians besieged the Sveaborg fortress, and about one quarter of the town was destroyed in an 1808 fire.|$|E
25|$|MD 381 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 231 (Prince Frederick Road) at the hamlet of Patuxent between Hughesville and the Patuxent River.

Just north of Swanson Creek, MD 381 crosses the Herbert Subdivision of CSX's Pope's Creek Subdivision, which connects the Pope's Creek Subdivision with the Chalk Point Generating Station to the east. Road access to the power plant is provided by Eagle Harbor Road, which also serves the <b>tiny</b> <b>town</b> of Eagle Harbor. MD 381 continues through the village of Aquasco, which contains the historic homes Sunnyside and Villa DeSales and St. Mary's Rectory. The highway gradually curves northwest and meets MD 382 (Croom Road) at Poplar Hill. MD 381 passes through the village of Baden, which contains St. Paul's Parish Church, and {{to the east of}} Cedarville, which sits north of Cedarville State Forest.|$|E
