25|$|Strings were {{historically}} made {{of animal}} gut, usually {{from the small}} intestine of sheep (sometimes in combination with metal) and are still made of gut or a synthetic substitute, with metal windings on the lower-pitched strings. Modern manufacturers make both gut and nylon strings, and both are in common use. Gut is more authentic for playing period pieces, though unfortunately it is also more susceptible to irregularity and pitch instability due to changes in humidity. Nylon offers greater <b>tuning</b> <b>stability,</b> but is seen as anachronistic by purists, as its timbre differs {{from the sound of}} earlier gut strings. Such concerns are moot when more recent compositions for the lute are performed.|$|E
25|$|The rim of a Bösendorfer {{grand piano}} is built quite {{differently}} {{from that of}} all other grands. Instead of veneers bent around a form, the rim is made in solid sections of spruce and jointed together. Spruce is better at transmitting sound than reflecting it. This is perhaps why Bösendorfers {{tend to have a}} more delicate treble and a bass that features the fundamental tone more than the higher harmonics. There are also two other features of Bösendorfers that are shared with only a few other piano brands: one is a removable capo d'astro bar in the treble, which facilitates rebuilding of the instrument and, Bösendorfer says, provides greater acoustic separation from the plate, decreasing tonal absorption; the other is single-stringing, providing each string its own individual hitch pin on the plate instead of connecting it to a neighboring string. This design may slightly improve <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> and is an advantage in case of string breakage.|$|E
50|$|The main design issue {{faced with}} an eight-string guitar is <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> with the lower strings. This {{is due to the}} neck being {{constructed}} too short, bridge problems such as improper intonation, uneven spacing for floating bridges, or the use of wrong string gauges. Other problems associated with <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> rely on proper set up of the guitar.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} surface charge on the {{stability}} of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to the biogenic thiols glutathione (GSH), dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), and cysteine was quantified. It was observed {{that the rate of}} release of fluorescein-tagged ligand was determined by the surface charge of the AuNPs, with cationic particles much more labile than anionic analogues. This ability to <b>tune</b> <b>stability</b> is significant for the design of both delivery vehicles and intracellular probes...|$|R
40|$|The {{baseline}} tune (Q) and chromaticity (Q’) diagnostics {{and associated}} feedback systems {{played a crucial}} role during the LHC commissioning, in establishing circulating beam, the first ramps and their fill-to-fill feed-forward correction. Early on, they also allowed to identify issues such as the residual <b>tune</b> <b>stability,</b> beam spectrum interferences and beam-beam effects – all of which may impact beam lifetimes and thus need to be addressed in view of nominal LHC operation...|$|R
40|$|The BBQ tune (Q) and {{chromaticity}} (Q’) diagnostic systems {{played a}} crucial role during the LHC commissioning while establishing circulating beam and first ramps. Early on, they allowed identifying issues such as residual <b>tune</b> <b>stability,</b> beam spectrum interferences and beam-beam effects – all of which may impact beam life-times and thus are being addressed in view of nominal LHC operation. This contribution discusses the initial beam stability in relation to the achieved instrumentation sensitivity, corresponding tune frequency and Q’ resolution...|$|R
50|$|These bridges are bolted {{directly}} to the guitar body. Assuming the bridge is of good quality, it will limit longitudinal string movement, and therefore <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> is assured.|$|E
50|$|All bridges have advantages, {{depending}} on the playing style, but, in general, a non-vibrato bridge is thought to provide better <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> and a solid contact between the guitar body and the strings.|$|E
50|$|The Roland Juno-106 is {{an analog}} {{polyphonic}} synthesizer released by Roland Corporation in February 1984. It features digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) for <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> and digital envelope generation along with analog filters and signal path.|$|E
40|$|The CERN Accelerator Logging Service stores {{data from}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of parameters and measurements, mostly from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The systematic measurement analyzer is a Java-based tool that is used to visualize and analyze various beam measurement data over multiple fills and time intervals during the operational cycle, such as ramp or squeeze. Statistical analysis and various manipulations of data are possible, including correlation with several machine parameters such as β^{*} and energy. Examples of analyses performed include checks of collimator positions, beam losses throughout the cycle and <b>tune</b> <b>stability</b> during the squeeze which is then used for feed-forward purposes...|$|R
40|$|Self-association of {{proteins}} is strongly affected by long-range electrostatic interactions caused by equilibrium adsorption of small ions such as protons and multivalent metals. By affecting the molecular net charge, solution pH {{is thus a}} widely used parameter to <b>tune</b> <b>stability</b> and phase behavior {{of proteins}}. We here review recent studies where the charge distribution is perturbed not only by protons, but also by other binding ions, leading to a rich and inherently anisotropic charge distribution. Focus is on coarse grained simulation techniques, coupled to experiments of protein-protein interaction at varying salt and pH conditions. Finally, and with future bio-colloidal models in mind, we discuss the validity of coarse graining charge anisotropy using electric multipoles...|$|R

50|$|Invaders are {{strictly}} budget-end instruments and {{do tend to}} suffer from the not-unusual weakness of occasionally having poor <b>tuning</b> <b>stability,</b> but these instruments can still be regarded as very useful and playable instruments. They are light, versatile, and comfortable.|$|E
5000|$|A {{digitally}} controlled oscillator or DCO is {{a hybrid}} digital/analogue electronic oscillator used in synthesizers, microcontrollers, and software-defined radios. The name is analogous with [...] "voltage-controlled oscillator." [...] DCOs {{were designed to}} overcome the <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> limitations of early VCO designs.|$|E
50|$|Around 1979, the locking tremolo {{was invented}} by Floyd D. Rose. The locking trem became highly popular among 1980s heavy metal guitarists due to its {{extremely}} wide range of variation and <b>tuning</b> <b>stability.</b> The original Floyd Rose system {{was similar to the}} Fender synchronized tremolo, but with a number of extra mechanisms. The first to be added and most obvious is a locking plate on the head nut, tightened with a hex key to fix the strings at this point after tuning. This provides extra <b>tuning</b> <b>stability,</b> particularly during use of the vibrato arm, but as an unwanted side effect it also prevents further adjustment of the pitch using the machine heads.|$|E
40|$|Processive DNA {{synthesis}} by {{the alpha}} epsilon theta {{core of the}} Escherichia coli Pol III replicase requires it to be bound to the beta(2) clamp via a site in the a polymerase subunit. How the epsilon proofreading exonuclease subunit influences DNA synthesis by alpha was not previously understood. In this work, bulk assays of DNA replication were used to uncover a non-proofreading activity of epsilon. Combination of mutagenesis with biophysical studies and single-molecule leading-strand replication assays traced this activity to a novel beta-binding site in e that, {{in conjunction with the}} site in a, maintains a closed state of the alpha epsilon theta-beta(2) replicase in the polymerization mode of DNA synthesis. The epsilon-beta interaction, selected during evolution to be weak and thus suited for transient disruption to enable access of alternate polymerases and other clamp binding proteins, therefore makes an important contribution to the network of protein-protein interactions that finely <b>tune</b> <b>stability</b> of the replicase on the DNA template in its various conformational states. ...|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{transversal}} filters implemented as adjustable tapped {{fiber optic}} delay lines developed. Main advantages of these filters (in comparison with conventional microwave transversal filters) are small size, light weight, {{no need for}} matching of radio-frequency impedances, no need for shielding against electromagnetic radiation at suboptical frequencies, no need for mechanical <b>tuning,</b> high <b>stability</b> of amplitude and phase, and active control of transfer functions. Weights of taps in fiber optic delay lines adjusted...|$|R
40|$|Animat agent models {{constitute}} {{an important tool}} for studying emergent phenomena in large scale complex systems. We have developed a spatial animat agent model to investigate predator-prey interactions and other e↵ects arising from emergent cooperation and competition. The rules for microscopic animat predation and reproduction critically a↵ect the stability of model systems. We report on our experiments on <b>tuning</b> the <b>stability</b> and growth of animat population models {{against a background of}} multiple animat species and the emergence of spatial segregation...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the higher}} tension {{required}} for steel strings, steel strung guitars are much more robustly made than 'classical' guitars which use synthetic strings. Most jazz and folk string players prefer steel-core strings for their faster response, low cost, and <b>tuning</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Dual-Fulcrum Vibrato has two pivot points. The design aims {{to improve}} <b>tuning</b> <b>stability,</b> and {{according}} to some has a sound that is more mellow than a traditional bridge. It allows the player to bend notes up as well as down. See also Tremolo arm.|$|E
5000|$|Ibanez Fixed Edge {{while it}} still uses the locking nut and locking bridge, it was mounted {{on top of}} the body, and was used not as a vibrato system, but to provide a {{familiar}} feel to vibrato users, and even more <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> on a hardtailed guitar.|$|E
40|$|We present direct {{evidence}} {{for a change in}} protein structural specificity due to hydrophobic core packing. High resolution structural analysis of a designed core variant of ubiquitin reveals that the protein is in slow exchange between two conformations. Examination of side-chain rotamers indicates that this dynamic response and the lower stability of the protein are coupled to greater strain and mobility in the core. The results suggest that manipulating the level of side-chain strain may be one way of fine <b>tuning</b> the <b>stability</b> and specificity of proteins...|$|R
2500|$|A well-thought-out design {{procedure}} {{is considered to}} be the first significant step to a successful synthesizer project. In the system design of a frequency synthesizer, states Manassewitsch, there are as many [...] "best" [...] design procedures as there are experienced synthesizer designers. System analysis of a frequency synthesizer involves output frequency range (or frequency bandwidth or tuning range), frequency increments (or resolution or frequency <b>tuning),</b> frequency <b>stability</b> (or phase stability, compare spurious outputs), phase noise performance (e.g., spectral purity), switching time (compare settling time and rise time), and size, power consumption, and cost. James A. Crawford says that these are mutually contradictive requirements.|$|R
40|$|An ‘azido gauche effect’ {{determines the}} {{conformation}} of (4 S) - and (4 R) -azidoproline (Azp) derivatives and affects the s-cis:s-trans conformer ratio of Xaa-Azp bonds. The article summarizes our {{research on the}} con- formational analysis of monomers as well as oligomers derived from (4 S) Azp and (4 R) Azp. We show that (4 S) Azp and (4 R) Azp {{can be used to}} <b>tune</b> the <b>stability</b> of the polyproline II (PPII) helix. In addition we demonstrate that Azp containing oligoprolines are attractive molecular scaffolds with a well-defined helical conformation that can be readily further functionalized using e. g. click chemistry...|$|R
50|$|Hexcore strings are {{composed}} of hexagonal core wire and a tight (usually round) winding. Hexcore string design prevents the winding from slipping around the core - which can occur with round core strings. This may lead to improved <b>tuning</b> <b>stability,</b> flexibility, and reduced string breakage, compared with round core strings.|$|E
50|$|Seagull guitars use a {{distinctive}} and recognizable headstock which places the tuning machines roughly {{in line with}} the nut to improve <b>tuning</b> <b>stability.</b> Most models are available with either the Godin Quantum I electronics (featuring an under saddle transducer) or the Godin Quantum II electronics (with both a transducer and small microphone which can be blended together).|$|E
50|$|They come factory {{tuned to}} Drop B (B, F#, B, E, G#, C# to high). They have a H-H configuration, or two humbucking pickups, and the fixed Edge FX bridge, {{which is based}} on Ibanez Edge tremolo but fixed, {{providing}} more <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> than a standard hard-tail. Contrary to popular belief, the MTM series guitars do not sport a tremolo bar or system.|$|E
40|$|Strong {{dynamical}} scaling violations {{exist in}} quenched two-dimensional systems with vector O(3) order parameters. These systems support non-singular topologically stable configurations (skyrmions). By <b>tuning</b> the <b>stability</b> of isolated skyrmions to expand or shrink, we find dramatic {{differences in the}} dynamical multiscaling spectrum of decaying moments of the topological charge density distribution and in particular in the decay of the energy-density ϵ∼. We present a simple two-length-scale model for the observed exponents in the case when isolated skyrmions expand. No such simple model is found when isolated skyrmions shrink.

5000|$|Vigier Floyd Rose {{created by}} Vigier guitars at the {{beginning}} of the 90s, this system uses force-tolerant needle bearings for improved wear on the bridge and enhanced <b>tuning</b> <b>stability.</b> The ball-bearing and global tuner features are manufactured under license to American Inventor and recording artist, Geoffrey Lee McCabe -- see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,175,066 5,965,831, 6,891,094, 5,986,191, 6,563,034 and 7,470,841.|$|E
5000|$|Another type is a locking nut. This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves <b>tuning</b> <b>stability</b> when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the locking nut must be loosened using an Allen wrench to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{original}} Minimoog, the Voyager's modulation busses {{can be set}} to affect almost any parameter of the sound, not just the filters. Although the synthesizer features MIDI control and advanced patch storage, all audio paths in the Voyager are analog. The three oscillators are designed for high <b>tuning</b> <b>stability,</b> as {{the original}} Minimoog oscillators tended to slightly shift out of tune while playing.|$|E
40|$|Wavelength <b>tuning</b> and <b>stability</b> {{characteristics}} of a singly resonant continuous-wave optical parametric oscillator (cw OPO) in the proximity of signal-idler degeneracy have been studied. The OPO is made singly resonant by using a Bragg grating as a spectral filter in the OPO cavity. The signal-idler frequency difference can be tuned from 0. 5 to 7 THz, which makes the OPO suitable for cw THz generation by optical heterodyning. The operation of the OPO within this singly-resonant regime {{is characterized by a}} strong self-stabilization effect. A gradual transition to an unstable, doubly-resonant regime is observed for a signal-idler detuning smaller than ~ 0. 5 THz...|$|R
40|$|Persistent neural firing is of {{fundamental}} importance to working memory and other brain functions {{because it allows}} information to be held “online” following an input and to be integrated over time. Many models of persistent activity rely {{on some kind of}} positive feedback internal to the neural circuit concerned; however, too much feedback causes runaway firing (instability), and too little results in loss of persistence (leak). This parameter sensitivity leads to the hypothesis that the brain uses an error signal (external feedback) to <b>tune</b> the <b>stability</b> of persistent firing by adjusting the amount of internal feedback. We test this hypothesis by manipulating external visual feedback, a putative sensory error signal, in a model system for persistent firing, the goldfish oculomotor neural integrator. Over tens of minutes to hours, electronically controlled visual feedback consistent with a leaky or unstable integrator can drive the integrator progressively more unstable or leaky, respectively. Eye fixation time constants can be reduced > 100 -fold to < 1 s. Normal visual feedback gradually retunes the integrator back to stability. Changes in the phase of the sinusoidal vestibulo-ocular response are consistent with integrator detuning, as are changes in ocular drift following eye position shifts compensating for brief passive head movements during fixations. Corresponding changes in persistent firing of integrator neurons are presented in the accompanying article. The presence, strength, and reversibility of the plasticity demonstrate that, in this system, external visual feedback plays a vital role in gradually <b>tuning</b> the <b>stability</b> of the neural integrator...|$|R
40|$|Transient {{precursor}} {{states are}} often experimentally observed for molecules adsorbing on surfaces. However, such precursor states are typically rather short-lived, quickly yielding to more stable adsorption configurations. Here we employ first-principles calculations to systematically explore the interaction mechanism for benzene derivatives on metal surfaces, enabling us to selectively <b>tune</b> the <b>stability</b> and the barrier between two metastable adsorption states. In particular, {{in the case}} of the tetrachloropyrazine molecule, two equally stable adsorption states are identified with a moderate and conceivably reversible barrier between them. We address the feasibility of experimentally detecting the predicted bistable behaviour and discuss its potential usefulness in a molecular switch. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
