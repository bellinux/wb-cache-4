50|$|Octagonal drum {{is a type}} of Manchu {{folk art}} that was very popular among bannermen, {{especially}} in Beijing.

When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells. Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer.|$|R
