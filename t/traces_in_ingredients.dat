40|$|Hydrophobins are {{exceptional}} proteins {{produced by}} fungi. Research {{over the last}} decade has led {{to a better understanding of}} their role in spontaneous self-assembly at hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces. This has resulted in many proposals for using hydrophobins in many important scientific and technological applications. Hydrophobins may become attractive as special biosurfactants, as foaming agents and for protein immobilization in the food industries and in biosensors. Moreover, they can be interesting as stabilizers for flavors, and as, encapsulating agents of <b>trace</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> beverages. The use of hydrophobins in pharmaceutical formulations and in medicine is another interesting application as they cause an increased stabilization of drugs. The study of hydrophobins must also lead to a better understanding of the gushing phenomenon in beverages like beers, wines and ciders, which causes great economic losses in those fields. To recognize the positive and the negative aspects of hydrophobins these proteins should be commercially available at large scale which however is not the case. An overview of existing possibilities for applications may help to understand their behavior in different environmental conditions and to stimulate finding improved methods for isolation and purification, and possibly other unexpected applications. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Minerals {{and trace}} {{elements}} are essential constituents in any diet. Our {{understanding of the}} requirements of minerals and <b>trace</b> elements <b>in</b> salmonids is limited, and based on information gained {{through the use of}} purified feeds. There exists a need to define standardised methods for determining the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of minerals (calcium, iron, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, sulphur and magnesium) and trace elements (aluminium, boron, cadmium, cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, vanadium and zinc), the relation between ADC and mineral retention and the effects alternative dietary protein sources, particularly those derived from plants, have on mineral and <b>trace</b> element ADC <b>in</b> salmonids. The primary objective of this research is to improve our understanding of how to best observe the nutritive value of essential minerals and trace elements and their interactions in salmonid diets. Part 1 dealt with the methodology of determining the ADC of minerals and trace elements by comparing external digestibility markers (chromium oxide and yttrium oxide) and an internal marker (acid insoluble ash) and measured the effect of faecal collection timing on ADC. High recovery marker rates and low variation in digestibility values indicated that including yttrium oxide at 0. 1 % effectively determined ADC for all minerals and most trace elements. Significant differences <b>in</b> mineral and <b>trace</b> element ADC were observed under the various sampling protocols, and an 18 hour collection period provided the most reliable ADC. Part 2 sought to determine the strength of relationships between digestibility and retention of minerals and trace elements and establish data for expected tissue concentrations and mineral status of salmon. There was a complex range of diet and time effects that varied between tissues. The statistical power of determining the effect of mineral supplementation varied by element, and reflected ADC. There were no differences in growth performance between feed composed of various levels of mineral supplementation so the results provide baseline data on mineral status in relation to requirements and uptake. Part 3 dealt with the effect of plant ingredients on ADC, mineral retention, intake and growth, and compared methods of measuring maximum voluntary intake. Mineral and trace element ADC for plant ingredients differed between and amongst species. Lupin—based feeds provided growth similar to that provided by a fish meal based feed, but displayed significantly different ADC and maximum voluntary intake. The concentration of particular minerals and <b>trace</b> elements <b>in</b> plant <b>ingredients</b> was reflected <b>in</b> ADC, carcass concentrations, but not in calculated retention values...|$|R
