5|$|After renovations were {{finished}} in 2005, {{the number of}} two- and three-bedroom units was increased dramatically, due to {{the combination of the}} building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted more families to the cooperative community. In recent years the lobby has been restored, hallways remodeled, and amenities increased, including larger storage areas, a bike room, and an improved laundry facility. The building is now said to be luxurious as measured both by residents' quality of living and by the purchase prices <b>they</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and self-sufficiency when <b>they</b> <b>pay</b> back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
5|$|The {{group were}} {{surprised}} to see how small and technically basic the studio was, with only one microphone in {{the centre of the}} room. Phillips demanded that <b>they</b> <b>pay</b> for the recording before they set up the equipment, so each member paid 3 shillings and 6 pence, but he then asked for an extra surcharge (£1) {{to cover the cost of}} transferring the tape recording to acetate disc. As this was too expensive, Phillips said that for a cut-rate price they would not be taped first, but record directly to vinyl.|$|E

The principal decides to expel Chengcai, while Tom receives a public caning {{for his part in}} the scuffle. Tom and Chengcai later join a local street gang; as their initiation, they are forced to shoplift an iPod. However, they are caught by two conmen with connections to the street gang posing as police detectives, who demand that <b>they</b> <b>pay</b> the fine $2000 within two days or be arrested.|$|E
5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was {{a branch of the}} military, this structure could not be used in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the ground station. The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration. The ground station needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from Digital Equipment Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, they chose to award the contract to FFI on the condition that <b>they</b> <b>pay</b> for a PDP-8 if they were not able to deliver a computer themselves.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Roran is {{planning}} to rescue Katrina. He decides that the only solution is to join the Varden in Surda, and so he convinces almost the entire village to travel there. The villagers reach Narda, where <b>they</b> <b>pay</b> for barges to sail to Teirm. In Teirm, Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who tells him about Eragon and that he now is a Dragon Rider. Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden. Jeod decides {{to go with them}} and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing. The villagers are chased by a group of Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.|$|E
5|$|To the poorest, Nerva granted allotments of land worth up to 60 million sesterces. He {{exempted}} {{parents and}} their children from a 5% inheritance tax, and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that <b>they</b> <b>pay</b> interest of 5% to their municipality to support the children of needy families; alimentary schemes which were later expanded by Trajan, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. Furthermore, numerous taxes were remitted and privileges granted to Roman provinces. Namely, he abolished abuses of the Fiscus Iudaicus, the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay: some of his coins bear the legend FISCI IUDAICI CALUMNIA SUBLATA (abolition of malicious prosecution regarding the Jewish tax).|$|E

For {{it is from the}} city, rather than from the country, that our armies must mainly be recruited. Not only is the townsman more ready to enlist than the countryman, because in the town the labour market is most likely to be overstocked; but the townsman actually makes a better soldier than the countryman. He is a shrewder, more active, more self-helping man; give him but the chances of maintaining the same physical strength and health as the countryman, and he will support the honour of the British arms as gallantly as the Highlander or the Connaughtman, and restore the days when the invincible prentice-boys of London carried terror into the heart of foreign lands. In all ages, in all times, whether for war or for peace, it will pay. The true wealth of a nation is the health of her masses.|$|R
