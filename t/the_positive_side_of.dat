500|$|The early {{projects}} of Zvi Hecker, designed {{in partnership with}} Sharon and Neumann, have architectural qualities that were developed later in his career.

Raw concrete was chosen because it did not require constant maintenance and renovation in light of the strong sandy winds.

With his solo material, he [...] "paid more care in terms of arrangement and mixing" [...] of his music rather than [...] "changing something inorganically".

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>positive</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the {{explosion}} in information was that the 18th century was markedly more generally educated than the centuries before. Education was less confined to the upper classes {{than it had been}} in prior centuries so contributions to science, philosophy, economics, and literature came from all parts of the kingdom. It was the first time that literacy and a library were all that stood between a person and education. It was an age of [...] "enlightenment" [...] in the sense that the insistence and drive for reasonable explanations of nature and mankind was a rage. It was an [...] "age of reason" [...] in that it was an age that accepted clear, rational methods as superior to tradition. However, there was a dark side to such literacy as well, which authors of the 18th century felt at every turn, which was that nonsense and insanity were also getting more adherents than ever before. Charlatans and mountebanks were fooling more, just as sages were educating more, and alluring and lurid apocalypses vied with sober philosophy on the shelves. As with the Worldwide Web in the 21st century, the democratisation of publishing meant that older systems for determining value and uniformity of view were both in shambles. Thus, it was increasingly difficult to trust books in the 18th century, as books were increasingly easy to make and buy.|$|E

6000|$|Accordingly it is {{important}} to translate as adequately as possible <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Abbey's activity. None to-day is more charming, and none helps us more to take the large, joyous, observant, various view of the business of art. He has enlarged the idea of illustration, and he plays with it in a hundred spontaneous, ingenious ways. [...] "Truth and poetry" [...] is the motto legibly stamped upon his pencil-case, for if he has on the one side a singular sense of the familiar, salient, importunate facts of life, on the other they reproduce themselves in his mind in a delightfully qualifying medium. It is this medium that the fond observer must especially envy Mr. Abbey, and that a literary observer will envy him most of all.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{hitherto}} {{spoken of}} all labour as profitable; {{because it is}} impossible to consider under one head the quality or value of labour, and its aim. But labour of the best quality may be various in aim. It may be either constructive ("gathering," [...] from con and struo), as agriculture; nugatory, as jewel-cutting; or destructive ("scattering," [...] from de and struo), as war. It is not, however, always easy to prove labour, apparently nugatory, to be actually so;[55] generally, the formula holds good, [...] "he that gathereth not, scattereth;" [...] thus, the jeweller's art is probably very harmful in its ministering to a clumsy and inelegant pride. So that, finally, I believe nearly all labour may be shortly divided into positive and negative labour: positive, that which produces life; negative, that which produces death; the most directly negative labour being murder, and the most directly positive, the bearing and rearing of children: so that in the precise degree in which murder is hateful, on the negative side of idleness, in that exact degree child-rearing is admirable, on <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> idleness. For which reason, and because of the honour that there is in rearing[56] children, while the wife is said to be as the vine (for cheering), the children are as the olive-branch, for praise; nor for praise only, but for peace (because large families can only be reared in times of peace): though since, in their spreading and voyaging in various directions, they distribute strength, they are, to the home strength, as arrows in the hand of the giant--striking here and there, far away.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{just one}} more {{nuisance}} to be disposed of before I come to <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> my case. I mean the person who tells me that my schooldays belong to a bygone order of educational ideas and institutions, and that schools are not now a bit like my old school. I reply, with Sir Walter Raleigh, by calling on my soul to give this statement the lie. Some years ago I lectured in Oxford on the subject of Education. A friend to whom I mentioned my intention said, [...] "You know nothing of modern education: schools are not now what they were when you were a boy." [...] I immediately procured the time sheets of half a dozen modern schools, and found, as I expected, that they might all have been my old school: there was no real difference. I may mention, too, that I have visited modern schools, and observed that {{there is a tendency to}} hang printed pictures in an untidy and soulless manner on the walls, and occasionally to display on the mantel-shelf a deplorable glass case containing certain objects which might possibly, if placed in the hands of the pupils, give them some practical experience of the weight of a pound and the length of an inch. And sometimes a scoundrel who has rifled a bird's nest or killed a harmless snake encourages the children to go and do likewise by putting his victims into an imitation nest and bottle and exhibiting them as aids to [...] "Nature study." [...] A suggestion that Nature is worth study would certainly have staggered my schoolmasters; so perhaps I may admit a gleam of progress here. But as any child who attempted to handle these dusty objects would probably be caned, I do not attach any importance to such modernities in school furniture. The school remains what it was in my boyhood, because its real object remains what it was. And that object, I repeat, is to keep the children out of mischief: mischief meaning for the most part worrying the grown-ups.|$|E
