60|$|A <b>turn-up</b> {{bedstead}} is a blunt, honest {{piece of}} furniture; {{it may be}} slightly disguised with a sham drawer; and sometimes a mad attempt is even made to pass it off for a book-case; ornament it as you will, however, the <b>turn-up</b> bedstead seems to defy disguise, and to insist on having it distinctly understood {{that he is a}} <b>turn-up</b> bedstead, and nothing else—that he is indispensably necessary, and that being so useful, he disdains to be ornamental.|$|E

I ain't 'ad a <b>turn-up,</b> not to call a <b>turn-up,</b> since I've been a time-expired man. I ain't hitting of 'em, Mr. Garnet, sir, not hard I ain't. That there first one of 'em he played me dirty, hittin' at me when I wasn't looking. They can't say as I started it." ...|$|E

6000|$|P.S.--Apropos of the odd {{controversy}} about Shelley's nose: I have before me four photographs of myself, done by Shelley's son: my nose is hooked, {{not like the}} eagle, indeed, but like the accipitrine family in man: well, out of these four, only one marks the bend, one makes it straight, and one suggests a <b>turn-up.</b> This throws a flood of light on calumnious man--and the scandal-mongering sun. For personally I cling to my curve. To continue the Shelley controversy: I have a look of him, all his sisters had noses like mine: Sir Percy has a marked hook; all the family had high cheek-bones like mine; what doubt, then, but that this <b>turn-up</b> (of which Jeaffreson accuses the poet, along with much other fatras) {{is the result of}} some accident similar to what has happened in my photographs by his son? ...|$|E

'No vay,' said Mr. Weller, 'unless'--and a {{gleam of}} {{intelligence}} lighted up his countenance as he sank {{his voice to}} a whisper, and applied his mouth to the ear of his offspring--'unless it is getting him out in a <b>turn-up</b> bedstead, unbeknown to the turnkeys, Sammy, or dressin' him up like a old 'ooman vith a green wail.' ...|$|E
25|$|Trouser-makers {{can finish}} the legs by hemming {{the bottom to}} prevent fraying. Trousers with <b>turn-ups</b> (cuffs in American English), after hemming, are rolled outward and {{sometimes}} pressed or stitched into place.|$|R
25|$|<b>Turn-ups</b> on {{the bottom}} of trousers, or cuffs, were {{initially}} popularised in the 1890s by Edward VII, and were popular with suits throughout the 1920s and 1930s. They have always been an informal option, being inappropriate on all formalwear.|$|R

60|$|One chill December {{afternoon}} there sat {{in front}} of a strange-looking instrument a woman--at least she was as nearly a woman as is compatible with the age of seventeen. She was also pretty--not beautiful, observe, but pretty--sparklingly pretty; dark, dimpled, demure and delightful in every way; with a <b>turn-up</b> nose, a laughing eye, and a kindly look.|$|E

50|$|Formal {{trousers}} {{should not}} have <b>turn-ups</b> (cuffs in American English), and should {{have one or two}} forward pleats to each leg. Braces (suspenders in American English) should be worn to prevent the waistband from appearing beneath the waistcoat. Belts should not be worn with morning dress. Less common alternatives to striped trousers are houndstooth check, and grey flannel trousers, amongst others.|$|R
25|$|The {{amount and}} style of {{decoration}} on cioareci depends on regional style. The majority of the decoration is on the upper parts of the trousers around the pockets, and front. Trousers worn with boots {{did not have any}} decoration on the lower part whereas those worn with spats had decoration down the legs accenting the cut of the trousers and round the hems or <b>turn-ups.</b>|$|R

60|$|Thus, Mr Riderhood: taking {{from the}} hands of his daughter, with special ill-will, a lent cap, and grumbling as he pulls it down over his ears. Then, getting on his {{unsteady}} legs, leaning heavily upon her, and growling, 'Hold still, can't you? What! You must be a staggering next, must you?' he takes his departure out of the ring in which he has had that little <b>turn-up</b> with Death.|$|E
6000|$|... "Leave a woman {{alone to}} find out that," [...] said John admiringly. [...] "Now, a man would never have thought of it! Whereas, it's my belief that if you was to pack a wedding-cake up in a tea-chest, or a <b>turn-up</b> bedstead, or a pickled-salmon keg, or any {{unlikely}} thing, a woman would be sure to find it out directly. Yes; I called for it at the pastrycook's." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Starting a Paper in India" [...] is very droll to us. But {{it is full}} of {{references}} that the public don't understand, and don't in the least care for. Bourgeois, brevier, minion, and nonpareil, long primer, <b>turn-ups,</b> dunning advertisements, and reprints, back forme, imposing-stone, and locking-up, are all quite out of their way, and a sort of slang that they have no interest in.|$|R

60|$|The goods {{here are}} {{adapted to the}} taste, or rather to the means, of cheap purchasers. There {{are some of the}} most {{beautiful}} looking Pembroke tables that were ever beheld: the wood as green as the trees in the Park, and the leaves almost as certain to fall off in the course of a year. There is also a most extensive assortment of tent and <b>turn-up</b> bedsteads, made of stained wood, and innumerable specimens of that base imposition on society—a sofa bedstead.|$|E
60|$|The baby grunted again, and Alice {{looked very}} anxiously into its face {{to see what}} was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a VERY <b>turn-up</b> nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting {{extremely}} small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. 'But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.|$|E
2500|$|The sack coat or lounge coat {{continued}} {{to replace the}} frock coat for most informal and semi-formal occasions. [...] Three-piece suits consisting of a sack coat with matching waistcoat (U.S. vest) and trousers were worn, as were matching coat and waistcoat with contrasting trousers, or matching coat and trousers with contrasting waistcoat. [...] Trousers were shorter than before, often had <b>turn-ups</b> or cuffs, and were creased front and back using the new trouser press.|$|R
50|$|Many skinheads wear Sta-Prest flat-fronted slacks {{or other}} dress {{trousers}}; jeans (normally Levi's, Lee or Wrangler); or combat trousers (plain or camouflage). Jeans and slacks are worn deliberately short (either hemmed, rolled or tucked) {{to show off}} boots, or to show off socks when wearing loafers or brogues. Jeans are often blue, with a parallel leg design, hemmed or with clean and thin rolled cuffs (<b>turn-ups),</b> and are sometimes splattered with bleach to resemble camouflage trousers (a style popular among Oi! skinheads).|$|R
5000|$|Many things {{affected}} {{the style of}} clothes that people wore. Austerity also affected men's civilian clothes during the war years. The British [...] "Utility Suit" [...] and American [...] "Victory Suit" [...] were both made of wool-synthetic blend yarns, without pleats, cuffs (<b>turn-ups),</b> sleeve buttons or patch pockets; jackets were shorter, trousers were narrower, and double-breasted suits were made without vests (waistcoats). [...] Men who were not in uniform could, of course, continue to wear pre-war suits they already owned, and many did so.|$|R
60|$|The {{meeting was}} {{breaking}} up now. Underneath {{the photograph of}} the lost shaft Hemmings was buttonholed by the Rev. Mr. Boms. Little Mr. Booker, his bristling eyebrows wreathed in angry smiles, was having a parting <b>turn-up</b> with old Scrubsole. The two hated each other like poison. There was some matter of a tar-contract between them, little Mr. Booker having secured it from the Board for a nephew of his, over old Scrubsole's head. Soames had heard that from Hemmings, who liked a gossip, more especially about his directors, except, indeed, old Jolyon, of whom he was afraid.|$|E
60|$|This {{intelligence}} was but too true. A long course of snubbing and neglect; his days {{spent in the}} kitchen, and his nights in the <b>turn-up</b> bedstead, had completely broken the little spirit that the unfortunate volunteer had ever possessed. He {{had no one to}} whom he could detail his injuries but the servants, and they were almost of necessity his chosen confidants. It is no less strange than true, however, that the little weaknesses which he had incurred, most probably during his military career, seemed to increase as his comforts diminished. He was actually a sort of journeyman Giovanni of the basement story.|$|E
60|$|It was one {{of those}} things which are really nobody's fault. It was not the chauffeur's fault, and it was not mine. I was having a {{friendly}} <b>turn-up</b> with a pal of mine on the side-walk; he ran across the road; I ran after him; and the car came round the corner and hit me. It must have been going pretty slow, or I should have been killed. As it was, I just had the breath knocked out of me. You know how you feel when the butcher catches you just as you are edging out of the shop with a bit of meat. It was like that.|$|E
40|$|Man's morning suit (for wedding wear). Black {{jacket and}} waistcoat, black and grey striped {{trousers}} with button flies and <b>turn-ups.</b> Buttons for braces.

Body lined in black satin, sleeves as waistcoat. Pockets (two) have flaps. Label (black and silver to inside pocket) : Burton the Tailor of Taste Oxford Street, London. Maker: Burton.

25|$|Black tie {{trousers}} {{traditionally have}} no cuffs (<b>turn-ups</b> in British English) or belt loops. The outer seams are usually {{decorated with a}} single braid of silk or a material that matches the lapel facing. Traditionally, braces (suspenders), hidden by the waistcoat, are used to support the trousers. Belts should not ever be worn with black tie trousers. Evening trousers can be flat-fronted or pleated today; pleats first coming into fashion in the 1930s. Whilst flat-fronted trousers are more fashionable at present, pleated trousers may be considered more comfortable by men who have wider hips and a narrow waist.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Dalton {{took office}} he {{appointed}} Metford Watkins as Director of Civilian Clothing as the Board of Trade. Watkins, {{aware of the}} high price of clothes at the time, promised to introduce cheaper clothes via 'austerity' provisions but not, as had been done during the First World War, using standardisation. Shortly after the government announced the production of 'national footwear'. The austerity provisions governed exactly what could or could not be used in the manufacture of clothes and shoes (for example, number of buttons, pleats or pockets, height of heels, amount of lace or embroidery, no <b>turn-ups</b> on trousers and no double-breasted suits).|$|R
