5|$|Later, {{the crash}} of a small {{commuter}} aircraft is attributed to a similar signal from a numbers station, and when Fringe division identifies the source, they find a second box. Taking the box to Walter, Peter identifies one of the electronic components as rare, and engages his contacts to find Feller's address from its purchase. Fauxlivia feigns returning to headquarters to instead travel to Feller's apartment, warning him that Fringe is onto him, but he insists on continuing his job. She throws him out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> the Fringe team arrives, killing him and revealing {{him to be a}} shapeshifter. Fauxlivia claims she killed the man in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E

5|$|Walsh was on {{the team}} that {{captured}} criminal Arthur Barker, son of gangster Ma Barker, in Chicago in 1935 and was later involved in tracking Public Enemy Number One Al Brady in 1937. On October 12 of that year, {{he was with the}} group of FBI agents who ambushed and killed Brady in a shoot-out at a Bangor, Maine sporting goods store. While waiting for Brady to arrive, he acted as a clerk in the store for several days and arrested Brady Gang member James Dalhover. As the operation leader, Walsh's job was to alert thirteen other agents, as well as over 30 other state and local policemen, of any gang member's arrival by pulling a cord on <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>As</b> they were interrogating Dalhover in the store Clarence Lee Shaffer, Jr., another gang member, entered the building and began firing at the agents. While arresting Dalhover, Walsh took bullets to his hand, shoulder and right chest, but quickly returned to work.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E

25|$|Heart of Darkness: Welles's {{projected}} {{first film}} in 1940, planned in extreme detail {{and with some}} test shots filmed. (The footage is now lost.) It was planned to be entirely shot in long takes {{from the point of}} view of the narrator, Marlow, who would be played by Welles; his reflection would occasionally be seen in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> his boat sailed down river. The project was abandoned, because it could not be delivered on budget, and Citizen Kane was made instead.|$|E
25|$|Antikainen was {{allegedly}} {{killed in a}} plane crash near Arkhangelsk in October 1941. As he had openly critizised the Soviet leaders, some believe that his death was not an accident. According to the memoir of the exile Austrian communist Ruth von Mayenburg, Antikainen stayed at the Hotel Lux in Moscow and jumped out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> the NKVD officers were breaking his door. It is also claimed that he was assassinated by the later head of the Soviet Union Yuri Andropov, because Antikainen tried to take his place in the Komsomol of the Soviet Karelo-Finnish Republic.|$|E

The {{brothers}} had been in jail awaiting trial when an armed mob of about 200 men stormed the facility, their faces painted black with wet gunpowder. Hyrum was killed first, having been shot in the face. After emptying the pistol with which he tried to defend himself, Joseph was then shot several times while trying to escape from a second-story window, and fell from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> he died.|$|E
500|$|Naval combat {{was subject}} to more {{criticism}} than land battles. PC Format described the visuals in a naval battle as [...] "incredible", but stated that the controls were [...] "frustrating; genuine naval tactics fast disappear out of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> [...] struggles to bring [...] navy’s cannons {{to bear on the}} enemy". PC Gamer UK reciprocated this view, but noted that naval strategy was a [...] "deeply difficult task" [...] for a developer, and that [...] "The Creative Assembly have done the best that their game template would allow". IGN praised the graphical quality of the naval battles and stated that [...] "trying to line ships up correctly, making the most of the wind and choosing targets appropriately is very rewarding", but that [...] "the formations and pathfinding leave a lot to be desired". GameSpot commented that [...] "the AI seems incapable of managing [...] with much success".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Happiness" [...] starts at {{a train station}} (Roma Street railway station in Brisbane) with a boy and girl {{stepping}} off a train. As the pair leave the train, the boy turns and tries to reach for something, but the girl pulls him back. It is shown that he was reaching for a [...] slinky. The slinky leaves the train, and passes Middleton busking in the train station. The slinky ventures to find the boy, facing a range of challenges along the way; these include avoiding fruit falling on it and riding a skateboard. In {{the middle of the}} music clip, the slinky is shown making its way through a music room in which Powderfinger are performing [...] "My Happiness". It rests on the bar and the band finishes playing, while the background music continues. As Powderfinger leaves, the slinky is picked up by Haug. He gets into a car and places the slinky on the car's dashboard, but it falls out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> the car turns a tight corner.

500|$|Ultimately, the {{producers}} turned to 30-year-old Sean Connery for five films. It is often reported that Connery won the role through a contest {{set up to}} [...] "find James Bond". While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a Gregory Peck quality, but proved unable {{to cope with the}} role. When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery [...] "put on an act and it paid off" [...] as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude. When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> he went to his car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E
500|$|The church {{features}} several {{stained glass}} windows of significance. The east window, by Clayton and Bell, {{was a gift from}} Robert Treat Paine, Jr. in memory of his wife, Lydia Lyman Paine, who died in 1897 during the construction of the church. [...] At Paine's request, his wife's likeness was incorporated into the left panel of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> a red-clad figure kneeling before Christ. [...] The west window, designed by Charles Connick, pays homage to Waltham's manufacturing history. In addition to images of Ruth, Solomon, and Noah — all industrious figures in the Bible — the window features rivets, a bicycle wheel, a watch escapement, a Metz car, and other symbols that reference Waltham's industrial character. [...] Along the south wall is a signed Tiffany window, designed by Tiffany artist Frederick Wilson. [...] The window depicts the Nativity, and was given to the church in 1908 by John H. Storer in memory of Frank Henry Perkins and Mary Ella Perkins. [...] Also along the south wall is a window by noted Boston stained glass artist Donald MacDonald. [...] This work, given in memory of Harriet K. Parmenter, depicts the Easter scene of the risen Christ revealing himself to Mary Magdalene.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World {{synopsis}} states, [...] "State Senator Jack Dare, one of {{the reform}} members of the legislature, starts to the state capitol to attend an important session of that body. That he took the midnight train from his home city is clearly proven, for his aged mother was a passenger on it, and besides the conductor and porter are certain that he retired for the night. In the morning, however, his berth is empty, although some of his garments are found there. The case puzzles the railroad officials and the police, and Violet Gray is {{given a chance to}} distinguish herself. She learns from the conductor and porter, who had happened to spend the night awake at opposite ends of the car, that the senator did not go by them. Consequently this leaves only <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>as</b> his means of egress, and she knows that he must have gone that way. Violet discovers that Dare is a hearty supporter of a bill that a powerful lobby is trying to defeat. The fight is so close that his is the deciding vote. Dare cannot be bribed, so his opponents spirited him away in a novel fashion. But the girl finds where he is hidden and brings him back, although he is much injured. He reaches his seat in time to cast the needed vote, and to astound and defeat the lobby." ...|$|E

This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> <b>As</b> the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E
