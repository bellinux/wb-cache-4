2500|$|Sutcliffe readily {{acknowledged}} {{his debt}} to his [...] "influential guide" [...] by naming {{his eldest son}} after him and writing, in a booklet published in 1927, that he doubted if Hobbs had an equal and that, as a batsman, [...] "he stands alone (and is) the best I have ever seen". Sutcliffe expressed the view that if W G Grace {{was as good as}} Jack Hobbs, [...] "then he must have been wonderful". [...] He said that Hobbs' earliest advice to him had been simply: [...] "Play your own game". Sutcliffe commented: [...] "Four words – they counted for so much. [...] They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> I wanted to know".|$|E
2500|$|... "It was Monsieur Haussmann who {{impressed}} me the most. It {{was a strange}} thing, but it was less his talents and his remarkable intelligence that appealed to me, but the defects in his character. I had {{in front of me}} one of the most extraordinary men of our time; big, strong, vigorous, energetic, {{and at the same time}} clever and devious, with a spirit full of resources. [...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was.... He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn't at all displeased.... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. [...] Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed. I told him about the Paris works and offered to put him in charge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, I {{thought as}} you had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>all</b> the beauty places in Thrums, and you ain't never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about the Den." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to. They <b>all</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to. They <b>all</b> said, kiss her; {{and said}} she'd like it. They all said it--every one of them. But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do {{it no more}} --I won't, honest." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{afterward}} <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> that <b>all</b> our provisions {{had been}} {{purchased by the}} owners at an auction sale of condemned navy stores in Sydney.|$|R
60|$|He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> three balls {{had been}} duly entered: and commented upon.|$|E
60|$|THEKLA [with a quivering voice]. And where—where is—You {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
60|$|TREHERNE. Man alive, you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> {{about it}} soon {{after we were}} wrecked.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. Your sister <b>told</b> <b>me</b> something; <b>all</b> she knew, perhaps, but not enough. Anyhow, you are {{in trouble}} about money and I promised to help." ...|$|R
6000|$|ERNEST. Gilbert, you bewilder <b>me.</b> You have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>all</b> art is, in its essence, immoral. Are {{you going}} to tell <b>me</b> now that <b>all</b> thought is, in its essence, dangerous? ...|$|R
60|$|LORETTA. [Reproachfully, still weeping.] You <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was <b>all</b> right.|$|R
60|$|The glass has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> I want to know. We {{leave the}} vestry at last.|$|E
60|$|Cecily. Yes, he has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> about poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible {{state of}} health.|$|E
60|$|After a {{while she}} dried her eyes, and when I came home she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> about it.|$|E
60|$|This time I was {{pitted against}} men--the spear <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>all</b> too plainly--but {{so long as}} they didn't take me unawares or from behind I had little fear of them.|$|R
6000|$|Ada <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{next day}} that Lord Bangley had condescended to express to her his great {{approval}} of my appearance and manner. I curtsied low when Ada <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> but <b>all</b> that I could say was, [...] "that {{the feeling was}} by no means reciprocal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have wanted}} {{no one to}} tell me. Thinking of it has <b>told</b> it <b>me</b> <b>all.</b> My own heart which is full of {{gratitude}} and love for you has told me." ...|$|R
60|$|RUTH. Yes, sir. I {{called at}} his office afterwards, and [pointing to COKESON] that gentleman <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> about it.|$|E
60|$|NICHOLLS (impatiently). That's silly, Mr. Carmody. Gaynor {{knows his}} business. (After a moment's hesitation.) He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> about Eileen's sickness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little {{affair of}} Miss Bultiwell," [...] Felixstowe replied, gazing admiringly at Jacob's well-suspended silk socks. [...] "Mary <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Guy {{listened to}} it all in {{profound}} silence. It was a strange, and for him a momentous tale. Then he said at last, as Granville finished, [...] "And you never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> this <b>all</b> these long months, Kelmscott." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly I see. And I {{perceive}} {{something else}} which {{you appear to}} have overlooked. If Amy doesn't exist--or, rather, never did exist--she cannot stand between you and Miss Campbell. Tell her what you have <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>all</b> will be well.' ...|$|R
50|$|King Edward <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>all</b> {{the battles}} {{which he had}} won, {{as soon as he}} had gained victory, he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common {{soldiers}} and kill the lords, of whom none or few escaped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> that passed," [...] said Oak, with a pharisaical {{sense that}} he was not as other shearers in this matter.|$|E
60|$|Sir John. This is {{a double}} generosity, to do me favours, and conceal 'em from me; but honest Warner here has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mark, [...] "he has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all,</b> and he {{is coming}} here to-morrow morning that he may receive an answer from yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not afraid}} of you now. Mother <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>all</b> strange men were very wicked and dangerous, but I do not think you can be. I have thought {{a great deal about}} you, and I am sorry I ran away the other night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, {{your uncle}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>all</b> {{negotiations}} are settled with Riggs and Ballinger, and he's sending off the manuscript tomorrow for immediate publication. They {{make a special}} thing {{of that sort of}} book. They published Lady Carnaby's 'Memories of Eighty Interesting Years.'" ...|$|R
60|$|NED. [Nerving {{himself for}} another effort.] Now look here, Loretta, be sensible. What {{is this about}} kisses? You haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{everything}} after <b>all.</b>|$|R
60|$|We made camp {{there beside}} the {{peaceful}} river. There Perry <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> that had befallen him since I had departed for the outer crust.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Om-at. [...] "Speak Kor-ul-lul, {{and when}} you have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all,</b> you and your fellows may return unharmed to your tribe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{wrote to}} me, Mary, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>all</b> that." [...] This he said, striving {{to hide the}} impatience which he felt; but striving in vain.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{really must}} {{tell me your}} story first," [...] Frank said, laughing. [...] "Now that {{you know you are}} cleared, you can very well wait to hear all the details, and I refuse to say a word until you have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>all</b> this means." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{remembered the}} woman. It was Martha, to whom Emily {{had given the}} money {{that night in the}} kitchen. Martha Endell--side by side with whom, he would not have seen his dear niece, Ham had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> for <b>all</b> the treasures wrecked in the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The governor,--that's my father,--he {{had heard}} of Mr. Seely. I wrote first as he <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> They knew <b>all</b> about it at Pollington {{as well as you}} do.' ...|$|R
