5|$|Altgens was {{featured}} in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing <b>two</b> <b>shots,</b> but thought someone had been setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens wrote {{that he did not}} know the origin of the gunshots until later, but he believed they came from the other side of Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} Razor 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{when he came to}} the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with <b>two</b> <b>shots.</b> The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E
5|$|All {{witnesses}} {{generally agreed}} that the first <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E

5|$|Although the Sabres {{held the}} Flyers to <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> {{in the first}} period of game one, eight in the second, and were the {{beneficiaries}} of a 1:04 two-man advantage at one point, the game remained scoreless until the third period when the Flyers connected four times in a 4–1 victory. In game two, the Sabres were held to 19 shots on goal with none coming after Bobby Clarke scored at the 6:43 mark of the third period.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the films}} {{directed}} by Umboh were romantic melodramas, a genre which had existed in Indonesia since the 1950s but was refined by Umboh. However, he preferred shooting films with a social message; he considered Pengemis dan Tukang Becak his favourite film. When shooting, Umboh minimised his use of master shots, instead preferring to use medium and close-up shots; his obituary in Kompas notes that around 80per cent of any given Umboh film used these latter <b>two</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters in the frame. For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a <b>two</b> <b>shot</b> but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in <b>two</b> <b>shot</b> while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in <b>two</b> <b>shot</b> when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|R
5|$|On February 29, 2016, Hyman was {{recalled}} by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Prior {{to being}} recalled, he recorded 13 goals and 20 assists in 54 {{games for the}} Marlies that season and lead the entire AHL in short-handed goals. He made his NHL debut {{in a game against}} the Tampa Bay Lightning later that night, recording 15:58 of ice time, 22 shifts, <b>two</b> <b>shots,</b> and one hit. He subsequently scored his first career NHL goal one week later on March 7 against Chad Johnson of the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
5|$|Renoir used few close-ups {{or reverse}} shots {{and most of}} the shots are <b>two</b> <b>shots.</b> The hunt scene differs {{from the rest of the}} film; it uses rapid editing whereas most of the film uses long takes of {{dialogue}} or action. Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade Technicolor to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E
40|$|Conference Name:International Conference on Advanced Engineering Materials and Technology (AEMT 2011). Conference Address: Sanya, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:JUL 29 - 31, 2011. Three Dimensional Molded Interconnect Devices (3 D-MID) has {{enormous}} potential for rationalization in both manufacturing {{process and the}} freedom to design of mechatronic products. <b>Two</b> <b>shot</b> molding {{is one of the most}} important and commonly used methods among the various MID manufacturing processes. Currently, there is a lack of effective design and simulation tools that can be used for MID with <b>two</b> <b>shot</b> molding. In this paper, an integrated product model using feature technology, some MID-specific design functions, and one special interface based on the API of Moldflow Plastics Insight (MPI) and the COM-Technology are presented. These developed product model, functions and interface increase the efficiency of the MID design process, and the design and simulation integrated environment also towards the rational and optimal design of MID products with <b>two</b> <b>shot</b> molding...|$|R

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the oil platform, which was shot {{in a way that}} recalls a scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front of a green screen. Separate footage of the rig exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of the rig with CGI—was then filmed, and the <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> were composited on top of one another.|$|E
5|$|Two men are {{surveying}} {{an area of}} the Apalachicola National Forest in Leon County, Florida {{when they}} are attacked and killed by unseen assailants with glowing red eyes. Later that day, Michael Asekoff and his son, Louis, are hunting for possums with their dog, Bo, in the same stretch of woods. Upon discovering a surveyor's bloody jacket, the father orders his son to take the dog and run home. As the son and dog take off, <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> are heard.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with <b>two</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before Euro 2000, Nedvěd {{was unable}} to train {{normally}} due to an ankle injury. The Czechs' first match (against the Netherlands) saw him and international teammate Jan Koller hit the woodwork without scoring, before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1–0. In the second match, against France, he was fouled, where the resultant Czech penalty was converted by Karel Poborský to even the score at 1–1. Despite <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> on goal, Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2–1. He played in the third group match, against Denmark; despite the Czechs' 2–0 victory, the team was eliminated from the tournament. After Euro 2000, Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří Němec.|$|E
5|$|Imperial troops mainly used Minié rifles, {{which were}} much more accurate, lethal, and had a much longer range than the smoothbore Gewehr guns, although, being also muzzle-loading, they were {{similarly}} limited to <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> per minute. Improved breech-loading mechanisms, such as the Snider, developing {{a rate of about}} ten shots a minute, are known to have been used by troops of the Chōshū Domain against the Shogunate's Shōgitai, at the Battle of Ueno in July 1868. In {{the second half of the}} conflict, in the northeast theater, Tosa Province troops are known to have used American-made Spencer repeating rifles. American-made handguns were also popular, such as the 1863 Smith & Wesson Army No 2, which was imported to Japan by the Scottish trader Thomas Blake Glover and used by the Satsuma forces.|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E

5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After <b>two</b> <b>shots,</b> Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired <b>two</b> <b>shots</b> and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
