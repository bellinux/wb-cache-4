5|$|In Maleficent (2014), a live-action re-imagining of the {{animated}} film in which Sleeping Beauty is retold {{from the perspective}} of the villain, Aurora is portrayed by actress Elle Fanning, while actress Janet McTeer voices an elderly version of the character in the role of film's narrator. The princess is raised by Maleficent after first being cursed by the fairy in an act of revenge against her father King Stefan, only for a strong mother-daughter bond to develop between the characters; Aurora affectionately refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. When her curse is finally fulfilled, Aurora is awoken by Maleficent's remorseful kiss <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> as opposed to a prince's. Aurora defends Maleficent from her father, and eventually returns her wings to her when she is crowned queen of both the human kingdom and the fairy kingdom known as the Moors.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E
500|$|In {{one of the}} song's rare mixed reviews, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe {{enjoyed the}} song itself but {{felt that it was}} {{unnecessary}} and melodramatic, writing, [...] "The movie doesn't need , for one thing. For another, their archness (Gothel sings with a forearm <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead)</b> suggests that the filmmakers want {{to have it both ways}} — to be sincere and to sneer." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the song a negative review, feeling that it was equally as unmemorable as the other tracks and writing, [...] "It's hard to imagine someone humming ... 'Mother Knows Best' when leaving the theater." ...|$|E

2500|$|The American Society for Psychical Research wanted further investigation. In 1926, a {{committee}} of three professors (Knight Dunlap, Henry C. McComas and Robert Williams Wood) was sent to Boston. Crandon had a luminous star attached <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> identifying the location of {{her face in the}} dark. After a few minutes, a narrow dark rod appeared over a luminous checkerboard which had been placed on the table opposite Crandon. It moved from side to side and picked up an object. As it passed in front of Wood he lightly touched it with the tip of his finger and followed it back to a point very near Crandon's mouth. Wood thought it probable she was holding the rod by her teeth. He took hold of the tip and very quietly pinched it. It felt like a knitting needle covered with one or two layers of soft leather. Though the committee had been warned that touching the ectoplasm could result in the illness or death of the medium, neither Crandon nor the [...] "ectoplasm" [...] rod showed any reaction to Wood's actions. At the end of the sitting, Wood dictated his actions to the stenographer. Upon hearing this, Crandon gave a shriek and fainted. She was carried {{out of the room and}} the committee was asked to depart. Wood was never invited again.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the turn}} of the last century, an Iyer widow was never allowed <b>to</b> remarry. Once <b>her</b> husband dies, an Iyer woman had <b>to</b> tonsure <b>her</b> head. She had to remove the kunkumam or the {{vermilion}} mark on <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> and was required <b>to</b> smear <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> with the sacred ashes. All these practices have, however, greatly dimimished with the enactment of reforms.|$|R

60|$|She {{had said}} {{what she wanted}} to say. She had made her testament. She closed her eyes. He was amazed to find this {{grotesque}} old creature had suddenly become beautiful, in that silvery vein of beauty one sometimes finds in very old men.

It had always been his habit <b>to</b> kiss <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> when he chanced <b>to</b> meet <b>her</b> about the house at Greshamsbury. She had been younger and more childish then; but even now she was but a child to him, so he kissed her {{as he had been}} wont to do. She blushed {{slightly}} as she looked up into his face, and said: [...] "Oh, Mr Gresham, I am so glad to see you here again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sadhana {{introduced}} the fringe hairstlye in Indian film industry {{in her first}} film Love in Simla. R.K.

Sadhana says, [...] "They tried to stick a strip near the hair-line, but it didn’t work out." [...] Nayyar then suggested she go for the fringe style as was then sported by the Hollywood actress Audrey Hepburn. The fringe soon became popular and a fashion fad in the 1960s.|$|R
60|$|Eve {{threw down}} the book {{she had been}} reading and leaned {{over the side of}} her chair, looking at me. She seemed no longer angry. There was, indeed, a touch of that {{softness}} in her face which I had noticed once before and which had encouraged me <b>to</b> hope. <b>Her</b> <b>forehead</b> was a little puckered, her dear eyes a little wistful. She looked at me very earnestly; but when I would have moved toward her she held out <b>her</b> hand <b>to</b> keep me back.|$|R

5000|$|After an {{operation}} on Anderson's arm, she recuperated at the Mommsen Nursing Home in Berlin. There, in October 1925, the Gilliards saw Anderson again. Anderson did not recognise Gilliard, which she later claimed {{was because he}} had shaved off his goatee beard. When he asked <b>her</b> <b>to</b> [...] "tell me everything about your past", she refused. According to Gilliard, Anderson mistook Shura for Grand Duchess Olga {{on the second day}} of their visit. At a subsequent meeting, Anderson mimicked the actions of Anastasia when she asked Shura <b>to</b> moisten <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> with eau de Cologne, which left Shura shaken.|$|R

60|$|Nor {{would an}} angel with a shade of human passion in his {{temperament}} have been contented with <b>her</b> <b>forehead.</b> <b>Her</b> mouth {{had all the}} richness of youth, and the full enticing curves and ruby colour of Anglo-Saxon beauty. Caroline Waddington was no pale, passionless goddess; her graces and perfections were human, and in being so were the more dangerous <b>to</b> humanity. <b>Her</b> <b>forehead</b> we have said, or should have said, was perfect; we dare not affirm quite so much in praise of her mouth: there was sometimes a hardness there, not in {{the lines of the}} feature itself, but in the expression which it conveyed, a want of tenderness, perhaps of trust, and too much self-confidence, it may be, for a woman's character. The teeth within it, however, were never excelled by any that ever graced the face of a woman.|$|R

The rush of the cold air began <b>to</b> revive <b>her.</b> She opened her eyes, and Suzette said, severely, [...] "What has come over you, Adeline? Aren't you well?" [...] and as Adeline answered nothing, she went on: [...] "I don't believe she knows where she is. Let us get her into the library on the lounge." ...|$|R

In his memory, young Sylar chases his father outside of the restaurant and witnesses his father murder his mother in their car using telekinesis <b>to</b> cut <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> much like Sylar's own weapon of choice. After his flashback ends, Sylar vows to gain revenge on his father and demands that Luke return home to his mother.|$|R
