5000|$|Collins {{was granted}} US patent 814,942 on March 13, 1906 for an arc-transmitter {{improvement}} which separated the <b>telephone</b> <b>microphone</b> circuit from the arc circuit, {{to avoid the}} problem of the arc current burning out the microphone. Although this was merely an incremental improvement on existing arc-transmitter technology, the company's stock promotion advertisements claimed this patent was [...] "a broad one, covering the fundamental principles for transmitting and receiving articulate speech without connecting wires" [...] that was supposedly [...] "considered by the highest authorities on patent law {{to be one of the}} strongest to be issued since the one granted to Bell in 1876".

5000|$|Their {{style of}} music is often {{referred}} to as [...] "quirky folk", which incorporates acoustic instrumentation including banjo, guitar, upright bass, mandolin, ukelele, glockenspiel, djembe, and their signature golden egg. Twin harmonies layered on top of acoustic instrumentation are coupled with Laurie’s beatboxing and inventive use of a looping machine, and Katelyn’s repurposed <b>telephone</b> <b>microphone.</b> The use of electronics set their sound apart, creating an eclectic and eccentric blend of folk, roots, pop and fun. A Shook Twins staple is also the addition of choruses or lines from other contemporary songs (Edward Sharpe in Shook Twins “Toll Free,” for example) to their own songs, remix-style. The band members have performed with or opened for Ryan Adams, Mason Jennings, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Sarah Jarosz, Laura Veirs, Trace Bundy, Jonatha Brooke, Michelle Shocked, Crooked Still, Jason Webley, John Craigie, Elephant Revival, The Head and the Heart and many more.|$|E
5000|$|At {{least one}} company, Audiovox, built {{and may have}} offered an {{electric}} solid-body as early as 1932. Audiovox electric guitars were built by Paul Tutmarc who is also credited as the co-inventor of the magnetic pickup along with Art Stimpson, and the fretted electric bass guitar. Bob Wisner worked for Paul converting tube radio amplifiers into guitar amplifiers and eventually developing his own amplifier circuits so Paul's instruments could be sold along with their own amplifiers. Paul was unsuccessful at obtaining a patent for his magnetic pickup as it was too similar to the <b>telephone</b> <b>microphone</b> coil sensor device. Audiovox production was handed over to Paul's son, Bud Tutmarc, who continued building these instruments under the brand, [...] "Bud-Electro" [...] until the early 1950s. Bud Tutmarc had been delegated by the senior Tutmarc the task of winding the pickup coils used on his father's and he continued producing them for his own guitars. He used horseshoe magnets in a single-coil and later a hum cancelling dual coil configuration. Bob Wisner was hired by Rickenbacher, later spelled Rickenbacker and may have passed on Tutmarc's magnetic pickup technology and helped them develop the more familiar bar magnet and pole-piece pickup construction still widely used today for their cast aluminum electric guitar, nicknamed The Frying Pan or The Pancake Guitar, beginning in 1933.|$|E

40|$|The {{recently}} developed i-vector framework for speaker recognition {{has set a}} new performance standard in the research field. An i-vector is a compact representation of a speaker utterance extracted from a low-dimensional total variability subspace. Prior to classification using a cosine kernel, i-vectors are projected into an LDA space {{in order to reduce}} inter-session variability and enhance speaker discrimination. The accurate estimation of this LDA space from a training dataset is crucial to classification performance. A typical training dataset, however, does not consist of utterances acquired from all sources of interest (ie., <b>telephone,</b> <b>microphone</b> and interview speech sources) for each speaker. This has the effect of introducing source-related variation in the between-speaker covariance matrix and results in an incomplete representation of the within-speaker scatter matrix used for LDA. Proposed is a novel source-normalised-and-weighted LDA algorithm developed to improve the robustness of i-vector-based speaker recognition under both mis-matched evaluation conditions and conditions for which insufficient speech resources are available for adequate system development. Evaluated on the recent NIST 2008 and 2010 Speaker Recognition Evaluations (SRE), the proposed technique demonstrated improvements of up to 31 % in minimum DCF and EER under mis-matched and sparsely-resourced conditions.

The pitch values in the PV files were manually extracted; they were mainly used for the matching performance excluding the performance of the pitch extractor. The sampling period of pitch values in the PV file was 32 ms, and there were 250 pitch values in each query file since the recording time was 8 s [13, 14, 17].|$|R
