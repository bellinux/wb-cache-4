5|$|O'Reilly {{eventually}} removed Hutton {{and ended}} with 3/178 off 85 overs. Nevertheless, these compared favourably with Fleetwood-Smith's 1/298 off 87 overs. O'Reilly was the only Australian to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> solitary wicket, and rated Hutton's knock as the finest innings played against him. Australia collapsed to lose by an innings and 579 runs, the heaviest defeat in Test history. O'Reilly's lack of success went with The Oval Test in 1934, {{when he took a}} total of 4/151.|$|E
5|$|There are exoplanets {{that are}} much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, {{and there are also}} exoplanets {{that are much}} farther from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the {{shortest}} known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thousand years to orbit, e.g. 1RXS1609 b.|$|E

25|$|The {{week before}} he left for Mexico, Weston briefly reunited with Mather and took several nudes of her lying in the sand at Redondo Beach. These images were very {{different}} from his previous nude studies - sharply focused and showing her entire body in relation to the natural setting.

25|$|Wind power {{offers a}} {{reliability}} benefit in that its generation (though not its transmission) is highly decentralized. Sabotage and industrial accidents can be potential {{threats to the}} large, centrally located, power plants that provide most of Texas’ electricity. Should one of these plants be damaged, repairs could <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year, possibly creating power shortages {{on a scale that}} Texans have never experienced before. Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption. However, wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired. The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged, the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymptotic}} computational {{complexity of}} these algorithms may be misleading, {{because they can}} only be run on inputs of very small size. In a 1991 comparison, Hoon Hong estimated that Collins' doubly exponential procedure {{would be able to}} solve a problem whose size is described by setting all the above parameters to 2, in less than a second, whereas the algorithms of Grigoriev, Vorbjov, and Renegar would instead <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> million years. In 1993, Joos, Roy, and Solernó suggested that {{it should be possible to}} make small modifications to the exponential-time procedures to make them faster in practice than cylindrical algebraic decision, as well as faster in theory. However, as of 2009, it was still the case that general methods for the first-order theory of the reals remained superior in practice to the singly exponential algorithms specialized to the existential theory of the reals.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the {{fighting}} had begun, the OAS met in an urgent session and called for an immediate cease-fire and a withdrawal of El Salvador's forces from Honduras. El Salvador resisted the pressures from the OAS for several days, demanding that Honduras first agree to pay reparations for the attacks on Salvadoran citizens and guarantee the safety of those Salvadorans remaining in Honduras. A cease-fire was arranged {{on the night of}} July 18; it took full effect only on July 20. El Salvador continued until July 29 to resist pressures to withdraw its troops. Then a combination of pressures led El Salvador to agree to a withdrawal in the first days of August. Those persuasive pressures included the possibility of OAS economic sanctions against El Salvador and the dispatch of OAS observers to Honduras to oversee the security of Salvadorans remaining in that country. The actual war had lasted just over four days, but it would <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> decade to arrive at a final peace settlement.|$|E

25|$|East Germans were {{subjected}} to far more stringent restrictions. The East German constitution of 1949 granted citizens a theoretical right to leave the country, though it was hardly respected in practice. Even this limited right was removed in the constitution of 1968 which confined citizens' freedom of movement to the area within the state borders. It was not until November 1964 that {{they were allowed to}} visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. East German pensioners were able to visit the West for up to four weeks in a year, but were not permitted to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> token 10East German marks with them, requiring them to depend on the support of relatives, churches and the West German government. As they were retired, they were seen by the East German government as economically unimportant and no great loss if they defected. The vast majority, though, chose to return {{home at the end of}} their stay.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known is Miguel Santiago, who sells about forty pieces a year. Some of these sales are {{individual}} pieces and others are multiple sets such as Frida Kalo surrounded by monkeys. Sets are usually sold to foreign buyers for between $300 and $800 USD and have been sent to Europe, Japan and the United States. Sets often <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> month to make and his work is considered to be in {{the high end of the}} market. Santiago’s orders extend more than two years in advance. Santiago used to work with a brother and later with a nephew, but today he works mostly solo with his father to help. Another {{of the best}} known is one of the few female entrepreneurs in the market, Olga Santiago. She does not carve or paint, rather she hires others to do the work while she administrates. However, she signs all the pieces. Many of her carvers and painters are young men who leave quickly to form workshops of their own. While her workshop is not the only one run in this manner, hers is the newest and most successful. Olga’s client base is tourists, which are often brought to her by tour guides, taxi drivers and the like for a commission, and wholesalers.|$|E

500|$|Although {{several key}} {{elements}} of Evans's designs—such as bucket elevators and Archimedean screws—were merely modified rather than invented by him, the combination of many machines into an automated and continuous production line was a unique idea that would prove pivotal to both the Industrial Revolution {{and the development of}} mass production. Scientific and technical historians now generally credit Evans as the first in a line of industrialists that culminated with Henry Ford and the modern assembly line. His concept of industrial automation was far ahead of its time, and the paradigm shift within manufacturing towards that concept would <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> century to be fully realized. However continuous process manufacturing would spread from Evans's milling designs, first to related industries such as brewing and baking, then eventually {{to a wide variety of}} products, as technology and prevailing opinion caught up. Evans contributions were later deemed to be so important that eminent industrial historian Sigfried Giedion would conclude that in this respect, Evans [...] "opens a new chapter in the history of mankind".|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Hurricane Andrew {{destroyed}} the company headquarters. The building, located on Old Cutler Rd. in Miami, {{was right in}} the center of the path of the hurricane. Located on the shoreline at the terminus of 184th St. (Eureka Drive), [...] the highest storm surge levels was recorded (16.9ft) at the site. The building suffered more than [...] in damage and pushed the company from its offices during one of its more significant product pushes. Not only was the company forced from its facilities, roughly 300 members of its 700+ staff were left homeless. Immediately after the storm, Gibbons began a program to help get the company back on track. The company's recovery was helped due to pre-planning before the storm's landfall; Corporate backoffice data was moved to Seattle, Washington before the storm struck in order to safeguard critical records, and the company established a temporary [...] "command center" [...] at the Doral Resort and Country Club in Miami within eight days of the hurricanes passing. Additional operations were temporarily decentralized by temporarily shifting some corporate functions to regional offices. The facility would eventually <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year to rebuild, finally opening in September 1993.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the voyage, the James Caird which, in {{addition}} to Shackleton and Worsley, also carried McNish, sailors John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy, as well as the experienced Tom Crean, encountered the ice but Worsley found a way through and into the open ocean. The crew set up two watches for the journey, which eventually would take 16 days, in strong and heavy seas, to reach South Georgia. [...] For most of the voyage, the weather proved to be stormy and so overcast Worsley was unable to <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> few sightings with his sextant. [...] He described one sighting as [...] "...cuddling the mast with one arm and swinging fore and aft round the mast, sextant and all..." [...] and he would [...] "...catch the sun when the boat leaped her highest on the crest of a sea...". At times the sea conditions were so rough he was braced by the other crew members when taking his sightings. On occasion, the temperature was bitter and each man would spend one minute shifts chipping away ice that coated the top surfaces of the James Caird, affecting its buoyancy. The heavy seas meant there was considerable risk that a man could go overboard.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} [...] "conceived and {{launched}} fast compared to most stadium tours" [...] according to Live Nation, who noted that most tours {{of this nature}} <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year of planning, compared to the On the Run Tour that took around one month. [...] "It came together quite quickly, around mid-March", Omar Al-Joulani of Live Nation North America commented. [...] "By April, we had everything together, and once the routing was in place we had about three weeks until the tour was announced." [...] Following the general sale of tour dates, fans were left concerned as the July 11, 2014 show in East Rutherford, New Jersey remained pending to go on sale for many weeks, despite all other dates already being available to the public. Some reports stated {{that the reason for}} this was that the state of New Jersey had implemented a legislation resulting in 95% of tickets for an event having to be available to the public. The show was eventually put on sale to the public on June 4, 2014. The On the Run Tour was the first tour {{to be a part of}} [...] "Official Events" [...] – the collaboration of Facebook and Live Nation in which the size and scale of Ticketmaster's database is leveraged as events promoted by Live Nation are imported to Artists' Facebook Pages as [...] "Official Events", providing fans with direct links to Ticketmaster to purchase verified tickets.|$|E
