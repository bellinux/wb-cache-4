5|$|When the Hugo awards were {{begun in}} 1953, each Worldcon {{organizing}} committee decided what awards <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give.</b> Several awards were presented {{over the next}} few years which were not repeated in later conventions, unlike the primary categories which are still presented—such as Best Novel. These awards were the Best Cover Artist, Best Interior Illustrator, Excellence in Fact Articles, Best New SF Author or Artist, and #1 Fan Personality Hugos at the initial 1953 awards ceremony, the Best Feature Writer, Best Book Reviewer, and Most Promising New Author awards in 1956, the Outstanding Actifan award in 1958, and the Best New Author of 1958 award in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
5|$|Initially the new {{government}} had little success, but in 1220 the fortunes of Henry's government began to improve. The Pope allowed Henry to be crowned for a second time, using {{a new set of}} royal regalia. The fresh coronation was intended to affirm the authority of the King; Henry promised to restore the powers of the Crown, and the barons swore that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> back the royal castles and pay their debts to the Crown, on the threat of excommunication. Hubert, accompanied by Henry, moved into Wales to suppress Llywelyn in 1223, and in England his forces steadily reclaimed Henry's castles. The effort against the remaining recalcitrant barons came to a head in 1224 with the siege of Bedford Castle, which Henry and Hubert besieged for eight weeks; when it finally fell, almost all of the garrison were executed.|$|E

5|$|From 1808, {{a number}} of detractors argued that the {{navigation}} was in a poor condition, hoping to force Hollis to concede water rights to mills, and traffic declined. Another Act of 1811 allowed Hollis to raise the tolls, and eight years later, he held {{a meeting at the}} Winchester Guildhall, explaining why he needed to raise the tolls further. The meeting asked him to postpone his next Bill for a year, in return for which <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> him £1,200 for one year's tolls, wharfage and rent, he would spend £600 on repairs, and the remaining £600 would amount to 5 per cent interest on the estimated value of the navigation, which was then £12,000. He obtained his Act of Parliament a year later, which raised the tolls, but the Commissioners reduced freight charges at the same time, resulting in the operation being more profitable for Hollis and less so for the barge owners.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal team in Canada {{depended}} on the Americans for supplies of heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail, British Columbia, (which was under American contract), as well as technical information about plutonium. The Americans said that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> heavy water to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by du Pont. Despite doing much good work, by June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab {{had come to a}} complete standstill. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. John Cockcroft became the director. The Americans supported the project with information and visits. They also supplied material, for example, uranium and heavy water. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went critical in September 1945.|$|E

As part of the agreement, the Jews of Khaybar were to {{evacuate}} the area, and surrender their wealth. The Muslims would cease warfare and not hurt any of the Jews. After the agreement, some Jews approached Muhammad with a request to continue to cultivate their orchards and remain in the oasis. In return, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> one-half of their produce to the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{withdrawing}} from the presidential race in July 2011, Norris maintained considerable and, in some cases, increased public support. A poll taken one week after Norris withdrew from the presidential race, showed a large increase in public support for his Presidency if they were given the choice {{to vote for him}} (topping the poll by a considerable margin) with 40 per cent of respondents now saying they would vote Norris number one in the preferential voting electoral system and 50 per cent saying <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> him a vote.|$|E

In Walk, teams had to count and add up the number of stairs in the Town Hall Tower and one of the towers in St. Mary's Basilica.

25|$|England {{lost three}} early wickets {{in their second}} innings, but their middle order rallied, and they reached 138, despite both Schwarz and Vogler {{getting a lot of}} {{movement}} with their bowling. South Africa needed 256 runs in two hours and forty minutes to secure an unlikely victory. Their captain, Sherwell, announced that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> it a go, and the opening batsmen, Sinclair and Faulkner began well, moving the score to 61 runs after 35 minutes. Three wickets from Hirst restricted the South Africans, but further attacking batting from the South Africans entertained the crowds until the match was stopped due to poor light, resulting in a draw.|$|E
25|$|The Jews of Khaybar finally {{surrendered}} {{after seeing}} {{no way out}} and were allowed {{to live in the}} oasis on the condition that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> one-half of their produce to the Muslims. Jews continued to live in the oasis for several more years until they were expelled by caliph Umar. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews served as a precedent for provisions in the Islamic law requiring the exaction of tribute known as jizya from Dīn under Muslim rule, and confiscation of land belonging to non-Muslims into the collective property of the Muslim community. In return, non-Muslim citizens were permitted to practice their faith, to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy, to be entitled to Muslim state's protection from outside aggression, and to be exempted from military service and the zakat, which is obligatory upon Muslim citizens.|$|E
25|$|In the 2003 season, Harvick {{teamed with}} now former crew chief Todd Berrier in the Cup Series, {{with whom he}} had won the Busch {{championship}} in 2001. Together, they won the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. Harvick and his team jumped to fifth in the 2003 point standings, coming within 252 points ahead of Matt Kenseth. In the Busch Series, Harvick was teamed with Johnny Sauter, driving the No. 21 Hershey's-sponsored PayDay car. The two would combine for three wins, 16 Top 5's, and 24 Top 10's, with Harvick posting all three wins. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> Childress the NASCAR Busch Series owner's championship that season, with the driver's championship going to Brian Vickers. It would be {{the first time that the}} championship would be split between two teams. Harvick competed in 19 of the 34 races, and Sauter competed in the other 15. Harvick also scored eight pole positions and finished 16th in the final point standings.|$|E

25|$|Stantien & Becker would dig up {{many pieces}} of amber shaped as amulets or knick-knacks. At first <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> them out as souvenirs, but then started {{collecting}} these {{items from the}} Mid Neolithic and the Bronze Ages. Richard Klebs, professor at Königsberg University, described 435 items (pendants, buttons, tubular beads, discs, and figurines of humans and animals) in his book Stone Age Amber Adornments in 1882. These ancient Schwarzorter Funde are considered to contain the earliest known amber carving finds from the Baltic Sea area (with amber carvings thousands of years older in other locations). About 150 items have detailed images. The collection was exhibited in Berlin, St. Petersburg, London, Chicago. After Klebs' death, Königsberg University purchased his collection. However, during the turbulent times of World War II and the expulsions from East Prussia most of the large collection in Königsberg was destroyed or stolen {{and only a few}} items were saved at Göttingen University, previously the sister university of Königsberg. But scientists were able to make replicas from detailed illustrations in Klebs' book.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Madhusudana Saraswati of Bengal {{organised}} {{a section}} of the Naga tradition of armed sannyasi in order to protect Hindus from the intolerant Mughal rulers. Although generally said to abide by the principle of non-violence (ahimsā), these Dashanami monks had long been forming akhara for the practice of both yoga and martial arts. Such warrior-ascetics have been recorded from 1500 to as late as the 18th century, although tradition attributes their creation to the 8th-century philosopher Sankaracharya. They began as a stratum of Rajput warriors who would gather after harvest and arm peasants into militarised units, effectively acting as a self-defense squad. Prevalent in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Bengal, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> up their occupations and leave their families to live as mercenaries. Naga sadhu today rarely practice any form of fighting other than wrestling, but still carry trishula, swords, canes and spears. To this day their retreats are called chhauni or armed camps, and they have been known to hold mock jousts among themselves. As recently as the 1950s, it was not unusual for Naga sadhu to strike to kill someone over issues of honour.|$|E
25|$|Returning {{home for}} their final home {{series of the}} regular season, the Blue Jays battled the Red Sox for 3 games. Marcus Stroman made his first home start in 2015, holding the Red Sox to 1 run over 7 innings in the first game, which Toronto won 6–1. The win gave Toronto a 4-game lead in their division, however <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> that game back the {{following}} day, losing 7–6 to Boston, coupled with the Yankees defeating the Mets. The Blue Jays led the game 4–2, heading into the ninth inning, however Roberto Osuna and Aaron Sanchez would combine to give up 5 runs to the Red Sox. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth, Jose Bautista hit a 2-run home run, however the comeback would fall short. The Blue Jays would lose another game off their division lead in the rubber match, losing 4–3 to Boston after committing 3 errors. Following their series loss to Boston, the Blue Jays faced the Yankees for the final time in the 2015 regular season. Toronto would take the first game, 4–2, after another quality start from David Price. Losing 3–2 in the ninth inning of the second game, Dioner Navarro hit a solo home run to tie the game. The Blue Jays would load the bases later in the inning, but were unable to score the winning run. In the top of the tenth, the Yankees scored 3 runs off a home run by Greg Bird, and the Blue Jays would go on to lose the game 6–4. In the final game, Toronto and New York battled to a scoreless tie through the first 5 innings. In the bottom of the sixth, Kevin Pillar broke the tie with an RBI single, and the Blue Jays took a 1–0 lead. In the seventh, Russell Martin hit a 3-run home run to lead Toronto to a 4–0 victory. Marcus Stroman earned his third win in as many starts, pitching 7 shutout innings against the Yankees and lowering his ERA to 1.89. Toronto's last 3 regular season home games would be played against the Rays. R.A. Dickey started {{the first game of the}} series and earned his 100th career win, 5–3 over Tampa Bay. The win also clinched a postseason berth for the Blue Jays, their first since the 1993 season. The second game featured a match between former Rays ace David Price and current ace Chris Archer, who was mentored by Price early in his career. Though many had thought the game would be a pitcher's duel, the two combined to allow 14 runs through the first 4 innings, with Toronto eventually coming out on top, 10–8. The Blue Jays would complete the sweep, winning the final game of the series 5–4 thanks to Josh Donaldson's franchise record third walk-off home run of the season.|$|E
