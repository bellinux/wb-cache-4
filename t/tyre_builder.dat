50|$|Jimmy Keddie {{was born}} in Milnathort, Scotland; he was a <b>tyre</b> <b>builder</b> when he enlisted in the Territorial Army at the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. He served in France and at Dunkirk and after returning to England transferred to the Royal Air Force as an aircrew candidate with the service number 659018. Completing training as a bomb aimer he flew night bombing operations with No. 61 Squadron RAF in the crew of Squadron Leader Kenneth Burns DSO DFC*. He transferred to the Pathfinder Force along with his pilot joining No. 97 Squadron RAF. With a strong recommendation dated 29 May 1943 he was awarded a Distinguished Flying Medal for his bravery as a bomb aimer during bombing missions commencing January 1943 against targets such as DÃ¼sseldorf, Hamburg, Duisburg, Berlin, Essen, La Spezia, Pilson and Dortmund. His Avro Lancaster was damaged by anti-aircraft fire over Pilsen in May 1943 and over Turin in July 1943. The DFM was announced in the London Gazette of 13 July 1943. Meanwhile, Keddie was commissioned as pilot officer on 3 June 1943. before quickly being promoted flying officer on 2 December 1943. He was promoted flight lieutenant on 26 May 1945 after returning from captivity.|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{contribution to}} urinary mutagenicity of occupational exposures in the rubber industry was studied by assaying the urine concentrates of 72 workmen (44 smokers) employed in a tyre plant. Twenty three clerks (16 smokers) {{engaged in the}} administrative department of the same factory served as presumptive unexposed controls. XAD- 2 resin concentrates of urine samples were assayed in the plate incorporation test and in the microtitre fluctuation assay with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 98, and TA 100. Furthermore, the in vitro mutagenicity of the major raw materials in use at the plant was determined in the plate incorporation assay with S typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 98, and TA 100. The results obtained from the urinary mutagenicity study show that smoking habits, but not occupation, were statistically {{significantly related to the}} appearance of a urinary mutagenicity that was detectable with strain TA 98. A possible synergistic effect of occupation with smoking was observed among <b>tyre</b> <b>builders</b> who were also smokers. The study of the raw materials showed that three technical grade materials were weakly active as mutagens in strain TA 98 in the absence (poly-p-dinitrosobenzene) or in the presence of metabolic activation (mixed diaryl-p-phenylendiamines and tetramethyltiuram disulphide). The latter chemical was also weakly active in strain TA 100...|$|R
