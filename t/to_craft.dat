5|$|Ilaiyaraaja {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music. This allowed him <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> a rich tapestry of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences. The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of Crafted With Pride in the USA stimuli and country of origin on consumers' attitudes toward and evaluations of clothing. The sample consisted of 112 female college students enrolled {{in one of three}} courses in the College of Home Economics, Spring term, 1988. A two-by-four complete factorial between subjects experimental design was employed. The independent variables consisted of two levels of exposure <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride in the USA stimuli (exposure and non-exposure) and four levels of country of origin labels (made in the USA, made in a developing country, made in a developed country and no identifying label). Subjects were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the eight experimental cells. Dependent measures consisted of subjects' evaluations of a stimulus item on twenty-five evaluative criteria using a seven-point unipolar semantic differential scale, a measure of the price subjects expected to pay for the stimulus item and the perception of the price as expensive, inexpensive or neither expensive or inexpensive. The 25 items on the evaluative measure were factor analyzed. The resulting six factors included "status/prestige," "fashionability," "objective product criteria," "subjective product criteria," "color," and "media promotion. " Findings of the study indicate that there was no significant difference between the prices subjects indicated they would expect to pay for the stimulus item based on exposure/non-exposure <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride cues. In addition, there was no significant difference in the prices subjects indicated they would expect to pay for the stimulus item based on its country of origin. Findings also revealed that there were no significant differences among subjects' ratings of the stimulus item on the six evaluative criteria factors for the exposure <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride in the USA cues variable or for the country of origin variable. Additional findings indicated that there was an interaction between the exposure <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> with Pride cues and country of origin variable for the objective product criteria. The mean scores for the treatment made in the USA/not exposed <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride in the USA cues were significantly higher than the scores for the treatment made in the USA/exposed <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride cues. The mean scores for the treatment made in the USA/not exposed <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride cues were significantly higher than for the treatment made in Italy/not exposed <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride cues. In addition, the mean scores for the treatment made in Italy/exposed <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride cues were significantly higher than the scores for the treatment made in Italy/ not exposed <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride cues. In conclusion, neither exposure <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride in the USA cues nor country of origin had an effect on subjects' ratings of the stimulus item on the evaluative factors or on the price subjects expected to pay for the stimulus item. However, country of origin and exposure <b>to</b> <b>Crafted</b> With Pride in the USA cues interacted to affect ratings of the stimulus item for the objective product criteria factor which included items closely related to the quality and value aspects of the Crafted With Pride in the USA advertising campaign...|$|R
5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such as gold, copper, and iron {{may have been}} noticed in prehistory and, {{in light of their}} malleability, led to the first attempts <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> metal ornaments, tools, and weapons.

5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life.

5|$|In {{addition}} to finding weaponry {{out in the}} wastelands, the player can also create their own. <b>To</b> <b>craft</b> such weapons, the player must use a workbench, possess either the necessary schematics or the right Perk, and scavenge for the items needed to make them. These weapons usually possess significant advantages over other weapons of their type. Each weapon's schematic has three copies that can be found, and possessing additional copies improves the condition (or number) of items produced at the workbench, while a higher repair skill {{will result in a}} better starting condition for the related weapon. Weapon schematics can be found lying in certain locations, bought from vendors, or received as quest rewards.|$|E

5|$|Since their inception, U2 have {{developed}} and maintained a distinctly recognisable sound, {{with emphasis on}} melodic instrumentals and expressive, larger-than-life vocals. This approach is rooted partly in the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite {{at a time when}} the band was not known for musical proficiency. The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature delay <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> his distinctive guitar work, coupled with an Irish-influenced drone played against his syncopated melodies that ultimately yields a well-defined ambient, chiming sound. Bono has nurtured his falsetto operatic voice and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social, political, and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting. In addition, the Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band.|$|E
5|$|Sir Joseph {{commissioned}} Pistrucci <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> a cameo of King George III. As the King was {{ill with}} porphyria, Pistrucci modelled the likeness from Marchant's three-shilling bank token, {{and cut it}} in red jasper for a fee of 50 guineas. Banks showed the cameo to William Wellesley-Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington and the Master of the Mint, who was greatly impressed {{by the quality of}} what he saw. At this time, the Royal Mint was preparing to issue new gold and silver coins as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816, and in June of that year, Pole decided to hire Pistrucci to make models in stone for the new coinage that could be converted into steel dies by the Mint's engravers.|$|E
5|$|The group {{recorded}} with Finn {{over a period}} of three months at numerous locations in their hometown of San Diego and in Los Angeles. Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating pop punk with a more radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories from friends and autobiographical situations <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> summery tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, as well as more offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories. The cover artwork for Enema of the State features porn star Janine Lindemulder famously clad in a nurse uniform, and the title is a pun on the term enemy of the state.|$|E

5|$|This belief persisted {{into the}} Medieval era, with many {{scholars}} arguing that Virgil not only prophesied Christ {{prior to his}} birth but also {{that he was a}} pre-Christian prophet. Dante Alighieri included Virgil as a main character in his Divine Comedy, and Michelangelo included the Cumaean Sibyl on the ceiling painting of the Sistine Chapel (a reference to the widespread belief that the Sibyl herself prophesied the birth of Christ, and Virgil used her prophecies <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> his poem). Modern scholars, such as Robin Nisbet, tend to eschew this interpretation, arguing that seemingly Judeo-Christian elements of the poem can be explained through means other than divine prophecy.|$|E
5|$|After three days, {{unable to}} persuade {{his men to}} back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts {{in the army and}} conferred Macedonian {{military}} titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.|$|E
5|$|Artisans {{from across}} India were {{recruited}} <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> the props.

The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also stitched by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment. Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the desert of Rajasthan, wearing full armour.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{his second}} effort that fall, West would invest two million dollars {{and take over}} a year <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> his second album. West was {{significantly}} inspired by Roseland NYC Live, a 1998 live album by English trip hop group Portishead, produced with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip-hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album Late Registration. West collaborated with American film score composer Jon Brion, who served as the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. Late Registration sold over 2.3million units in the United States alone by the end of 2005 and was considered by industry observers as the only successful major album release of the fall season, which had been plagued by steadily declining CD sales.|$|E
5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn sat behind the testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had been drawn to The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game <b>to</b> <b>craft</b> short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E
