In some countries such as Canada, government agencies have made systematic surveys of large areas. The survey generally involves making a series of parallel runs at a constant height and intervals of anywhere from a hundred meters to several kilometers. These are crossed by occasional <b>tie</b> <b>lines,</b> perpendicular to the main survey, to check for errors. The plane {{is a source of}} magnetism, so sensors are either mounted on a boom (as in the figure) or towed behind on a cable. Aeromagnetic surveys have a lower spatial resolution of ground surveys, but this can be an advantage for a regional survey of deeper rocks.|$|E

The studio area comprises three rooms with differing acoustic properties: a main area (90 m2), a stone room (15 m2) and a 'dead' room (15 m2), each with ceilings close to 6 metres high and excellent lines of sight for musicians and engineers. All of these areas have natural daylight and can handle demanding tracking and orchestral sessions of up to 26 players.

40|$|Forty-one phase {{diagrams}} {{and fifteen}} sand column experiments {{were conducted to}} evaluate the efficiency of three types of washing solutions to recover trichloroethylene (TCE) at residual saturation and to identify the recovery mechanisms involved. This study demonstrates that: (1) an alcohol and a surfactant combination is more efficient than an alcohol used alone in water; (2) the prediction of the dominant recovery mechanism from the <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> slopes in phase diagram is accurate and can be reproduced in sand column experiments; and (3) TCE recovery efficiency in sand column experiments is generally well represented by {{the position of the}} miscibility curve in phase diagrams in the low concentration range. However, the miscibility curve alone is not sufficient to exactly predict the TCE recovery mechanisms involved. <b>Tie</b> <b>line</b> slopes and the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> have to be taken into consideration to select the active matter as well as its concentration and to predict the dominant recovery mechanism in sand column experiments. The sand column experiments quantified the recovery efficiency of each solution and identified the proportion of the recovery mechanisms (mobilisation vs. solubilisation). Washing solutions with an active matter concentration above the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> caused dominating mobilisation. Mobilisation was also dominant when the active matter of the washing solution partitioned into the organic phase and the active matter concentration was below the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Solubilisation and emulsification were dominant for washing solutions containing active matter, which principally partitioned into the aqueous phase and an active matter concentration below the critical <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Copyright 2003 Elsevier B.

The studio is very self-contained and is most commonly used for album sessions at any stage from conception to tracking and mix. A notable feature of this studio is its private lounge and dining/kitchen area, which are incorporated into the control room environment by opening the two large acoustic doors {{at the rear of}} the control room. The space can be used more economically by utilising the mobile outboard racks, allowing efficient placement of outboard and computer equipment during recording and mix sessions as projects dictate.

50|$|To {{provide a}} black start, some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for fuel preparation. It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated <b>tie</b> <b>lines</b> from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|E

This paper presents the first partially miscible aqueousorganic mixtures flash point measurements and modeling for the ternary type-I mixtures, water + ethanol + 1 -butanol, water + ethanol + 2 -butanol, and the type-II mixture, water + 1 -butanol + 2 -butanol. Results reveal that the flash points are constant in each <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> Handling the non-ideality of the liquid phase through the use of activity coefficient models, the general flash-point model of Liaw et al. extended to partially miscible mixtures predicts the experimental data well when using literature LLE and the VLE activity coefficient model binary parameters to estimate sequentially the span and flash point in each <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> and the flash point in the mutual solubility region, respectively. The constant flash-point behavior in a <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> is also observed and predicted, in agreement with the VLLE <b>tie</b> <b>line</b> property that a single vapor is in equilibrium with all liquid composition on a <b>tie</b> <b>line.</b> For the aqueousorganic mixtures here studied, a deviation between prediction and measurements is observed, arising from the failure of the constant lower flammable limit assumption in the mutual solubility inert-rich region.
