25|$|In the afternoon, Thailand's coup leader ordered media {{executives}} to army headquarters <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stop carrying expression {{of public opinion}} following the military takeover. The move came after the military imposed strict controls on the media and said they would block information deemed harmful to the provisional military council now in control of Thailand. The army official said the normal television programming will be resumed but the council would begin making its own televised announcements every two hours starting from 11:00 am (04:00 GMT).|$|E

500|$|First-time X-Files {{director}} Paul Shapiro was {{tasked with}} directing the episode. Many {{of the physical}} effects in the episode were coordinated by Danny Weselis, who noted that the episode contained several scenes featuring extensive stunt work. He explained, [...] "during the bar explosions we had {{a room full of}} stunt people showered with broken glass. And we used stunt people for much of the missionary and special agent fights." [...] The final scene, featuring a stadium full of people attacking each other after the Templetons make an appearance, was filmed at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. Several hundred extras were contacted via ads on the internet and in select publications. The scene took two days to completely film. The crowd supplemented sixteen stuntmen and over 200 cardboard cutouts to give the stadium a filled-out feel. In order to create a mock fight, staff members gave the several hundred extras soft props to hit each other with. Producer Harry Bring later noted, [...] "a few of [...] members got carried away and we had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> settle down." [...] During the finished episode, a split screen was inserted as a way to enhance the scene and allow the viewer to [...] "focus on various angles of action".|$|E
500|$|Revie {{was made}} player-manager at Leeds United in March 1961 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Jack Taylor, who left after Leeds found themselves struggling in the Second Division. He had initially applied for the vacant job at Bournemouth, but Bournemouth were unable to find the £6,000 Leeds demanded, and the Leeds directors decided to instead appoint Revie as manager. At the time the club was in debt and was located in a rugby league territory, with very little football tradition. Less than 7,000 turned out for the final home game of the 1960–61 season whilst Leeds's championship game of the 1960–61 Rugby League season had an attendance of over 50,000. He immediately began to institute radical changes such as ensuring the players stayed at higher quality hotels. He instilled a [...] "family atmosphere" [...] at Elland Road, making sure to {{take an interest in}} the lives of everyone at the club from the cleaning staff to the star players and ensuring there were no [...] "big egos" [...] at the club. He showed trust in his players, leaving them mainly to their own devices though he always made sure he was fully informed as to what they were up to off the pitch, even going so far as <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable. He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players knew every detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats. Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions, such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the Peacocks nickname in favour of the Whites.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' second {{recording}} {{session with}} Martin was on 4 September 1962, when they recorded [...] "How Do You Do It", heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin {{thought was a}} sure-fire hit, even though Lennon and McCartney {{did not want to}} release it, not being one of their own compositions or style. Martin was correct: Gerry & the Pacemakers' version, which Martin produced, spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963, before being displaced by [...] "From Me to You". On 11 September 1962, the Beatles re-recorded [...] "Love Me Do" [...] with session player Andy White playing drums. Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely [...] "not pleased". Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases. Martin would later praise Starr's drumming, calling him [...] "probably... the finest rock drummer in the world today". As [...] "Love Me Do" [...] peaked at number 17 in the British charts, on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded [...] "Please Please Me", which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. Martin's crucial contribution to the song was <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> speed up what was initially a slow ballad. After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record". Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote [...] "Love Me Do", informing Epstein of three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, would be fair and honest, which led them to Dick James.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, during rehearsals {{for their}} first album with {{producers}} Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie, Radiohead spontaneously performed [...] "Creep".

After some failed attempts to record other songs, Slade and Kolderie suggested Radiohead play [...] "Creep" [...] again. They recorded the song in a single take; after the performance {{everyone in the room}} burst into applause. After the band assured Kolderie that [...] "Creep" [...] was an original song, he called EMI <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> consider it as Radiohead's first single.

2500|$|Gestapo signal tracers {{endangered}} clandestine radio operators, {{and their}} life expectancy averaged about six weeks. Therefore, short and less frequent transmissions from the codemaster were of value. The pressure could cause agents {{to make mistakes}} encoding messages, and the practice was for the home station <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> recode it (usually a safe activity) and retransmit it (dangerous, and increasingly so the longer it took). [...] In response to this problem, Marks established, staffed and trained a group based at Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire to cryptanalyse garbled messages ("indecipherables") {{so they could be}} dealt with in England without forcing the agent to risk retransmitting from the field. [...] Other innovations of his simplified encoding in the field, which reduced errors and made shorter messages possible, both of which reduced transmission time.|$|E

2500|$|According to a musnad (supported) hadith, Muhammad made {{a speech}} at Ghadir Khumm in which he said, [...] "Of whomsoever I am the mawla, Ali is his mawla". Mawla {{has a number of}} {{meanings}} in Arabic. Although Shi'ites translate it as [...] "master" [...] or [...] "ruler" [...] and believe that Muhammad did not make 120,000 people wait in the desert for three days only <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> support Ali, some Sunni scholars say that Muhammad was saying that his friends should befriend Ali; it was a response to Yemeni soldiers who had complained about Ali. A similar incident is described in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah, in which Muhammad reportedly said: [...] "Do not blame Ali, for he is too scrupulous in the things of God, or the way of God, to be blamed."(Guillaume p.650) Sunnis believe that interpreting an expression of friendship and support as the appointment of a successor is incorrect, and the leadership dispute after Muhammad's death proved that his statement was not an appointment.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} [...] "and it bred worms and rotted" [...] in [...] a Midrash asked whether {{anything}} exists that first produces worms and then rots (implying that surely, rot precedes worms).

The Midrash told that Moses became so angry with them that he forgot <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> gather two omers for each person on the sixth day. So when they went out and gathered on the sixth day and found a double portion, the princes told Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses."

2500|$|... "Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?" [...] {{was written}} by Al Jean and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). American actor Ed Asner guest starred in the episode as the newspaper editor that hires Homer. The character is based on Lou Grant, the character Asner played in the series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Lou Grant. The episode features several other references to popular culture. For example, the song Homer sings upon being given the food critic job is set to the tune of [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical West Side Story. The restaurant Planet Springfield is a parody of Planet Hollywood, containing items such as the film script for The Cable Guy (1996), Herbie from The Love Bug (1968), a model of the RMS Titanic from Titanic (1997), an alien similar to those from Mars Attacks!
