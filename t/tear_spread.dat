40|$|SYNOPSIS. This paper reviews {{our current}} {{understanding}} of the relationship be-tween the structures and properties of the tissues of the spine and their mechanical functions. Emphasis is on the human lumbar spine. Vertebrae consist of a core of cancellous bone (low density) surrounded by a shell of cortical bone (high stiffness); as a result they have high stiffness but low mass. The intervertebral disc is able to withstand compression because of the swelling pressure exerted by the nucleus pulposus which is constrained, radially, by the annulus fibrosus. Thus the disc acts as a thick-walled pressure vessel. Collagen fibers within the annulus provide re-inforcement during compression, bending and torsion of the disc. Collagen fibers also provide tensile reinforcement and prevent <b>tears</b> <b>spreading</b> across ligaments. The ligamenta flava contain elastic fibers (low stiffness and low strength) with collagen fibers (high stiffness and high strength). In the unstretched ligamenta flava, the collagen fibers have almost random orientations but they become aligned as the ligament is stretched. This structure enables the high extensibility of elastic fibers to be exploited but protects them from damage at high strains. The structure of the interspinous ligament suggests that its main function is to attach the tho-racolumbar fascia to the posterior spine. Thus the fascia is maintained in tension when stretched by the abdominal muscles. This and other observations indicate the importance of muscles for maintaining the stability of the spinal column...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} <b>tear</b> film <b>spreading</b> {{and central}} lid position in spontaneous blinks and {{to propose a}} model of the central lid position of the closed eye in such blinks. METHOD: In vivo: lid margin position and geometry of 15 subjects (9 female; median age= 45 years) were evaluated by high-speed video and slit-lamp microscope video in consecutive spontaneous blinks. Upper lid (UL) tear meniscus (TM) depth was observed in the open and almost closed eye. Eyelid geometry, position and UL TM depth were analysed by Image-J Software. Lid margin thicknesses were measured with a Scheimpflug camera. In vitro: <b>tear</b> film <b>spreading</b> and lipid layer formation were simulated on a lubricated glass plate and videoed by high-speed camera (JVC, GZ-GX 1 BE, Japan). RESULTS: In vivo: the median central lid margin thickness was not significantly (p= 0. 258) different between UL (1. 8 mm) and LL (1. 7 mm) in the opened eye. During blinking, UL remained perpendicular to the corneal surface, while LL tilted in and thinned. A scaled model diagram was created and revealed an over-blink of the UL over the LL (> 0. 7 mm) and a height offset of the posterior lid margin of > 0. 7 mm. In vitro: the LL TM fused with the UL TM even before full lid touch due to capillary bridge building. CONCLUSIONS: The central UL overlaps the central LL during spontaneous blinking. This provides the appearance of complete closure. The space that results from the lack of lid margin apposition influences the fusion of the upper and lower TM and ultimately tear film mixing...|$|R
50|$|Blinking is a semi-autonomic rapid {{closing of}} the eyelid. A single blink is {{determined}} by the forceful {{closing of the}} eyelid or inactivation of the levator palpebrae superioris and the activation of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi, not the full open and close.

40|$|Realistic {{simulation}} of tissue cutting and bleeding is important {{components of a}} surgical simulator that are addressed in this study. Surgeons use a number of instruments to perform incision and dissection of tissues during minimally invasive surgery. For example, a coagulating hook is used to <b>tear</b> and <b>spread</b> the tissue that surrounds organs and scissors are used to dissect the cystic duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the execution of these procedures, bleeding may occur and blood flows over the tissue surfaces. We have developed computationally fast algorithms to display (1) tissue cutting and (2) bleeding in virtual environments with applications to laparoscopic surgery. Cutting through soft tissue generates an infinitesimally thin slit until {{the sides of the}} surface are separated from each other. Simulation of an incision through tissue surface is modeled in three steps: first, the collisions between the instrument and the tissue surface are detected as the simulate [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In many animals, {{including}} humans, eyelids {{wipe the}} eye and prevent dehydration. They <b>spread</b> <b>tears</b> on the eyes, which contains substances which help fight bacterial infection {{as part of the}} immune system. Some species have a nictitating membrane for further protection.Some aquatic animals have a second eyelid in each eye which refracts the light and helps them see clearly both above and below water. Most creatures will automatically react to a threat to its eyes (such as an object moving straight at the eye, or a bright light) by covering the eyes, and/or by turning the eyes away from the threat. Blinking the eyes is, of course, also a reflex.|$|R
40|$|Background: Rabbits have {{a longer}} inter-blink time (approximately 10 minutes) {{compared}} with humans (five to eight seconds), suggesting that rabbits {{have a much more}} stable tear film. Using fluorescein, the tear break-up time of rabbits has been reported to be similar to that of humans. This study set out to measure the tear break-up time in rabbits using non-invasive methods and to establish the pattern of tear break-up compared to humans. Methods: The tear break-up time was measured and the pattern of tear break-up was observed in six New Zealand White rabbits on two separate occasions using both the Keeler Tearscope-plusTM and a slitlamp biomicroscope. Results: The mean rabbit tear break-up time was 29. 8 ± 3. 4 (SD) minutes. This contrasts with the reports of human tear break-up time of eight to 30 seconds. The <b>tear</b> breaking <b>spread</b> very slowly and was often restricted to the area of the initial break. Conclusion: Rabbit tears have a significantly higher tear break-up time than humans and this aligns with previously demonstrated differences in inter-blink time between rabbits and humans. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of tear stability may lead to novel ways of increasing human tear film stability. 6 page(s...|$|R
500|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon reaches faster speeds {{than any other}} animal on the planet when performing the stoop, which involves soaring to a great height and then diving steeply at speeds of over , hitting one wing of its prey {{so as not to}} harm itself on impact. The air pressure from such a dive could possibly damage a bird's lungs, but small bony tubercles on a falcon's nostrils are theorized to guide the powerful airflow away from the nostrils, enabling the bird to breathe more easily while diving by reducing the change in air pressure. To protect their eyes, the falcons use their nictitating membranes (third eyelids) to <b>spread</b> <b>tears</b> and clear debris from their eyes while maintaining vision.

40|$|Characteristics of the spreads of {{platelet-rich plasma}} (PRP) are not widely known despite {{commonly}} use. This study aims {{to evaluate whether}} PRP stays within the injected area by using ultrasonography, to improve understanding of the spreads of intratendinous injected PRP. Thirty-nine patients (15 males, 24 females; mean age, 49. 3 years), who had symptoms on their elbows (> 6 months) and diagnosed as lateral (25 elbows) or medial (14 elbows) tendinopathies of elbow, were included. The severity of tendon pathology was assessed by ultrasonography as tear or no tear. Immediately after ultrasound-guided PRP injection, ultrasound images were evaluated to assess the area of PRP distribution, which {{was defined as the}} presence of fluid or microbubbles. Ultrasound revealed that 13 elbows had tendon tear and 26 had no tear, respectively. Post-injection ultrasound confirmed the injected PRP was within the tendon in all cases. The mean distance of distribution from the injection site was 12. 6 mm (5. 0 – 26. 0 mm). There was no difference in the distance of PRP distribution between tendon tear and no <b>tear.</b> Injected PRP <b>spread</b> to soft tissue outside the tendon in 20 of 39 cases. Intra-articular extension of PRP was observed in 5 cases. Although PRP remained intratendinous after the injection in all cases, some portion tended to spread outside from the injection site in a short space of time. Postinjection ultrasonographic imaging has a value for observing the spreading patterns of intratendinous PRP injection...|$|R
6000|$|... "On n'est plus heureux à notre âge," [...] {{says the}} old man, {{to one of}} his old generals, {{welcoming}} Tallard after his defeat; and he rewards him with honors, as if he had come from a victory. There is, if you will, something magnanimous in this welcome to his conquered general, this stout protest against Fate. Disaster succeeds disaster; armies after armies march out to meet fiery Eugene and that dogged, fatal Englishman, and disappear in the smoke of the enemies' cannon. Even at Versailles you may almost hear it roaring at last; but when courtiers, who have forgotten their god, now talk of quitting this grand temple of his, old Louis plucks up heart and will never hear of surrender. All the gold and silver at Versailles he melts, to find bread for his armies: all the jewels on his five-hundred-million coat he pawns resolutely; and, bidding Villars go and make the last struggle but one, promises, if his general is defeated, to place himself at the head of his nobles, and die King of France. Indeed, after a man, for sixty years, has been performing the part of a hero, some of the real heroic stuff must have entered into his composition, whether he would or not. When the great Elliston was enacting the part of King George the Fourth, in the play of [...] "The Coronation," [...] at Drury Lane, the galleries applauded very loudly his suavity and majestic demeanor, at which Elliston, inflamed by the popular loyalty (and by some fermented liquor in which, it is said, he was in the habit of indulging), burst into <b>tears,</b> and <b>spreading</b> out his arms, exclaimed: [...] "Bless ye, bless ye, my people!" [...] Don't let us laugh at his Ellistonian majesty, nor at the people who clapped hands and yelled [...] "bravo!" [...] in praise of him. The tipsy old manager did really feel that he was a hero at that moment; and the people, wild with delight and attachment for a magnificent coat and breeches, surely were uttering the true sentiments of loyalty: which consists in reverencing these and other articles of costume. In this fifth act, then, of his long royal drama, old Louis performed his part excellently; and when the curtain drops upon him, he lies, dressed majestically, in a becoming kingly attitude, as a king should.|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} eyelid {{participates in}} blinking and eye movements. Blinking requires transient lid movements, whereas the lid movements accompanying eye movements additionally involve maintaining the lid {{in a new}} position. Eyelid control evolved so that the lid-closing muscle governs blinks and the lid-opening muscle determines lid position. here {{are at least three}} types of blinks, reflex, T spontaneous, and voluntary, that can lower the lid as little as a few micrometers or completely close the eyes. Reflex blinks protect the eye, rapidly lowering the upper eyelid in response to an assortment of stimuli that could damage or signal damage to the eye. Because reflex blinks also occur in response to cornea 1 drying, reflex blinks help maintain tear film continuity on the cornea by <b>spreading</b> <b>tears.</b> Like other reflexes, the size of reflex blinks depends on the magnitude of the stimulus. For example, a weak stimulus may evoke a reflex blink that lowers the upper eyelid as little as 100 pm, while a strong stimulus elicits full lid closure. Indeed, the nervous system adaptively regulates the relationship between stimulus magnitude and the amount of lid closure (see below). Primates also produce spontaneous blinks that occur in the absence of sensory stimuli, as if initiated by a central pattern generator. For example, humans make I O- 20 spontaneous blinks a minute. This is a rate much higher than that required to keep the cornea moist. The size of spontaneous blinks is also quite variable. The modal size is- 6 mm, which is about one-half the amplitude required for full lid closure (8, 14). Like blink amplitude, blink rate is not constant, changing dramatically with emotional state and cognitive tasks. Blink rate goes up when people are anxious. For example, rapid spontaneous blinking is obvious when someone is uncomfortable being in front of a television camera (e. g., Nixon in the Kennedy-Nixon de...|$|R
