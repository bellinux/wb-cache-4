Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only {{became aware of}} Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollows trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives, was hired to direct in June 1998.

As a result, Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and other films such as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, various Roger Corman horror films, Jason and the Argonauts, and Scream Blacula Scream. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. [...] "One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It {{was one of the things}} that maybe shaped what I like to do."

40|$|Freedom of <b>the</b> will <b>is</b> {{a never-ending}} source of puzzlement for {{academic}} philosophers. At the same time, {{it is something}} deeply familiar to everyone. For the relevant concept of freedom underlies much, if not all, of our ordinary discourse and thinking about ourselves and others. However, our attempt {{to make sense of}} the world, through science and philosophy, can itself cast doubt on the validity of this conception of freedom. Are we not ourselves part of the world whose workings we study? And are we not, then, subject to the same laws of nature that we have discovered to govern that world? If so, should we not admit that our actions are simply physical events, mere links in a long chain of cause and effect? So, should we not conclude that the special perspective we take on our own actions and <b>those</b> of others <b>is</b> perfectly illusory? For a long time, this worry was phrased almost solely in terms of the problem of universal determinism. But in more recent times, many philosophers have recognized that the question whether we can somehow reconcile the familiar conception of agency with determinism may be a red herring. Free will, they argue, may be illusory even if our actions are undetermined. For if indeterminism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> absence of determination, what is it but pure randomness of <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> that does indeed exist at the subatomic level? If that <b>is</b> true, <b>the</b> ideaea that there is a special class of happenings which find their origin in human choice seems to be at least as problematic as it would be under determinism: what we regard as our choices would be nothing but random events, over which we have as little control as over the outcome of a die roll. What we end up doing would be merely accidental, and precisely not up to ourselves. My aim in this thesis will be to show how to overcome this dichotomy between accidentality and causal necessitation. A sound account of agency, I will argue, has to take seriously the idea that in practical deliberation, we are genuinely self-determining. I will show that progress towards such an account has <b>been</b> hampered by <b>the</b> prevalence of a reductive understanding of intentional action, according to which the explanation of an action in terms of an agent's reasons is just a species of the `ordinary' form of quasi-mechanical causation we associate with the laws of nature. On that assumption, non-accidentality can consist only in something's being caused by prior states and events. Instead, I defend a less dogmatic view, on which we can distinguish a number of formally distinct kinds of causal principles, or forms of non-accidentality. One of <b>those</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of responsiveness to reasons, or spontaneity, that is exhibited by intentional action. In exercising such spontaneity, I will argue, we are truly self-determining and free...|$|R

The party patriots continue ever to believe and hope.

The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.To begin with, the number of the party members is extremely large. Millions of people believed in the National Socialist philosophy; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda. Individual thinking was switched off, and the party members allowed their leaders to set the guidelines in everything for them--and this spread throughout the entire population. In this way, more fanatics were created who were ready to use brute force, and other means of terror, to eliminate any internal resistance.There is no important place in the government or private sector not occupied by proven party comrades. Adolf Hitler clearly announced before the seizure of power that the party would be running things. Thus, anywhere there might be a reaction against the party, a Hitler guard stands ready to quell that reaction.Although today our opponents are at the Rhine and at the Oder, I do not believe yet that there will be a coup brought about by the German people. Without assistance from outside, such a coup is not even to be considered. Only the armed forces would be able to make a conclusive coup. But the prominent officers know, as well as the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them out of power. Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.That is how I imagine it will end. The Allies must continue to use force in order to terminate the war.|$|E
