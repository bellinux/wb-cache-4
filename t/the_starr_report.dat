25|$|Starr {{served as}} a federal Court of Appeals judge and as {{solicitor}} general for George H. W. Bush. He received the most publicity for his tenure as independent counsel while Bill Clinton was U.S.president. Starr was initially appointed to investigate the suicide death of deputy White House counsel Vince Foster and the Whitewater real estate investments of Bill Clinton. The three-judge panel charged with administering the Independent Counsel Act later expanded the inquiry into numerous areas including an extramarital affair that Bill Clinton had with Monica Lewinsky. After several years of investigation, Starr filed <b>the</b> <b>Starr</b> <b>Report,</b> which alleged that Bill Clinton lied {{about the existence of}} the affair during a sworn deposition. The allegation lead to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and the five-year suspension of Clinton's law license.|$|E

500|$|After the 1998 elections, the House impeached Clinton, alleging {{perjury and}} {{obstruction}} of justice related to the Lewinsky scandal. Clinton was only the second U.S. president to be impeached, after Andrew Johnson. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky. After <b>the</b> <b>Starr</b> <b>Report</b> was submitted to the House providing what it termed [...] "substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment", the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.|$|E

Proceeds from Monica's Story benefitted the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund. The publisher also received mainstream notice for publishing 2001's Titans of Finance: True Tales of Money and Business, by R.

5000|$|A much-quoted {{statement}} from Clinton's {{grand jury testimony}} showed him questioning the precise {{use of the word}} [...] "is". Contending that his statement that [...] "there's nothing going on between us" [...] had been truthful because he had no ongoing relationship with Lewinsky {{at the time he was}} questioned, Clinton said, [...] "It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the—if he—if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement". Starr obtained further evidence of inappropriate behavior by seizing the computer hard drive and email records of Monica Lewinsky. Based on the president's conflicting testimony, Starr concluded that Clinton had committed perjury. Starr submitted his findings to Congress in a lengthy document (<b>the</b> so-called <b>Starr</b> <b>Report),</b> and simultaneously posted the report on the internet, replete with lurid descriptions of encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky. Starr was criticized by Democrats for spending $70 million on an investigation that substantiated only perjury and obstruction of justice. Critics of Starr also contend that his investigation was highly politicized because it regularly leaked tidbits of information to the press in violation of legal ethics, and because his report included lengthy descriptions which were humiliating yet irrelevant to the legal case.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Delivering popular {{web pages}} to the clients results in high {{bandwidth}} and high {{load on the}} web servers. A method to overcome this problem is to send these pages, requested by many users, via multicast. In this paper, we provide an analytic criterion to determine which pages to multicast, and analyze the overall saving factor as compared with a unicast delivery. The analysis {{is based on the}} well known observation that page popularity follows a Zipf-like distribution. Interestingly, we can obtain closed-form analytical expressions for the saving factor, that show the multicast advantage {{as a function of the}} site hit-rate, the allowed latency and the Zipf parameter. 1 Introduction One of the largest problems in the web is to deliver the content efficiently from the site to the user. High load on the server and on the network leads to long delays or more extremely denial of services. Increasing the capacity for delivering the content results in a high cost of extra servers and extra bandwidth. Moreover, the capacity is planed to some value, though larger than the average load, but almost always cannot accommodate the peak load. This is specially correct for popular pages were the access pattern may be unpredictable and very unstable (e. g. <b>the</b> famous <b>Starr</b> <b>report</b> case). There are several methods to try to overcome the problem. One is to use caches [13, 7, 1]. However, caches are not effective for frequently changing content or for long files (e. g video, audio). A different possibility that we consider in this paper is to use multicast [4, 8, 6], i. e., to deliver the content simultaneously to many (all) users via multicast dynamic tree. Obviously, one may also combine both caching and multicasting to further improve the solution...|$|R
