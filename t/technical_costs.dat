40|$|The German {{insurance}} market was liberalized in 1994 by {{the introduction of}} the ‘single passport’ allowing European insurers to operate throughout the entire European Union. The European directive put also an end to price and insurance contract terms regulation. These measures were meant for removing the obstacles to competition within and between the {{insurance market}}s of the member states aiming at an increased efficiency of the European insurance markets. We analyze to which extent this aim has been achieved in the German life insurance market. The development of market performance is measured by changes in <b>technical</b> <b>cost</b> and profit efficiency levels since the liberalization, as well as a measurement of technological change. <b>Technical</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency levels are estimated by applying a stochastic “true” fixed effects distance frontier (Greene, 2005). Non-standard profit efficiency is derived in a second step following Kumbakhar (2006). According to our results, the industry experienced positive total factor productivity (TFP) growth during the observation period, which is mainly driven by substantial positive technological change. <b>Technical</b> <b>cost</b> efficiency and profit efficiency remained stable on average, but significant positive scale efficiency change can be found indicating that market consolidation in the presence of increasing returns to scale led to efficiency gains of the firms.

Risk Management is an over arching communication tool used by management to prioritize and effectively mitigate potential problems before they concur.

Some of these are safety issues such as hazards that have a specific likelihood and consequence {{that need to be}} controlled and included to show an integrated picture of accepted) mitigated, and residual risk.

The impacts of a firm's service concentration on pure technical and scale efficiencies are positive, but its impact on allocative efficiency is negative. Firms with a branch or branches are less efficient than those without any branch in terms of pure <b>technical,</b> scale and <b>cost</b> efficiencies.

40|$|ObjectiveEndovascular {{aneurysm}} repair (EVAR) {{is associated}} with significant direct device costs. Such costs place EVAR at odds with efforts to constrain healthcare expenditures. This study examines the procedure-associated costs and operating margins associated with EVAR at a tertiary care academic medical center. MethodsAll infrarenal EVARs performed from April 2011 to March 2012 were identified (n = 127). Among this cohort, 49 patients met standard commercial instruction for use guidelines, were treated using a single manufacturer device, and billed to Medicare diagnosis-related group (DRG) 238. Of these 49 patients, net technical operating margins (technical revenue minus technical cost) were calculated {{in conjunction with the}} hospital finance department. EVAR implant costs were determined for each procedure. DRG 238 -associated costs and length of stay were benchmarked against other academic medical centers using University Health System Consortium 2012 data. ResultsAmong the studied EVAR cohort (age 75, 82 % male, mean length of stay, 1. 7  days), mean <b>technical</b> <b>costs</b> totaled $ 31, 672. Graft implants accounted for 52 % of the allocated <b>technical</b> <b>costs.</b> Institutional overhead was 17 % ($ 5495) of total <b>technical</b> <b>costs.</b> Net mean total technical EVAR-associated operating margins were −$ 4015 per procedure. Our institutional costs and length of stay, when benchmarked against comparable centers, remained in the lowest quartile nationally using University Health System Consortium costs for DRG 238. Stent graft price did not correlate with total EVAR market share. ConclusionsEVAR is currently associated with significant negative operating margins among Medicare beneficiaries. Currently, device costs account for over 50 % of EVAR-associated <b>technical</b> <b>costs</b> and did not impact EVAR market share, reflecting an unawareness of cost differential among surgeons. These data indicate that EVAR must undergo dramatic care delivery redesign for this practice to remain sustainable...|$|E

A multiple input-output nonparametric model was used to measure <b>technical,</b> <b>cost,</b> revenue and profit efficiencies. Source of productivity growth was also investigated to identify for efficiency change or technology change of the firms under study. The input variables comprise assets, equity and numbers of employees, while the output variables are revenue and profit. This study also examines the impact of three moderating' variables - size, age and change of government policy (or deregulation) on the efficiency and productivity measures of the firms concerned. Change of government policy refers to Libya opening its doors to foreign companies to operate in its country beginning 2003. This study also conducts statistical test of significance for the overall results, in particular the Mann-Whitney's Test was used to test hypothesis for the moderating variables. The relationship between <b>technical,</b> <b>cost,</b> revenue and profit efficiency scores are also tested for their statistical significance before interpretation in the light of hypothesis of interest...|$|R
