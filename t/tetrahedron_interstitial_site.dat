The function of these proteins on telomeres {{has been studied}} extensively. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested possible roles for these proteins outside of telomeres. However, the non-canonical (extra-telomeric) function of human telomeric proteins remains poorly understood. To this end, we systematically investigated the binding sites of telomeric proteins along human chromosomes, by performing whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for RAP 1 and TRF 2. ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that RAP 1 and TRF 2 could be found on {{a small number of}} <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites,</b> including regions that are proximal to genes.

Primary H solution in Mg 2 -yPryNi 4 was analyzed by the model with θ = 0. 15. The chosen  value 0. 15 for the model analysis was close to be 1 / 6 (≈ 0. 167) which was half of 1 / 3 (=[Mg + Pr]/[Mg + Pr + Ni]) implying that about half of the (Mg + Pr) -related <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> were provided as the available sites for occupation by H atoms in the primary H solution of Mg 2 -yPryNi 4.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} distribution of carbon atoms in the octahedral <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> of the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of the iron-carbon system. The experimental part of the work consists of Mössbauer measurements in Fe-C alloys with up to about 12 atomic percent C, which are interpreted in terms of two alternative models for the distribution of C atoms in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites.</b> The theoretical part combines an analysis of the chemical potential of C based on the quasichemical approximation to the statistical mechanics of interstitial solutions, with three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. The latter were performed by assuming a gas like mixture of C atoms and vacancies (Va) in the octahedral <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites.</b> The number of C-C, C-Va and Va-Va pairs calculated using Monte Carlo simulations are compared with those given by the quasichemical model. Furthermore, the relative fraction of the various Fe environments were calculated and compared with those extracted from the Mössbauer spectra. The simulations reproduce remarkably well the relative fractions obtained assuming the Fe 8 C 1 −y model for Mössbauer spectra, which includes some blocking of the nearest neighbour <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> by a C atom. With the 1 new experimental and theoretical information obtained in the present study, a critical discussion is reported {{of the extent to which}} such blocking effect is accounted for in current thermodynamic models of the Fe-C fcc phase.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of Lu_ 2 (SiO_ 4) O:Ce (“LSO”) has two trivalent cation sites {{which may be}} occupied by Ce^(3 +) to form luminescence centers. Previous investigations revealed the existence of two distinct sets of Ce^(3 +) excitation and emission spectra and suggested that {{the differences in the}} spectra are due to differences in the crystal fields at the two lattice sites that shift the 5 d levels of Ce^(3 +). In the present report, we re-examine this issue and present new evidence which suggests a different interpretation. In particular, spectra measured at 13 K suggest that both lattice sites give rise to indistinguishable excitation and emission spectra while the second set of observed spectra arises from Ce^(3 +) located in <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites.</b> The evidence for the <b>interstitial</b> <b>sites</b> is a disappearance of the doublet structure in the emission spectra and a large variation in the population of the sites as a function of total cerium concentration.

40|$|Understanding the {{behavior}} of hydrogen in hexagonal tungsten carbide (WC) {{is of particular interest}} for fusion reactor design due to the presence of WC in the divertor of fusion reactors. Therefore, we use first-principles calculations to study the hydrogen behavior in WC. The most stable <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> for the hydrogen atom is the projection of the octahedral <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> on tungsten basal plane, followed by the site near the projection of the octahedral <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> on carbon basal plane. The binding energy between two interstitial hydrogen atoms is negative, suggesting that hydrogen itself is not capable of trapping other hydrogen atoms to form a hydrogen molecule. The calculated results on the interaction between hydrogen and vacancy indicate that the hydrogen atom is energetically trapped by vacancy and the hydrogen molecule can not be formed in mono-vacancy. In addition, the hydrogen atom bound to carbon is only found in tungsten vacancy. We also study the migrations of hydrogen in WC and find that the interstitial hydrogen atom prefers to diffusion along the c axis. Our studies on the hydrogen behavior in WC provide some explanations for the experimental results of the thermal desorption process of energetic hydrogen ion implanted into WC.

40|$|Vanadium bestows a deep {{turquoise}} {{color to}} zircon, {{making it an}} excellent ceramic pigment. Questions about vanadium valence and location in the zircon structure gave rise to many diffraction and spectroscopy studies. From the literature, an overall convergence emerges about the occurrence of vanadium as V 4 +, while controversial are the results about its accommodation at the Si tetrahedral site or at the Zr cubic site. Convincing diffraction (Siggel & Jansen, 1990) and spectroscopic studies (Niesert et al., 2002) point to V 4 + hosted at a peculiar four-fold coordinated <b>interstitial</b> <b>site.</b> However, current knowledge {{is not able to}} explain the variation in color shade usually observed in pigment manufacturing. In order to overcome this limit, four industrial pigments were considered (representing high V concentrations) together with zircon literature data (low to intermediate V contents) and isostructural phases (Hf and Th silicates and germanates). Industrial zircon pigments were characterized by XRF, XRPD and DRS to get chemical composition, unit-cell and structural parameters (e. g. metal-oxygen distances, polyhedral volumes, and distortion parameters), energy of the main optical bands and crystal field strength. The V 4 + incorporation into the zircon structure is testified by a progressive increase of the unit-cell volume with the V concentration. XRF analysis indicates a deficiency in Si suggesting a Si‒V balanced substitution. Such a substitution might occur through a Si by V 4 + replacement at the tetrahedral site 4 b (point symmetry - 4 m 2) or with V 4 + hosted at the <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> 16 g (point symmetry [...] 2) coupled to a Si vacancy. Very different from those of structures containing VO 2 2 - vanadyl complexes, the optical spectra of V-doped zircon exhibit three main bands in the 4000 ‒ 22000 cm - 1 range which can be attributed to electronic transitions of V 4 + at tetrahedral coordination. Although challenging to calculate because of three-fold splitting of the 2 T 2 band, the crystal field strength values obtained from samples containing different amounts of V and isostructural phases give rise to a linear relationship with the mean V‒O distances at the <b>interstitial</b> <b>tetrahedron</b> from diffraction data (on average 1. 894 Å). Such findings support the occupancy of an <b>interstitial</b> <b>site</b> by tetravalent vanadium when incorporated into the zircon crystal structure. The changes in turquoise color appear to depend in complex way on the amount of vanadium actually incorporated, the local environment at the <b>interstitial</b> <b>site,</b> the Zr/Si ratio in zircon, and particle size distribution.
