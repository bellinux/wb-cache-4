5|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Stuff</b> <b>of</b> Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by years of hard campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C. Filitti {{worked with the}} {{formerly}} Junimist tribune Convorbiri Literare, which published fragments of his research on Maiorescu (1922) and novelist Costache Negruzzi (1923). Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, on one hand, and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and <b>The</b> <b>Stuff</b> <b>of</b> Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E

Maynard and Teach engaged each other with small arms and cannon until the ships were close enough to board; Maynard boarded the pirate ship to fight Teach, and the notorious pirate eventually fell. Blackbeard's death became <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> legend and was used by the royal navy in its propaganda campaign in eliminating piracy.|$|E
25|$|Reith's autocratic {{approach}} became <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> BBC legend. His preferred {{approach was}} one of benevolent dictator, but with built-in checks to his power. Throughout his life, Reith remained convinced that that approach {{was the best way}} to run an organisation. Later Director-General Greg Dyke, profiling Reith in 2007, noted that the term Reithian has entered the dictionary to denote a style of management, particularly with relation to broadcasting. Reith summarised the BBC's purpose in three words: inform, educate, entertain; this remains part of the organisation's mission statement to this day. It has also been adopted by broadcasters throughout the world, notably the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States.|$|E

It is estimated that Holy Cross students began playing stickball at Wheeler Hall around 1940. The Holy Cross version's origins are <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> legends. The sport lends itself to neighborhood stickball, and is played with a tennis ball and broomstick. Wheeler Hall's five floors and symmetrical design makes it an ideal setting for the playing and spectating of the sport. A hill behind home plate helps contribute to the playing area's natural amphitheater-like setting.|$|E

The two main publications which covered the shutting of the gates, were The New York Times and Wired, who were apparently unable to arrive at a consensus, with the Times listing the sale of MindVox's client-base and the closing of the system, in 1996, while Wired was still covering an apparently open and at least partially operational MindVox circa 1997, more than one year after the Times listed MindVox as being closed.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{examines}} {{the concepts of}} substance and essence (ousia) in his Metaphysics (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance {{is a combination of}} both matter and form. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>of</b> which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia (see also predicables) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.|$|E
