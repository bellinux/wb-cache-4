5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be {{knowledgeable}} contributors, children {{must be aware of}} their surroundings and community's goals. Children's learning in Indigenous-heritage communities is mainly based upon observing and helping out others in their community. Through this type of participation within their community, they gain purpose and motivation for the activity <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> within their community and become active participants because they know they are doing it for their community.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, {{and that would be the}} end of our contribution... They would shout back at us and that would be the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically of the things <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{link between}} {{character}} masks {{and the concept of}} deliberate misrepresentation and hypocrisy. Yet character masks need not be hypocritical, insofar as the motive for their use is genuine, sincere, principled or naive – or a product of (self-)delusion. People can also mask their behavior, or mask a situation, without being aware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> so. Paul Ricœur explains: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} month, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, while {{discussing}} penalties that Europe might impose on Iran, {{said that they}} could be [...] "economic sanctions regarding financial movements... Our German friends proposed this. We discussed it a few days ago. The international community's demand is simple: They must stop enriching uranium. Our Iranian friends want to create, they say, civilian nuclear energy. They have the right to that, but all <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> proves the contrary. That is why we are worried." ...|$|E
2500|$|Golaud {{sits with}} his little son, Yniold, in the {{darkness}} before dawn and questions him about Pelléas and Mélisande. The boy reveals little that Golaud wants to know since he is too innocent to understand what he is asking. He says that Pelléas and Mélisande often quarrel about the door {{and that they have}} told Yniold he will one day be as big as his father. Golaud is puzzled when learning that they (Pelléas and Mélisande) never send Yniold away because they are afraid when he is not there and keep on crying in the dark. He admits that he once saw Pelléas and Mélisande kiss [...] "when it was raining". Golaud lifts his son on his shoulders to spy on Pelléas and Mélisande through the window but Yniold says <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> nothing other than looking at the light. He threatens to scream unless Golaud lets him down again. Golaud leads him away.|$|E
50|$|In {{the age of}} Colonialism, hyperdiffusionism proved attractive, as {{it showed}} how missionaries, {{engineers}} and prospectors had spread civilisation all over the earth, as the colonial nations believed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> themselves.|$|R
50|$|After the law {{went into}} effect on July 1, 2012, a number of {{restaurants}} continued to serve foie gras, insisting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> so {{as a gift to}} customers rather than selling it to customers.|$|R

2500|$|In {{response}} to questions of why God would allow the Zionists some measure of success if Zionism is against the Talmud; anti-Zionist religious Jews respond with the following; [...] "The fallacy of the argument lies in the undeniable {{fact that there is}} evil in this world. Hashem allows people free will to choose to do wrong, and even to <b>be</b> successful in <b>doing</b> wrong on a large scale.... Why Hashem decided to grant their efforts some degree of success is one of the mysteries of our era. But the fact <b>that</b> <b>they</b> succeeded <b>is</b> no more a proof <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing, than {{is the fact that the}} Germans succeeded in killing six million Jews a proof <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> the right thing." ...|$|R

60|$|The mistresses of American families, {{whether they}} like it or not, have the duties of missionaries imposed upon them by that class from which our supply of {{domestic}} servants is drawn.

60|$|One {{meets with}} such extreme {{kindness}} and consideration among the Italians {{that there is}} a real danger lest one's personal feeling of obligation should warp one's judgment or hamper one's expression. Making every possible allowance for this, I come away from them, after a very wide if superficial view of all <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> with a deep feeling of admiration and a conviction that no army in the world could have made a braver attempt to advance under conditions of extraordinary difficulty.|$|E
60|$|No; it is {{the sense}} of duty. The {{knowledge}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> a good and a noble work in saving the lives of human beings and the wealth of the nation--the knowledge that they are in God's hands, and that no evil can happen to him who is doing right--that to him even death at his post is not a loss, but a gain. In short, faith in God, more or less clear, is what gives those men their strong and quiet courage. God grant that you and I, if ever we have dangerous work to do, may get true courage from the same fountain of ghostly strength.|$|E

It won't hurt Hooty or Mrs. Hooty a bit, but it will make them very angry. They have very short tempers, and people with short tempers usually forget everything else when they are angry. We'll pay them a visit while the sun is bright, because then perhaps they cannot see well enough to catch us, and we'll tease them until they lose their tempers and forget all about keeping guard over those eggs. Then I'll slip in and get one and perhaps both of them. Without knowing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> anything of the kind, my friends and relatives will help me to get a good meal. My, how good those eggs will taste!" ...|$|E

He sent off the Marquess Del Vasto with the Sieur De Hautepenne towards Bois le Duc. General Count Hohenlohe, who, as you know, we English always call Count Holland, went off with a large force to meet him, and we heard only this morning that a battle has been fought, Hautepenne killed, and the fort of Crevecoeur on the Maas captured. From what I hear, some of our leaders think that it was a mistake so to scatter our forces, and if Parma moves forward from Bruges against Sluys, which is likely enough, we shall be sorely put to it to save the place." ...|$|E
6000|$|Most {{people do}} not know why they do things--not even you and I {{invariably}} know, though of course we are superior to the unresponsive masses. Many people are even unconscious <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> things or being things--being gentle or cruel or creative or parasitic. Quite without knowing it, Father was searching for his place in the world. The New York shoe-stores had decided that he was too old to be useful. But age is as fictitious as time or love. Father was awakening from the sleep of drudgery in the one dusty shop, and he was asking what other place there was for him. He was beginning to have another idea, a better idea, which he pondered as he came to shoe-stores in small towns.... They weren't very well window-dressed; the signs were feeble.... Maybe some day he'd get back into the shoe business in some town, and he'd show them--only, how could he talk business to a shoeman when he was shabby and winter-tanned and none too extravagant in the care of his reddening hands? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 137. Have you {{any further}} remark {{to offer to}} the Commissioners?--I wish to say one word {{respecting}} {{the question of the}} restoration of statuary. It seems to me a very simple question. Much harm is being at present done in Europe by restoration, more harm than was ever done, as far as I know, by revolutions or by wars. The French are now doing great harm to their cathedrals, under the idea <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> good, destroying more than all the good they are doing. And all this proceeds from the one great mistake of supposing that sculpture can be restored when it is injured. I am very much interested by the question which one of the Commissioners asked me in that respect; and I would suggest whether it does not seem easy to avoid all questions of that kind. If the statue is injured, leave it so, but provide a perfect copy of the statue in its restored form; offer, if you like, prizes to sculptors for conjectural restorations, and choose the most beautiful, but do not touch the original work.|$|E
