5|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> link between altered brain function and schizophrenia. One of the most common is the dopamine hypothesis, which attributes psychosis to the mind's faulty interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons.|$|E

5|$|Commentators {{have offered}} many {{theories}} for {{the origins of}} vampire beliefs, trying <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> superstition – and sometimes mass hysteria – caused by vampires.

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, McClintock {{discovered}} transposition {{and used}} it to demonstrate that genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on and off. She developed theories <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> suppression and expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Due to skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In 1619 Johannes Kepler made {{an early}} {{documented}} study of tessellations. He wrote about regular and semiregular tessellations in his Harmonices Mundi; he was possibly {{the first to}} explore and <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> hexagonal structures of honeycomb and snowflakes.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from east to west. This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{developed}} a number of hypotheses <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in southwest Asia, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted, but were not immediately domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Several species show clumped distributions. Dispersal {{limitation}} {{has been}} invoked <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>the</b> clumped distribution of adults and limited recruitment of seedlings in both A.erinacea in Ecuador and A.minima in Puerto Rico. Similarly, the rarity of A.lindeniana and A.simplex in Colombian forests {{may be linked}} to limited seed production and the limited effectiveness of seed dispersal by avian and mammalian frugivores.|$|E
