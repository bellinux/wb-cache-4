5|$|In {{the area}} of Pendjari National Park, almost all West African males are maneless or have very weak manes. Maneless, male African lions have also been {{reported}} from Senegal, from Sudan (Dinder National Park), and from Tsavo East National Park in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. The <b>testosterone</b> hormone {{has been linked to}} mane growth; therefore, castrated lions often have minimal to no mane, as the removal of the gonads inhibits <b>testosterone</b> production. In addition, increased <b>testosterone</b> may be the cause of the maned lionesses of northern Botswana.|$|E
5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels <b>Testosterone</b> and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, {{and in the case of}} Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. <b>Testosterone</b> needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Several {{medications}} can worsen pre-existing acne, {{with examples}} being lithium, hydantoin, isoniazid, glucocorticoids, iodides, bromides, and <b>testosterone.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} sports, vinkensport {{has had its}} {{cheating}} scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and the owner was later accused of doping the bird with <b>testosterone.</b> After one contestant sang exactly {{the same number of}} calls in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E
5|$|Baker's {{work has}} {{achieved}} cult {{status in the}} years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. First-edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items. His novel <b>Testosterone</b> was adapted to a film of the same name, though it was not a financial success. Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.|$|E
5|$|C. Floyd Landis was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2006 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during stage 17 of the race. The United States Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of using synthetic <b>testosterone</b> during the race and stripped him of his title on 20 September 2007.|$|E
5|$|Cells in zona reticularis of the {{adrenal glands}} produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most {{important}} of which is DHEA. In general, these hormones do not have an overall effect in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as <b>testosterone</b> and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way as a metabolic intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{pollution}}. Water {{pollution is}} primarily seen in turtles and crocodilians and can affect their eggs and sex characteristics. Male American alligators (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi) {{have been found}} with lowered <b>testosterone</b> and altered gonads in a chemically contaminated lake.|$|E
5|$|If {{exposed to}} <b>testosterone,</b> the genital {{tubercle}} elongates {{to form the}} penis. By fusion of the urogenital folds– elongated spindle-shaped structures {{that contribute to the}} formation of the urethral groove on the belly aspect of the genital tubercle– the urogenital sinus closes completely and forms the spongy urethra, and the labioscrotal swellings unite to form the scrotum. In the absence of <b>testosterone,</b> the genital tubercle allows for formation of the clitoris; the initially rapid growth of the phallus gradually slows and the clitoris is formed. The urogenital sinus persists as the vestibule of the vagina, the two urogenital folds form the labia minora, and the labioscrotal swellings enlarge to form the labia majora, completing the female genitalia. A rare condition that can develop from higher than average androgen exposure is clitoromegaly.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} for erectile dysfunction to exist not {{as a direct result}} of SCI but due to factors such as major depression, diabetes, or drugs such as those taken for spasticity. Finding and treating the root cause may alleviate the problem. For example, men who experience erectile problems as the result of a <b>testosterone</b> deficiency can receive androgen replacement therapy.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that boron plays several {{essential}} roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and <b>testosterone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mme M'Barek further {{stated that}} the {{arguments}} she had with her husband {{had nothing to do}} with money, but rather arose as a result of Lord Shaftesbury's excessive sexual demands brought on by his seemingly endless injections of <b>testosterone.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2011, the OCA {{stripped}} Qatari Ahmed Dheeb of {{his silver}} medal in discus throw after he {{tested positive for}} exogenous <b>testosterone</b> metabolites. The bronze medalist, Iran's Mohammad Samimi was promoted as silver medalist and India's Vikas Gowda was promoted as bronze medalist.|$|E
5|$|Sex steroids {{are known}} to affect the rate of sebum secretion; {{androgen}}s such as <b>testosterone</b> {{have been shown to}} stimulate secretion, and estrogens have been shown to inhibit secretion. Dihydrotestosterone acts as the primary androgen in the prostate and in hair follicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone <b>testosterone</b> into estrogen; thus the more <b>testosterone</b> a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly {{adjacent to}} the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to <b>testosterone)</b> in humans. Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.|$|E
5|$|A. Belarusian athletes Vadim Devyatovskiy and Ivan Tsikhan, who won {{silver and}} bronze {{respectively}} in the men's hammer throw, both {{tested positive for}} abnormal levels of <b>testosterone.</b> After attending a disciplinary hearing in September, they were stripped of their medals on December 11, 2008. Krisztián Pars of Hungary was given the silver medal, and Koji Murofushi of Japan was given the bronze. On June 10, 2010, following a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Devyatovskiy and Tsikhan had their medals reinstated.|$|E
5|$|About 1,400 random doping {{tests were}} carried out during the Games. Two athletes tested {{positive}}; judoka Shokir Muminov on November 19, 2010 and Greco-Roman wrestler Jakhongir Muminov on November 24, 2010, both from Uzbekistan, tested positive for methylhexanamine. On January 24, 2011, the OCA announced another two doping failures, Qatari's Ahmed Dheeb who tested positive for exogenous <b>testosterone</b> metabolites and Palestinian Awajna Abdalnasser who tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone.|$|E
5|$|Belarusian athletes Vadim Devyatovskiy and Ivan Tsikhan, who won {{silver and}} bronze {{respectively}} in the men's hammer throw, both {{tested positive for}} abnormal levels of <b>testosterone.</b> After attending a disciplinary hearing in September, they were stripped of their medals on December 11, 2008. Krisztián Pars of Hungary was given the silver medal, and Koji Murofushi of Japan was given the bronze. However, both of the Belarusian athletes had their medals reinstated because the doping tests weren't handled properly.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{is thought}} to be the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases. The role of diet and {{cigarette}} smoking is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appear to play a part. During puberty, in both sexes, acne is often brought on by an increase in hormones such as <b>testosterone.</b> A frequent factor is excessive growth of the bacterium Propionibacterium acnes, which is normally present on the skin.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as <b>testosterone</b> seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, sexual {{differentiation}} {{is determined}} by the sperm that carries either an X or a Y (male) chromosome. The Y chromosome contains a sex-determining gene (SRY) that encodes a transcription factor for the protein tdf (testis determining factor) and triggers the creation of <b>testosterone</b> and Anti-Müllerian hormone for the embryo's development into a male. This differentiation begins about eight or nine weeks after conception. Some sources state that it continues until the twelfth week, while others state that it is clearly evident by the thirteenth week and that the sex organs are fully developed by the sixteenth week.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of <b>testosterone</b> replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added anabolic steroids.|$|E
5|$|On March 19, 2007, Sports Illustrated posted {{an article}} on its website {{as part of its}} {{continuing}} series investigating a steroid and HGH ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. The article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Orton, who was alleged to have obtained anastrozole, clomiphene citrate, nandrolone, oxandrolone, stanozolol, and <b>testosterone.</b> WWE simply claimed that the allegations preceded their Talent Wellness program launched in February 2006.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, Kemp came {{in second}} to Ryan Braun in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. Later, it was {{revealed}} that Braun had tested positive for elevated <b>testosterone</b> and baseball attempted to suspend him, but lost on appeal. A survey of baseball writers revealed that if the MVP vote was retaken, with knowledge of Braun's positive test, then Kemp would have won. Braun was eventually suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal. Kemp publicly stated that he believed Braun should be stripped of his MVP Award from that season.|$|E
5|$|Robertson, now Baker's {{literary}} executor, {{was successful}} in having two additional novels published after Baker's death. One of those, <b>Testosterone,</b> was filmed in 2003. Directed by David Moreton and starring Antonio Sabato Jr., the plot was significantly altered and the film was a critical and financial failure. Both Boy Wonder and Fuel-Injected Dreams have been optioned for the movies several times, most recently in 2004, though they were never produced. Baker's work has also been published in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Australia, Japan and Russia.|$|E
5|$|The female is mildly {{aggressive}} to her suitors during estrus, {{and will}} often lunge at males, usually {{after a long}} period of being approached and followed. Vocalizations during mating include a whistling sound, most commonly by the female, usually during June and August, coinciding with female estrus. Other vocalizations recorded during estrus include chittering and growling. The <b>testosterone</b> levels of the males are seasonal, with peaks coinciding with female estrogen peaks.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require <b>testosterone</b> supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian {{weightlifter}} Fabrício Mafra {{lost his}} bronze {{medal in the}} men's 105 kg competition. He tested positive for abnormal levels of <b>testosterone,</b> and Damian Abbiate, the competitor from Argentina, received the medal in his place. Colombian cyclist Libardo Niño Corridor, who won a silver medal in the men's individual road time trial, {{tested positive for the}} banned substance erythropoietin (EPO), and consequently the silver medal went to Matias Medici of Argentina and the bronze medal to Dominique Rollin of Canada. Nicaraguan baseball player Pedro Wilder Rayo Rojas tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid boldenone, and lost his bronze medal from the men's baseball competition, but his teammates kept their medals.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens <b>testosterone,</b> dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of <b>testosterone,</b> faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in <b>testosterone</b> biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E
25|$|When {{females have}} a higher {{baseline}} level of <b>testosterone,</b> they have higher increases in sexual arousal levels but smaller increases in <b>testosterone,</b> indicating a ceiling effect on <b>testosterone</b> levels in females. Sexual thoughts also change the level of <b>testosterone</b> but not level of cortisol in the female body, and hormonal contraceptives may affect the variation in <b>testosterone</b> response to sexual thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>testosterone</b> and 5α-DHT are metabolized {{mainly in}} the liver. Approximately 50% of <b>testosterone</b> is metabolized via {{conjugation}} into <b>testosterone</b> glucuronide {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>testosterone</b> sulfate by glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, respectively. An additional 40% of <b>testosterone</b> is metabolized in equal proportions into the 17-ketosteroids androsterone and etiocholanolone via the combined actions of 5α- and 5β-reductases, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17β-HSD, in that order. Androsterone and etiocholanolone are then glucuronidated {{and to a lesser extent}} sulfated similarly to <b>testosterone.</b> The conjugates of <b>testosterone</b> and its hepatic metabolites are released from the liver into circulation and excreted in the urine and bile. Only a small fraction (2%) of <b>testosterone</b> is excreted unchanged in the urine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Testosterone</b> {{is used as}} a {{medication}} for the treatment of males with too little or no natural <b>testosterone</b> production, certain forms of breast cancer, and gender dysphoria in transgender men. This is known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or <b>testosterone</b> replacement therapy (TRT), which maintains serum <b>testosterone</b> levels in the normal range. Decline of <b>testosterone</b> production with age has led to interest in androgen replacement therapy. It is unclear if the use of <b>testosterone</b> for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>testosterone</b> to {{cortisol}} can both increase and decrease during resistance training, depending on intensity of exercise. A study comparing {{young and old}} subjects showed acute increases in GH and <b>testosterone</b> for both, although the latter increased less in older men. <b>Testosterone</b> rises in late hours of sleep after anaerobic exercise. Androgen receptor expression increases with acute exercise in correlation to free <b>testosterone.</b> When comparing {{men and women in}} the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased <b>testosterone</b> after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol. Elderly men showed no change. Other studies have also shown with age there is a downtrend of <b>testosterone</b> and attenuated growth hormone response. Young men have shown no acute change in <b>testosterone</b> with resistance training, with increase in cortisol and growth hormone depending on intensity. One study in young men showed <b>testosterone</b> acutely stable, with increase in GH and IGF-1. Similarly, a study showed <b>testosterone</b> did not increase in young men, women, and pubescent boys unaccustomed to weight training when corrected for plasma volume. Extreme intensity of strength training may trigger the stress response, resulting in lower <b>testosterone</b> levels, an effect accentuated by energy deprivation. A separate study comparing different ages, however, found no difference in acute <b>testosterone</b> and cortisol levels between groups, but attenuated growth hormone response in the elderly. Acutely, other studies have shown <b>testosterone</b> to increase. In a small group of anaerobically trained athletes, stressful training acutely even decreased serum <b>testosterone</b> and its ratio to cortisol and SHBG, with an increase in LH. With subsequent decompensation, <b>testosterone</b> was stable, but cortisol and SHBG decreased. Another case control showed with intense training followed by rest, <b>testosterone</b> dropped and LH increased initially.|$|E
25|$|Oral <b>testosterone</b> is {{provided}} exclusively as <b>testosterone</b> undecanoate. It {{is available in}} Europe and Canada, {{but not in the}} United States. Once absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, <b>testosterone</b> is shunted (at very high blood levels) to the liver where it can cause liver damage (albeit very rarely) and worsens some of the adverse effects of <b>testosterone,</b> like lower HDL (good) cholesterol. In addition, the first pass metabolism of the liver also may result in <b>testosterone</b> levels too low to provide satisfactory masculinization and suppress menses. Because of the short terminal half-life of <b>testosterone,</b> oral <b>testosterone</b> undecanoate must be administered two to four times per day, preferably with food (which improves its absorption).|$|E
