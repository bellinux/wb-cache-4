5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E

5|$|St. Joseph Mayor M. Jeff Thompson, William H. Russell, and Alexander Majors gave speeches {{before the}} mochila was handed off. The ride began at about 7:15p.m. The St. Joseph Gazette {{was the only}} {{newspaper}} included in <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{least one}} station, KTVI-TV in St. Louis, has given Green Bags a {{positive}} review. They tested <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> for their Deal or Dud segment and found <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> kept both {{fruits and vegetables}} fresher. They called <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> “a Deal”.|$|R
25|$|Many {{of those}} were Haganah members, and several of them asked what was in <b>the</b> <b>bags.</b> <b>The</b> Irgun members lied, saying that <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> {{contained}} guns, at which point some of the workers suggested {{that they should be}} confiscated. One of the Irgun men, David Dahari, took out his pistol and threatened to fire if any of them touched <b>the</b> <b>bags,</b> so they backed off.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bags,</b> often {{referred}} to as <b>The</b> <b>Bags</b> LP due to its untitled cover and spine, is the third album by <b>The</b> <b>Bags.</b> This album was later re-released on Compact Disc in 2008 by the Oaf Records and Heartworm Music labels, with additional tracks from the Stanton '89 single, [...] "I Know"/"Hide and Seek", and a couple of previously unreleased tracks.|$|R
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b>|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|About {{seven minutes}} after {{stepping}} onto the Moon's surface, Armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick. He then folded <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> {{and tucked it}} into a pocket on his right thigh. This was to guarantee {{there would be some}} lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the EVA and return to the LM.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the last}} stage, the belt moves the {{finished}} mochi to <b>the</b> <b>bagging</b> area. In <b>the</b> <b>bagging</b> area, <b>the</b> cakes are inspected carefully for any breakage or damage, then stacked, packaged, sealed, and labelled.|$|R
50|$|Cleaning a mechanical-shaker {{baghouse}} {{is accomplished}} by shaking the top horizontal bar from which <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> are suspended. Vibration produced by a motor-driven shaft and cam creates waves in <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> {{to shake off the}} dust cake.|$|R

5|$|On 17 April 1986—the day {{the bodies}} of the {{teachers}} were found and McCarthy was kidnapped—Ann Marie Murphy, a pregnant Irish chambermaid, was discovered in Heathrow airport with a Semtex bomb in the false bottom of one of her bags. She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. <b>The</b> <b>bag</b> had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi, who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married.|$|E
5|$|When the two entered Roubaix, Wegmuller {{ran over}} {{a plastic bag}} that flew {{out in front of}} him, which became jammed in his derailleur. Wegmuller was unable to change gears which was crucial for a sprint finish. He got {{assistance}} from his team car to remove <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> but his gears still would not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to his chances, Wegmuller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him.|$|E
5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving {{their bodies and}} the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown {{and head for the}} beach. Patrick inadvertently loses <b>the</b> <b>Bag</b> of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E
50|$|Water buffalo leaf tripe is {{cut into}} small pieces and the layers {{separated}} to form bags. Diced bone marrow is stuffed into <b>the</b> <b>bags.</b> <b>The</b> opening is gathered and tied with a piece of thread to close it. <b>The</b> <b>bags</b> are then boiled and fried.|$|R
40|$|Nylon-aluminium-polyethylene laminated, {{sealable}} bags {{provided a}} more economical and flexible method of transportation, incubation and storage than anaerobic jars. <b>The</b> <b>bags</b> were {{used with a}} special heat sealer and ‘Anaerocult-A’ sachets to remove oxygen. The environment inside <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> remained oxygen-free for at least 3 years...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the new location, new touches {{were made to the}} service. If a female diner had a handbag, a small side table was placed beside her so that she did not need to place <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> on the floor. Money was not reused; change was only given in new notes and previously unused coins. The kitchen staff were expanded further to around 25, with Robert Reid as the head chef under White. The front of house staff were also expanded to six sommeliers, four Maître d'hôtels and two head waiters. In 1998, ownership of the restaurant transferred to MPW Criterion, a holding company created by White which also owned the Titanic restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen-year-old Andy {{is about}} to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E
5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} boy with a {{basketball}} in his bag walking out of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce out of <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E
60|$|The {{sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> are {{sometimes}} closely approximated; but, when <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> are less flattened, their cavities are, usually, filled with numerous, irregularly rounded, hollow bodies, {{having the same}} kind of wall as the large ones, but not more than one seven-hundredth of an inch in diameter.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a preliminary {{evaluation of the}} possibility of using grass biomass from a sports field as a compost ingredient which positively affects the degree of decomposition of the biodegradable wrappings. For 5 months <b>the</b> biodegradable <b>bags</b> were stored, both empty and filled with organic waste in the heap of grass clippings. After that period, fragments of <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> were observed under the microscope and then assessed the state of their decomposition. The results indicate that the biomass used favourably affected <b>the</b> process of <b>bag</b> degradation, however <b>the</b> speed of decomposition of <b>the</b> empty <b>bags</b> was quicker than <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> filled with <b>the</b> organic waste...|$|R
60|$|The work of {{removing}} the gold began immediately. Tackle was rigged. The negroes went below {{to get out}} <b>the</b> <b>bags,</b> which were hauled up to the deck in a tub. When a moderate boat-load had been taken out, a boat was lowered and manned, and <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> passed down to it.|$|R
5|$|The {{body was}} found inside a plastic garbage bag on the {{shoreline}} of Deer Island in Boston, Massachusetts. A woman walking her dog discovered Bond's remains {{on the afternoon of}} June 25, 2015, when the dog stopped at the plastic bag. After the {{body was found}}, the public placed flowers near the scene. She wore only a pair of white leggings designed with a black polka-dot pattern. A zebra-print blanket was also inside <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> Initially, police were unsure if there would be additional bodies at the scene, so they attempted unsuccessfully to use cadaver dogs to locate any other possible remains.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{rendezvous}} of the Kvant-1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 {{was troubled}} {{by the failure of}} the onboard control system. After the failure of the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to fix the problem. They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing <b>the</b> <b>bag,</b> docking was completed on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and Maggie {{come home}} from trick-or-treating, Marge {{switches}} out the candy with dental hygiene products and asks Homer to deliver the candy to a drive for the troops overseas. Homer instead runs off with <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> to eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls {{to the bottom of}} the canyon with his arm pinned. Fueled by his need to get the out-of-reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off his arm. Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that he was carrying a bag of vegetables, as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had secretly stolen back their candy, inciting an upset Homer to scream in rage.|$|E
30|$|All <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> had a {{starting}} fresh weight of 5  kg (moisture 36  %). <b>The</b> experimental <b>bags</b> {{were made by}} a polyester net with a mesh size of 1  mm, currently used in forest litter studies [15]. For every test <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> were evenly distributed {{with respect to the}} insufflations tube, and finally covered with the composting mixture for a final pile height of approximately 1.5  m (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 c).|$|R
40|$|In two {{experiments}} lasting 4 to 6 weeks, {{communities of}} North Sea coastal plankton kept in separate plastic bags (of about 1400 l) and {{exposed to the}} same environmental conditions showed very similar patterns of growth and decline. This result means that the method is suitable {{for the evaluation of}} toxic effects of environmental pollutants at low concentrations on complex plankton systems. The phytoplankton in <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> produced a succession of blooms, which were probably limited by shortage of nutrients. The dominant zooplankton organisms were various species of copepods which can develop in <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> from egg to adult. Strong indications were found that mineralization of organic matter occurs in <b>the</b> <b>bags.</b> Chemical parameters and phytoplankton biomass were found not to be stratified, indicating that the contents of <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> were well mixed. © 1977 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
60|$|When the Doctor {{went out}} {{he found the}} whole of the {{garrison}} busy. The Major had placed four men on the roof, and had ordered everyone else to fill <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> that had been prepared for the purpose with earth from the garden. It was only an order to the men and male servants, but the ladies had all gone out to render their assistance. As fast as the natives filled <b>the</b> <b>bags</b> with earth <b>the</b> ladies sewed up the mouths of <b>the</b> <b>bags,</b> and <b>the</b> men carried them away and piled them against the gate.|$|R
5|$|After {{recording}} sessions, Lennon, Harrison and Starr {{would be}} chauffeured {{back to their}} houses in the 'stockbroker belt' of Southern England, but Aspinall would often drive McCartney and Evans in an Austin Princess limousine to a late-night club to eat. <b>The</b> <b>Bag</b> O'Nails nightclub {{was one of their}} favourites, at 8 Kingly Street in Soho, London, as it also presented live music. They would eat steak, chips and mushy peas, but Aspinall would always take out a torch from his pocket (in the dimly lit club) to inspect the portions on each of their plates. This was {{to make sure that the}} portions were exactly as they had ordered, which McCartney always found amusing. While Harrison, McCartney and Starr passed their driving tests, Lennon didn't pass his driving test until 1965; however, he rarely drove himself due to being a notoriously bad driver by poorly navigating roads and failing to notice other traffic, and as a result, he was usually chauffeured to and from recording sessions and appointments by his own personal chauffeur.|$|E
5|$|All four cover sleeves for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer ND Chow. The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki holding {{the door to}} a red telephone box in Covent Garden, London, with the album title and her name superimposed on the booth. This marks Hamasaki's third album cover to be photographed and directed outside of Japan, after LOVEppears and (Miss)understood. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with parts of the British stripes across her face. The box set is coloured black with the red British cross near the corner; the album version is the CD and DVD format, with the CD and DVD cover imprinted onto the mug, red tea tin, and <b>the</b> <b>bag.</b> The digital release uses the standalone CD format. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Chow, and the design was based on Hamasaki's first visit to the UK and Britannia. First pressing issues for both the standalone CD format, the CD and DVD format, and the box set included a 36–page photo album of Hamasaki roaming the streets and wondering around stores and markets in London.|$|E
5|$|In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's {{birthday}} plans, infuriating her. Although he {{is convinced}} {{that he has made}} up an enemy to cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham. In <b>the</b> <b>bag</b> is an old Rubik's Cube, a key and a British coin.|$|E
