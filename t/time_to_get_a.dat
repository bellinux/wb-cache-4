500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

This is known as the [...] "automobile exception" [...] to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement. The court's reasoning in Carroll v. United States was twofold: First, the [...] "practical mobility" [...] of an automobile made it impractical to take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> search warrant from a magistrate, since in that time the vehicle could leave the jurisdiction. Second, vehicles were presumed to have a lower expectation of privacy than houses or personal containers, since they provide clear visibility of their contents (through the windows), and their primary purpose is the transportation of people instead of the storage of personal property.

2500|$|Back to the Future: The Game {{received}} generally positive reviews. The first episode, [...] "It's About Time", {{was praised}} by several reviewers {{as an effective}} start to the series. IGN's Greg Miller gave the episode a score of 8.5/10, writing, [...] "it's a movie-inspired game that doesn't suck. Instead, it pushes the characters in interesting directions and whips up a good story." [...] Miller praised Telltale Games for recreating the Back to the Future universe with attention to detail and for the iteration's witty dialogue. Nathan Meunier of GameSpot gave the episode a 7.5/10 score, saying the series [...] "shows a lot of promise with its debut installment". The review added that [...] "The entertaining story that follows is enhanced by believable character interactions, imbuing the adventure with {{a great sense of}} authenticity." [...] Meunier did note that the installment was [...] "surprisingly light on challenge and content." [...] Ben PerLee from GameZone summarized his praise of the game by saying it is a [...] "feel good cinematic experience that any fan of Back to the Future will want to check out, and everyone else would do well to check it out." [...] PALGN gave the installment a 7/10, saying that fans of the films [...] "will find plenty to love with all of the callbacks and nostalgic moments", but calling the game's pace slow and the 1930s setting uninspiring. The review concluded, [...] "Fans will delight in the more nostalgic and clever moments of [...] "It's About Time", but it's a short, easy and somewhat bland introduction to the series, which we hope still has <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot better." [...] In a 2/5 stars review, The Escapist said the first episode of the game [...] "doesn't quite get the tone [...] right and fails to offer up much compelling gameplay." [...] The reviewer called the setting, situations, and characters [...] "bland", further describing the characters as [...] "cardboard nobodies", and did not review the rest of the series. The consensus among critics was that the voice acting was exceptional, with particular praise directed at A.J. Locascio's impersonation of Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly. Most reviewers were critical of the episode's puzzles as being too simplistic and easy. Review aggregator Metacritic assigned the episode an average review score of 74/100.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Doctors' {{professional}} behaviour {{is influenced}} by the way they are paid. When GPs are paid per item, i. e., on a fee-for-service basis (FFS), there is a clear relationship between workload and income: more work means more money. In the case of capitation based payment, workload is not directly linked to income since the fees per patient are fixed. In this study list size was considered as an indicator for workload and we investigated how list size and remuneration affect GP decisions about how they provide consultations. The main objectives of this study were to investigate a) how list size is related to consultation length, waiting <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> appointment, and the likelihood that GPs conduct home visits and b) to what extent the relationships between list size and these three variables are affected by remuneration. Methods List size was used because this is an important determinant of objective workload. List size was corrected for number of older patients and patients who lived in deprived areas. We focussed on three dependent variables that we expected to be related to remuneration and list size: consultation length; waiting <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> appointment; and home visits. Data were derived from the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (DNSGP- 2), carried out between 2000 and 2002. The data were collected using electronic medical records, videotaped consultations and postal surveys. Multilevel regression analyses were performed to assess the hypothesized relationships. Results Our results indicate that list size is negatively related to consultation length, especially among GPs with relatively large lists. A correlation between list size and waiting <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> appointment, and a correlation between list size and the likelihood of a home visit were only found for GPs with small practices. These correlations are modified by the proportion of patients for whom GPs receive capitation fees. Waiting <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> appointment tend <b>to</b> become shorter with increasing patient lists when there is a larger capitation percentage. The likelihood that GPs will conduct home visit rises with increasing patient lists when the capitation percentage is small. Conclusion Remuneration appears to affect GPs' decisions about how they provide consultations, especially among GPs with relatively small patient lists. This role is, however, small compared to other factors such as patient characteristics. </p...|$|R
