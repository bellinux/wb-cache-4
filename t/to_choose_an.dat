5|$|Logan Moore is {{a troubled}} 14-year-old boy {{living with his}} mother Marianne and {{stepfather}} Robert in Newburg, Oregon. Logan does not get along well with Robert or his mother, and holds a grudge against his biological father for leaving when he was young. After an incident at a barbecue, Robert decides to purchase a Labrador Retriever in order to teach Logan responsibility. Eager to rebel against his stepfather, Logan convinces his mother to adopt a dog from an animal shelter. He plans <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> ugly dog and teach it destructive behavior. At the shelter, Logan encounters a young female mutt who immediately takes a liking to him. Logan adopts the dog and names her Jack after Robert's former dog.|$|E

50|$|A Conservative {{leadership}} {{convention was}} held on October 12, 1927 at the Winnipeg Amphitheatre in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

25|$|The final was contested between Victoria and Western Australia. Due to {{the final}} of the World Cup being held at the MCG, Victoria, who earned the right to host the final by {{finishing}} on top of the ladder, had <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> alternative ground. They opted for Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The final was drawn, meaning Victoria won their 29th title by finishing on top of the table. Adam Voges was the leading run-scorer and was named man of the series, while Fawad Ahmed took the most wickets of the season.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, the United States Marine Corps held a {{competition}} <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> assault support helicopter {{to replace the}} Cessna O-1 fixed-wing aircraft and the Kaman OH-43D helicopter. The winner was the UH-1B, which was already in service with the Army. The helicopter was designated the UH-1E and modified to meet Marine requirements. The major changes included the use of all-aluminum construction for corrosion resistance, radios compatible with Marine Corps ground frequencies, a rotor brake for shipboard use to stop the rotor quickly on shutdown and a roof-mounted rescue hoist.|$|E
25|$|Morris {{was one of}} nine Australian Test {{players to}} make his debut in the second Test of the 1884–85 series against England. Selectors were forced <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> entirely new team after the eleven of the first Test refused to play over a dispute {{concerning}} payment of players. Morris took two wickets in the match, including English captain Arthur Shrewsbury, and made just fourteen runs (4 as an opener in the first innings, 10 not out in the second batting at number ten) as Australia lost by ten wickets.|$|E

This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgements if the motivation was to do good.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{came under}} criticism for its alleged use of excessive force on 26 May 2011 when it dispersed protesters led by Nino Burjanadze, among others, with {{tear gas and}} rubber bullets after they refused to clear Rustaveli avenue for an independence day parade despite the expiration of their demonstration permit and despite being offered <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> alternative venue. While human rights activists maintained that the protests were peaceful, the government pointed out that many protesters were masked and armed with heavy sticks and molotov cocktails. Georgian opposition leader Nino Burjanadze said the accusations of planning a coup were baseless, and that the protesters' actions were legitimate.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> {{example that}} did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant that {{it was very difficult to}} do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality. And, as is very common in debates, it was much easier to destroy neoclassical theory than to develop a full-scale alternative that can help us understand the world.|$|E

25|$|When it {{was time}} for him <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> heir, the Yongle Emperor wanted to choose his second son, Zhu Gaoxu. Zhu Gaoxu had an athletic-warrior {{personality}} which contrasted sharply with his elder brother's intellectual and humanitarian nature. Despite much counsel from his advisers, the Yongle Emperor chose his older son, Zhu Gaozhi (the future Hongxi Emperor), as his heir apparent mainly due to advice from Xie Jin. As a result, Zhu Gaoxu became infuriated and refused to give up jockeying for his father's favour and refusing to move to Yunnan Province, where his princedom was located. He {{even went so far as}} to undermine Xie Jin's counsel and eventually killed him.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, the Australian Test team – minus Horan – {{demanded a}} {{significant}} pay rise. When organisers refused the request, the team went on strike. With the Second Test against England due {{to start in}} Melbourne, selectors were forced <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> entirely new team. Horan was selected as captain. His team consisted on nine debutants (five of whom never played Tests again). Australia lost the Test by 10 wickets. In the following Test, Horan, having been stripped of his captaincy duties, made a significant impact with the ball, returning figures of 6/40 from 37.1 four-ball overs in England's first innings at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Horan played his final Test on 21 March 1885. He scored a duck in the first innings and made 20 in the second before being bowled by William Attewell, and bowled three wicketless overs for five runs as England took an innings victory.|$|E
25|$|The first episcopal {{assistant}} of the vicar {{known is}} Angelus de Tineosis, Episcopus Viterbiensis, named 2 October 1321, as {{assistant to the}} Vicar Andreas, Episcopus Terracinensis. His position is not so well outlined in the documents that we can form {{a clear idea of}} his duties. It is significant that Angelus officiated as assistant even when the Vicar Andreas was in the city. On the other hand, the Vicar Franciscus Scaccani, Episcopus Nolanus, was allowed <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> <b>an</b> assistant for the business of the vicariate only in the case of his own absence from Rome. According to this document it was not for the pope but the vicar himself, though authorized thereto by the pope, who chose his own assistant and gave over to him all his authority or faculties, insofar as they were based on law or custom. This shows that the vicarius urbis was firmly established in the fulness of his office and externally recognized as such; certain consuetudinary rights had even at this date grown up and become accepted. We see from the Bullarium Magnum (II, 75) that on 18 October 1412, Pope John XXII nominated Petrus Saccus, a canon of St. Peter's, as locum tenens of the Vicar Franciscus, abbas monasterii S. Martini in Monte Cimino O.S.B., and himself conferred on this official all the faculties of the vicar. The new locum tenens was bidden to take the usual oath before the Apostolic Camera (see above). A similar case is that (1430) of Lucas de Ilpernis, another canon of St. Peter's. When Petrus Accolti, Bishop-elect of Ancona, was named vicarius urbis in 1505, he took over the jurisdiction, but the pontificalia or ceremonial rights were given to Franciscus Berthleay, Bishop of Mylopotamos, until the consecration of Accolti. A similar case is that of Andreas Jacobazzi, a canon of St. Peter's, named vicar in 1519, but not consecrated as Bishop of Lucera until 1520; the pontificalia were committed to Vincentius, Bishop of Ottochaz-Zengg.|$|E
