A novel routing protocol named CAMARP for the interplanetary backbone network is proposed in this letter. We use wait delay to consider future <b>link</b> <b>connection</b> and make the best next hop selection. A load balancing mechanism is used to avoid congestion. The proposed method leads to a better and more efficient distribution of traffic, and also leads to lower packet drop rates and higher throughput.

30|$|Figure 3 {{illustrates}} {{an activity}} diagram of a mobile node, which represents a workflow of stepwise activities and actions describing control plane and data plane interaction, coordinated {{by the decision}} module. This activity diagram is equal for all network nodes, and represents the concept of control plane and data plane separation with out-of-band signaling. Each network node autonomously manages its control plane and data plane <b>link</b> <b>connections.</b> Nodes are always searching for new contact opportunities, using their control plane <b>link</b> <b>connection</b> (low-power, low bandwidth, long-range), which is always active. A decision module is responsible for processing the control information exchanged at a new contact opportunity {{to decide whether to}} accept the contact, and for determining {{the amount of time that}} lasts the contact [27]. Then, the data plane <b>link</b> <b>connection</b> (high-power, high bandwidth, short-range) is activated, and remains in this state only during the estimated period of time that lasts the contact. Nodes use their data plane link to exchange data bundles. The BSC layer executes the control plane functions, such as signaling messages exchange, resources reservation (at the data plane), and routing. The BAD layer executes the data plane functions that deal with data bundles. These functions include storage management, queuing and scheduling, and traffic classification, among others.|$|R

50|$|A data <b>link</b> <b>connection</b> {{identifier}} (DLCI) is a Frame Relay 10 bit wide link-local {{virtual circuit}} identifier {{used to assign}} frames to a specific PVC or SVC.

The wheel carrier {{takes the form of a}} splined stub axle (for knock-off wheels) or a stub axle and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|R

30|$|To {{enable the}} direct link {{communication}} between STAs in infrastructure-based wireless networks, the researches {{have been carried}} out in [5 – 7]. Before the actual direct link communication between STAs is activated, the direct <b>link</b> <b>connection</b> should be established based on the connectivity information. The MAC protocol proposed in [6] assumes that the AP maintains a database for the geographical locations of the STAs and the connectivity information among the STAs can be derived from this database. The hybrid coordination function (HCF) protocol in [5] proposes the four-step process of establishing the direct <b>link</b> <b>connection,</b> but the method for obtaining the connectivity information is not specified in [5]. Our previous work in [7] proposes the efficient method for the APs collecting the connectivity and interference information among the STAs, and the simultaneous polling method to allow the multiple direct data communication to be performed simultaneously.|$|R
