5|$|Nepotism is {{a common}} feature {{in the history of}} governance, {{particularly}} in cultures where identity and loyalty are determined more {{at the level of the}} family than that of <b>the</b> <b>nation-state.</b> The use of nephews, rather than direct descendants, is a product of the tradition of clerical celibacy within the Catholic Church, although hereditary descent from uncles to nephews is also seen in the patriarchate of the Assyrian Church of the East.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> is the {{creation}} of a national culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate the idea of a shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E

5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as bringing people together on <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E

25|$|Cities and the Wealth of Nations {{attempts}} {{to do for}} economics what The Death and Life of Great American Cities did for modern urban planning, though it has not received the same critical attention. Beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics, this book challenges {{one of the fundamental}} assumptions of the greatest economists. Classical (and Neo-classical) economists consider <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> to be the main player in macroeconomics. Jacobs argues that it is not <b>the</b> <b>nation-state,</b> rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game. She restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book The Economy of Cities, while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second, or not at all.|$|E

How it can be possible that the parliamentary democracy which is practiced {{on the national level}} can be achieved beyond <b>the</b> <b>nation-states</b> without diminishing <b>the</b> democracy at <b>the</b> <b>nation-states?</b> If not, how legitimacy can be obtained so that the continued existence and expansion of the EU should be justified? Since expectations for democratization of the EU are still unmet, finding answers to the actual questions is a great appeal. The thesis will explore the fundamental debates and arguments contributing to the democracy in the EU through the parliaments. I will try to reflect to the different ways of thinking and the prospects of establishing parliamentary democracy beyond the nation states...|$|R

Spain was not a political entity until much later, and when referring to the Middle Ages, one should not be confounded with <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> of today. The term The Spains referred specifically to a collective of juridico-political units, first the Christian kingdoms, and then the different kingdoms ruled by the same king.|$|E
25|$|While the French Republics – {{the epitome}} of <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> – {{have a long history}} of {{attempting}} the complete cultural absorption of ethnic minority groups – including the French Basques – Spain in turn has accepted intermittently in its history some degree of linguistic, cultural, and political autonomy to the Basques. Altogether there was a gradual language shift towards Spanish language in the Basque-speaking areas of the Spanish Basque Country, a phenomenon initially restricted to the upper urban classes, but progressively reaching the lower classes. Western Biscay, most of Alava and southern Navarre have been Spanish-speaking (or Romance-speaking) for centuries.|$|E

30|$|The {{political}} system: The political system, as a fifth subsystem, is also {{of crucial}} importance, because it formulates the ‘will’, where to <b>the</b> state (<b>nation-state)</b> is heading toward {{in the present}} and future, thereby also defining, organizing as well as administering the general conditions of <b>the</b> state (<b>nation-state).</b> Therefore, this helix has a ‘political and legal capital’ (for example: ideas, laws, plans, politicians, etc.).|$|R
25|$|In {{the present}} era of globalization, the {{recognition}} of global interdependence {{on the part of}} the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending their students to study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} the {{indigenous}} groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized, isolated or minimally participative one, in comparison to majority groups or <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> as a whole. Their ability to influence {{and participate in the}} external policies that may exercise jurisdiction over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and land rights.|$|E

25|$|Mommsen's History of Rome, {{his most}} famous work, {{appeared}} as three volumes in 1854, 1855, and 1856; it expounded Roman history {{up to the end}} of the Roman republic and the rule of Julius Caesar. Since Mommsen admired Caesar, he felt unable to describe the death of his hero. He closely compared the political thought and terminology of the ancient Republic, especially during its last century, with the situation of his own time, e.g., <b>the</b> <b>nation-state,</b> democracy and incipient imperialism. It is one of the great classics of historical works. Mommsen never wrote a promised next volume to recount subsequent events during the imperial period, i.e., a volume 4, although demand was high for a continuation. Immediately very popular and acknowledged internationally by classical scholars, the work also quickly received criticism.|$|E
25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that <b>the</b> <b>nation-state</b> is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
