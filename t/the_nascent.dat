5|$|Assay Commission medals {{were struck}} {{from a variety}} of metals, {{including}} copper, silver, bronze, and pewter. The first Assay Commission medals were struck in 1860 at the direction of Mint Director James Ross Snowden. The initial purpose in having medals struck was not principally to provide keepsakes to the assay commissioners, but to advertise the Mint's medal-striking capabilities. <b>The</b> <b>nascent</b> custom lapsed when Snowden left office in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{catered to}} gay people, the bar became a {{flashpoint}} for <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> homophile movement. The Black Cat {{was at the}} center of a legal fight that was one of the earliest court cases to establish legal protections for gay people in the United States. Despite this victory, continued pressure from law enforcement agencies eventually forced the bar's closure in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Comprising <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> {{motion picture}} genres of horror and science fiction, the {{nightmare}} picture provoked individual psychological terror in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological terror in its science fiction manifestations. The two main types of pre-Code horror pictures were the single monster movie, and films where masses of hideous beasts rose up and attacked their putative betters. Frankenstein and Freaks exemplified both genres.|$|E
5|$|During the August 2009 summer congressional recess, {{many members}} {{went back to}} their districts and held town hall {{meetings}} on the proposals. <b>The</b> <b>nascent</b> Tea Party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals attended the meetings to oppose the proposed reforms. Many threats were made against members of Congress {{over the course of the}} debate.|$|E
5|$|In Petrograd, {{the work}} of {{beginning}} publication was assisted by <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda Union, and the new paper bolstered the city's indigenous anarcho-syndicalist movement.

5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I. As a result, the veracity of Theophanes's account has been questioned by recent scholarship, which places more emphasis on the Arabic and Syriac sources.|$|E
5|$|According to Teeuw, {{after the}} {{publication}} of Atheis Mihardja immediately became famous. Maier notes that the fame and warm reception to which Atheis was released was influenced not only by the novel's strengths, but also by Mihardja's personality and stature. These qualities were in-line with <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> government's need to use literature, as the most developed of the new national culture, for nation-building; in 1969, Atheis received a literary award from the government of Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, {{the firm}} {{moved from the}} Security Building to the newly {{constructed}} Valley Center (now Chase Tower). As the decade closed, <b>the</b> then <b>nascent</b> national legal press reported storm clouds on the economic horizon for lawyers.|$|R
30|$|We also {{consider}} the effect that current business ownership (owner-manager) or pursuit of nascent entrepreneurial activities of <b>the</b> respondent (<b>nascent</b> entrepreneur) might have on one’s positive perception of entrepreneurial abilities by segregating non-entrepreneurs from owner-mangers and nascent entrepreneurs using dummies.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1952, Warwick County {{converted}} {{to an independent}} city. On July 1, 1958, <b>the</b> still <b>nascent</b> city of Warwick was politically re-consolidated with the independent city of Newport News, which had itself broken away from Warwick County in 1896.|$|R
5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the {{proclamation}} of Indonesian independence in August 1945, the Japanese began withdrawing from <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> republic. The Indonesian republican government, based in Jakarta and including Sukarno {{as president and}} Mohammad Hatta as vice president, began to take over infrastructure from the departing Japanese. By September 1945, however, allied British and Dutch forces had begun to enter the archipelago, hoping to reestablish the status quo ante. The British initially focused on Java and Sumatra and attempted to avoid armed confrontations with the Republican forces; the Dutch, meanwhile, spent the first months after the Japanese surrender reclaiming the eastern islands with help from Australia.|$|E
5|$|After {{the novel}} was published, it caused {{considerable}} discussion. Religious thinkers, Marxist-Leninists, and anarchists decried the novel for not explaining their ideologies in more detail, but literary figures {{and many in}} the general public praised it; this positive reception may {{have been influenced by}} <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> government's need to promote literature for nation-building. Atheis was translated into Malay before 1970 and into English in 1972; it was also adapted into a film with the same title in 1974. The novel, which received an award from the Indonesian government in 1969, is one of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{is not well}} understood but RITS degrade nascent mRNA transcripts. It has been suggested this mechanism acts as a 'self-reinforcing feedback loop' as <b>the</b> degraded <b>nascent</b> transcripts are used by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to generate more siRNAs.|$|R

Similar studies with Escherichia coli ribosomes, using antibodies directed against the enzyme beta- galactosidase, show that <b>the</b> polypeptide <b>nascent</b> chain emerges in the same relative position in plants and bacteria. The eucaryotic ribosomal exit site is on the large subunit, approximately 75 A from the interface between subunits and nearly 160 A from the central protuberance, the presumed site for peptidyl transfer. This is the first functional site on both the eucaryotic and procaryotic ribosomes to be determined...|$|R
5|$|Around May6, {{the monsoon}} trough {{extended}} across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity. A broad low-pressure area {{formed by the}} next day and remained nearly stationary. Over the next few days, the convection varied in intensity until becoming more organized around <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> surface low on May10. At 03:00UTC on May10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported the formation of a depression about 535km (330mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified into a deep depression. Around the same time, the system was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

5|$|In 1811, while Tecumseh was traveling, Harrison was {{authorized}} by Secretary of War William Eustis to march against <b>the</b> <b>nascent</b> confederation {{as a show}} of force. Harrison led an army of more than 1,000 men north, to intimidate the Shawnee into making peace. Instead, the tribes launched a surprise attack on Harrison's army early on November 7, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of Tippecanoe. Harrison defeated the tribal forces at Prophetstown, next to the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers. Harrison was hailed as a national hero and the battle became famous. However, his troops had greatly outnumbered the attackers, and suffered many more casualties during the battle.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSecM in Escherichia coli has two {{functionally}} crucial regions. The arrest motif {{near the}} C-terminus {{interacts with the}} ribosomal exit tunnel to arrest its own translational elongation. The signal sequence at the N-terminus directs <b>the</b> SecM <b>nascent</b> polypeptide to <b>the</b> Sec-mediated export pathway to release the arrested state of translation. Here, we addressed {{the importance of the}} central region of SecM. Characterization of internal substitution and deletion mutants revealed that a segment from residue 100 to residue 109 is required for the export-coupled release of <b>the</b> SecM <b>nascent</b> chain from <b>the</b> elongation-arrested state. Thus, the central region of SecM is not just a geometric linker but it participates actively in the regulation of translation arrest...|$|R
