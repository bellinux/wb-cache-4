5|$|In Germany and Illyricum, {{the legions}} were in mutiny. In Germany, the legions in mutiny {{were those of}} the Lower Rhine under Aulus Caecina (the V Alaudae, XXI Rapax, I Germanica, and XX Valeria Victrix). The army of the Lower Rhine was {{stationed}} in summer quarters {{on the border of}} the Ubii. They had not gotten <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> promised them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. Germanicus dealt with the troops in Germania, and Tiberius' son Drusus dealt with Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|Problems arose {{quickly for}} the new Princeps. The Roman legions posted in Pannonia and in Germania had not been paid <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> promised them by Augustus, and after {{a short period of}} time mutinied when it was clear that a {{response}} from Tiberius was not forthcoming. Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{had little}} time to mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of his}} grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Combs had {{advocated}} a progressive platform that included increased funding for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports. Soon after his election, he won {{approval for a}} three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to military veterans, although he could have funded <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> with a one-percent tax. He had asked for the larger tax in order to fund his other priorities. As {{a result of the}} sales tax, Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget. One study showed that Kentucky doubled its per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state. Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the sales tax had made the project possible.|$|E
5|$|Hawks' friend Howard Hughes finally {{suggested}} Cary Grant for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with Howard Hughes throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E

Unions were baffled that any bankers were getting bonuses, considering the bank {{is owned by the}} taxpayer. The 2010 figure was an improvement on the loss of £3.6 billion in 2009 and the record-breaking £24bn loss in 2008. <b>The</b> <b>bonuses</b> for staff in 2010 topped £950 million.

25|$|Lane Pryce (Jared Harris); {{recurring}} Season 3, regular Seasons 4–5: The English {{financial officer}} installed by Sterling Cooper's new British parent company. He first {{appears in the}} first episode of Season 3. His role {{is that of a}} strict taskmaster who brings spending under control, in particular by cutting out frivolous expenses. His efforts are so successful, he is to be sent to India to enact cost-cutting measures, a move which Pryce is not looking forward to after having settled in with his wife and child in New York. An unfortunate accident at work handicaps his replacement, thus allowing Pryce to keep his current position. He warms to American culture, and foresees some form of cultural and societal changes in American race relations. When the British parent company is sold at the end of Season 3, Pryce realizes he has become expendable and negotiates to become a founding partner in the new agency that Don Draper, Bert Cooper and Roger Sterling want to form. At Draper's suggestion, Pryce frees Sterling, Cooper, and Draper from their contractual non-compete clauses by firing them, then is fired himself, enabling the four of them to start their own firm. When hard times hit SCDP after Lucky Strike, their largest client, leaves them in Season 4, Pryce liquidates his portfolio in order to pay his share of the cash infusion required by the bank as collateral for a loan that keeps SCDP afloat. His finances already tight, he faces a crisis when the British Inland Revenue demand immediate payment of back taxes on the gain from the sale of his portfolio in Season 5. In order to pay the debt, Pryce secretly negotiates a $50,000 line of credit on behalf of the firm and announces to the partners that SCDP has a $50,000 profit and is able to pay bonuses. In anticipation of the bonus, Pryce forges Draper's signature on an early bonus check to himself, and views it as a 13-day loan which will be made good once <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> are paid. However, the partners decide to forgo their bonuses despite Pryce's pleading. In the penultimate episode of Season 5, Cooper discovers the cancelled check and confronts Draper, who in turn confronts Pryce, demanding his resignation. That weekend, Pryce types out a resignation letter and hangs himself in his office.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1873, President Grant {{signed a}} law that {{increased}} the president's salary from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year.

500|$|Final Fantasy VIII used an {{experience}} point and level system {{quite different from}} previous games in the series. [...] While EXP is awarded after battling and defeating enemies, who are predominantly encountered randomly, {{and contribute to the}} continued strengthening and level-gaining of the characters, here the similarity ends. [...] While previous levels required ever-increasing amounts of EXP to surmount (e.g. getting to level 2 might require 200 experience points, level 3 required 400, etc.), FF8 characters gain a level after accumulating a flat rate of 1000 points per level. [...] Enemies around the world gain levels averaging with the party's average level. [...] Higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage, may have additional special attacks, and carry additional magic spells, allowing for Junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> imparted by level-gain. [...] The game's unique EXP and level system allows a player to grind to maximum Level 100 before even beginning the plot.|$|E

500|$|Complaints {{were raised}} on the first-person perspective, with Ryan Scott of GameSpy {{considered}} it a [...] "weird forced handicap". Phil Kollar of Game Informer expressed disappointment that the game prevents the player from moving while in first person view. The A.V. Club David Wolinsky found the pixel hunting sequences irritating, while Official Nintendo Magazine Chris Scullion similarly described them as the [...] "only truly horrible moments" [...] in the game. Critics responded poorly to the mechanic of power-up restriction; they derided it as a deviation from the series' tradition of item discovery, and even more strongly criticized it as nonsensical and condescending in terms of story. GamesRadar derided the game's linearity in comparison with Metroid Fusion, a game which took a similar approach. The website also found the enemies to be [...] "a largely unimpressive collection", a gripe which Edge also had; it wrote that [...] "truly testing enemies are only found in the last stretch". Other Ms short length was criticized by reviewers, by critics such as GameTrailers, which writes that <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> such as art galleries were not stimulating enough to entice replay value.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Materia Generation System" [...] allows {{players to}} acquire Materia, objects {{tied to the}} game's magic system, by taking a picture with their camera phone. The game synthesizes the picture down to its base color. Depending upon the {{dominant}} color, lighting, and other factors, the game produces a Materia of a certain type. For example, a dark green picture results in a Bio Materia, while a blue picture results in a Cure Materia. Once acquired, Materia can be leveled up as in Final Fantasy VII. Under certain circumstances, assistance {{in the form of}} summoned monsters, recurring figures in the Final Fantasy series, can be called in via the Materia system to deal damage to multiple enemies. Rank Points are awarded during the completion of objectives in all three modes of play. After a certain amount of Rank Points have been acquired, special bonuses are unlocked, such as stronger armor and weapons, and extra Materia slots. The player is also given a rank, based upon how long they have been playing the game. The higher their rank, the better <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> the player gets.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} solve a puzzle, the player must input an answer on the bottom screen. Sometimes, this will involve tapping a button {{labelled}} [...] "Input Answer" [...] and writing a word or number that solves the given puzzle. Other times, they might be asked to circle an answer or tap an area on the touch screen, and then hit [...] "Submit". Still others are solved automatically once the player finds the solution by interacting with objects on the bottom screen. If the player has {{made a mistake in}} solving a puzzle, they can hit the button labelled [...] "Restart" [...] to reset the puzzle. Deducted Picarats and purchased hints are not reset if a puzzle is restarted. If the player submits an incorrect answer, they will be asked to repeat the puzzle, and a varying amount of Picarats will be deducted from the maximum possible for that puzzle. If the player submits a correct answer, they are rewarded with the amount of Picarats the puzzle is worth, and the plot will progress. After completing a puzzle, it can be played again at any time from the Puzzle Index, a section in the game's interface that lists the puzzles a player has completed. Occasionally, after completing a puzzle, the player will receive small items {{that can be used in}} minigames.

500|$|In {{his first}} speech of 2012, Miliband {{said that if}} Labour won the 2015 general {{election}} times would be difficult economically, but Labour was still the only party capable of delivering [...] "fairness". He also said he would tackle [...] "vested interests", citing energy and rail companies. Following the announcement in late January 2012 that {{the chief executive officer}} of the nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland, Stephen Hester, would receive a bonus worth £950,000, Miliband called the amount [...] "disgraceful", and urged David Cameron to act to prevent the bonus. Cameron refused, saying it was a matter for the RBS board, leading Miliband to announce that Labour would force a Commons vote on whether or not the government should block it. Hester announced that he would forego his bonus, and Miliband said Labour would carry on with a Commons vote regardless, focusing instead on <b>the</b> <b>bonuses</b> of other RBS executives. Following George Galloway's unexpected win in the March by-election in Bradford West, Miliband announced he would lead an inquiry into the result, saying, it [...] "could not be dismissed as a one-off". In April 2012, in the midst of a debate about the nature of political party funding, Miliband called on David Cameron to institute a £5,000 cap on donations from individuals and organisations to political parties, after it had been suggested that the government favoured a cap of £50,000. On 14 July 2012, Miliband became the first Leader of the Labour Party to attend and address the Durham Miners' Gala in 23 years. In the same month, Miliband became the first British politician to be invited to France to meet the new French President, François Hollande.|$|E
