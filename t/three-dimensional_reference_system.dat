50|$|Utah {{students}} modeled {{other common}} objects. For his 1971 dissertation, Henri Gouraud developed Gouraud shading, using his wife Sylvie's face as a model. In 1972, Ivan Sutherland challenged his graphics class to choose something iconic to realistically render. The students selected the Volkswagen Beetle—as {{a symbol of}} global culture, because it was large enough to measure as a group, and because Ivan’s wife, Marsha, owned one. The students painted points and lines {{on the surface of}} the Beetle to describe a set of polygons. A volleyball stanchion and joints in the pavement formed a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system.</b> The points and polygons were rendered using hardware developed by 1970 Utah Ph.D. Gary Watkins to imprint shaded images onto a direct film recorder. Also in 1972, Ed Catmull and Fred Parke, both students of Sutherland, made a video illustrating the process of modeling Catmull's left hand and its use in animation. Catmull made a plaster mold, to which he then added points and polygons in a similar way. Catmull received his Ph.D. in 1974, and went on to found Pixar. The video has recently been added to the National Film register as one of the earliest fully rendered computer animations.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is about}} a device for non-invasive monitoring of an eye position and ocular movements of a patient, comprising: - a housing body (2) having at least one through opening (2 a); - a plurality of light sources (3) housed in said housing body (2); - a plurality of sensor means (4) housed in said housing body (2); - deflector means (6) for invisible radiation (RL) supplied, in use, by said plurality of light sources (3) and reflected by said eye (O) under examination; - support means (8) that can be adjusted for said housing body (2); - at least one program data processing and control unit (9). The support means (8) can be adjusted {{in such a way}} that the through opening (2 a) of the housing body (2) can be placed at the eye (O) under examination so that the invisible radiation hits the eye (O) frontally.

40|$|Abstract: Wall {{paintings}} of the subterranean roman graveyards are a mirror of early-Christian society in late antiquity. Their iconographical content develops as a <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> in architectural space, which can only efficiently be deciphered under optimal laboratory-like conditions. Our paper is intended to refer what is to become the new standard in catacomb documentation, being evolved {{as one of the}} major research strategies of the Austrian START-Project “The Domitilla Catacomb in Rome. Archaeology, Architecture and Art History of a Late Roman Cemetery”. The approach is based on image laser scanning and mapping of separately taken photographs, creating photorealistic 3 d models, which are to serve as a new kind of data-base for further studies. Problems of orientation and accuracy- created by using two different data-sources of digital images and terrestrial laser scanner outputs- led to a laborious work-flow containing data acquisition, registration, preparation and cleaning, triangulation and texturing, still to be optimized, but finally providing the desired 3 d, photo-realistic and high-precision architectural models of the spatially defined burial areas. Problems however arise in some topographically important units, when trying to process even larger amounts of data, thus representing a technological threshold that can hardly be overcome by non-specialist users like architects and archaeologists.

40|$|A {{geodetic}} control network is the wire-frame or the skeleton on which continuous and consistent mapping, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and surveys are based. Traditionally, {{geodetic control}} points are established as permanent physical monuments placed {{in the ground and}} precisely marked, located, and documented. With the development of satellite surveying methods and their availability and high degree of accuracy, a {{geodetic control network}} could be established by using GNSS and referred to an international terrestrial reference frame used as a <b>three-dimensional</b> geocentric <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> for a country. Based on this concept, in 1992, the Egypt Survey Authority (ESA) established two networks, namely High Accuracy Reference Network (HARN) and the National Agricultural Cadastral Network (NACN). To transfer the International Terrestrial Reference Frame to the HARN, the HARN was connected with four IGS stations. The processing results were 1 : 10, 000, 000 (Order A) for HARN and 1 : 1, 000, 000 (Order B) for NACN relative network accuracy standard between stations defined in ITRF 1994 Epoch 1996. Since 1996, ESA did not perform any updating or maintaining works for these networks. To see how non-performing maintenance degrading the values of the HARN and NACN, the available HARN and NACN stations in the Nile Delta were observed. The Processing of the tested part was done by CSRS-PPP Service based on utilizing Precise Point Positioning “PPP” and Trimble Business Center “TBC”. The study shows the feasibility of Precise Point Positioning in updating the absolute positioning of the HARN network and its role in updating the reference frame (ITRF). The study also confirmed the necessity of the absent role of datum maintenance of Egypt networks...|$|R
40|$|As the {{adoption}} of Building Information Modelling (BIM) becomes pervasive and its level of application matures, the need to incorporate domain-specific knowledge in BIM authoring tools is also increasing. Rule-based scripts that assist and guide the modeller in model authoring are needed to enhance the level of usage of BIM. The authors developed a framework for incorporation of rule-driven domain knowledge into BIM authoring tools. With the objective of customizing the modelling process using a set of rules, the approach {{presented in this paper}} combines rules of modular coordination in prefabricated building with BIM. Modular coordination, a dimensional coordination system for sizing and placing building elements within a <b>three-dimensional</b> (3 D) <b>reference</b> <b>system,</b> is translated into rules that are incorporated into the BIM authoring tool through object-level and process-level interventions. The study explores various options of parametric modelling for integration of identified modular coordination rules. The aim of integrating modular coordination rules is to assist the user during the modelling process. The proposed approach has the potential of reducing inconsistencies and time spent in modelling and documentation allowing the designer to spend more effort on value-adding design tasks. With the help of a case study and an experiment, capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated and validated...|$|R

The new model, Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM 96), incorporates improved surface gravity data, altimeter-derived gravity anomalies from ERS- 1 and from the GEOSAT Geodetic Mission (GM), extensive satellite tracking data-including new data from Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), the Global Postioning System (GPS), NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS), the French DORIS system, and the US Navy TRANET Doppler tracking system-as well as direct altimeter ranges from TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P), ERS- 1, and GEOSAT. The final solution blends a low-degree combination model to degree 70, a block-diagonal solution from degree 71 to 359, and a quadrature solution at degree 360. The model was used to compute geoid undulations accurate to better than one meter (with the exception of areas void of dense and accurate surface gravity data) and realize WGS 84 as a true <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>reference</b> <b>system.</b> Additional results from the EGM 96 solution include models of the dynamic ocean topography to degree 20 from T/P and ERS- 1 together, and GEOSAT separately, and improved orbit determination for Earth-orbiting satellites...|$|E

40|$|The {{free energy}} of a {{molecular}} system can, at least in principle, be computed by thermodynamic perturbation from a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> whose free energy is known.

However, the conformational overlap of this <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> tends to decline steeply with increasing dimensionality, due {{to the neglect of}} correlations among the coordinates. Here, we test a <b>reference</b> <b>system</b> that can account for pairwise correlations among the internal coordinates, as captured by their two-dimensional marginal PDFs derived from a molecular simulation.
