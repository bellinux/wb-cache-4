It is also the basis for speeding up distortion measurements, for the prediction of distortion in the sound field and for the detection of noise and other disturbances not generated by the transducer. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{transducer}} function mu for contrast perception {{describes the}} nonlinear mapping of stimulus contrast onto an internal response. Under a signal detection theory approach, the <b>transducer</b> <b>model</b> of contrast perception {{states that the}} internal response elicited by a stimulus of contrast c is a random variable with mean mu(c). Using this approach, we derive the formal relations between the transducer function, the threshold-versus-contrast (TvC) function, and the psychometric functions for contrast detection and discrimination in 2 AFC tasks. We show that the mathematical form of the TvC function is determined only by mu, and that the psychometric functions for detection and discrimination have a common mathematical form with common parameters emanating from, and only from, the transducer function mu and {{the form of the}} distribution of the internal responses. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these relations, which have bearings on the tenability of certain mathematical forms for the psychometric function and on the suitability of empirical approaches to model validation. We also present the results of a comprehensive test of these relations using two alternative forms of the transducer model: a three-parameter version that renders logistic psychometric functions and a five-parameter version using Foley's variant of the Naka-Rushton equation as transducer function.

40|$|The {{determination}} of material properties for very small specimens such as biological cells or semiconductor microchips {{is extremely difficult}} {{and has been a}} challenging issue for several decades. One important constraint during these measurements is not to harm the specimens during the test process because the specimens, biological cells in particular, are vulnerable to the test itself even during a short period of testing time. Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is the only suitable precess for such applications. It is fast, causes no disturbance and can give a real time response while being cost effective. Many NDE methods are available today, such as, laser based techniques, Radiography, Magnetic techniques, High resolution photography and other optical techniques, MRI, acoustic and ultrasonic techniques to name a few. Ultrasound is the most popular tool for NDE. As specimens become smaller, the need for shorter wave length ultrasound increases dramatically. The use of acoustic waves in microscopy technology provides many more benefits than its conventional optical microscope counterpart. One such benefit is its ability to inspect a specimen in dark. Another is the capability to see inside an optically opaque specimen. Today, very high frequency, higher than 1 Giga Hertz (109 Hz), ultrasound is being used. This technology has improved at the same pace as the development of electronics and computer science. 	In acoustic microscopy experiments wave speed and wave attenuation in the specimen are measured by the V(f) technique. A specimen's density, Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus are directly related to the wave speed. V(f) method, as discussed in this dissertation, has some advantages over the more commonly used V(z) method. 	In order to correctly estimate the wave speed and attenuation in the specimen, the <b>transducer</b> <b>modeling</b> should be completed first. The Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) is used in this dissertation to model a 1 GHz acoustic microscope lens. Then the model-predicted pressure field is used in a FORTRAN program to calculate the thickness profile and properties of biological cell specimens from experimental data. <b>Transducer</b> <b>modeling</b> at 1 GHz has rarely been attempted earlier because it requires an immense amount of computer time and memory.
