He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about on Fringe." ...|$|E
500|$|A film {{based on}} the Runaways went {{through a number of}} iterations. Brian K. Vaughan was {{originally}} hired to write a screenplay {{based on the}} property in May 2008. In April 2010, Marvel hired Peter Sollett to direct the film, and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May. The following October, development on the film was put on hold, with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the Runaways film had been shelved in favor of The Avengers, with the earliest it could release being Phase Three. In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without Runaways, Feige stated the project was [...] "still an awesome script that exists in our script vault", adding, [...] "We'd love to do something with Runaways some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about, because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all." [...] In August 2016, Marvel Television announced Marvel's Runaways from the streaming service Hulu, with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017. It is scheduled to premiere in November 2017.|$|E

500|$|Cotto and Margarito's {{aggressive}} boxing styles led to much speculation of {{a potential}} fight of the year candidate. Junior welterweight titleholder Paulie Malignaggi said that the fight would be [...] "pure entertainment", and HBO commentator Jim Lampley said that [...] "I'm asking for one of my top 10fights in my 22years of calling fights on television". Dave Larzelere of Sporting News wrote that the bout had [...] "the potential {{to be one of}} those epic Irresistible Force vs. Immoveable Object kind of battles <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about forever afterwards, à la Hagler/Hearns or Corrales/Castillo". Jeff Haney of the Las Vegas Sun described the fight as [...] "not only the sport’s most promising matchup of the year. It also conjures memories of past fights in which regional or national pride was at stake", noting the rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Arizona Republic wrote, [...] "Cotto, an impassive and intimidating Puerto Rican, and Margarito, a patient and tough Mexican, are another chapter in a rivalry rich in legends and still productive". Yahoo! Sports writer Kevin Iole felt that the boxing match would provide a performance similar to that of the fight between Jose Luis Castillo and Diego Corrales, which was named fight of the year by The Ring magazine.|$|E

We put our grizzled heads together, we older ones, and we talk of the great days that we have known; but we find that when it is with our children <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> it is a hard matter to make them understand. We and our fathers before us lived much the same life, but they with their railway trains and their steamboats belong to a different age. It is true that we can put history-books into their hands, and they can read from them of our weary struggle of two and twenty years with that great and evil man. They can learn how Freedom fled from the whole broad continent, and how Nelson's blood was shed, and Pitt's noble heart was broken in striving that she should not pass us for ever to take refuge with our brothers across the Atlantic. All this they can read, with the date of this treaty or that battle, but I do not know where they are to read of ourselves, of the folk we were, and the lives we led, and how the world seemed to our eyes when they were young as theirs are now.|$|E
