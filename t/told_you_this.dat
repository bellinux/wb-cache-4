500|$|The discovery, made by Edward B. Daeschler of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Neil H. Shubin {{from the}} University of Chicago, and Harvard University Professor Farish A. Jenkins, Jr, was {{published}} in the April 6, 2006, issue of Nature and quickly recognized as a transitional form. Jennifer A. Clack, a Cambridge University expert on tetrapod evolution, said of Tiktaalik, [...] "It's one of those things you can point to and say, 'I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> would exist,' and there it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Semyon Vengerov {{quoted a}} source who knew Pisemsky closely as having called Yekaterina Pavlovna [...] "a perfect {{literary}} wife who took {{very close to}} her heart all the literary anxieties and troubles of her husband, all the jigsaws of his creative career, cherishing his talent and doing whatever was possible {{to keep him in}} conditions favourable to the development of his talent. Add to all this a rare leniency, of which she had to have a great deal of, to put up with Aleksey, who occasionally demonstrated qualities not congenial with being a family man." [...] Ivan Turgenev, in one of his letters, imploring Pisemsky {{to get rid of this}} spleen of his, wrote: [...] "I think I've <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> once, but I might as well repeat it. Do not forget that in the lottery of life you've won a major prize: you have an excellent wife and nice children..." ...|$|E
60|$|BARTHWICK. [Hurrying.] Thank {{goodness}} you've come, Roper. You {{remember what}} I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> afternoon; we've {{just had the}} detective here.|$|E
60|$|Har. Jun. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> Spaniard had not courage {{enough for}} such an enterprise.|$|R
60|$|Con. It cannot be, Ione! They {{could not}} {{raise their hands}} 'gainst one who hath striven for their good. They cannot wish the life I would so gladly have lain down to save them. Who <b>told</b> <b>thee</b> <b>this,</b> Ione? I cannot--no, I will not think they could prove so ungrateful unto their prince.|$|R
60|$|There now! I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this,</b> {{knowing your}} kindness, {{and that you}} will care to hear of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Goshen, child? This ain't Goshen. This is St. Petersburg. Goshen's ten mile {{further up}} the river. Who <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> was Goshen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Daggett has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Deacon Pratt"--said Gardiner, in his off-hand way. [...] "And {{he is the}} man who {{has told}} you of those sealing-islands too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I remember! Do {{you mean}} to tell me, then," [...] Margaret went on, with a little shiver, [...] "that father <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> was going to happen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Bingham," [...] said Basil, {{setting a}} chair for him, [...] "I imagine that Miss Chadd has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of <b>this</b> {{distressing}} occurrence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gyp, it is a {{year since}} I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of <b>this.</b> <b>You</b> did not believe me then. I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> too, that I loved you. I love you more, now, a hundred times! Don't move! I am going up to Gustav." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your mother, the Countess of St. Maurice, <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this?</b> She desires our marriage? She {{knows what}} you are asking me?" [...] I {{repeated}} breathlessly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{tell you}} seriously,' rejoined Ralph, 'what I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> minute. Stay. Let {{me look at}} you. There's a liquorish devilry in your face. What is this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. After what I saw at Craig Fernie, I {{grow more}} and more uneasy about Anne. You will {{understand}} that, I am sure, after what I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned off}} a little, facing round {{toward the wall}} and holding up his hand to look at as one had seen sick {{children}} look. [...] "I've told you--I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} {{very glad to}} take your duty, Desmond," [...] Ralph said eagerly. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> so <b>this</b> morning, and I thought you agreed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this</b> the day {{we first}} met," [...] said Low with grave astonishment. [...] "Don't you {{remember}} our long talk coming from church?" ...|$|R
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE [catching her dress]. You shan't go. I couldn't be so mistaken: I {{know too}} well what liars are like. Somebody has really <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; although, as I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> house belongs {{only to the}} President of the United States and his family," [...] {{said the}} gentleman, smilingly, [...] "in that little {{conservatory}} I proposed to your mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Leonard, [...] "but {{considering}} the risks the price {{does not seem}} quite good enough. As I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> stone may be worth nothing: you must make a better bid, mother." ...|$|E
60|$|I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> my father, {{though it}} has not {{to do with my}} story, because then, and then only, did I ever see Chaka show mercy to one whom he had doomed to die.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> but <b>this</b> morning, Master de Luynes, that a St. Auban {{does not}} fight men of your stamp. You forced a {{rendezvous}} upon me; you shall reap the consequences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] cried Mother Anastasia, [...] "you {{have seen}} her! A few days ago! She <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this!</b> Why did <b>you</b> not say so? Why {{did you come}} to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I suppose," [...] said Mrs. Cristie, [...] "that Mr. Beam <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this</b> {{in order}} {{that you might be}} induced to help on the match between Mr. Tippengray and Miss Rose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who has <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Captain Marrable?" [...] She had not {{intended}} to alter her form of speech, and when she had done so would have given anything to have called him then by his Christian name.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} to have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> We ask the Great Spirit to bless our marriages, and the ceremony is commonly {{performed by a}} priest. This is our practice, Peter; though not necessary, I think it good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is strange!" [...] exclaimed Willoughby, {{after a short}} pause. [...] "And my mother--our {{mother has}} given you the original, and <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this?</b> I did not believe she could muster the {{resolution}} necessary to such an act." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have already}} <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> reader, that <b>this</b> {{conversation}} took place no longer ago than yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this,</b> Miss Greendale, because I {{have heard}} that you know the man, and I thought {{you ought to know}} what sort of a man he is. His name is Carthew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 208. Now I {{will read}} you fifty-two {{lines of a}} {{classical}} author, which, once well read and understood, contain more truth than has been <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this</b> year by this whole globe's compass of print.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, young feller, {{you can hit}} the trail," [...] put in Buell, {{with his}} big voice. [...] "An' {{remember}} what I <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> country ain't got much use for a feller as can't look out for himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{believed}} me guilty?" [...] he said sadly. [...] "They <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> hideous tale of me, and {{you believed}} them, without giving the absent one, who alas! {{could not speak}} in his own defense, {{the benefit of the}} doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{why should}} my father have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> Pathfinder?" [...] the girl demanded a little earnestly. [...] "Perhaps he fancied {{you would think}} the better of me {{if you did not}} believe me a silly coward, as so many of my sex love to make {{themselves}} appear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are the signal. I {{should have}} <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>this</b> in the village, but I dared {{not be seen}} {{speaking}} with you. I galloped through the woods to cut you off, and concealed both my horse and myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{is changed}} since the news I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of <b>this</b> evening. We must {{separate}} at once, and keep apart. Remember you have only five days. If you remain in America longer than that, your life is not safe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could have}} <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> morning," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Flint. [...] "Wheeler, who runs errands {{for him in}} Coniston, drove him in this morning, and he's been with Peleg Hartington for two hours over Sherman's livery stable." ...|$|R
