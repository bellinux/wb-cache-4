5000|$|There may be plastic Esperanto coins {{used that}} have owls {{on them in}} order to [...] "pay" [...] for the food and drink, or the {{purchaser}} may have bought a [...] "tasopaso" [...] (tas: cup, paso: pass) which is a piece of paper showing that they've paid for a certain amount of tea beforehand. People who often frequent gufujoj like to use these, and it makes the <b>cashier's</b> <b>job</b> easier if they're used because instead of counting coins in the dim lighting they can simply mark the piece of paper to show how many cups of tea have been used.|$|R

60|$|Katie {{was sixteen}} then, {{and she had}} just been given the <b>cashier</b> <b>job,</b> as a treat. She wanted to do {{something}} to help the old man, so he put her on a high chair behind a wire cage with a hole in it, and she gave the customers their change. And let me tell you, mister, that a man that wasn't satisfied after he'd had me serve him a dinner cooked by Jules and then had a chat with Katie through the wire cage would have groused at Paradise. For she was pretty, was Katie, and getting prettier every day. I spoke to the boss about it. I said it was putting temptation in the girl's way to set her up there right in the public eye, as it were. And he told me to hop it. So I hopped it.|$|R
