5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. <b>The</b> <b>Narrator</b> moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} <b>the</b> {{construction of}} <b>narrator</b> identity in Douglas Coupland's short story composite Life After God. It suggests {{a reading of}} blurred narrators, a narrator identity positioned in between one and several. This is created through the omission of distinguishing qualities in <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> of <b>the</b> different chapters. <b>The</b> <b>narrators</b> are blurred further by there being no causal links between <b>the</b> chapters. <b>The</b> <b>narrators</b> of <b>the</b> text have experienced an ideologically homogeneous environment while growing up and are poorly equipped to tackle free choice as it looks in their adult lives. The loss of stability renders crises and confusion in <b>the</b> <b>narrators.</b> <b>The</b> blurred <b>narrators</b> allow <b>the</b> implied reader to experience a similar confusion in the reading experience. The confusion relies on reader-expectation of a traditional discourse where a distinct narrator is conventional in a first-person narrative. <b>The</b> blurred <b>narrators</b> are a metafictional construction, imperceptible by {{the characters in the}} text. This shows the reality presented in the fiction to be structured by an outside force, the author. To readers, this deconstructs the possibility or perceiving realism in the text. <b>The</b> blurred <b>narrators</b> are also discussed in relation to the recurring Christian imagery and the theme of "self" and "self-perception". <b>The</b> fluid <b>narrator</b> identity presents <b>the</b> image of narrated thoughts, emotions and events as equally shared between <b>the</b> <b>narrators.</b> This is interpreted in relation to the implied reader of the text...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>narrator's</b> full name, John Winterstraw, appears {{only in the}} book's subtitle. Only {{one other}} character's full name is given: Mistress Mary Madison is the 19-year-old {{survivor}} aboard the [...] "Seabird" [...] who eventually becomes <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> wife.|$|R
5|$|Marla overdoses on {{pills and}} {{telephones}} <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> for help; he eventually ignores her, leaving his phone receiver without disconnecting. Tyler notices the phone soon after, talks {{to her and}} goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla become sexually involved. He warns <b>the</b> <b>Narrator</b> never to talk to Marla about him. More fight clubs form across the country and, under Tyler's leadership (and without the Narrator's knowledge), they become an anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization, Project Mayhem, {{with many of the}} former local Fight Club members moving into the dilapidated house and improving it.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E

5000|$|The song is a ballad about treasuring {{moments in}} <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> life, using three examples: an {{expression}} of pride from a grandfather who fought in World War II, of love from <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> wife, and of comfort from <b>the</b> <b>narrator's</b> newborn daughter. All three examples are connected by a chorus stating [...] "I'll take this one day {{and figure out what}} I did right / And I'll do it the same way {{for the rest of my}} life." ...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Narrator</b> – as {{in other}} works of metafiction, the narrator's voice {{frequently}} intervenes in the story with a personality of its own. Though the voice appears {{to be that of}} Fowles, Magali Cornier Michael notes that chapter 13, which discusses the role of author and narrator within fiction, distinguishes between the author's role in the text and the narrator's. Alice Ferrebe describes <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a perpetuation of the perspectives on gendered identity perpetuated by the male gaze.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Beckett's trilogy {{as a work}} of metafiction, approaching each novel {{through its}} primary metafictional device, <b>the</b> self-conscious <b>narrator.</b> Since <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> are aware of their roles as story-tellers, the examination is carried out in light of Beckett's pronouncements on the nature of art and the artist. Not only are <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> found to meet Beckett's criteria for artists and artistic development, but Beckett's aesthetic is seen virtually to require self-consciousness. In their situations, their relationship to the audience (both reader and narratee) and the nature of their tales, <b>the</b> self-conscious <b>narrators</b> follow <b>the</b> artistic trajectory Beckett maps out in his critical writings. As Beckett's aesthetic is fulfilled, the narrators' increasing self-consciousness intensifies the metafictional aspects of the trilogy. The trilogy is thus a demonstration of Beckett's self-conscious aesthetic [...] a descent into reflexivity on the part of <b>the</b> <b>narrators,</b> and through <b>the</b> <b>narrators,</b> on <b>the</b> part of trilogy as a whole...|$|R

5|$|The poem is {{critical}} of the corruption Coleridge sees within his own government, but it still displays his loyalty and devotion to England. The poem operates in a circular pattern with its beginning and ending at the Stowey dell. By introducing the historically real possibility of an invasion of England, <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> announces his determination to protect his family and the dell, along with his fellow Britons. Throughout the poem, {{there is also an}} emphasis on the simple life and <b>the</b> <b>narrator</b> desires to return to his previous idyllic lifestyle.|$|E

Although he eventually sends her home, she does not remain there. After finding letters addressed to her that reveal he has left on a quest to find her mother (previously believed to be dead), she sets out to find him. As is slowly made clear in the novel, Helen is the narrator's mother. The letters continue the story her father has been telling her. <b>The</b> <b>narrator</b> decides to travel to a monastery where she believes her father might be.|$|E

5000|$|Defense of a thesis: <b>the</b> <b>narrators</b> {{write their}} works {{approaching}} reality from their moral conception. They are <b>the</b> so-called omniscient <b>narrators.</b> <b>The</b> defense of a thesis usually compromises the objectivity of the novel.|$|R
