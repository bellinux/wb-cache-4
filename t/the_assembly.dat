Andrew then held a general assembly for the barons and the noblemen of five counties to the east of the river Tisza—Bihar, Kraszna, Szabolcs, Szatmár, and Szolnok—at Nagyvárad (now Oradea in Romania) in early 1291. <b>The</b> <b>assembly</b> outlawed Stephen Balogsemjén, a staunch supporter of the late LadislausIV, for major trespass. From <b>the</b> <b>assembly,</b> Andrew went to Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia in Romania). Here he issued the decrees of his 1290 diet at <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> of the local noblemen, Saxons, Székelys and Romanians, in February or March. Around the same time, Andrew dismissed Amadeus Aba and made Ivan Kőszegi palatine.|$|E
5|$|As Morgan and {{his allies}} on <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> of Jamaica {{continued}} to deal with privateers and pirates, criticism of their action in London was fomented by two former governors of Jamaica, Carbery and Lynch. After Lynch paid £50,000 to Charles II, Morgan's commissions as lieutenant-governor and lieutenant-general were revoked and Lynch was appointed as the island's governor; Morgan still retained his position on <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> of Jamaica. Morgan had been a heavy drinker for several years; he received {{the news of the}} revocation of his positions badly and increased his intake of alcohol to the point where his health began to suffer. Lynch removed Morgan's supporters from <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> of Jamaica by 1683, and in October that year he removed Morgan and his brother-in-law, leaving <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> packed with men loyal to him. In 1684 Lynch died, and was temporarily replaced as governor by his friend, the lieutenant-general, Hender Molesworth.|$|E

The majority of <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> was Whig, and Clay {{knew that if he}} resigned while <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{consisted}} of representatives of {{all members of}} the League, with each state allowed up to three representatives and one vote. It met in Geneva and, after its initial sessions in 1920, it convened once a year in September. The special functions of <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> included the admission of new members, the periodical election of non-permanent members to the Council, the election with the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court, and control of the budget. In practice, <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> was the general directing force of League activities.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{understood}} {{its mandate}} under the Solemn League and Covenant {{to have been}} fulfilled on 14April 1648 when it delivered the scripture citations to Parliament, and the Scottish Commissioners had already left {{by the end of}} 1647. <b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> continued to meet primarily for the purpose of examination of ministers for ordination. Most of the divines were unhappy with the republican Commonwealth that emerged after Colonel Pride's Purge of the Long Parliament in 1648. As a result, a majority stopped attending rather than agree to the oath of Engagement to the Commonwealth that was imposed in 1649. Newspapers continued to report on the meetings of <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> as late as March 1653. <b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> must have stopped meeting sometime between then and Cromwell's dissolution of the Rump Parliament on 20April 1653.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{was called}} by the Long Parliament {{before and during the}} {{beginning}} of the First English Civil War. The Long Parliament was influenced by Puritanism, a religious movement which sought to further reform the church. They were opposed to the religious policies of King Charles I and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. As part of a military alliance with Scotland, Parliament agreed that the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called presbyterianism, rather than rule by bishops, called episcopalianism, which was used in the English church. Scottish commissioners attended and advised <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> as part of the agreement. Disagreements over church government caused open division in <b>the</b> <b>Assembly,</b> despite attempts to maintain unity. The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority, but political and military realities led to greater influence for the congregationalist party. Congregationalists favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the subjection of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism. Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government, but it lacked the power the presbyterian divines desired. During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, all of the documents of <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in England.|$|E
50|$|The Louisiana presbytery of <b>the</b> <b>Assemblies</b> of God {{initially}} suspended Swaggart {{from the}} ministry for three months.

His {{return to the}} pulpit coincided {{with the end of}} a three-month suspension originally ordered by <b>the</b> <b>Assemblies.</b> Believing that Swaggart was not genuinely repentant in submitting to their authority, the hierarchy of <b>the</b> <b>Assemblies</b> of God immediately defrocked him, removing his credentials and ministerial license.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> was {{strictly}} {{under the control}} of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of <b>the</b> <b>Assembly.</b> Twenty-two appointed members of <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at <b>the</b> <b>Assembly</b> over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. <b>The</b> <b>Assembly</b> also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
