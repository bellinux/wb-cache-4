5|$|After their Hampstead {{home was}} hit by bomb {{shrapnel}} in September 1940, Moore and Irina moved out of London <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> farmhouse called Hoglands in the hamlet of Perry Green near Much Hadham, Hertfordshire. This was to become Moore's home and workshop {{for the rest of}} his life. Despite acquiring significant wealth later in life, Moore never felt the need to move to larger premises and, apart from the addition of a number of outbuildings and studios, the house changed little over the years. In 1943 he received a commission from the Church of St. Matthew, Northampton, to carve a Madonna and Child; this sculpture was the first in an important series of family-group sculptures.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains as a historical site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E

5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{was created}} by Thomas Haining Gillespie, a {{solicitor}} from Dumfries who dreamed of establishing a zoological park in Scotland. At first {{he was told that}} tropical animals would never be able <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold climate like Edinburgh's—a view that had to some extent been borne out by the failure of the Royal Zoological Gardens. In 1908, though, he was encouraged to read of the pioneering methods employed by Carl Hagenbeck, which were allowing tropical animals to thrive in the recently opened Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, Germany.|$|E
5|$|For ten years, {{living at}} number four, Privet Drive, Harry is {{treated by the}} Dursleys more like a servant than {{a member of the}} family and is forced <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{cupboard}} under the stairs. Shortly before his eleventh birthday, a series of letters addressed to Harry arrive, but Uncle Vernon destroys them before Harry can read them, leading to an influx of more and more letters. To evade the pursuit of these letters, Vernon first takes the family to a hotel, but when the letters arrive there too, he hires a boat out to a hut on a small island.|$|E

5|$|Irma Johnson is {{the sister}} of the late Warren Johnson and Eve Russell's aunt. When she was young, Eve had a close {{relationship}} with her aunt because of their love of gospel music. Irma is proud of Eve's singing in the church's choir; she discouraged Eve from singing jazz and blues music, calling them sinful. Their relationship became strained when Irma saw a drugged and intoxicated Eve singing in a seedy Boston jazz club and cavorting with several men. Irma disowns Eve when she discovers her relationship with Julian, who is white, and her pregnancy with his child. Eve and Irma did not speak for nearly 20 years. Eve paid for Irma <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> retirement home, but told everyone she had no living relatives in an attempt to keep her past secret.|$|E

They moved shortly after, in February 1946, to 72 Western Avenue in Speke. In 1948, the family moved again to 12 Ardwick Road (also in Speke) which was part of a new estate in the suburbs of Liverpool. The frequent moves to better areas were Mary's idea, as she wanted to raise her children in the best neighbourhood possible.|$|E

The Columbia University School of General Studies and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the local}} beliefs were perhaps less welcome to the {{practitioners}} of organised religion. An each-uisge was thought <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bottomless well near the summit of Macphee’s Hill, and faery sidhes and their associated music were taken for granted, if generally avoided. The curative powers of the seventh son of a seventh son were assumed to be sufficient {{for the treatment of}} diseases as serious as tuberculosis. Yet the old ways themselves were dying.|$|E
5|$|The Daily Mail took on Beach Thomas as {{a writer}} of {{material}} relating to the countryside. Lord Northcliffe, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Beach Thomas would need <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Beach Thomas because it meant he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.|$|E

5|$|The castle was not {{demolished}} {{as planned}} and instead {{was purchased by}} Mary Bonham-Christie for £125,000 later that year. She decided <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearby house rather than the castle itself, allowing the island to return to nature and the castle to fall into disrepair. By the time of Bonham-Christie's death in 1961 the roof had partially collapsed and a tree was growing up through {{the centre of the}} building. Facing large death duties, Bonham-Christie's grandson put the island up for sale, before agreeing to donate it to the state in lieu of taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} in Korkoro {{are drawn from}} Sigot's anecdote. The film traces the Romani familias life during the war, from their disbelief at being forbidden to travel but also being rejected by others when they stay in one place, to their arrest, incarceration, liberation {{with the help of}} a local French mayor and a notary, their struggle <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-nomadic way, and then final arrest before being sent to the Death Camps. The character Théodore Rosier is based on the notary in the anecdote. The other Juste character, Lise Lundi, is based on Yvette Lundy and an old teacher of Gatlif's from Belcourt in Algeria who was a communist and an aide with the Front de Libération Nationale (National Liberation Front).|$|E
