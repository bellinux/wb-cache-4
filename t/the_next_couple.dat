5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni was a {{damaging}} {{tropical cyclone}} that impacted the island nations of Tuvalu and Fiji. It was first noted within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{at the start}} of December 1992, as a shallow tropical depression {{in the vicinity of the}} island nation Tuvalu. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further as it affected Tuvalu, before it was declared to be a tropical cyclone and named Joni by the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) during December 7. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of days the system intensified further as it was steered south-westwards and posed a threat towards the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The system subsequently peaked as a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale as it approached the Fijian Islands during December 10. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of days the system moved through the Fijian Islands, before it became an extratropical cyclone during December 13. The system was last noted during the next day as it was absorbed by a mid-latitude trough of low pressure to the east of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Keli {{was first}} noted as a depression, to the {{northeast}} of the New Zealand territory of Tokelau during June 7, 1997.

5|$|On March 19, the JTWC {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} disturbance that was located about 1145km (710mi) {{to the northwest}} of Suva, Fiji. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further {{in an area of}} low vertical windshear, before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couple</b> of days, 23P moved further towards the south, before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23. Later that day, RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti. During that day, Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24, after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and Malekula. As Beti moved into the Coral Sea, the system quickly intensified further, with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone, the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure. As a result, the system started to move towards the south-southeast.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{distributional}} and e ciency impacts of climate {{policy in the}} context of fiscal consolidation in a dynamic general-equilibrium overlapping generations model of the US economy. The model includes a disaggregated production structure, including energy sector detail and advanced low- or zero-carbon energy technologies, and detail on government taxes and spending. In contrast to revenue-neutral carbon tax swaps, using the carbon revenue for deficit reduction implies a relaxation of future public budgets as debt repayment results in lower interest obligations. While we show that the intergenerational welfare impacts depend importantly on what tax recycling instrument is used, we find that combining debt consolidation with a carbon policy entails the possibility of sustained welfare gains for future generations. We thus argue that combining fiscal and climate policy may o er the chance for positive societal gains (without considering potential benefits from averted climate change). Importantly, this may enhance the political support for revenue-raising climate policies that are framed over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>couples</b> of decades...|$|R

Meanwhile, the Japanese that had been around Finschhafen withdrew back into the mountains around Sattelberg. Allied air operations from the airfield at Finschhafen commenced on 4 October.

Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular television appearances on Raw, in which he scheduled matches, throwing around his authority, and sometimes even deciding the outcome of matches.
