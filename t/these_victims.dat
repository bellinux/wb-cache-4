Twenty-two Hungarians and 15 Croats were killed. The first killings occurred on 10 November 1991, when twelve civilians died. Eight more were killed over the following several days. Five more civilians were killed on 10 December, and another seven on 16 December. Four others were killed on 21 February 1992 and the final one was killed on 3 June. The bodies of <b>these</b> <b>victims</b> were either buried in mass graves or thrown into nearby wells.|$|E
5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners victimized by human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing <b>these</b> <b>victims</b> with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 {{the state}} {{passed a law}} authorizing the Illinois Torture Inquiry Relief Commission, to {{investigate}} cases related to convictions of people claiming to have been tortured by Burge and his officers and given coerced confessions, {{to see if there}} was evidence for judicial review and relief. It started to receive cases in 2011. Seventeen cases have been referred to the circuit court and three men freed by April 2016. Another 130 similar cases of torture by Chicago police have been claimed, beyond the scope of Burge and his cohort. The sponsors are trying to have the bill amended to accommodate <b>these</b> <b>victims.</b> In 2015 the City of Chicago announced that it has established a $5.5 million fund for reparations to victims of torture by Burge, and to aid their families. By that time, the city had paid more than $57 million to victims of Burge and his cohort, and another $50 million for defense of the officers.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of <b>these</b> <b>victims</b> were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E

This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of <b>these</b> <b>victims</b> nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E

25|$|Many of the victims' bodies bore {{evidence}} of mutilation {{to the eye}} sockets. Pathologists concluded the injuries were caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out {{the eyes of his}} victims. Chikatilo's adult female victims were often prostitutes or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. Chikatilo would typically attempt intercourse with <b>these</b> <b>victims,</b> but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. His child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; Chikatilo would lure <b>these</b> <b>victims</b> to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation with the victim, such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut, a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower <b>these</b> <b>victims</b> once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or loam into the victims' mouth to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them. After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary—though seldom serious—efforts to conceal the body before leaving the crime scene.|$|E
