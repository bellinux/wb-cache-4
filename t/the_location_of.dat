5|$|After {{wintering}} in Weymouth, Gorges {{abandoned his}} new colony {{in the spring}} of 1624 due to financial difficulties.

The remaining Weymouth settlers were supported by Plymouth until they were made part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop visited the settlement in 1632. In time, <b>the</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the original settlement was lost to history and development. <b>The</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the original fort was not rediscovered until 1891.|$|E

40|$|We compute <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> {{satellite}} {{galaxies in}} the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey using two sets of selection criteria and three sources of photometric data. Using the SuperCOSMOS r_F photometry, {{we find that the}} satellites are located preferentially near the major axes of their hosts, and the anisotropy is detected at a highly-significant level (confidence levels of 99. 6 % to 99. 9 %). <b>The</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> satellites that have high velocities relative to their hosts are statistically indistinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> satellites that have low velocities relative to their hosts. Additionally, satellites with passive star formation are distributed anisotropically about their hosts (99 % confidence level), while <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> star-forming satellites are consistent with an isotropic distribution. These two distributions are, however, statistically indistinguishable. Therefore it is not correct to interpret this as evidence that <b>the</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star-forming satellites are intrinsically {{different from those of the}} passive satellites.
