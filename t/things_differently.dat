25|$|Lt. Gene Hunt (Harvey Keitel) — Commander of the 125th Detective Squad, Hunt is a {{hardened}} older cop who's largely set in his ways. He accepts {{and even}} encourages the casual corruption and physical abuse rampant {{in the police}} force, although he lives by a very strict code of loyalty toward fellow officers and honor toward law-abiding citizens even if he personally dislikes them. He is often exasperated by Sam's outspoken insistence on doing <b>things</b> <b>differently,</b> but {{seems to have a}} grudging respect for Sam's crime-solving ability nonetheless. He has a long-standing rivalry with a fellow police officer, Lt. Anthony Nunzio of the 144th Precinct. His BBC counterpart is DCI Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister).|$|E

500|$|Fox {{expressed}} a robust attitude to his situation: {{he refused to}} regard himself as disabled, and would not allow anyone to pity him, telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more [...] "rewarding and challenging" [...] since {{he had lost his}} leg. His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the inclusion of the disabled in society. Fox's actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities, and in addition influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities, by showing them disability portrayed in a positive light. Rick Hansen commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability. [...] "What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity. People with disabilities started looking at <b>things</b> <b>differently.</b> They came away with huge pride", he wrote.|$|E

Frye did not express regret over {{his part in}} Pac-Mans port and felt he made the best decisions he could at the time. However, Frye stated {{that he would have}} done <b>things</b> <b>differently</b> with a larger capacity ROM. Video game industry researchers Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost attribute the poor reception to the technical differences between the 1977 Atari 2600 console and the 1980 arcade hardware used in Pac-Man cabinets. They further stated that the conversion is a lesson in maintaining the social and cultural context of the original source. Montfort and Bogost commented that players were disappointed with the flickering visual effect, which made the ghosts difficult to track and tired the players' eyes. The two further said that the effect diminishes the ghosts' personalities present in the arcade version. Chris Kohler of Wired commented that the game was poorly received upon its release and in contemporary times because of the poor quality. However, he further described the game as an impressive technical achievement given its console's limitations.|$|E

500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing <b>things</b> <b>differently,</b> and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as hard as they can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so we knew the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting."

There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E
500|$|As the German Army {{advanced}} through southern Belgium on 12 May, General Ewald von Kleist and Guderian clashed {{over where}} {{the main point}} of effort should fall. Kleist was Guderian's immediate superior, commanding Panzergruppe von Kleist, consisting of XLI Panzer Corps and XIX Panzer Corps (under Guderian). Kleist pressed for the main point to come at Flize, further west than Sedan. Kleist argued that the blow would avoid a double river crossing at the Meuse (at Sedan) and Ardennes canal (to the west of Sedan). Moreover, the blow would strike at the dividing line between the French Ninth Army and the French Second Army. Guderian saw <b>things</b> <b>differently,</b> and pointed out that a thrust {{along the lines of}} Kleist's plan would put the flank of the advance within range of the fortress artillery at Charleville-Mézières, some [...] north west of Sedan. The shift of operations further north would also disperse concentration (or Schwerpunkt) and disrupt the intense planning of the German tactical units, who had been in training for the Sedan attack and an advance north-west, for months. He also felt that a regrouping period in front of Sedan would delay the assault for 24 hours and allow the French to bring up reinforcements. Kleist agreed that such a delay was unacceptable, so he agreed to Guderian's plan.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, Usher {{revealed}} that {{for his next}} album {{he was working on}} a new type of music which he has depicted as [...] "revolutionary pop", which combines different genres to form a new sound. His seventh studio album Looking 4 Myself was released on June 8, 2012, worldwide and received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. American singer-songwriter and record producer Rico Love was interviewed by Billboard magazine, where he spoke about his relationships with artists and experiences. He commented on how Usher wanted to do <b>things</b> <b>differently</b> on the album compared to his previous efforts, saying: [...] "What he wanted to do [...] was explore himself musically. He stepped outside of what was safe and normal. He wanted to make an album that expressed where he was going sonically and not just where he's been for the past 12 to 15 years. He's growing, developing, moving, shaking, and being something that's new, cultural, and that's affecting people sonically. That's kind of forcing the people to grow and elevate". In an interview for MTV News, Usher stated that Looking 4 Myself is [...] "the most artistic of an album" [...] he has ever had in history. When questioned by Reuters during an interview regarding the latter quote, and how this project was different, Usher explained that he felt he was near a 'rebirth' and that prior to Looking 4 Myself, he felt restricted and conformed to a specific standard. He said to himself [...] "I gotta go with what I feel and hopefully people will follow me".|$|E

500|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Cardigan had reached and overrun the enemy battery: he was {{recognised}} beyond the guns by Prince Radziwill, an enemy officer with whom he was acquainted before the war. Considering his duty then done and disdaining, as he later explained, to [...] "fight the enemy among private soldiers" [...] Cardigan turned about and made his way steadily—he himself said that his return was at the walk to avoid any unseemly appearance of haste—for his own lines. Lucan recalled <b>things</b> <b>differently,</b> later giving evidence that Cardigan had been galloping back, only slowing to walk when he realised he was being watched. This hurried retreat was also noticed by General Liprandi, Russian commander, who made enquiries to identify the English officer whom he saw galloping away after the attack. Officers and men of the second and third lines—men for whom as brigade commander Cardigan remained responsible—were still advancing at the charge when they saw their commander riding in retreat. Other officers too had noticed his absence and when Lord George Paget of the 4th Hussars, one of the last to return after some intense, hand-to-hand fighting, encountered a [...] "composed" [...] Cardigan, he challenged him to account for himself. Unsatisfied with the response, Paget wrote an official complaint to the new Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge. Cambridge forwarded the letter to Cardigan for comment and Cardigan's reply in turn complained that Paget had not in fact taken his regiments into the attack that day. Inconclusive claim and counter-claim followed, until Cardigan's attentions were diverted to the allegations made public when Calthorpe's book Letters went on sale.|$|E

40|$|Manipulation of {{multimedia}} data in multimedia databases is not straightforward as in conventional databases {{because of the}} complex structure of the multimedia data such as image, or sound. The issue in the retrieval {{of multimedia}} data from the database is the matching {{of the contents of}} multimedia data to a user query. The common solution is to use either keywords or natural language descriptions to describe both the contents of multimedia data and user queries. The major problem is that different users, or the same user at different times, describe the same <b>thing</b> <b>differently</b> which results in the descriptions of the contents of multimedia data to rarely exactly match the descriptions of the user queries. Hence, partial or approximate match between descriptions of multimedia data and user queries is often required during multimedia data retrieval. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to approximate match by integrating both object-oriented and natural language understanding techniquesNaval Ocean Systems Center, San Diego, CA[URL] Direct FundingN...|$|R
