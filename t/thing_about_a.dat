In contrast, Andrew Unterberger of the same publication enjoyed the track, claiming that [...] "it might not be your favorite Madonna, but it's unquestionably her, and it's far more compelling than the anonymous EDM enthusiast she played on MDNA (2012)". Unterberger also praised the addition of PC Music [...] "ping-ponging oddball freneticism" [...] and [...] "Diplo's block-dropping beats". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone was also positive, calling it [...] "frenetic", and praised Minaj's verse for being [...] "pure fire", while Anna Zelaski of The A.V. Club appreciated the song for being [...] "the right kind of ... that's mindless fun and impossible to take seriously". In the same vein, Andy Gill of The Independent called it [...] "amusingly abrasive" [...] and praised Minaj for [...] "repris her role as Madge's rapping henchgirl".|$|E

2500|$|Paisley {{was born}} on October 28, 1972, in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He is {{the only child of}} Douglas Edward [...] "Doug" [...] Paisley, who worked for the West Virginia Department of Transportation, and Sandra Jean [...] "Sandy" [...] (née Jarvis) Paisley, a teacher. He was raised in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He has stated that his love of country music stems from his {{maternal}} grandfather, Warren Jarvis, who gave him his first guitar, a Sears Danelectro Silvertone, and taught him how to play at eight years old. At ten, he performed {{for the first time in}} public by singing in his church. He later recalled that, [...] "Pretty soon, I was performing at every Christmas party and Mother's Day event. The neat <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> small town is that when you want to be an artist, by golly, they'll make you one." [...] At age 13, he wrote his first song, [...] "Born on Christmas Day", which later appeared on his album Brad Paisley Christmas. He had been taking lessons with local guitarist Clarence [...] "Hank" [...] Goddard. By 13, Goddard and Paisley formed a band called [...] "Brad Paisley and the C-Notes", with the addition of two of Paisley's adult friends.|$|E

60|$|My {{mother was}} all American--no alkali-spider about HER, I can tell you; she {{was of the}} best blood of Kentucky, the bluest Blue-grass aristocracy, very proud and acrimonious--or maybe it is ceremonious. I don't know which it is. But it is no matter; size is the main <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> word, and that one's up to standard. She spent her {{military}} life as colonel of the Tenth Dragoons, and saw a deal of rough service--distinguished service it was, too. I mean, she CARRIED the Colonel; but it's all the same. Where would he be without his horse? He wouldn't arrive. It takes two to make a colonel of dragoons. She was a fine dragoon horse, but never got above that.

60|$|The devil can quote Scripture for his purpose; and {{the text}} of Scripture which he now most {{commonly}} quotes is, 'The kingdom of heaven is within you.' That text has been the stay and support of more Pharisees and prigs and self-righteous spiritual bullies than all the dogmas in creation; it has served to identify self-satisfaction with the peace that passes all understanding. And the text to be quoted in answer to it is that which declares that no man can receive the kingdom except as a little child. What we are to have inside is the childlike spirit; but the childlike spirit is not entirely concerned about what is inside. It is the first mark of possessing it that one is interested in what is outside. The most childlike <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> child is his curiosity and his appetite and his power of wonder at the world. We might almost say that the whole advantage of having the kingdom within is that we look for it somewhere else.|$|E

Look, again, at the two beasts. You see the false griffin is quite sleepy and dead in the eye, thus contradicting his eagle's nature, but is putting himself to a great deal of unnecessary trouble with his paws, holding one in a most painful position merely to touch a flower, and bearing the whole weight of his body on the other, thus contradicting his lion's nature.|$|R

60|$|My {{apparatus}} was simple: {{a little}} red paint {{and a bit of}} white paper. I painted the ball of the client's thumb, took a print of it on the paper, studied it that night, and revealed his fortune to him next day. What was my idea in this nonsense? It was this: When I was a youth, I knew an old Frenchman who had been a prison-keeper for thirty years, {{and he told me that}} there was one <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> person which never changed, from the cradle to the grave--the lines in the ball of the thumb; and he said that these lines were never exactly alike in the thumbs of any two human beings. In these days, we photograph the new criminal, and hang his picture in the Rogues' Gallery for future reference; but that Frenchman, in his day, used to take a print of the ball of a new prisoner's thumb and put that away for future reference. He always said that pictures were no good--future disguises could make them useless; 'The thumb's the only sure thing,' said he; 'you can't disguise that.' And he used to prove his theory, too, on my friends and acquaintances; it always succeeded.|$|E
60|$|Now, as to {{the light}} of the candle. We will light one or two, and set them at work in the {{performance}} of their proper functions. You observe a candle is a very different thing from a lamp. With a lamp you take a little oil, fill your vessel, put in a little moss or some cotton prepared by artificial means, and then light the top of the wick. When the flame runs down the cotton to the oil, it gets extinguished, but it goes on burning in the part above. Now, I have no doubt you will ask, how is it that the oil, which will not burn of itself, gets {{up to the top of}} the cotton, where it will burn? We shall presently examine that; but there is a much more wonderful thing about the burning of a candle than this. You have here a solid substance with no vessel to contain it; and how is it that this solid substance can get up to the place where the flame is? How is it that this solid gets there, it not being a fluid? or, when it is made a fluid, then how is it that it keeps together? This is a wonderful <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> candle.|$|E
60|$|But {{there are}} some people, nevertheless--and I am one of them--who think that the most {{practical}} and important <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> man is still {{his view of the}} universe. We think that for a landlady considering a lodger, {{it is important to know}} his income, but still more important to know his philosophy. We think that for a general about to fight an enemy, it is important to know the enemy's numbers, but still more important to know the enemy's philosophy. We think the question is not whether the theory of the cosmos affects matters, but whether in the long run, anything else affects them. In the fifteenth century men cross-examined and tormented a man because he preached some immoral attitude; in the nineteenth century we feted and flattered Oscar Wilde because he preached such an attitude, and then broke his heart in penal servitude because he carried it out. It may be a question which of the two methods was the more cruel; there can be no kind of question which was the more ludicrous. The age of the Inquisition has not at least the disgrace of having produced a society which made an idol of the very same man for preaching the very same things which it made him a convict for practising.|$|E

Anyway, here's the story: Parlay's a full-blooded Frenchman. He told me once that he came from Paris. His accent is the true Parisian. He arrived down here in the old days. Went to trading and all the rest. That's how he got in on Hikihoho. Came in trading when trading was the real <b>thing.</b> <b>About</b> <b>a</b> hundred miserable Paumotans lived on the island. He married the queen--native fashion. When she died, {{everything}} was his. Measles came through, and there weren't more than a dozen survivors. He fed them, and worked them, and was king. Now before the queen died she gave birth to a girl. That's Armande. When she was three he sent her to the convent at Papeete. When she was seven or eight he sent her to France. You begin to glimpse the situation. The best and most aristocratic convent in France was none too good for the only daughter of a Paumotan island king and capitalist, and you know the old country French draw no colour line. She was educated like a princess, and she accepted herself in much the same way. Also, she thought she was all-white, and never dreamed of a bar sinister.|$|E

The first night after he got it to his own house, the dog whined so with homesickness that it kept everybody awake till Pony went to the woodshed, where it was in the clothes-basket, and took it into his own bed; then it went to sleep, and did not whine a bit. His father let him keep it there that one night, but the next he made him put it out again, because he said it would get the house full of fleas; and he said if it made much more trouble he would make Pony take it back.|$|E

You can always win a woman's heart by taking notice of her child. Then she got to letting me carry it about on my shoulder while she took her husband's dinner in to him, if he did not happen to be in the yard. And when the little thing was able to totter it would hold on to my finger, and was always content to stay with me while she was away. So it went on till the child was four years old.|$|E

40|$|Voters {{feel about}} {{political}} candidates {{at least as}} much as they think about them. And yet we know relatively little yet <b>about</b> how <b>an</b> affective sense <b>about</b> <b>a</b> candidate – global evaluation – interacts with information voters learn about candidates. Motivated reasoning suggests that when an initial evaluation of a candidate is established, that evaluation acts as an anchor against which any new information has to struggle to be accounted for properly. Thus instead of operating as efficient Bayesian updaters, calculating correctly how new information should balance against existing feelings, studies show voters stick to their existing affect, at least for a while. The problem is we do not really know how this process works. In particular at some point a voter who encounters enough negative information <b>about</b> <b>a</b> previously liked candidate – or good stuff <b>about</b> <b>a</b> disliked one – may finally adjust global evaluations to be more in line with “reality”. But at what point? This paper reports the results of a study using dynamic process tracing designed to put subjects into the position of learning bad <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> good candidate and good <b>things</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> bad one. The results show evidence of motivated reasoning, but the process is eventually attenuated as incongruent information finally breaks through pre-existing affect...|$|R
