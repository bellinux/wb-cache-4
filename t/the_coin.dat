5|$|A {{commemorative}} half {{dollar for}} {{the battle was}} produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, mintage for <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> was very low, just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, the America the Beautiful quarters released a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse side of <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} conducted unearthed square or circular Chera coins made {{of copper}} from near Cochin. This {{was for the}} first time, from a stratographic context, coins of Sangam Chera period {{have been found in}} Kerala. <b>The</b> <b>coin,</b> which is almost a square in shape, has an elephant facing to the right and some symbols towards the top of <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> The symbols could not be identified as the upper part of <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> was partially corroded. A drawn bow and arrow was visible on the other side. Below the arrow is an elephant goad (a prod used to control elephants). These coins bear a striking resemblance to the ones excavated from Karur in Tamil Nadu, said the archaeologists.|$|E
50|$|According to Helen Brown, a {{total of}} 64 coins were {{discovered}} in the years 1983, 1986, 1987, and 1988. Horton mentions that three of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were found by Dr. Richard Wilding in 1977. The bit of writing that is legible on most of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> displays Arabic script. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> highlight <b>the</b> strong ties Shanga held with the Islamic world {{despite the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> themselves were never used in any other known Islamic community outside of Shanga. Horton mentions that most of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> are made of silver rather than bronze. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> found in Shanga have different dates that can range anywhere from 800-1100. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> themselves support <b>the</b> idea of commerce in Shanga.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{earliest}} <b>coins</b> in <b>the</b> hoard were minted 63 AD, {{during the}} reign of Nero. 99% of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were minted before 167 AD. Only six coins were struck between 193 and 196 AD. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> weigh between 5.8 and 7.6 gram. 40 Roman emperors and their relatives are depicted on <b>the</b> <b>coins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kolt steals <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> {{and returns}} to the hotel but Nick catches him and gets back <b>the</b> <b>coins.</b> He hides <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> in his aunt's trailer and watches the reel from the hotel. The film is {{revealed}} to be a black-and-white footage of Hitler delivering a speech. During a close-up, he sees that he's wearing <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> in his coat and then Hitler woges into a Blutbad.|$|R
5|$|In Austria, Kepler {{left behind}} such a {{historical}} legacy {{that he was}} one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin, minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse side of <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of <b>the</b> <b>coin).</b> In front of him on <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to calls for}} action from the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing {{that they would not}} accept <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, Lord Shannon did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> from being distributed.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{few were}} sold to <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> {{collecting}} community, {{and the majority of}} surviving specimens display the effects of careless handling. The 2015 deluxe edition of Richard S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> at $140 to $685, depending on condition—an exceptional piece sold for $7,050 in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, {{a number of}} {{scholars}} have provided alternative attributions for <b>the</b> <b>coins.</b> Claude Reignier Conder, writing in 1909, suggested that <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were forgeries of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> of Simon Thassi. Wolf Wirgin, writing in 1959, suggested that <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were instead minted by King Herod Agrippa Alice Muehsam, writing in 1966, suggested that those coins with dates such as [...] "Year 1" [...] were actually First Jewish Revolt coinage.|$|R
50|$|He had a {{very quick}} wit which he used with his sleight of hand.

5|$|Ritchie Valens, {{who once}} had a fear of flying, asked Tommy Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to toss a coin to decide. Bob Hale, a DJ with KRIB-AM, was working the concert that night and flipped <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> in the ballroom's side-stage room shortly before the musicians {{departed}} for the airport. Valens won <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> toss for the seat on the flight.|$|E
5|$|The Liudhard medalet is a gold Anglo-Saxon coin {{or small}} medal found {{some time before}} 1844 near St Martin's Church in Canterbury, England. It {{was part of the}} Canterbury-St Martin's hoard of six items. <b>The</b> <b>coin,</b> along with other items found with it, now resides in the World Museum Liverpool. Although some {{scholarly}} debate exists on whether or not all the items in the hoard were from the same grave, most historians who have studied the object conclude that they were buried together as a necklace in a 6th-century woman's grave. <b>The</b> <b>coin</b> is set in a mount so that it could be worn as jewellery, and has an inscription on the obverse or front surrounding a robed figure. The inscription refers to Liudhard, a bishop who accompanied Bertha to England when she married Æthelberht the king of Kent. The reverse side of <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> has a double-barred cross, or patriarchal cross, with more lettering.|$|E
5|$|The Mint began {{preparation}} for the reduced-diameter dollar coin in 1976. Although no legislation had yet been introduced, Treasury officials anticipated a positive reception from Congress, and <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> had near unanimous support from the Mint and the vending machine industry, an influential lobby {{in the area of}} coin design and creation. In 1977, Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal publicly endorsed a smaller dollar coin and suggested that an allegorical representation of Liberty would be a suitable subject for <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The obverse {{designs of}} all <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> {{featured}} Arnold Machin's portrait of Elizabeth II, with the legend ELIZABETH II NEW ZEALAND [...] The initial {{designs for the}} reverse sides of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> introduced in 1967 were rejected by the Royal Mint. Several more designs were produced, followed by a vigorous public debate. James Berry's designs were eventually accepted for most of <b>the</b> <b>coins,</b> although {{he was asked to}} rework his design for <b>the</b> 5c <b>coin</b> and Francis Shurrock's design for <b>the</b> 10c <b>coin.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The present hoard from Akki Alur is {{of great}} importance, as the {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> belonging sic to the Byzantine rulers. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> have <b>the</b> bust of the king on the obverse, with his name, while the reverse has among other things, the name of <b>the</b> mint. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> have all been struck at Constantinople, the modern Istanbul.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coin</b> was {{endorsed}} by the Commission of Fine Arts; on May 9, O'Reilly wrote to Beach that the design had received Secretary Mellon's approval.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>coin</b> was {{probably}} struck at Canterbury {{in the late}} 6th century, most likely between 578 and 589. Although {{it could have been}} used as a coin, it was more likely made as a medallion to proclaim the wearer's conversion to Christianity. <b>The</b> <b>coin</b> is the oldest surviving example of Anglo-Saxon coinage. The design of the figured side has some affinities with Merovingian and Visigothic coins, but the side with the cross has few known predecessors in coinage, and is the first northern European depiction of a patriarchal cross in any medium.|$|E
5|$|The coins were minted in August 1918, {{and were}} sold {{to the public for}} $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial {{celebrations}} or to help those in need because of World War I. Later writers have generally admired <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. <b>The</b> <b>coin</b> is valued in the hundreds of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.|$|E
5000|$|The obverse {{featured}} {{a portrait of}} king William I of the Netherlands. On the reverse was a crowned Dutch coat of arms between <b>the</b> value. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> had a smooth edge with edge lettering ‘GOD ZY MET ONS’. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> were minted in Utrecht in the years 1817-1824 and 1830-1832. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> of 1923 were also minted in Brussels.|$|R
25|$|With a few early exceptions, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> were {{identical}} in size, shape, and composition. Although they had distinct designs, <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> circulated in both Luxembourg and Belgium.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>coins</b> {{are still}} {{separated}} in two sets: {{one side of}} <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> is identical from New Caledonia to French Polynesia, while {{the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> is inscribed with the name Nouvelle-Calédonie in New Caledonia and in Wallis and Futuna, and with the name Polynésie française in French Polynesia. Both sets of coins can be used in all three French territories. The situation of <b>the</b> CFP <b>coins</b> is thus quite similar to that of <b>the</b> euro <b>coins,</b> which have a national side but can be used in all countries of the eurozone.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} smaller dollar coin depicted an allegorical representation of Liberty on the obverse but organizations and individuals in Congress called for <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> to depict a real woman. Several proposals were submitted, and social reformer Susan B. Anthony {{was selected as the}} design subject. The reverse design of the Eisenhower dollar was retained. Both sides of <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> were designed by Frank Gasparro, the Chief Engraver of the United States Mint.|$|E
5|$|The patent issue {{soon became}} a {{struggle}} between Prime Minister Robert Walpole (with {{the authority of the}} British Parliament) and the leaders of Ireland. All attempts by the Irish Privy Council and the Church of Ireland to prevent the release of the coinage proved fruitless. It was soon thought by many that William Conolly’s Commissioners of the Revenue might pay the soldiers stationed in Ireland with the new coin; if the soldiers were paid with <b>the</b> <b>coin,</b> then the merchants of Ireland would be forced to accept <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> from the soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business. This worried the leadership of Ireland and they requested help in challenging Wood's patent and leading a boycott of <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> Swift was asked by Archbishop King and Lord Chancellor Midleton to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against Wood's coin.|$|E
5|$|Tunney {{announced}} that a coin toss {{would be used to}} decide who faced Yokozuna for the belt first. If Luger won, he would face Yokozuna first. Hart would then wrestle his brother Owen Hart before facing the winner of the Luger-Yokozuna match. If Hart won <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> toss, he would get the first title shot, and Luger would wrestle Crush earlier on the card. On the January 31, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw, Luger won <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> toss and the right to face Yokozuna first.|$|E
50|$|Over 3,000 Roman-era coins {{were found}} by workers in 1848. <b>The</b> <b>coins</b> were stored in three {{earthenware}} jars in a cavity {{in the rock}} formations. The origin of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> is unknown.|$|R

25|$|Buddhist {{symbolism}} {{is present}} throughout Indo-Scythian coinage. In particular, they adopted the Indo-Greek practice since Menander I of showing divinities forming the vitarka mudra with their right hand (as for the mudra-forming Zeus on <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> of Maues or Azes II), or {{the presence of}} the Buddhist lion on <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> of <b>the</b> same two kings, or the triratana symbol on <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> of Zeionises.|$|R
5|$|After the {{approval}} of the legislation, the Vermont Sesquicentennial Commission moved quickly to secure designs to be used for the half dollar. Members decided to have <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> show Ira Allen on the obverse, and the Battle of Bennington Monument on the reverse. They commissioned Sherry Fry, who had created a statue of Allen for the University of Vermont, to design <b>the</b> <b>coin.</b> On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts (charged by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins), informing him that the models would be ready in about a week.|$|E
5|$|After winning <b>the</b> <b>coin</b> toss and {{receiving}} the ball, the Giants offense stalled {{and was forced}} to punt. From their own 20, the Colts drove the ball to the New York 1-yard line, where Alan Ameche ran for a touchdown to give the Colts the championship, 23–17.|$|E

50|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> {{are easily}} {{identified}} as coinage of the French Moroccan period {{by the presence}} of either the legend “Empire Cherifien” or the legend “Maroc.” All of <b>the</b> <b>coins</b> will have one or the other legend, and often both.
