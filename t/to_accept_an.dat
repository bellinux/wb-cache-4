5|$|Bert T. Combs put Breathitt {{in charge}} of his {{campaign}} against Wilson Wyatt in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1958. When Combs was elected governor in 1959, he appointed Breathitt as State Personnel Commissioner, charging him with writing legislation to create a merit system for state employees. After successfully guiding the legislation through the General Assembly, Breathitt resigned as personnel commissioner <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. He was also served as chair of a failed state constitutional convention in 1960 {{and was a member}} of the Governor's Commission on Mental Health.|$|E

5|$|Catalysis is {{performed}} in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> electron, {{leading to a}} tetrahedral intermediate. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an oxanion hole within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting {{the first half of}} the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The ejection of this first leaving group is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was elected}} to two {{consecutive}} terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1807 and 1808. On March 29, 1810, he {{was appointed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, and served in this capacity until his resignation in 1812. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1812. He took a leave of absence on April 18, 1816, and by August 1816, had resigned his seat <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment as a circuit court judge.|$|E

In August 1946, Johnson took {{a leave of absence}} from Reynolds and accepted the appointment. He frequently attended President Truman's cabinet meetings due to the illness of Secretary Lewis B.

5|$|Libyan {{activism}} began generating {{concerns in}} the strongest faction into which the FROLINAT had split, the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN). The insurgents split {{on the issue of}} Libyan support in October 1976, with a minority leaving the militia and forming the Armed Forces of the North (FAN), led by the anti-Libyan Hissène Habré. The majority, willing <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> alliance with Gaddafi, was commanded by Goukouni Oueddei. The latter group soon renamed itself People's Armed Forces (FAP).|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Tillman {{was born}} in Bedford County, Tennessee, near modern Shelbyville on October 3, 1847, one of several sons of Lewis Tillman and his wife Mary C. Davidson Tillman. The younger Tillman and his {{brothers}} were raised on the family plantation in wartime Tennessee {{during much of the}} American Civil War. Tillman left the farm in 1864 to attend Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, but left after a year <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> at-large appointment to the United States Military Academy in July, 1865, months {{after the end of the}} rebellion.|$|E

Dunn, {{who died in}} 1870, was honored by the town of Newton with the naming of two streets, Clarkson Street and Dunn Place, which frame {{the property of the}} parish's old parsonage. After a ten-year tenure, Dunn's son-in-law, Nathaniel Pettit, resigned in 1867 to become Sussex County's first Superintendent of Schools. Moffett, who served as rector for fifteen years, resigned from the pulpit <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment from President Grover Cleveland to become the American minister (essentially ambassador) to Greece in 1885.|$|E

5|$|After Roosevelt's {{death and}} Truman's {{succession}} to the Presidency, Minton continued offering {{advice to the}} new administration {{on a range of}} topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he would be interested in a seat on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Beshear was {{the first}} {{candidate}} to announce his bid for the post of Attorney General of Kentucky in the 1979 election. Shortly after declaring his candidacy, he was endorsed by outgoing Attorney General Robert F. Stephens. The central issue of Beshear's campaign was his pledge to be an advocate of the consumer in cases of proposed utility rate hikes. After winning the Democratic primary, he defeated Republican nominee Ron Snyder {{by a vote of}} 471,177 to 302,951. When incumbent Attorney General Stephens resigned in December 1979 <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment to the Kentucky Supreme Court, Beshear was appointed to fill the vacancy until his term officially began in January. As attorney general, Beshear created the state's first Medicaid fraud division and his office took {{a leading role in the}} Leviticus Project, an eight-state coalition committed to prosecuting organized crime in the country's coal fields.|$|E
5|$|Fellini secured {{financing}} {{through the}} producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, {{who wanted to}} cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampanò, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been {{the inspiration for the}} entire project, so Fellini was determined never <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> alternative to her. For Zampanò, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, {{who was a member of}} Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was eager to take the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.|$|E

5|$|Gordon Philip Saville {{was born}} in Macon, Georgia, on September 14, 1902. His Regular Army officer father {{propelled}} Saville's older brother to enroll at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he urged Saville <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment to the United States Naval Academy. However, Saville wanted to fly so he rejected formal military schools. Instead, he attended the University of Washington, Antioch College, and then the University of California and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve on November 5, 1923, in the infantry, seeing active duty in August 1924 and August 1925. While on reserve duty at Crissy Field in San Francisco, Saville watched Army Air Service pilots training on military aircraft. He determined that he would join them or leave the military.|$|E
5|$|In 1866, Melvin was {{nominated}} as the Republican candidate for Attorney General of West Virginia, {{and he won}} his election to the position with 23,509 votes, receiving {{the highest number of}} votes cast for an attorney in West Virginia's brief three-year history. On January 1, 1867, Melvin began his one-year tenure as attorney general; he was renominated on June 4, 1868 at the West Virginia Republican Convention and reelected to the position in fall 1868. He served in the office until his resignation on July 1, 1869. Melvin resigned his post as attorney general <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment to a circuit judgeship of the First Judicial District of West Virginia which comprised Brooke, Hancock, Marshall, and Ohio counties. He had been appointed to the judgeship by West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Elbert H. Caldwell.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the {{boundaries}} of the Clause were further defined when Senator William S. Kenyon was allowed <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>an</b> appointment by President Warren G. Harding as circuit judge for the Eighth Circuit. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty concluded that no disqualifying event had occurred because the increase in emoluments to that office had occurred in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving {{at the time of the}} nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed by the Clinton administration when Representative Bill Richardson was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No rollback was attempted when Senator Hugo Black was appointed to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Levitt, the court rejected, for lack of legal standing, an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections. The movant in the Black case, Albert Levitt, only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.|$|E
