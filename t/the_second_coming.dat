5|$|Queer as Folk 2 was {{broadcast}} in February 2000 and {{was driven by}} the plot element of Vince's half-sister's wedding. The specials place emphasis on Vince and Stuart's relationship, and ends with their departure for another gay scene in a pastiche of Grease, as Nathan took the role {{as the leader of}} the Manchester scene's next generation. On the heels of the special, Davies pitched the spin-off Misfits, a late-night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by Vince's mother, Hazel, and <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> a series that depicted <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ in contemporary Manchester. Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel. Instead of contesting the cancellation of <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again.|$|E

5|$|Davies {{moved into}} writing adult {{television}} dramas in 1994. His early scripts generally explored concepts {{of religion and}} sexuality among various backdrops: Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool; The Grand explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period; and Queer as Folk, his first prolific series, recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene. Following this, his adult series in the 2000s include Bob & Rose, which portrayed a gay man who {{fell in love with}} a woman; <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> which focused on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> and deicide of Jesus Christ from a mostly non-religious point of view; Mine All Mine, a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea; and Casanova, an adaptation of the complete memoirs of Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, he {{met with}} the BBC to discuss the revival of the show and {{producing}} The Second Coming; the BBC were unable to commit to either, and he again declined to work for them. After the BBC rejected <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> Shindler proposed that the series should be pitched to ITV. Despite the story's controversial message, the critical success of Bob & Rose encouraged the channel to commission the series for broadcast.|$|E
5|$|The Assemblies of God holds to a conservative, evangelical and Arminian {{theology}} {{as expressed}} in the Statement of Fundamental Truths and position papers, which emphasize such core Pentecostal doctrines as the baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, divine healing and <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ. It defines for itself a fourfold mission to evangelize others, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion.|$|E
5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, and may even be <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E
50|$|The Millerites {{were the}} {{followers}} of the teachings of William Miller who, in 1833, first shared publicly his belief in <b>the</b> <b>coming</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Jesus Christ in roughly the year 1844.|$|R

5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, the belief that <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ would occur {{at the end of}} an era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-final, the U.S. faced Costa Rica. During {{the second}} half, the U.S. scored two goals, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> from Lloyd.

During the final match against Canada, the U.S. {{defeated}} Canada at home 4–0 {{to move on to}} the Olympics as the CONCACAF champions.

Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense except that they claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again.|$|E
5|$|Shindler {{continued}} to pitch <b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> to other television networks while Davies sought other ventures. His next series {{was based on}} a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child. He saw the relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked the couple about their relationship to develop the show. After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay friends had shown, he realised he was creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them, and instead focused on telling a traditional love story and gave the couple the traditionally British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> was {{controversial}} {{from its}} conception. When {{it was a}} Channel 4 project, it {{was the subject of}} a Sunday Express article a year before its original projected transmission date of late 2001. The series would again receive criticism when it was rumoured it would be broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2003. The series was eventually broadcast over consecutive nights on 9–10 February 2003 to 6.3million and 5.4million viewers respectively, and received mixed reactions from the audience: Davies reportedly received death threats for its atheistic message and criticism for its anticlimactic ending, as well as two nominations for Television Awards and one for a Royal Television Society Award.|$|E
5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully, working alone, pursues a cult that worship a slug-like organism and {{believe it to be}} <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Jesus Christ; but in her efforts to save an injured stranger, she discovers she is in over her head.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was not up to standard. He had trouble with his defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches {{in the last three}} months of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors did not have to reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis before the start of the 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E

5|$|Born in Salem, Massachusetts to two unwed first cousins, Jones Very became {{associated}} with Harvard University, first as an undergraduate, {{then as a}} student in the Harvard Divinity School and as a tutor of Greek. He heavily studied epic poetry and was invited to lecture on the topic in his home town, which drew the attention of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Soon after, Very asserted that he was <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ, which resulted in his dismissal from Harvard and his eventual institutionalization in an insane asylum. When he was released, Emerson helped him issue a collection called Essays and Poems in 1839. Very lived the majority of his life as a recluse from then on, issuing poetry only sparingly. He died in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Christian doctrines {{include the}} beliefs that Jesus was {{conceived}} by the Holy Spirit, {{was born of}} a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
