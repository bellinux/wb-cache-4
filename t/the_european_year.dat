The step was taken as part of a two-day program on <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Year</b> of Intercultural Dialogue {{focusing}} on Islam and its relationship with Europe. The program commemorated the life and work of Asad, described as a great Austrian visionary, who earned international recognition by building bridges between religions. The honoree's son Talal Asad, the President of the Islamic Community of Austria Anas Schakfeh and Vienna's cultural adviser Andreas Mailath-Pokorny were present at the unveiling of the square. Mailath-Pokorny, while talking to the media said: [...] "There is probably no more appropriate place to honor Muhammad Asad than that {{in front of the}} UN-City. Muhammad Asad was a citizen of the world, who was at home, and left his mark, everywhere in the world, especially in the Orient." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn our {{paper we}} present a {{contemporary}} overview of EU policies and present the methods of their implementation as applied to teaching translation and interpreting.

They are devoted considerable space in university interpreting- translation study programmes, which are designed to form broadly educated minds able to play the role of intercultural and interlingual intermediary between members of different language communities. One example of European policies in practice are <b>the</b> so-called <b>European</b> <b>Years.</b> Thus in <b>the</b> second part of the paper {{we present a}} historical overview of them and summarize their objectives.
