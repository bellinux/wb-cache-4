United {{acquired}} Dax McCarty and an allocation fee {{of roughly}} $35,000 from the Portland <b>Timbers</b> for Rodney Wallace {{and the lower}} of United’s two fourth round 2011 MLS SuperDraft selections. Three days after playing for the entire MLS Cup 2010 McCarty was acquired by the Portland <b>Timbers</b> with the first overall pick of the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft. At 4:13pm EST D.C.

5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the <b>timbers</b> {{has enabled}} precise dating of the track, showing {{it was built}} in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the {{discovery}} in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old trackway built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of the Sweet Track's <b>timbers</b> has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} <b>timber</b> {{entrepreneurs}} in Eastern Visayas and Metro Cebu {{has been conducted}} {{as part of the}} ACIAR Tree Farm Project to investigate the use, attitudes and preferences of <b>timber</b> entrepreneurs for smallholder <b>timber.</b> It was found that gmelina and mahogany are widely used by <b>timber</b> enterprises in the study area. The majority of <b>timber</b> enterprises obtain most of their <b>timber</b> requirement from <b>timber</b> dealers while some obtain <b>timber</b> directly from tree farmers. Smallholder <b>timber,</b> e. g. gmelina and mahogany, are found to be suitable for <b>timber</b> businesses but current government regulation concerning harvest and transport, declining <b>timber</b> resources and a poor <b>timber</b> market are some of the problems affecting the use of smallholder <b>timber</b> in <b>timber</b> enterprises...|$|R

5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland <b>Timbers.</b> The <b>Timbers,</b> who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the <b>Timbers,</b> thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the <b>Timbers.</b> United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved <b>Timbers</b> striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, <b>Timbers</b> captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the <b>Timbers</b> conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A quarter of an hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E
5|$|On 12 December 2013, Zakuani was {{selected}} by Portland <b>Timbers</b> as the number two pick in the MLS Re-Entry Draft; a yearly draft that allows teams to select players who are out-of-contract or have had their options declined by their current teams. The <b>Timbers</b> traded up for the opportunity. Zakuani was reunited with Caleb Porter, his former Akron coach, who had become the Portland manager. His pay was cut by $60,000 to $120,000 a year. Zakuani was expected to receive additional minutes immediately because first-choice winger Rodney Wallace was recovering from injury. Zakuani appeared in the Timbers' opening match of 2014 against Philadelphia Union as a substitute in the 85th minute. The Sounders and <b>Timbers</b> are fierce rivals; when the teams met in the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Zakuani assisted former college team-mate Darlington Nagbe in the Timbers' only goal during the 3–1 loss to his previous club. Zakuani scored his first goal for <b>Timbers</b> on 19 August 2014, scoring the opening goal in a 4–1 win over Alpha United in the 2014–15 CONCACAF Champions League. After the match, Porter spoke to the media {{about the need to}} bench Zakuani because of his persistent muscle strains.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, Seattle {{went against}} its rival, the Portland <b>Timbers,</b> at Starfire for the quarterfinal. The Sounders went on top with an Osvaldo Alonso goal, but former Sounder Steve Zakuani {{assisted}} Darlington Nagbe {{to score a}} last-second equalizer for the <b>Timbers</b> in the 93rd minute. Extra time saw the ejection of Portland's Diego Chara while Cooper and Marco Pappa both found {{the back of the}} net to give the home team a 3–1 victory.|$|E

5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on her side for repairs. Some damaged <b>timbers</b> were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken <b>timbers</b> were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{form for}} the Aztex {{attracted}} the attention of the Portland <b>Timbers,</b> a Major League Soccer expansion side for the 2011 season. At the end of the 2010 league season, Johnson was announced as one of the <b>Timbers</b> first four signings, along with Steve Cronin, Ryan Pore and Bright Dike. Because Portland had second draft pick behind fellow expansion side Vancouver Whitecaps, they announced they had previously signed Johnson, by taking him to their former USL side before the transfer deadline on 14 August and loaning him back to the Aztex {{for the remainder of the}} 2010 season. He was listed on the Timbers' roster as a forward. Johnson was a late substitute for Jorge Perlaza in the Timbers' first MLS home game and fourth in all, as they defeated Chicago Fire 4–2 on 15 April 2011.|$|E

The ground floor may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and sleeping accommodation. The walls of the ground floor have chasing and sockets cut into them. It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained <b>timbers</b> to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held <b>timbers</b> that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.|$|E
40|$|Prior to 1977, each {{county in}} California {{assessed}} all nonexempt standing <b>timber</b> for ad valorem taxation. Since {{the value of}} <b>timber</b> {{was added to the}} value of land and then taxed annually, property owners had an incentive to harvest trees to reduce their property taxes, thereby threatening to erode the <b>timber</b> base of California. Each forested county had to maintain a staff who established the values of standing <b>timber.</b> Owners of large <b>timber</b> properties were displeased with the variation in appraisal values that often occurred between counties and with the need to discuss values with county assessors in multiple counties. These owners strongly supported the centralized appraisal and determination of taxable value for <b>timber.</b> The Z'berg-Warren-Keene-Collier Forest Taxation Reform Act of 1976 dramatically changed the method of taxing <b>timber</b> in California. The Act encouraged the protection of immature trees and the continued use of timberlands for the production of trees for <b>timber</b> products, and provided restrictions on the use of timberland to the production of <b>timber</b> products and compatible uses. The Act, codified as the <b>Timber</b> Yield Tax Law, replaced the ad valorem tax on standing <b>timber</b> with a yield tax on felled <b>timber.</b> The resulting <b>timber</b> yield tax is imposed on every <b>timber</b> owner who harvests <b>timber</b> or causes it to be harvested...|$|R
