40|$|In {{this thesis}} the <b>tail</b> <b>threading</b> {{procedure}} for a pulp drying plant in a Stora Enso's manufacturing plant in Finland is examined. Tools are developed {{to analyze the}} work shifts' operation during <b>tail</b> <b>threading,</b> examine the most problematic work stages and to determine causes for web breaks. The process environment and the threading procedure were studied by interviewing {{the staff at the}} plant. The threading procedure is a very complex series of work tasks, which must be completed in order. The next work stage may be started only after certain criteria are fulfilled. Hidden Markov Modelling was applied to the procedure by dividing the tasks as hidden states into two models. The observations used to distinguish the work tasks were developed according to the interviews. The developed Markov models consist of six states. The model parameters were taught using supervised learning method. The models were validated by comparing video recordings from the process environment with the state sequence estimate given by the model, and also by using Confusion Matrices between the taught and estimated system states. According to the Confusion Matrix calculations and the video material comparison, the models are found to function reliably. The wet end model's true states are confused with the other states more often than those of the dry end model. This may partly be related to the low sampling rate of the data and the short duration of the wet end work stages. The effects of inaccuracies in state recognition are minimized by post-processing the state estimates. For the dry end model state recognition a very high level of confidence was achieved (over 99 %). Key figures were defined from the state sequence estimates. In this thesis, these characteristics are simplified for presentation. The characteristics include durations in various threading stages, the number of threading efforts and the distribution of web breaks between the different stages for each of the work shifts. The analysis suggests that each work shift has strengths and weaknesses in different stages of the procedure. By further examining the shifts' operations, the most reliable methods for each work phase could be obtained. During the research for this thesis some issues with one of the process measurements were discovered. According to the measurement, the pulp web is higher than normal, and the automation system attempts to lower the web by decreasing the speed settings for the process. According to the measurement, however, the web is not lowered. These issues may greatly affect the success of the threading. Cause for this measurement behaviour was not found during the research for this thesis...|$|E
6000|$|The Fán were {{accompanied}} in their seaward movement by the Osheba or 'Sheba, the Moshebo and Moshobo of M. du Chaillu's map. They {{are said to}} be a tribe of kindred blood and warlike tastes, speaking a remarkably guttural tongue, but intelligible to the Mpángwe. They too were doubtless pressed forward by the Inner Bati, who are.also affected by the Okáná, the Yefá, and the Sensobá. The latter are the innermost known to my negro informants, and their sheep and goats have found their way to the Gaboon: they are doughty elephant-hunters, and they attack the Njína, although they have no fire-arms. The Mpangwe deride the savagery of these races, who have never heard of a man riding a horse or an ass, which the Mpongwes call Cavala and Buro burro). The names of these three races, which are described as brave, warlike, and hospitable to strangers, will not be found on any map; indeed the regions east of the Gaboon belong to the great white blot of inter-tropical Africa, extending from north latitude 7 degrees to south latitude 5 degrees. Major de Ruvignes heard also of a tribe called Lachaize (Osheba?) which excels the Fán in strength and courage as much as the latter do the coast tribes: a detachment of them had settled near one of the chief Mpángwe towns, [...] "Mboma." [...] Some days after his arrival he saw several of these people, and describes them as giants, compared with the negro races to which his eye was accustomed. The general stature varied from six feet to six feet four inches; their complexion was a light café au lait; their hair was ornamented with cowries, strung so thickly as to suggest a skull-cup, whilst long streamers of elephants' <b>tails,</b> <b>threaded</b> with the Cypraea and brass rings, hung down from the head behind the ears, covering the nape of the neck. All these, we may observe, are Congo customs. In their manufacture of iron, dug by themselves, they resemble the cannibals.|$|R
40|$|SummaryCapistruin is a 19 -residue ribosomally {{synthesized}} lasso peptide encoded by the capABCD {{gene cluster}} in Burkholderia thailandensis. It {{is composed of}} an N-terminal 9 -residue macrolactam ring, through which the 10 -residue C-terminal <b>tail</b> is <b>threaded.</b> Using a heterologous capistruin production system in Escherichia coli, we have generated 48 mutants of the precursor protein CapA to gain insights into capistruin biosynthesis. Only 4 residues (Gly 1, Arg 11, Val 12, and Ile 13) of the lasso sequence {{were found to be}} critical for maturation. Tandem mass spectrometric fragmentation studies of capistruin F 16 A/F 18 A proved Arg 15 to be responsible for the trapping of the C-terminal tail. Substituting Arg 15 and Phe 16 by alanine revealed a temperature-sensitive capistruin derivative, which unfolds into a branched cyclic peptide upon heating. In conclusion, our global mutagenic approach revealed a low overall specificity of the biosynthetic machinery and important structure-stability correlations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicrocin J 25 is {{a potent}} {{antibacterial}} peptide produced by Escherichia coli AY 25. It displays a lasso structure, which consists of a knot involving an N-terminal macrolactam ring through which the C-terminal <b>tail</b> is <b>threaded</b> and sterically trapped. In this study, we rationally designed and performed site-specific mutations in order to pinpoint the sequence determinants of the lasso topology. Structures of the resulting variants were analysed {{by a combination of}} methods (mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, enzymatic digestion), and correlated to the antibacterial activity. The selected mutations resulted in the production of branched-cyclic or lasso variants. The C-terminal residues below the ring (Tyr 20, Gly 21) {{and the size of the}} macrolactam ring were revealed to be critical for both the lasso scaffold and bioactivity, while shortening the loop region (Tyr 9 -Ser 18) or extending the C-terminal tail below the ring did not alter the lasso structure, but differentially affected the antibacterial activity. These results provide new insights for the bioengineering of antibacterial agents using a lasso peptide as template...|$|R

The quality obtained for the elevator is better, thanks to the material used and to the manufacturing process. For the elevator prototypes there were performed some Finite element method (FEM) analysis to identify stress locations and displacements. It was realized corrosion test in artificial saliva Fusayama Meyer (pH 5, 5) at temperature of 37 ± 1 °C for 24 hours and remarks the importance of post treatment after DMLS process to obtain a better corrosion resistance in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Numerous ribosomal {{proteins}} have a striking bipartite architecture: a globular body positioned on the ribosomal exterior and an internal loop buried {{deep into the}} rRNA core. In eukaryotes, {{a significant number of}} conserved r-proteins have evolved extra amino- or carboxy-terminal <b>tail</b> sequences, which <b>thread</b> across the solvent-exposed surface. The biological importance of these extended domains remains to be established. In this study, we have investigated the universally conserved internal loop and the eukaryote-specific extensions of yeast L 4. We show that in contrast to findings with bacterial L 4, deleting the internal loop of yeast L 4 causes severely impaired growth and reduced levels of large ribosomal subunits. We further report that while depleting the entire L 4 protein blocks early assembly steps in yeast, deletion of only its extended internal loop affects later steps in assembly, revealing a second role for L 4 during ribosome biogenesis. Surprisingly, deletion of the entire eukaryote-specific carboxy-terminal tail of L 4 has no effect on viability, production of 60 S subunits, or translation. These unexpected observations provide impetus to further investigate the functions of ribosomal protein extensions, especially eukaryote-specific examples, in ribosome assembly and function...|$|R
50|$|Tiger {{tail wire}} (also simply called tiger tail or tiger-tail) {{is a kind}} of thin wire encased in nylon often used in beaded jewellery, and that is {{particularly}} suited to stringing heavy beads and sharp beads, which tend to fray other kinds of thread. For this reason, tiger <b>tail</b> is the <b>thread</b> of choice for gemstones. Some tiger tail has multiple intertwined wire threads under the nylon coating. The wire threads are made of stainless steel. Tiger tail cannot be fashioned into a knot in order to end a sequence of beads as other kinds of thread can, therefore crimp beads are often used for this purpose instead. Crimp beads are also used as spacers between other beads strung on tiger tail. Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail is the most common. Tiger tail is easier to use than many other kinds of thread, and it does not require the use of a sewing needle. Tiger tail has high ultimate tensile strength and is therefore extremely difficult to tear, but if it is creased or twisted, tiger tail has a tendency to kink and then become brittle in the kinked area.|$|R
5000|$|While {{there are}} reports of this type of {{instrument}} being used in humans, {{it is more likely that}} these were reserved for veterinary use, while the common thumb lancet was the instrument of choice for use in people. A survey of 100 fleams found thumb lancets in 6%. [...] These instruments with their triangular-shaped blades were designed to be placed over the vein (most commonly the jugular or saphenous) and struck with a fleam stick. This would ideally result in a rapid penetration of the vein with minimal risk to the operator and minimal dissection of the subcutaneous tissues. This latter point would have been considered important in minimizing the formation of a dissecting hematoma. Once the desired blood was drained from the patient, the operator would place a pin through the edges of the incision. A figure eight of <b>tail</b> hair or <b>thread</b> would then be placed over the pin to retain closure. Statements from Mayhew in his 1864 treatise would indicate that the perceived benefits of these procedures were coming into great question in the latter half of the 19th century for all conditions except laminitis.|$|R
