5|$|In fiction, Druitt is {{depicted}} as <b>the</b> <b>murderer</b> in the musical Jack the Ripper by Ron Pember and Denis de Marne. In John Gardner's Sherlock Holmes story The Return of Moriarty, Professor Moriarty's criminal exploits are hampered by increased police activity {{as a result of}} the Jack the Ripper murders. He discovers that Druitt is <b>the</b> <b>murderer</b> and so fakes his suicide in the hope that the police will lose interest once the murders cease. In Alan Moore's graphic novel From Hell, Druitt is portrayed as a patsy for the royal family, made to look guilty of the Ripper murders in order to protect the real killer, Sir William Gull.|$|E

40|$|Scream 4, {{directed}} by Wes Craven, {{was released in}} 2011. The story of Scream 4 is about the terror and the murder committed by two murderers: Jill Roberts and Charlie Walker, to a woman, named Sidney Prescott, and to the people around them. The murderers’ motivation is jealousy. Out of jealousy, {{they want to take}} revenge to the victims who have hurt them. <b>The</b> <b>murderers</b> are jealous about Sidney because Sidney becomes popular after she survived from the attempted murder ten years ago. Besides, <b>the</b> <b>murderers</b> also have problems with the victims. So, {{the only way to get}} rid of them is by killing them one by one. <b>The</b> <b>murderers</b> are inspired by a modern horror movie. <b>The</b> <b>murderers</b> therefore record <b>the</b> actions, as if they are making a movie. After <b>the</b> <b>murderers</b> do their actions, <b>the</b> <b>murderers</b> upload it to the internet. The writer will use the Jungian psychoanalysis theory to analyze the characters of <b>the</b> <b>murderers.</b> <b>The</b> theory used in this thesis is Jungian psychoanalysis especially the one focussing on Jungian archetypes. In this thesis, the pictures from the scenes are also presented to give more details...|$|R

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat <b>the</b> <b>murderer</b> as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to <b>the</b> <b>murderer</b> in Kant's example.|$|E
5|$|Lady Macbeth {{has gained}} fame along the way. In his 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District, Nikolai Leskov updated The Tragedy of Macbeth {{so that it}} takes place among the Imperial Russian {{merchant}} class. In an ironic twist, however, Leskov reverses the gender roles – the woman is <b>the</b> <b>murderer</b> and the man is the instigator. Leskov's novel {{was the basis for}} Dmitri Shostakovich's 1936 opera of the same name.|$|E

This, he said would make murder costly and in self defense the local authorities would {{put a stop to}} it. At first blush, this is an attractive suggestion. But why not hang <b>the</b> <b>murderers?</b> Why make a distinction between <b>the</b> <b>murderers</b> of white men and <b>the</b> <b>murderers</b> of colored men? ...|$|R

Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|The {{mutilated}} body of {{the fourth}} woman, prostitute Annie Chapman, was discovered at about 6:00am on Saturday 8 September on the ground near a doorway {{in the back yard}} of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields. Chapman had left her lodgings at 2am on the day she was murdered, with the intention of getting money from a client to pay her rent. Her throat was cut from left to right. She had been disembowelled, and her intestines had been thrown out of her abdomen over each of her shoulders. The morgue examination revealed that part of her uterus was missing. The pathologist, George Bagster Phillips, was of the opinion that <b>the</b> <b>murderer</b> must have possessed anatomical knowledge to have sliced out the reproductive organs in a single movement with a blade about 6–8inches (15–20cm) long. However, the idea that <b>the</b> <b>murderer</b> possessed surgical skill was dismissed by other experts. As the bodies were not examined extensively at the scene, it has also been suggested that the organs were actually removed by mortuary staff, who took advantage of bodies that had already been opened to extract organs that they could sell as surgical specimens.|$|E

5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which may lead to <b>the</b> <b>murderer.</b> Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers {{in an effort to}} acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover <b>the</b> <b>murderer,</b> although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
