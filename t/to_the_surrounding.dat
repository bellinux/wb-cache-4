5|$|During the Triassic (252–201 Ma), much of Scotland {{remained}} in desert conditions, with higher {{ground in the}} Highlands and Southern Uplands providing sediment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> basins via flash floods. This is the origin of sandstone outcrops near Dumfries, Elgin and the Isle of Arran. Towards the close of this period sea levels began to rise and climatic conditions became less arid.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe used {{binocular}} rivalry as a psychophysical probe to explore center-surround interactions in orientation, motion and color processing. Addition of <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> matching {{one of the}} rival targets dramatically altered rivalry dynamics. For all visual sub-modalities tested, predominance of the high-contrast rival target matched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> was greatly reduced—a result that disappeared at low contrast. At low contrast, addition of <b>the</b> <b>surround</b> boosted dominance of orientation and motion targets matched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surround.</b> This contrast-dependent modulation of center-surround interactions {{seems to be a}} general property of the visual system and may reflect an adaptive balance between surround suppression and spatial summation...|$|R

5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became {{an important component of}} the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} that the Normans conquered England in 1066, the town of Southampton {{occupied}} a rectangular area overlooking the mouth of the River Test, an important medieval waterway. It was protected by water on most sides and by protective ditches and banks to the north and east. Southampton at this time was a relatively large town, but not as significant as in the later medieval period. The Normans built a castle within the town on the site of a probable large English hall, and considerable damage was caused <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> local buildings as space was opened up for the new fortification.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{isolated}} coastal location, the Isle of Portland has {{an extensive}} range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists {{from around the}} country. Rare visitors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach {{is one of only}} two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{executed}} {{a number of}} nuclear tests {{on the island of}} Amchitka in the face of vehement opposition from environmental and local indigenous groups. The first test, conducted in 1965, caused significant damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> area, although the details of this damage were not released to the public until 1969. In 1969, the AEC executed a 'calibration shot' to determine whether Amchitka would be suitable for future tests. In 1970, the AEC announced plans to detonate a bomb named 'Cannikin', set to release a blast 385 times that released by the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. After a United States Supreme Court challenge to the testing failed by one vote, the testing proceeded as scheduled in November 1971.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
5|$|In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by {{a margin}} of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state {{legislature}} to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Justin Ferrell explores three moral {{sensibilities}} {{that motivated}} activists {{in dealing with}} Yellowstone. First came the utilitarian vision of maximum exploitation of natural resources, characteristic of developers in the late 19th century. Second was the spiritual vision of nature inspired by the Romanticism and the transcendentalists the mid-19th century. The twentieth century saw the biocentric moral vision {{that focuses on the}} health of the ecosystem as theorized by Aldo Leopold, which led to the expansion of federally protected areas and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} while the issues of {{increasing}} public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city's economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than 168million dollars for 2005, and a highly skilled workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by access roads and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surrounding</b> communities.|$|E
