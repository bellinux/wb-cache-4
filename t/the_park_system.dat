5|$|In 1906, Theodore Wirth came to Minneapolis as {{the parks}} superintendent. During his tenure, <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system</b> {{increased}} from 1810 acres (7.3km²) in 57 properties to 5421 acres (21.9km²) in 144 properties. <b>The</b> <b>park</b> <b>system,</b> {{organized around the}} Minneapolis chain of lakes (including Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Lake Hiawatha, and Lake Nokomis) became a model for park planners around the world. He also encouraged active recreation in the parks, {{as opposed to just}} setting aside parks for passive admiration.|$|E

5|$|Lawton {{is home to}} 80 {{parks and}} {{recreation}} areas in varying sizes, including the largest Elmer Thomas Park. Along with <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system,</b> the city is near three major lakes, Lake Lawtonka, Lake Ellsworth, and Elmer Thomas Lake, where boating, swimming, camping, and fishing are permitted. The Lawton branch of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) offers {{a wide variety of}} recreational programs to members, and the Lawton Country Club maintains an 18-hole, par 71 golf course. Recreation can also be found in many amateur leagues, including: adult softball, youth baseball, soccer, softball, and volleyball.|$|E

5|$|National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) are a {{relatively}} new invention in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system.</b> Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area, created in 2015, is the only unit that uses this designation in its name. Fathom Five National Marine Park was created in 1987, prior to the NMCA concept, and subsequently classified as an NMCA without changing its legal name. The case of Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park is similar, while Gwaii Haanas is an NMCA Reserve, {{with the intention of}} becoming an NMCA.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin F. Stapleton was {{the mayor}} of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was {{responsible}} for many civic improvements, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the New Deal. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system</b> was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed Stapleton International Airport in his honor. Today, the airport {{has been replaced by}} a neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ron Swanson {{had been}} {{director}} of Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{for six years}} at the time Parks and Recreation began. A staunch Libertarian, with a distinctive mustache, Ron is an extremely strong advocate for small government; despite working in a city hall job, he believes all government {{is a waste of}} taxpayer money. Ron believes <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system</b> should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, as exemplified by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government. Ron puts almost no effort into his job, and lets his deputy director Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) do {{the vast majority of the}} work.|$|E

25|$|The Trujillo regime greatly {{expanded}} the Vedado del Yaque, a nature reserve around the Yaque del Sur River. In 1934 {{he created the}} nation's first national park, banned the slash-and-burn method of clearing land for agriculture, set up a forest warden agency to protect <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system,</b> and banned the logging of pine trees without his permission. In the 1950s the Trujillo regime commissioned {{a study on the}} hydroelectric potential of damming the Dominican Republic's waterways. The commission concluded that only forested waterways could support hydroelectric dams, so Trujillo banned logging in potential river watersheds. After his assassination in 1961, logging resumed in the Dominican Republic. Squatters burned down the forests for agriculture, and logging companies clear-cut parks. In 1967, President Joaquín Balaguer launched military strikes against illegal logging.|$|E

500|$|Before Laguna Canyon {{became a}} {{wilderness}} park, a housing development was proposed {{to be built}} in and around the canyon, tentatively called [...] "Laguna Laurel". The [...] community, which was proposed to contain 3,200 housing units {{as well as a number}} of businesses, was canceled in the 1990s after the City of Laguna Beach purchased four of its parcels in order to provide space for a wilderness park, while the City of Irvine purchased one, and Laguna Coast Wilderness Park was opened and dedicated in 1993.

500|$|A {{series of}} levees on the park's eastern border marks {{the line between}} urban and {{protected}} areas, but development into these areas threatens <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system.</b> Florida still attracts nearly a thousand new residents every day, and building residential, commercial and industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses the water balance and ecosystems within the park. On the park's western border, Fort Myers, Naples and Cape Coral are expanding, but no system of levees exists to mark that border. National Geographic rated both Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve the lowest-scoring parks in North America, at 32 out of 100. Their scoring system rated 55parks in terms of sustainable tourism, destination quality, and park management. The experts who compiled the results justified the score by stating: [...] "Encroachment by housing and retail development has thrown the precious ecosystem into a tailspin, and if humankind doesn't back off, there will be nothing left of one of this country's most amazing treasures".|$|E
500|$|There were {{objections}} to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site. Prominent opponents included Mayor Franklin Edson, who believed that the system of parks was too big and expensive to acquire, and Assemblyman Theodore Roosevelt, who opposed the bill's being pushed through. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the bill, now {{referred to as the}} [...] "New Parks Act", as law, authorizing the creation of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>system.</b> As part of the proposed system, Bronx Park would {{be at the center of}} the system. It was connected to Van Cortlandt Park in the northwest via Mosholu Parkway; to Pelham Bay Park in the east via Pelham Parkway; and to Crotona Park in the south via Crotona Parkway. There were no direct connections to Claremont Park and St. Mary's Park, the other two parks in the system.|$|E
