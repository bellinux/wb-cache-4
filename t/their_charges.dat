5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to <b>their</b> <b>charges</b> in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, <b>their</b> <b>charges</b> cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

5|$|The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator, Gregory, {{reveals that}} it is his company's policy to record all conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing he murdered Pellitt. Harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while the friends get <b>their</b> <b>charges</b> waived. Nick is {{promoted}} to {{president of the company}} under a sadistic CEO, Kurt retains his job under a new boss, and Dale blackmails Julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient, while Jones secretly records the act.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{handling of}} Luftflotte 3 {{was not good}} either. The escorting fighters of StG 77 were stretched too far across a 30-mile front. By chance half of the defending fighters went into action {{against one of the}} attacking Ju 87 groups with disastrous results for the group concerned. The German fighters, which outnumbered the RAF units by 2:1, were unable to protect the Stuka units. Had the targets been closer together, the concentration of fighters would have allowed the Germans to destroy more RAF fighters in the air, while protecting <b>their</b> <b>charges.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{rapid changes}} raised {{tensions}} between officers and <b>their</b> <b>charges,</b> and over thirty sailors {{were arrested in}} early December and accused of planning a new rebellion—which led to that feared second rebellion. On 9 December, crewmen onboard Rio Grande do Sul, {{the only one of}} Brazil's major new warships to not take part in the Revolt of the Lash, mutinied but did not gain enough traction to take the ship. Shortly after, the marine infantry battalion at the naval facilities on Ilha das Cobras revolted. The government acted quickly and put down both rebellions, but they caused the Brazilian Congress to declare that Rio de Janeiro {{was in a state of}} siege, thereby giving President Fonseca a suite of tools to combat the unrest. The vote was nearly unanimous; the only vote against came from Rui Barbosa.|$|E

5|$|KG 1, meanwhile, {{had a clear}} run to its target. The {{battles with}} KG 76 had drawn {{in four of the}} five RAF Squadrons. Still, the British sent No. 615 Squadron and its 15 Spitfires to deal with KG 1. They were confronted with a large number of Bf 109s from JG 54, escorting the He 111s. The German fighters {{successfully}} defended <b>their</b> <b>charges</b> and the RAF fighters could not break through to the bombers, which were flying in stepped-up waves from 12 to 15,000 feet. Most of the German bomber crews noted the absence of fighter opposition and speculated that the RAF might be {{at the end of its}} tether. Most of the personnel at Biggin Hill had time to take cover before the bombers arrived. KG 1 lost only one He 111 and one another damaged but failed to damage Biggin Hill. It is likely the losses sustained by KG 1 were inflicted by Spitfires from No. 65 Squadron RAF which stumbled across of their He 111s while 615 and JG 54 were locked in combat.|$|E

25|$|The {{electric}} {{charge of a}} macroscopic object {{is the sum of}} the {{electric charge}}s of the particles that make it up. This charge is often small, because matter is made of atoms, and atoms typically have equal numbers of protons and electrons, in which case <b>their</b> <b>charges</b> cancel out, yielding a net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.|$|E
25|$|It was {{becoming}} apparent, {{by the fall}} of 1942, that Prince David and her sister ships were not equipped to defend themselves or <b>their</b> <b>charges</b> against well-armed enemy ships that, it was feared, may begin to operate off the West Coast. It was therefore decided to convert Prince David and Prince Henry to landing ships infantry (medium) in preparation for the coming invasion of Europe.|$|E
25|$|By convention, {{the charge}} of an {{electron}} is −1, while that of a proton is +1. Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. Coulomb's law quantifies the electrostatic force between two particles by asserting that the force {{is proportional to the}} product of <b>their</b> <b>charges,</b> and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E
