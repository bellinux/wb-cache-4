5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a <b>two-step</b> <b>process.</b> Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E
5|$|Two rule {{changes were}} made for the 79th Academy Awards {{in regard to the}} Best Foreign Language Film process. The first was instituting a <b>two-step</b> <b>process</b> in {{choosing}} the nominees for the award in order to allow New York-based members of the Academy to participate. An initial committee would select nine films to form a shortlist in January that would then be reviewed by a committee composed of ten members of the initial committee, ten Los Angeles-based members, and ten New York-based members that would select the final five nominees. The second change was the removal of a rule requiring that the films be in an official language of the submitting country. This was done in response to the rejection of Italy's and Austria's submissions for the 78th Academy Awards, Private and Caché respectively, because they were not filmed in the official language of their respective countries. This allowed for the acceptance of submissions such as Canada's Water, which contained solely Hindi dialogue. Following the revealing of the shortlist, the Academy released a list of the five nominees on January 23, 2007. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was Germany's The Lives of Others, which was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.|$|E

40|$|The two-step {{contribution}} to the spin-longitudinal and the spin-transverse cross sections of ^{ 12 }C,^{ 40 }Ca(p,n) reactions at 494 MeV and 346 MeV is calculated. We use a plane-wave approximation and evaluate the relative contributions from the one-step and the <b>two-step</b> <b>processes.</b> We found that the ratios of the two-step to the one-step processes are larger in the spin-transverse cross sections than in the spin-longitudinal ones. Combining these results with the distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) results we obtained considerable two-step contributions to the spin-longitudinal and the spin-transverse cross sections. The <b>two-step</b> <b>processes</b> are important in accounting for the underestimation of the DWIA results for the spin-longitudinal and the spin-transverse cross sections.

30|$|We {{demonstrate}} that the regrowth of ZnO NWs by a <b>two-step</b> CVTC <b>process</b> can lead to NWs with different morphologies and properties. By varying the growth parameters in the first-step CVTC process, ZnO NWs can preferentially grow along the axial, radial or both directions. Unlike Si or Ge NWs where axial or core-shell heterostructures can be fabricated by varying different gaseous precursors, most ZnO NWs are grown by evaporating solid ZnO powder which {{makes it difficult to}} switch the precursor. Our <b>two-step</b> CVTC <b>processes</b> suggest a simple yet effective method to fabricate axial or core-shell ZnO NW heterostructrues, such as p/n ZnO junctions. Moreover, ZnO nanoantennas first reported here can be readily obtained by our <b>two-step</b> CVTC <b>process</b> and are good candidates for field emitters and/or nanosensors.|$|R
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} {{is accomplished}} by a <b>two-step</b> <b>process,</b> first images are aligned to account for errors in the positioning of a sample; such errors can occur due to vibration or mechanical drift. Alignment methods use image registration algorithms, such as autocorrelation methods to correct these errors. Secondly, using a reconstruction algorithm, such as filtered back projection, the aligned image slices can be transformed from a set of two-dimensional images, I'j(x,y), to a single three-dimensional image, Ij(x,y,z). This three-dimensional image {{is of particular interest}} when morphological information is required, further study can be undertaken using computer algorithms, such as isosurfaces and data slicing to analyse the data.|$|E
25|$|Xu, using atomic force microscopy, {{has shown}} that {{formation}} of amyloid fibers is a <b>two-step</b> <b>process</b> in which proteins first aggregate into colloidal spheres of ~20nm diameter. The spheres then join together spontaneously to form linear chains, which evolve into mature amyloid fibers. The formation of these linear chains appears {{to be driven by}} the development of an electrostatic dipole in each of the colloidal spheres strong enough to overcome coulomb repulsion. This suggests a possible mechanism by which alpha sheet may promote amyloid aggregation; the peptide bond has a relatively large intrinsic electrostatic dipole, but normally the dipoles of nearby bonds cancel each other out. In the alpha sheet, unlike other conformations, the peptide bonds are oriented in parallel so that the dipoles of the individual bonds can add up to create a strong overall electrostatic dipole.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the probing {{process was}} {{performed}} in two steps because of the relative ease of producing primary and secondary antibodies in separate processes. This gives researchers and corporations huge advantages in terms of flexibility, and adds an amplification step to the detection process. Given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection, however, there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems {{that would allow the}} process to occur faster and with fewer consumables. This requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label, probes which are often available for known protein tags. The primary probe is incubated with the membrane {{in a manner similar to}} that for the primary antibody in a <b>two-step</b> <b>process,</b> and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps.|$|E

25|$|Ease {{of voting}} {{is a factor}} in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through {{separate}} voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This <b>two-step</b> <b>process</b> quite clearly decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E
25|$|The {{demise of}} the ichthyosaurs has {{recently}} {{been described as a}} <b>two-step</b> <b>process.</b> A first extinction event {{in the beginning of the}} Cenomanian eliminated two of the three ichthyosaur feeding guilds then present, the 'soft-prey specialists' and the 'generalists', leaving only an apex predator group, which probably was not particularly specialized. The second major ichthyosaur extinction took place during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event, an 'anoxic event', eliminating the apex predators, after which just a single lineage survived, Platypterygius hercynicus, which disappeared shortly afterwards, about 93 million years ago. Ichthyosaur extinction was thus a pair of abrupt events rather than a long decline, probably related to the environmental upheavals and climatic changes in the Cenomanian and Turonian. If so, it was not caused by mosasaurid competition; large mosasaurs did not appear until 3 million years after the ichthyosaur extinction, likely to fill the resulting ecological void. Plesiosaurian Polycotylidae perhaps also filled some of the niches previously occupied by ichthyosaurs, although they had coexisted for 19 million years. The extinction was most likely the result of ecological change and volatility that caused changes in migration, food availability, and birthing grounds. This part of the Cretaceous was one in which many other marine extinctions occurred, including those of some types of microplankton, ammonites, belemnites, and reef-building bivalves.|$|E
