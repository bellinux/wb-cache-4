5000|$|The {{status of}} women {{differed}} immensely by region. In most of Western Europe, later marriage and higher rates of definitive celibacy (the so-called [...] "European marriage pattern") helped to constrain patriarchy at its most extreme level. The rise of Christianity and manorialism had both created incentives to keep families nuclear and thus the age of marriage increased; the Western Church instituted marriage laws and practices that undermined large kinship groups. From {{as early as the}} 4th century, the Church discouraged any practice that enlarged the family, like adoption, polygamy, taking concubines, divorce, and remarriage. The Church severely discouraged and prohibited consanguineous marriages, a marriage pattern that has constituted a means to maintain clans (and thus their power) <b>throughout</b> <b>history.</b> <b>The</b> <b>church</b> also forbade marriages in which the bride did not clearly agree to the union. After the Fall of Rome, manorialism also helped weakened the ties of kinship and thus the power of clans; as early as the 9th century in Austrasia, families that worked on manors were small, consisting of parents and children and occasionally a grandparent. The Church and state had become allies in erasing the solidarity and thus the political power of the clans; the Church sought to replace traditional religion, whose vehicle was the kin group, and substituting the authority of the elders of the kin group with that of a religious elder; at the same time, the king's rule was undermined by revolts {{on the part of the}} most powerful kin groups, clans or sections, whose conspiracies and murders threatened the power of the state and also the demand of manorial lords for obedient, compliant workers. As the peasants and serfs lived and worked on farms that they rented from the lord of the manor, they also needed the permission of the lord to marry; couples therefore had to comply with the lord and wait until a small farm became available before they could marry and thus produce children. Those who could and did delay marriage presumably were rewarded by the landlord and those who did not were presumably denied said reward. For example, Medieval England saw the marriage age as variable depending on economic circumstances, with couples delaying marriage until the early twenties when times were bad and frequently marrying in the late teens after the Black Death, when there were labor shortages and it was economically lucrative to workers; by appearances, marriage of adolescents was not the norm in England.|$|E

40|$|Peer reviewedDemocracy, “government by the people, for the people” in Zimbabwe, {{as in most}} post-colonial African countries, is an ideal, and the {{attainment}} of it is difficult, {{as we can see}} from the absence of and pretensions to it. In Zimbabwe itself, the road to democracy since independence from colonial oppresssion has been filled with blind alleys and impasses. <b>Throughout</b> <b>history,</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> has been a recognised key partner with the state in particular, and society in general, in the discourse facilitating the democratisation process. In this context, the church shares in the mission of Christ as a pacesetter in offering prophetic advocacy, and in education as a driver of social transformation. This article explores church engagement in the transition to democracy, using access points that include promoting liberation, reconciliation and reconstruction, and inculcating democratic values of respect for human dignity and the participation of all people in decisions that affect the quality and direction of their lives. The article explores the question of how the church has exercised its role in the transition from colonial rule to democracy in Zimbabwe by defining the term “transition to democracy”, examining the situation in Zimbabwe, and exposing the church’s engagement with it. Pertinent questions for the appraisal are: What has been done? What is being done? Do the interventions go deep enough? What needs to be done...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Ethics), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This study encapsulates a theological-ethical {{study of}} church visitation. It was {{focussed}} on the GKSA {{and wants to}} make a contribution towards an ethical implementation of church visitation in the GKSA and elsewhere. Church visitation within the GKSA can be described as a regular, precautionary shepherding visit to all churches in the jurisdiction of the classis, by two experienced visitators to take cognisance of the service, order and teaching; as well as to show the concern of God for His church and every member of the congregation in order to admonish, comfort and strengthen them. The aim is to promote harmony (not chaos), to uplift so as to stimulate (not demolish) and to expand the Kingdom of God (not to subdue it). <b>Throughout</b> <b>history</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> visitation was contantly engaged in a struggle as to how church visitation should take place so that the Word and Confessions and during the Sinod of Dortrecht (Netherlands) in 1618 / 1619 an order was formulated. A part of this Order is Church Order Article 44 which provides for the opportunity of church visitation ecclesiastically, as well as the instructions as to how (includes ethically) it should be done. In the GKSA this Dordt Church Order was accepted in 1862. Although church visitation is organised according to Church Order, it is an action that is ethically grounded arising from the love and care of believers for each other and for God and His Church. This care and concern appears intermittently in the Word, as for example: Acts 15 : 36 (the locus classicus of church visitation) : "a while later Paul said to Barnabas: "Let us go and see how it is going with the believers in all the cities where we have proclaimed the Word of God. " Church visitation can be termed a caring strategy wherein visitations look with compassion as to how it is going in the churches. It is a pastoral visit where love is exhorted, comforted in faith and strengthened in hope. In Revelation 2 and 3 it is found that Jesus Christ as the real Visitator moves between His churches. He comforts, admonishes and strengthens seven of His congregations. The congregations are eventually representative of all churches over all the centuries. Ethically, attention is paid to motive, aim (objective), mean (Word) and consequence. On the basis on which the Lord of the Old and the New Testament focuses upon when He visits His Church, as was understood by the Church throughout the centuries, it is ethical guidelines and a model for church visitation in the GKSA and its broader disposal.
