5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E

5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the stress on the {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E

50|$|Thomas Pelham's grandfather, John Pelham, had {{appointed}} Thomas Bowers to the Rectory at Burwash in 1693. The Pelham family {{seat was}} at Halland close to Burwash, {{and it is}} likely <b>that</b> Bowers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a frequent visitor. It is thought <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> tutored the young Thomas at this time.|$|R
5000|$|Critics contended <b>that</b> CHEERS <b>would</b> <b>have</b> paid {{families}} to expose {{their children to}} pesticides. EPA denies this, contending <b>that</b> because CHEERS <b>would</b> <b>have</b> only examined families who used pesticides prior to the study, CHEERS <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> increased the subject families' exposure to pesticides.|$|R
5|$|An {{advocate}} {{for small businesses}} and agricultural interests, Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded {{the powers of the}} Federal Trade Commission to regulate cigarette advertising.

5|$|As First Sea Lord, Battenberg was {{responsible}} to the First Lord for {{the readiness of}} the fleet and the preparation of naval strategy, {{as well as the}} development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> stifled British trade.|$|E

Ranulf kept the revenues <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone to the missing canons and used it to rebuild the church. Some medieval sources claim that in rebuilding the church at Twynham, he not only demolished the church he was replacing, but nine others that were nearby.|$|E
