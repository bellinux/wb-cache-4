5000|$|The Mirage also debuted Mitsubishi's Super Shift transmission, a four-speed manual with {{a second}} lever for [...] "low" [...] and [...] "high" [...] range; thus, {{effectively}} making the transmission an eight-speed unit. The Super Shift was not originally planned. However, Mitsubishi engineers had {{to make use of}} the existing Orion engine designed for rear-wheel drive applications making use of the longitudinal engine orientation. In the Mirage, sizing constraints as a result of the front-wheel drive layout required the engine to be mounted transversely, thus causing the carburetor to face forwards and run into icing issues. However, the primary implication of the Mirage's powertrain orientation—and the issue that demanded the unconventional transmission—was the mounting of the transmission beneath the engine. This required the gearbox to take power down from the clutch, an action not possible directly as this would have dictated that the gearbox rotate in the opposite direction to that required. To overcome this, the use of an extra [...] "idle" [...] transfer shaft was necessitated. It was subsequently realized that for a cost no more than developing a new five-speed transmission, this shaft could be modified as a separate two-speed gearbox controlled by a secondary shift lever mounted alongside the main lever inside the cabin. The ratios on this <b>transfer</b> <b>transmission</b> were, in effect, [...] "underdrives"—consequently marked on the second shift lever as a [...] "power" [...] mode due to increased performance granted by the lower gearing. In contrast, the higher overdrive setting was noted as [...] "economy". Mitsubishi called this a unique selling proposition.|$|E

In real life, {{everything}} is in movement so there are always continuous <b>transfers,</b> <b>transmissions</b> and transports of people, materials, information and energy to other places.

40|$|Background: Tetherin (BST- 2 /CD 317 /HM 1. 24) is an {{interferon}} (IFN) -inducible {{factor of}} the innate immune system, recently shown to exert antiviral activity against HIV- 1 and other enveloped viruses by tethering nascent viral particles {{to the cell}} surface, thereby inhibiting viral release. In HIV- 1 infection, the viral protein U (Vpu) counteracts this antiviral action by down-modulating tetherin from the cell surface. Viral dissemination between T-cells can occur via cell-free transmission or the more efficient direct cell-to-cell route through lipid raft-rich virological synapses, to which tetherin localizes. Results: We established a flow cytometry-based co-culture assay to distinguish viral <b>transfer</b> from viral <b>transmission</b> and investigated the influence of tetherin on cell-to-cell spread of HIV- 1. Sup-T 1 cells inducible for tetherin expression were {{used to examine the}} impact of effector and target cell tetherin expression on virus <b>transfer</b> and <b>transmission.</b> Using this assay, we showed that tetherin inhibits direct cell-to-cell virus <b>transfer</b> and <b>transmission.</b> Viral Vpu promoted viral transmission from tetherin-expressing cells by down-modulating tetherin from the effector cell surface.

The basic overlay structures we study are the K-Nearest Neighbours overlay topologies, connecting every overlay node to its K nearest peers. We introduce a family of optimizations, based on a pruning rule. As flooding is {{a key component of}} many route discovery mechanisms in MANETs, our performance study focusses on the delivery percentage, bandwidth consumption and time duration of flooding on the overlay. We also consider the overlay path stretch and the overlay nodes degree as respective indicators for the data <b>transfer</b> <b>transmission</b> time and overlay resilience. We finally recommend to optimize the K-Nearest Neighbours overlay topologies with the most selective pruning rule and, if necessary, to set a minimal bound on the overlay node degree for improving resilience. ...|$|E

The protocol does not require any information from the underlay routing protocol, nor cooperation from the nodes that do not belong to the overlay. Each overlay node maintains a set of nearest overlay nodes and exchanges its neighbourhood information with them in order to select useful overlay links. Resilience is afforded by setting a minimum number of overlay neighbours. The performance observed over OLSR are good, for all overlay densities and mobility level studied. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the resonant transfer of energy between filters with the viewpoint of applying this technique to communication systems. A summary of the existing filter designs for this application is made. This summary shows that a requirement common to all these filters is that the impulse response be zero at the sampling interval. It is further shown that this impulse response requirement in turn dictates that the resonant transfer filter have a 3 -dB loss at one-half the sampling frequency. A practical procedure for designing filters meeting this "impulse response zero" criterion is given. The major contribution of this paper is a design method for resonant transfer filters which allows the attenuation at half the sampling frequency to be much greater than 3 dB. The method makes use of the resonant <b>transfer</b> <b>transmission</b> function T(jw). The objective is to make IT(jw) I approximate unity in the desired passband and zero otherwise.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} elaborates {{on channel}} coding for reliable communication in passive RFID systems. RFID applications {{have been developed}} and used widely. Since a passive RFID tag has no power requirements, passive RFID has received considerable attention for application to sensor networks, access management, etc. A passive RFID system transfers energy together with information by means of inductive coupling. Coding schemes design for inductively coupled channels is the main task of this work. Due to the properties of inductive coupling, the communication over the inductively coupled channel has synchronization loss problems {{in addition to other}} classical channel errors. We therefore design codes that consider synchronization loss, energy <b>transfer,</b> <b>transmission</b> rate, and complexity of encoding and decoding. Because of the different properties of reader and tag, the coding schemes for a passive RFID system are designed differently for the two directions between a reader and a tag. In this dissertation, electronic circuits as infrastructure for the physical layer of the system are described. Modulation codes, error control codes and constrained codes, including their algebraic and structural properties, related algorithms, and techniques are addressed. Code combination and code power spectra are also considered as important issues in the code design that improve the ability of error detection and correction. </p...|$|E

Larvae were transferred from freshwater at 3  days post-hatch to 12. 5 and 20  ppt and were sampled at 24 - and 48 -h post-transfer. Scanning electron microscopy allowed quantification of MRCs, based on apical crypt appearance and surface area, resulting in a morphological classification of 'sub-types', that is, Type I or absorptive (surface area range 5. 2 - 19. 6  μm(2)), Type II or active absorptive form (surface area range 1. 1 - 15. 7  μm(2)), Type III or weakly functioning form (surface area range 0. 08 - 4. 6  μm(2)) and Type IV or active secreting form (surface area range 4. 1 - 11. 7  μm(2)). Mucus cell crypts were discriminated from those of MRCs based on the presence of globular extensions and quantified. Density and frequency of MRCs and mucus cells varied significantly according to the experimental salinity and time post-transfer; in freshwater-adapted larvae, all types were present except Type IV but, following transfer to elevated salinities, Type I and Type II disappeared and appeared to be replaced by Type IV crypts.
