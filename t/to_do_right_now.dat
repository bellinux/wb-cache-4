He has been seeking a way to use an orb to return to his dimension, and now needs to do this as soon a possible since he fears that other nobles no longer trust him. As Daniel nears the Inner Sanctum, he encounters Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, a man who had once studied the orbs with his student Johann Weyer and has since been kept alive and imprisoned by Alexander.

Agrippa also asks Daniel to take with him his head, which can be severed alive using a tonic invented by Weyer, and throw it into the inter-dimensional portal after Alexander opens it. Once Daniel enters the Inner Sanctum, there are three possible endings: he can let Alexander succeed, then be killed by the Shadow and descend into darkness, while Alexander tells him his sacrifice will be forever celebrated; he can prevent the portal from opening, then leave the castle content with his redemption after the Shadow kills only Alexander; or he can throw Agrippa's head into the portal, which leaves the Shadow to kill both Alexander and Daniel, though Agrippa promises to save Daniel from descending into darkness, calling upon Weyer to help him and stating that [...] "it will be alright".|$|E

40|$|The orbiter medium has a pod {{that can}} be ejected from the pad or from {{anywhere}} in flight. The essence of that ejectable pod and its capacity and its systems {{could also be used}} as a lifeboat, similar to the X- 38. The orbiter medium, when boosted by one booster, goes into low-Earth orbit. With two boosters and a tank, it can then rendezvous with things at the L- 1 port. The L- 1 port really comes from the habitable volumes that are put up. We would envision looking at a prototype during this period and actually launching one {{before the end of the}} year 2008 into the space station orbit of the International Space Station, where it could supplement what we think is a desirable thing... an orbiter on station. Owen Garriott, who flew on Skylab, has been pioneering the activity of long-duration orbiters that could be left at the Station and relieved on Station by another orbiter, thereby relieving the burden of having to rely on the lifeboat Soyuz and a half module, both of which have been sort of postponed now by NASA because of cost overruns. The booster large now is a fly-back booster for the Shuttle, and two of those go with the Shuttle system as it proceeds toward phase out. One large booster launches an orbiter large into low-Earth orbit for Space Shuttle transportation two into the future. With two boosters and a tank, it can then go to high orbits, which means it can intercept cycling space ships. Cycling space ships are a derivative of what we first put at the 51. 6 -degree inclination and then work close to the International Space Station, perhaps take the nose section of the tank and put it actually on the ISS as a larger half module than we plan <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>now...</b>|$|E

40|$|Astronomical telescopes {{operate in}} a dynamic and {{uncertain}} operational environment. Time is often oversubscribed with programs competing for available slots and the best observing conditions. In order to achieve a high scientific return a scheduler {{must be able to}} create a globally optimal observing schedule. In dynamic environments any offline or static schedule will become rapidly out-of- date, thus iterative repair based or dynamic despatch scheduling is the preferred option being able to respond quickly to such changes. Dynamic despatch suffers from myopism. Long term global aims are usurped in favor of local optimization, namely what is best <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Using data collected from external and embedded instrumentation I investigate and characterize the scheduler's operating environment and investigate tech- niques for short term prediction. I investigate metrics for characterizing the value of schedules both locally (at the decision point) and over longer horizons. Using this information an extensible software architecture is designed incorporating a simulation framework to allow a variety of schedulers to be implemented. Experiments are performed using the scheduler component architecture and simulation framework to determine the effects on schedule quality of environmental stability, disruptive events and reliability of prediction under a range of load conditions. Ultimately these show that where conditions are relatively stable there is an advantage to using longer look-ahead horizons but that where conditions are unstable or disruptive a basic despatch scheduler achieves results as good or better. A look-ahead scheduler with a horizon of 4 hours can give an improvement of upto 26 % over a simple despatch scheduler when seeing remains stable over a period of up to 6 hours. When the loading is high, further experiments show that look-ahead schedulers can achieve better quality than despatching. As load (measured by con- tention) is increased from 1 to 25 (a reasonable range), performance of a despatcher increases by upto 17 % while for a look-ahead scheduler with 4 hour horizon it can increase by upto 23 %. In the experiments the look-ahead scheduler has an advantage of between 10 % and 14 % over the despatcher over this range of loads. Under disruptive conditions (breaks in the normal execution of the schedule) due to weather or mechanical problems, it was found {{that a large number of}} small disruptions has a more negative effect on schedule quality than a few long events. The despatcher was unaffected by these disruptions while the look-ahead sched- uler under-performed by as much as 11 % relative to the despatcher and upto 22 % relative to its own performance under non-disruptive conditions which were typ- ically 14 % better than the despatcher. When new observations are being added to the pool during schedule execution it was found that a look-ahead scheduler could loose out on the potential gains of adding high quality observations if the lead-time for these observations was small compared to the scheduler's look-ahead horizon. Typically the highest gain occurs where the lead-time is of the order of the look-ahead horizon. The amount of gain also decreases for longer horizons. This loss can be up to 40 % for long (4 hour) horizon and as little as a few percent for a horizon of 30 minutes. For very short lead-time observations, the loss of potential reward can increases for longer horizons. For a 4 hour horizon as much as 80 % of the potential gain can be lost. Under such conditions, the addition of a sequestration mechanism by means of which newly arriving high quality urgent observations can be added into an executing schedule are shown to improve the performance of look-ahead schedulers by upto 8. 8 % with a look-ahead horizon of 4 hours but with little effect for shorter horizons. Further experiments have shown that when determining the length of look- ahead horizon, if we either over or under-estimate the duration of stable con- ditions we obtain poorer results. When the stability length is severely under- estimated a loss of between 5 % and 17 % in quality was found to occur. The optimum situation appears to be when the horizon is of order the stability length. Where the stability length is over-estimated by a factor 2, a loss of 5 % to 10 % can occur.

These are crops that were introduced {{here and have}} really taken off. But all over Africa, there are nutritionists, scientists and researchers {{who are trying to}} convince us to kick out the carrots, turn down the tomatoes and welcome back indigenous leafy vegetables onto our plates instead. In Kenya no one is more enthusiastic in this message than Judith Kimiywe from Kenyatta University. As Winnie Onyimbo found out when she met her, Dr. Kimiywe?s love of traditional but neglected crops began when she was a very small child. Track 4 In	?When did you discover? Out	? treatment of certain diseases. Duration	 6 ? 12 ? Suggested closing announcement: That was Dr Judith Kimiywe from Kenya explaining to Winnie Onyimbo how traditional leafy vegetables are slowly making their way into our farms, markets and eventually onto our plates. Contact details: Dr Judith Kimiywe Nutritionist, Kenyatta University Department of Foods, Nutrition and Dietetics, P. O Box 43844, Nairobi, Kenya Email: jokimiywe@yahoo. com Website: www. ku. ac. ke Transcript Onyimbo	When did you discover that traditional vegetables have special health benefits? Kimiywe	I have always known about the {{benefits of}} traditional vegetables right from my early childhood when I was exposed to them by my grandparents. And this is because I was a sickly child and we thought the only remedy was to eat certain vegetables which they associated with the healing of some of the elements that I was suffering from, like stomach aches, tonsils and even later in life, ulcers. My background as a nutritionist has actually triggered my interest in the traditional foods as the best source for availing the micronutrient deficiencies which have been with us for a long, long time, particularly of interest are foods that are rich in vitamin A or beta carotene, iron and iodine and zinc, which have featured prominently in our health programmes. Those {{are some of the things}} that also triggered my interest in promoting traditional foods which I know have got a high potential for those nutrients. Onyimbo	You talked of iodine and you talked of vitamins. How does this help in the body? Kimiywe	Well one of the key things about micronutrients is that they provide preventative measure against very many key health conditions that people may suffer from. Onyimbo	Give us two examples of out-of-fashion vegetables that are good for us to eat. Kimiywe	There is a whole wide range of traditional vegetables but the most common ones that are on the market now are easily available and accessible to people and acceptable for the majority of the people that have had exposure to indigenous vegetables, include vegetables like the spider weed or the sweet potato leaves, cassava leaves and a whole range of other vegetables that are picked from the wild. Onyimbo	I have a carrot and a tomato in my hands. What special benefits will I get from the traditional vegetables we have been talking about in comparison to the tomato and the carrot? Kimiywe	These ones do not contain the green colour, the green matter which the vegetables have which also carry with it other nutrients that are not necessarily in the carrot and the tomato. Because of the nature of their composition as green leafy vegetables, they are carrying other substances that are also important in contributing towards the health of the individual, in different ways. Green leafy vegetables will contain a higher level of minerals such as iron and calcium and zinc compared to the carrot and the tomato. Onyimbo	What is a proper way to cook the underutilised vegetables? I understand you can lose the nutrients by boiling them. How should someone cook them so that you don?t lose any nutrients? Kimiywe	We do not want prolonged cooking because too long a period of cooking beyond ten minutes usually interferes with the amount of available nutrients in that vegetable. And particularly if the vegetable is cooked in water and the water is thrown away. So what we are trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> is to come up with recipes, agreeable recipes based on the traditional recipes but a little bit modified in terms of retention of nutrients. The other thing we are building on is the indigenous knowledge of what people used to do with these vegetables. One of the things they used to do was to combine different types of vegetables. And that way they make a mixture of vegetables. Now it is a good thing to do because each vegetable has got its own strength as far as the nutrient content is concerned. The other good thing was that traditionally in some communities they add coconut milk to the vegetables, or they add pounded groundnut powder or sesame powder, and some communities they add avocado pear that is mashed into the vegetables and that helps to enhance the vegetables in two ways. These additives provide a fat medium which is very important for the absorption and utilisation of the vitamin A. Essential fatty acids from the oil-based product are very important for protecting the body, for growth, for the smooth skin, for good eyes and for children for growth generally. These fat mediums are also good carriers of vitamin E, which is a key anti-oxidant in the body. Onyimbo	In your opinion do you think these underutilised vegetables or neglected vegetables will be back in fashion? Back on our plates, back in our markets? Kimiywe	The promotion of these vegetables has created a very high demand, particularly in this area of going natural. Because of the very many diseases that have come up, cancer, is threatening right now, diabetes is another health condition that has made people look towards using natural foods. Things like TB, HIV/AIDS and many other illnesses, health conditions that have made people go back to use of traditional foods as a way of managing, controlling or preventing these illnesses. Thanks to the traditional medicine people, they are also emphasising the use of these foods when they are giving the remedies for treatment of certain diseases. End of track. Judith Kimiywe, a nutritionist from Kenyatta University, believes that traditional vegetables are an ideal solution for the micronutrient deficiencies that are a common cause of poor health. Leafy vegetables like spider weed, sweet potato and cassava leaves, and other food plants picked from the wild are high in vitamin A, iron, zinc and iodine. Mixing different types of vegetables helps to achieve a good balance of nutrients, which protect the body from many kinds of illness and can help to manage conditions such as diabetes, HIV and TB...|$|E

Steele said, [...] "I am someone who tries to approach whatever I do with my best effort, and I know my body. At this point in time, I don’t believe I will be 100 percent by the start of practice. This is something I’ve put a lot of thought and prayer into. I want to play my best and play an entire season and know I’ve done everything I can on the court to help Alabama win. The doctors have told me my future for playing is good, but <b>right</b> <b>now</b> the timing for me to heal and be back in shape like I need to be to play on the level we play isn’t on my side. My teammates are out on the floor conditioning every day, getting ready for the season, and I know how important that is, and <b>right</b> <b>now</b> I’m not able <b>to</b> run and <b>do</b> all the things that they are doing. So that’s why I’ve decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this. <b>Right</b> <b>now</b> my plan is still to graduate in December, start taking classes toward a second degree in January and then come back next fall and have a great senior season with my team." ...|$|R

So he cried out aloud against Sir Kay, saying: [...] "Thou tall man! that was very ill done of thee; for, certes, with or without armor thou shouldst have taken the quarrel of this lady upon thee. For {{my mother told me}} I should take upon me the defence of all such as needed defence, but she did not say that I was to wait for arms or armor to aid me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what was <b>right.</b> <b>Now,</b> therefore, though I know little of arms or of knighthood, I will take this quarrel upon myself and will do what I may to avenge this lady's affront, if I have her leave <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." ...|$|R

It was first broadcast on March 11, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central, and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom. It was the first episode of South Parks thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high-definition (HD). Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession, which they had been planning <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for some time. Stone argued they should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. An episode about the economy entitled [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was shown later in the season. By March 8, three days before the episode premiered, the script was only half-finished and the animation was not yet complete, in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last-minute deadlines; Stone said of the practice, [...] "We don't do a live show, but we kind of harness some of that energy. We kind of need that to work. We're, like, 'We have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" ...|$|R
500|$|Continuing their {{practice}} from previous seasons, Parker and Stone wrote and produced each episode within {{the week before}} its broadcast date, although as in previous seasons, only Parker was listed as writer in the end credits. The duo conceived a list of episode ideas {{at the start of}} the season, but said they preferred to wait until the last minute to start working. Deadline pressure, they explained, energized them as if they were doing a live show. Stone said of the practice, [...] "We kind of need that [...] to work. We're, like, 'We have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" [...] For example, three days before the broadcast of the season premiere, [...] "The Ring", the script was only half-finished and the animation was incomplete. Likewise, they did not start work on [...] "Whale Whores" [...] until five days before the episode aired, and the scripts for [...] "Margaritaville" [...] and [...] "Pee" [...] were both still being finished the day before the episodes were first broadcast. Parker and Stone said [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] was a particularly challenging episode to make—they were up all night working on it the day before it aired, and did not finish until 11a.m. on its broadcast date. Some critics have said that this short turnaround process helps South Park stay fresh and allows the show to address current events in a timely fashion.|$|R
