5|$|Baseball writer-scorers usually {{worked at}} the games played at the home stadium of the team which <b>they</b> <b>covered</b> for their newspaper. The writer-scorers were tasked with making {{objective}} decisions that could impact the statistics of the team they were writing about.

5|$|Frank McNamara made a bed {{of leaves}} for the {{survivor}} and built a fire to help keep him as warm and comfortable as possible. McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. <b>They</b> <b>covered</b> the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E
5|$|The tactics {{employed}} by the Anzac Mounted Division were to prove effective throughout the coming campaigns in the Sinai and in the Levant (also known {{at the time as}} Palestine). The key to the mounted rifles and light horse's approach was to quickly move onto tactical ground and then to effectively operate as infantry once dismounted. In defence, the artillery and machine guns wrought havoc on enemy attacks, and during the mounted advance, <b>they</b> <b>covered</b> and supported the British Empire mounted force.|$|E

5|$|Al-Kilabi led {{his army}} along the Jaxartes valley to Ferghana, and laid siege to it while devastating the {{surrounding}} countryside. At this point, the Umayyad army {{became aware that}} the Turgesh khagan Suluk was advancing against them with an army stronger than their own. Abandoning the siege, the Muslim army retreated so hastily towards the south that it was claimed <b>they</b> <b>covered</b> a distance in one day that equalled three days of normal travel. On the second day, after the Arabs crossed the river Wadi al-Subuh, the Turgesh army caught up with them, and attacked a secondary camp pitched by Abdallah ibn Abi Abdallah separately from the main Arab force. The Arabs and their Sogdian allies suffered heavy casualties—the brother of the ruler of Samarkand, Ghurak, being among the slain—but managed to repel the attack.|$|E

The bulk of the convoy reached Malta the next day before the escorts rejoined Force H. A week later she screened the capital ships of Force H as <b>they</b> <b>covered</b> another Malta convoy (Operation Style). Foxhound returned to the UK in August for a refit that lasted until November. The ship was briefly assigned to Escort Group EG.3 in the North Atlantic for convoy escort duties later that month until she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in late December.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, {{together}} with Akagi and Kaga of the First Carrier Division, the sisters supported {{the invasion of}} Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. Aircraft from all four carriers attacked the Australian base at Rabaul on 20 January; the First Carrier Division continued to attack the town while the Fifth Carrier Division moved westwards and attacked Lae and Salamaua in New Guinea. <b>They</b> <b>covered</b> the landings at Rabaul and Kavieng on 23 January before returning to Truk {{before the end of}} the month.

Over the next several months, Forester participated in Operation Halberd, another Malta convoy and escorted Ark Royal and Furious as they made several trips to fly off aircraft for Malta (Operations Status, Status II and Callboy). Upon her return to the UK on 26 October, the destroyer was briefly assigned to the 11th Escort Group before rejoining the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in November.

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia.

Aside from Slash, the band consisted of Teddy Andreadis, guitarist Bobby Schneck, bassist Johnny Griparic, saxophonist Dave McClarem and drummer Alvino Bennett. The band toured on and off until 1998, which included a headline slot at a jazz festival in Budapest. <b>They</b> <b>covered</b> various artists and bands such as B.B.

5|$|Soon, all {{the bodies}} except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those {{of the last}} three to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were some {{distance}} from the rest, where they had evidently attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding. There they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which <b>they</b> <b>covered</b> with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on April 7, 1882, then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of Chipp and his crew.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Mark Webber Pure Tasmania Challenge was {{launched}} at the 2007 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne when Webber {{was joined by}} sports stars and Kylie Minogue, and Hollywood star Anthony Edwards. The trek was another gruelling physical and mental adventure race about Tasmania in aid of charity but albeit with a new format. Teams competed for honours in two unique categories: the Van Diemen Cup– designed exclusively for corporate teams of four people, and the 2theXtreme Cup– a two-person elite team entry. Both categories trekked, kayaked and cycled alongside each other as <b>they</b> <b>covered</b> approximately 450km through World Heritage wilderness and along the idyllic coast of the Freycinet National Park. It was held from 17–23 November, {{and for the first}} time, one of Webber's fellow Formula One drivers, Heikki Kovalainen, joined him in the challenge.|$|E

The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where <b>they</b> <b>covered</b> d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.|$|E
