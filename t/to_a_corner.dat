5|$|In the end, Sounders FC {{was able}} to {{withstand}} D.C.'s late push for a 2–1 victory, becoming the second MLS expansion team in league history (Chicago Fire was the first) to win the U.S. Open Cup in their inaugural season. Players and coaches ran onto the field after the final whistle, {{jumped up and down}} together and hurried <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of the field to acknowledge the Sounders FC fans cheering in the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> kick to score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|M-48 {{currently}} {{starts at}} an interchange with I-75 in the Rudyard area. The highway runs west from the interchange into Rudyard where it turns south, running concurrently with county road H-63. M-48 turns eastward {{south of town}} along 22Mile Road through fields. At Meridian Road, M-48 turns south along M-129 through the community of Pickford. South of town, M-48/M-129 runs long the Chippewa–Mackinac county line and crosses the Munuscong River. M-48 turns east at 26Mile Road into Chippewa County. The highway zig-zags through rural areas in the southeast of the county. It follows Hanna and 28Mile roads to Stalwart. In that community, M-48 runs south on Reynolds Road <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> on the Chippewa–Mackinac county line where the highway turns back east toward the Goetzville area running through the Lake Superior State Forest. After one last north–south segment, M-48 terminates at a junction with M-134 west of DeTour Village near Albany Harbor.|$|E

5|$|Only wall {{clouds that}} rotate spawn tornadoes, and usually precede the tornado by five to thirty minutes. Rotating wall clouds {{may be a}} visual manifestation of a {{low-level}} mesocyclone. Barring a low-level boundary, tornadogenesis is highly unlikely unless a rear flank downdraft occurs, which is usually visibly evidenced by evaporation of cloud adjacent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of a wall cloud. A tornado often occurs as this happens or shortly after; first, a funnel cloud dips and in nearly all cases {{by the time it}} reaches halfway down, a surface swirl has already developed, signifying a tornado is on the ground before condensation connects the surface circulation to the storm. Tornadoes may also occur without wall clouds, under flanking lines, and on the leading edge. Spotters watch all areas of a storm, and the cloud base and surface.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{supporters}} {{have been involved}} in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters, and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990. Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial. In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter; half of the terms were suspended.|$|E
5|$|The sex scene {{involving}} Rourke and Bonet {{was filmed}} {{in one of}} the unused buildings located on Royal Street and took four hours to shoot. Parker limited the crew down to himself, cinematographer Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts and the camera assistant. To make the actors more comfortable, Parker played music during the shoot. Production then moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of New Orleans, which doubled for flashback sequences set in 1943 Times Square, New York. The crew then discovered an unused bus depot, which was used to film scenes set in Ethan Krusemark's gumbo hut. Filming then moved to the St. Alphonsus Church, where the crew filmed a dialogue scene between Angel and Cyphre. Production returned to Royal Street in the French Quarter, where the final confrontation between Angel and Cyphre, and the film's ending were shot.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E
5|$|Milan won the toss and Liverpool kicked off. Playing in a 4–2–3–1 formation, {{they had}} the first attack of the match, but Jermaine Pennant could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross-field pass. Milan responded with two low {{attempts}} on the Liverpool goal, but Jamie Carragher was able to clear them both. The second clearance led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> from which Milan failed to score. Liverpool had the first chance of the match in the ninth minute. A slip from Milan defender Marek Jankulovski allowed Pennant to run into space, he passed the ball to Dirk Kuyt who passed it back to him, Pennant's subsequent shot was saved by Milan goalkeeper Dida. Minutes later Gerrard won a header which found Pennant, however Gerrard was unable to make decent contact with the ball following Pennant's pass. Milan had their first shot of the match a few minutes later. Kaká received the ball outside the area and moved to his right before shooting, however Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina saved the shot. Liverpool continued to exert pressure leading Milan defender Massimo Oddo to mis-read a cross from Pennant, the ball reached Gerrard whose shot went over the goal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} third of the pitch a player with a long throw can put {{pressure}} onto the defenders by throwing the ball deep into the opponents' penalty area, resulting in somewhat similar tactics <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> kick situation, but with the added advantage of avoiding the offside trap, as an attacking player cannot be offside from a throw in. Players well known for their long throwing skills are Rory Delap, Giorgio Chiellini and Morten Gamst Pedersen.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} each store had the {{following}} departments: dairy, bacon and hams, poultry and game, cooked meats, and fresh meats. Groceries {{were introduced in}} 1903, when John James purchased a grocer's branch at 12 Kingsland High Street, Dalston. Home delivery featured in every store, as there were fewer cars in those days. Sites were carefully chosen, with a central position in a parade selected in preference <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> shop. This allowed a larger display of products, which could be kept cooler in summer, which was important as there was no refrigeration.|$|E
25|$|A solemn bronze {{statue of}} the saint by Russian {{sculptor}} Gregory Pototsky was donated by the Russian government in 2000, and was given a prominent place in the square fronting the medieval Church of St. Nicholas. In 2005, mayor Süleyman Topçu had the statue replaced by a red-suited plastic Santa Claus statue, because he wanted an image more recognisable to foreign visitors. Protests from the Russian government against this were successful, and the bronze statue was returned (albeit without its original high pedestal) <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> nearer the church.|$|E

25|$|Clearing is {{when the}} player in {{possession}} of the ball is pressed hard, often near his own goal, and chooses to shoot the ball away with low precision simply {{in order to get}} out of a dangerous situation. When opponent pressure is extremely high, the ball is often cleared <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> kick or to a throw-in. Clearing long, but into opponent control, may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise, including setting up the correct formation and pressure height. If the attack was high up the field, such as in or near the penalty area, defenders will thus quickly push out, and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in the next move. Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball. Players high up in the field who are pressed hard, and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack, may in some instances combine clearing with a shot.|$|E
500|$|Keenor won {{the coin}} toss for Cardiff City, and so Ferguson {{kicked off the}} match. Shortly {{afterwards}} Arsenal won a free kick and the ball went into Cardiff's penalty area {{for the first time}} but Tom Watson cleared it for Cardiff. Irving went on a run {{on the right side of}} the pitch, but Arsenal defender Andy Kennedy stopped the play. Arsenal went on the attack again, with Sloan dodging several tackles but a pass to Hoar caused the chance to break down as he had moved offside. A direct free kick was given to Arsenal shortly afterwards, but the shot by Parker from [...] was saved by Farquharson for Cardiff. Combined play by Hulme and Buchan led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> which then forced another three in a rapid succession. However, Arsenal couldn't capitalise on the opportunities and the final corner ended in the ball being shot a distance over the bar. The first half ended, Arsenal having dominated but the Cardiff City defence had stopped them each time. There was an incident in the crowd during the first half, at the 25th minute around 400 spectators outside the stadium rushed a gate being manned by four policemen. Reinforcements arrived and managed to push the crowd back when they reached the turnstiles.|$|E

500|$|... "She Wolf" [...] {{was written}} by Shakira, John Hill, and Sam Endicott. Shakira and Hill also served as the {{producers}} of the song. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shakira said that the idea for [...] "She Wolf" [...] came to her [...] "very mysteriously", revealing [...] "I was in the studio {{in a bad mood}} that day, then I got inspired and went <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> and I wrote the lyrics and the melody in 10 minutes. The image of the she wolf just came to my head, and when I least expected it I was howling and panting". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, explained how he and Hill began working with Shakira, saying she [...] "contacted him (Hill), asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". [...] "She Wolf" [...] was described by Slant Magazine as a [...] "sleek, hi-NRG/Italo throwback that's drenched in disco strings". Mikael Wood from Spin identified the song's genre as synthpop. Shakira also howls and pants at various times during the song. It is written in B minor key and is a moderate dance groove with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Shakira's vocal range on the song spans from B3 to D5. One of the lines of the song, in which Shakira sings [...] "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee machine in an office", is often cited {{as an example of the}} unusual lyrics present in Shakira's songs.|$|E
