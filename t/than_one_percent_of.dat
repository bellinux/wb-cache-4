Fewer <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Soviet Jews murdered in the Holocaust were killed in Auschwitz, as German forces had already been driven from Russia when the killing at Auschwitz reached its peak in 1944.

5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} 35 million Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians respectively. In 2011, nearly 6.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some {{of the most common}} non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Canadians (just over 250,000 individuals) can speak an indigenous language. About half this number (129,865) reported using an indigenous language on a daily basis. Additionally, Canadians speak several sign languages; the number of speakers is unknown of the most spoken ones, American Sign Language (ASL) and Quebec Sign Language (LSQ), as it is of Maritime Sign Language and Plains Sign Talk. There are only 47 speakers of the Inuit sign language Inuiuuk.|$|E

The Omak area has a relatively high percentage of people of American Indian and Mexican ancestries; there were over 80 American Indians and over 535 Mexican immigrants, with a combined percentage of 28 percent of residents. Conversely, the city has a small Asian population, making up less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Omakians.

5|$|In 1880, {{the party}} {{nominated}} Thompson for vice president, joining a ticket headed by Neal Dow of Portland, Maine, {{the author of}} one of the nation's first municipal prohibition laws. Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention, and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the evils of alcohol. The Prohibitionists increased their vote total in the election that year, but still received just over 10,000 votes out of more than nine million cast. Thompson made another bid for elected office in 1887, when the Prohibition Party nominated him for Governor of Ohio. He was again unsuccessful, netting less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the vote and finishing in a distant fifth place behind the winner, Democrat Richard M. Bishop. Thompson's vote total was also surpassed by the Republican candidate, William H. West, and the candidates of two other minor parties, the Workingman Party and the Greenback Party.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{only about}} 4% of {{patients}} with photosensitive disorders are reported to {{have been diagnosed with}} solar urticaria. Internationally, the number is slightly larger at 5.3%.

Globably 3.1 per 100,000 people are affected and females are more likely to be affected than males.

Solar urticaria accounts for less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the many documented urticaria cases. To put that into a better perspective, since its first documented case in Japan in 1916, over one hundred other instances of the disease have been reported.|$|E

5|$|As of {{the late}} 2000s, The Washington Post wrote that the museum {{struggled}} with low attendance, modest budget, concealed location, and leadership turnovers. Thirty years after joining the Smithsonian, the museum {{remains one of the}} smallest museums in the complex, with 213,000 visitors in 2016about half of the 2009 count and less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the 28 million annual Smithsonian visitors. This is due, in part, to its location, which is hidden from the National Mall by the original Smithsonian Institution Building, known as the Castle. Visitor numbers have fluctuated between 200,000 and 400,000 since the 2000s, and in the mid-2000s were comparable with its underground neighbor museum, the Sackler Gallery. The museum's annual budget has fluctuated from $4.3 million (late 1990s) to $6 million (mid-2000s), and was $5 million in 2016. By comparison, the museum had a 34-person staff in 2016, down from 48 in the late 1990s. Like many other museums in the 2000s, the institute has sought private funding and endowments. It trailed behind other Smithsonian entities in fundraising campaigns, into which the museum was expected to pay about $2.1 million. In late 2016, the museum held its first annual African Arts Awards Dinner for over 500 guests.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although less <b>than</b> <b>one</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> {{the population is}} now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains {{a major part of}} the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E
