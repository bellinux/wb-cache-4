5|$|As planned, Mayweather boards Horizon and {{receives}} {{a warm welcome}} {{from most of the}} crew, including his mother Rianna.

Mayweather offers to make a few repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, but Paul tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out of place. Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a homing device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then recommends a boost in the ship's fighting capability, but Paul insists that the safest course is to flee <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{usually have}} highly {{eccentric}} elliptical orbits, {{and they have}} a wide range of orbital periods, ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. Short-period comets originate in the Kuiper belt or its associated scattered disc, which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud, a spherical cloud of icy bodies extending from outside the Kuiper belt to halfway <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> star. Long-period comets are set in motion towards the Sun from the Oort cloud by gravitational perturbations caused by passing stars and the galactic tide. Hyperbolic comets may pass once through the inner Solar System before being flung to interstellar space. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition.|$|E

5|$|In addition, at {{some time}} between {{the date of the}} writ of {{election}} and 12:00 noon on nomination day, the potential candidate or someone on his or her behalf must hand to the returning officer a deposit amounting to three times of 8% of the total allowances payable to an MP in the preceding calendar year, rounded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> $500. At the 2017 presidential election, the deposit was $43,500. The deposit is returned if the person is not nominated as a candidate, withdraws his or her candidature, or is eventually elected.

5|$|In his 1918 {{revision}} of North American Oryzomys, Goldman considered O.nelsoni {{to be most}} closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> mainland subspecies of O.couesi, O.couesi mexicanus. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O.nelsoni is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although O.nelsoni likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived from a common ancestor with O.albiventer.|$|E
