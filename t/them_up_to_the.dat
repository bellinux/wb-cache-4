5|$|The Egyptians {{attempted}} to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the entire day. Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting, the Egyptians relinquished {{control of the}} routes to the canal, opening <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Israelis. The battle is remembered {{as one of the}} most costly and brutal battles of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Outsider (Billy Lush) {{offers to}} help Corvo in his quest. Described as {{a mixture of}} God and the Devil, The Outsider {{imprints}} his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities, and provides him with a mechanically altered human heart (April Stewart) that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his mark, and special abilities, to other characters. Smith described the character as an amoral figure who grants abilities, but leaves the choice of how to use <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recipient.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín kept a {{regulation}} from the dictatorship {{that allowed him}} to regulate the level of wages. He authorized wage increases every three months, to keep <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inflation rate. The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that wages be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher wages in response to it. The unions got the support of the non-unionized retirees, the church and left-wing factions. Popular support for the government allowed it to endure in spite of opposition from the unions.|$|E

5|$|The allies invaded Paraguay in April 1866, {{but after}} initial success, their advance {{was blocked by}} fortifications at Humaitá and along the Paraguay River. Porto Alegre had {{remained}} behind, leading the 2nd Corps and guarding Rio Grande do Sul. Mitre, no longer on Brazilian territory and acknowledged as the allied commander-in-chief, planned to use Porto Alegre's army to march through Paraguayan territory from the rear to surround Humaitá. As {{a result of a}} suggestion by Tamandaré—though Mitre had not issued orders for the move—Porto Alegre boarded his army onto Brazilian ships and instead brought <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> positions occupied by the other allied troops.|$|E
5|$|Then {{the autumn}} of 1646, Wiśniowiecki invaded and took over the starostwo kaniowskie vacated {{recently}} by banished Samuel Łaszcz. He did so without any legal justifications, which caused a court ruling against him; a ruling that was however never enforced. Later that year, he raised a large private army of about 25,000 for a purpose unknown, as noted by Widacki, who writes that the army, which Jeremi raised with an immense cost for a short time, {{did not participate in}} any engagement, nor did it have any clear purpose. He notes that such an army might have been useful in provoking the Ottomans, but as Jeremi was opposed to the war with <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point of refusing the hetman office, his actions are puzzling even for the modern historians.|$|E

25|$|The orca, wolf, raven, spider, whale, were revered animals. Also {{folklore}} (e.g. tale) examples demonstrate this. For example, {{a spider}} saves {{the life of}} a girl.

25|$|After World War I, {{in which}} Brazil was {{an ally of}} the United States, Great Britain, and France, the country {{realized}} it needed a more capable army but didn't have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for World War II.|$|E

25|$|Since 1992 the {{university}} has run a widening access programme, originally called the Centre for Lifelong Learning. Now called the Foundation Centre, it delivers courses at both Durham City and Queens campus, Stockton on Tees.

The Centre runs a range of courses which cover specific academic disciplines and key skills. For the 2013–14 admissions cycle, 153 students took up offers of places in the programme.|$|E

His foremost achievements included that of bringing the Maldives to the United Nations even with the opposition of some nations that felt awkward at including a nation of such a small size. He laid the foundations of the nation by modernising the fisheries industry with mechanized vessels and starting the tourism industry. Even today the nation is dependent on these two industries as a primary source of income and the main driver of the economy.|$|E

25|$|Suffering badly from malaria {{and other}} {{tropical}} diseases, {{the men were}} mainly used to provide work parties instead of undertaking the training that they would require for the fighting that would come. In June, the 53rd was attached to Maroubra Force and the following month it was split up, with two companies—'B' and 'C'—being sent to the area around Kokoda to reinforce the 39th Battalion, while {{the remainder of the}} battalion remained around Port Moresby in preparation to move up the Kokoda Track. That month the battalion received eight officer reinforcements from experienced 2nd AIF units. On 10 August, the 53rd Battalion was ordered to relieve the 39th, which was at the time positioned around Uberi. The two detached companies moved into position and upon their arrival they finally received a number of Bren guns and had a small amount of training with them, but it was not enough to bring <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard required for combat against the battle-hardened Japanese soldiers that they were about to come up against.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} after the Second World War, the British {{produced}} the No. 4 Mk 2 (Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals for official designations in 1944) rifle, a refined and improved No. 4 rifle with the trigger hung forward from the butt collar and not from the trigger guard, beech wood stocks (with the original reinforcing strap and centre piece of wood {{in the rear of}} the forestock on the No.4 Mk I/Mk I* being removed in favour of a tie screw and nut) and brass buttplates (during World War II, the British replaced the brass buttplates on the No.4 rifles with zinc alloy (Zamak) ones to reduce costs and to speed up rifle production). With the introduction of the No. 4 Mk 2 rifle, the British refurbished many of their existing stocks of No. 4 rifles and brought <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same standard as the No. 4 Mk 2. No. 4 Mk 1 rifles so upgraded were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/2, whilst No. 4 Mk I* rifles that were brought up to Mk 2 standard were re-designated No. 4 Mk I/3.|$|E

500|$|After the Reformation the Humanist {{concern with}} {{education}} {{became part of}} a programme of godly education, with an attempt {{to establish a system}} of parish schools administered by the Church of Scotland (the [...] "Kirk"). A new university was established in Edinburgh and the existing universities underwent a series of reforms associated with Andrew Melville that revitalised them and brought <b>them</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standards of Humanist scholarship and methods of teaching of institutions elsewhere. In the seventeenth century there were attempts to organise and finance the system of parish schools and a successful expansion of the university system. By the early eighteenth century the network of parish schools was reasonably complete in the Lowlands, but limited in the Highlands where it was supplemented by Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Scotland began to reap the benefits of its university system, with major early figures of the Enlightenment including Francis Hutcheson, Colin Maclaurin and David Hume.|$|E
