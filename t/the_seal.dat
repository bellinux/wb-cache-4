5|$|The process upon being branded is {{a painful}} {{experience}} for the person as the body would either accept <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> or reject it. Once one's body accepts <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> they can assume its First Level where <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> spreads from its point of application across the user's body, increasing their chakra supply and their physical abilities in the process. When <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> is deactivated, the user is left exhausted, having expended all their energy during its use. The Second Level of the Cursed Seal is achieved by allowing <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> to engulf the users entire body, ultimately causing the person to transform into a personalized parody of Sage Mode with various strengths and weakness. The means to achieve the Second Level is by being given a drug and entering a state of lifelessness.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> and namely to discover if the sun in <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Nowe {{becoming}} a fully-fledged Knight of <b>the</b> <b>Seal.</b> During his first mission, Nowe begins {{to doubt the}} ethics of the Knights' methods, as the seals require human sacrifices to remain strong. During a second mission to ensure the protection of <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> in the District of Soul Flame, Nowe encounters Manah, who kills the guardian Zhangpo and destroys <b>the</b> <b>seal.</b> Manah is sentenced to be burnt at the stake, but uses her magic to escape. After returning from the mission, Nowe is poisoned by Gismor, who reveals to have killed Nowe's adoptive father Oror. Surviving and escaping with Legna, Nowe is pursued by the Knights, including Eris, who wishes {{to persuade him to}} return. Nowe and Legna eventually meet up with Manah and join her on her quest to destroy the seals and, in her mind, free the people from the Knights' oppression. On their way to the second seal, Manah shows Nowe the true horror of the Knights' oppression, fully winning him over. The two then fight and kill Lieutenant Hanch, destroying <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> in the District of Hallowed Water. After this, they are joined by Urick, a former Lieutenant of the Knights, to rout a group of bandits. Attacked by the Knights, they are unexpectedly saved by Caim, who is also working to destroy the seals and free his dragon Angelus from the pain of being the Goddess Seal. After taking down Lieutenant Yaha and destroying <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> in the District of Precious Light, Manah is captured by the Knights and sentenced to death.

The order suffers heavy losses in the attempt, and in desperation the priest Bartholomew uses a ritual to bind Jeremy to the vampire Alysa.

5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
