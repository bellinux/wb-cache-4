5|$|Following Syria's independence, the National Bloc was {{dissolved}} {{and replaced}} by the National Party. Quwatli's leadership, while supported by older politicians like Asali, Jabiri and Haffar, became increasingly challenged by emerging leaders such as Nazim al-Qudsi of the People's Party and Akram al-Hawrani of the Arab Socialist Party as well as <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party, the Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian Communist Party (SCP). Antagonistic relations between Quwatli and the Hashemite kings of Iraq and Jordan, Abdullah I and Faisal II, respectively, increased with the latter two seeking to unite Syria, Iraq and Jordan under Hashemite monarchical rule, and Quwatli countering that Iraq and Jordan join a republican Syria under his leadership instead. The Hashemites found support in the People's Party, which became an influential force in Aleppo, a major city and economic hub of Syria, particularly after the 1947 death of Jabiri, Quwatli's Aleppo-based ally.|$|E

Their numbers continued to plummet after the American invasion, and they occupy 4% of municipal offices, a percentage thought to be representative of their numbers in the city. They number around 2,000.|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} {{put him at}} {{odds with}} the country's new democratic government led by Nazim al-Kudsi, and he was a political outcast during those years from 1961 to 1963, when a new coup in March of that year brought to power a more nationalist and unionist wing of <b>the</b> <b>Baath.</b> Jamal's own cousin, the future president Nureddin al-Atassi became Minister of the Interior, and Jamal became Minister of Information in the cabinet of Prime Minister Salah al-Din al-Bitar, {{one of the founders of}} <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> party. He was also voted into the party's Revolutionary Command Council. A mere four months later Atassi resigned after coming to the realization that restoration of the UAR was not a party priority. He then formed his own party, the Arab Socialist Union, an umbrella group of dedicated unionists who wanted to restore the UAR and reappoint Nasser as president of Syria.|$|E

It was first the regional branch of <b>the</b> original <b>Baath</b> Party (1947-1966) before it changed its allegiance to <b>the</b> Syrian-dominated <b>Baath</b> movement (1966-present) following the 1966 split within <b>the</b> original <b>Baath</b> Party. <b>The</b> party has ruled Syria continuously since the 1963 Syrian coup détat which brought the Baathists to power.|$|R

25|$|Following the 1966 coup d'état, Salah Jadid {{became the}} undisputed strongman of the country. He began his rule by re-organizing all the {{intelligence}} agencies under the central command of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party's National Security Bureau. Jadid appointed al-Jundi, his ally, to head the security bureau, which {{became known as the}} most intimidating apparatus in the country. The bureau, under al-Jundi, acquired a notorious reputation in the country for its brutal methods in rooting out opponents, including arbitrary arrests, torture and infiltrating society with state informers.|$|E
25|$|The 1950s {{also saw}} Syria and Egypt attempt to unify as the United Arab Republic, {{and this was}} {{reflected}} in the Syrian Air Force with growth in personnel and aircraft. The union did not last. With the ascent to power of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party and Hafez Al-Assad, himself a former SAF Commander-in-chief, Syria began looking {{to the members of the}} Warsaw Pact for help and built closer ties with the USSR. This in turn led to a huge influx of Eastern-made equipment to the Syrian Armed Forces, including the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|Al-Jundi, {{like many}} members of his family, joined the Ba'ath Party early in his youth. In 1960 al-Jundi, then a captain in {{the army of the}} United Arab Republic (UAR), became a {{founding}} member of the secretive Military Committee of <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party. In the beginning, the Military Committee's goal was to rebuild the Ba'ath Party, which had been dissolved on the orders of Gamal Abdel Nasser when the UAR was founded, and establish a new party leadership. Following the Syrian secessionist coup of 1961 that ended the UAR, the Military Committee started planning its own coup against the secessionist government.|$|E

50|$|In 1968 {{the second}} Ba'ath Coup was successful, and an {{agreement}} called the Bazzaz Declaration was reached between the KDP and the Ba'ath. Although Ba'ath Party founder Michel Aflaq called for {{equal rights for}} all ethnic and religious minorities under Arab rule, in practice the new regime ultimately became more chauvinist than any before. The Arab nationalists had not forgotten the atrocities they suffered {{at the hands of}} the Mulla Mustafa and the Barzanis in 1959. Ironically, one of <b>the</b> <b>Baath's</b> leading advocates of a more considered and amenable approach to the Kurdish question in these early days was Saddam Hussein. Ahmad and Talabani also welcomed the new Ba'ath regime, as they felt more at home with its socialist ethos than any previous Baghdad government.|$|R
25|$|The Iraqi Islamic Party {{was formed}} in 1960 as the Iraqi branch of the Brotherhood, but was banned from 1961 during the {{nationalist}} rule of Abd al-Karim Qasim. As government repression hardened under <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party from February 1963, the group was forced to continue underground. After {{the fall of the}} Saddam Hussein government in 2003, the Islamic Party has reemerged as one of the main advocates of the country's Sunni community. The Islamic Party has been sharply critical of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, but still participates in the political process nevertheless. Its leader is Iraqi Vice-President Tariq Al-Hashimi.|$|E
25|$|Barzani {{agreed to}} the ceasefire and fired the {{radicals}} from the party. Following the unexpected death of Arif, whereupon he was replaced by his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, the Iraqi government launched a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kurds. This campaign failed in May 1966, when Barzani forces thoroughly defeated the Iraqi Army at the Battle of Mount Handrin, near Rawandiz. At this battle, {{it was said that}} the Kurds slaughtered an entire brigade. Recognizing the futility of continuing this campaign, Rahamn Arif announced a 12-point peace program in June 1966, which was not implemented due to the overthrow of Rahman Arif in a 1968 coup by <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, the Iraqi {{ministry}} of information appointed Bashir to its culture committee; {{the regime of}} <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> party was not well established {{at that time and}} made Bashir to a cultural figure of integration of the Christian minority. Also because of his international popularity, Bashir, who rather presented himself apolitical, seemed to be a suited personality for representing the different ethnic, religious, and political groups of his home country. In 1981 – Saddam Hussein was already in power and the actual forces passing over to the Sunnites – the regime also supports the formation of Bashir's Iraqi Traditional Music Group that dedicates itself to the diversity of the Iraqi culture.|$|E

5000|$|JRTN {{is linked}} to <b>the</b> [...] "New <b>Baath</b> Party" [...] led by Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, an {{adherent}} of the Naqshband Order. Many members of both <b>the</b> New <b>Baath</b> Party and <b>the</b> JRTN are former officials and soldiers who served under Saddam Hussein. US military officers contend that many JRTN members {{are believed to be}} former Iraqi military officers, due in part to JRTN statements often being infused with military terminology as well as their vetting procedures of new recruits involving putting new members in a 90-day trial period in which they are required to carry out low-level attacks, endure physical abuse, and background checks to ensure they are not affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq.|$|R
500|$|While the Syrian {{constitution}} liberally grants free speech, a {{state of}} emergency in effect since <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party seized power suspends this freedom. Syria has stringently approached dissidents who question its policies in neighboring Lebanon; Syrian authorities detained and imprisoned ten activists who signed the Beirut-Damascus Declaration petition in May 2006. The petition, of which al-Mir was a signatory, advocated the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the normalization of relations between the two countries.|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of the Tabqa Dam, Syria built two more dams in the Euphrates, both of which were functionally related to the Tabqa Dam. <b>The</b> <b>Baath</b> Dam, located [...] downstream from the Tabqa Dam, was completed in 1986 and functions as a floodwater control to manage the irregular output of the Tabqa Dam and as a hydroelectric power station. The Tishrin Dam, which functions primarily as a hydroelectric power station, has been constructed [...] south from the Syro–Turkish border and filling of the reservoir started in 1999. Its construction was partly motivated by the disappointing performance of the Tabqa Dam. The implementation of a fourth dam between Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor – the Halabiye Dam – was planned in 2009 and an appeal to archaeologists was released to excavate sites that will be flooded by the new reservoir.|$|E
2500|$|The {{full name}} of the {{government}} is the [...] "Kurdistan Regional Government", abbreviated [...] "KRG".

2500|$|Similarly, it {{has been}} implied that Interim Iraqi Prime Minister Dr. Ayad Allawi {{violated}} his obligation to medical ethics whilst serving as Western European chief of secret police for the Baathist government of Saddam Hussein.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the 1977 census, Assyrians were being {{incorrectly}} referred to as either Arabs or Kurds. Assyrian Christians were forced to deny their identity as Assyrian nationalism was harshly punished.

2500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Baath</b> Party {{took control}} in 1968 and {{especially}} after Saddam Hussein seized power in 1979, youth groups were retooled {{to serve the}} state.
