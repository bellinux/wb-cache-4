5|$|On {{the night}} of Tommy's fight with Kane, Tommy and Marty plan to force Kane to exhaust himself {{pursuing}} Tommy until the seventh round and then put him away. The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take everyone out for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out.</b> Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} a {{planetary}} system {{adjacent to the}} giant planets will be influenced in a different way. In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that {{a huge number of}} small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> without the help of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4AU from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|With Ujung Kulon as {{the last}} resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an {{advantage}} over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, because any catastrophic diseases or tsunamis could wipe <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. The banteng cattle also compete with the rhinos for food, so the authorities were considering plans to fence off {{the western part of}} the park to keep the livestock out.|$|E

25|$|Walcott scored 220 {{out of a}} first-innings {{total of}} 383. England then batted painfully slowly, taking 150 overs to make 181 runs. Stollmeyer again did not enforce the follow-on: Holt made a maiden Test century, 166 {{out of a total}} of 292 for two declared. Needing 495 to win, England reached 258 for three before another {{collapse}} left <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 313.|$|E
25|$|De Kock {{represented}} South Africa for {{the first}} time, at T20 level, on 21 December 2012 against New Zealand. While South Africa crushed New Zealand and got <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for only 86, the hosts chased it down easily with 8 wickets still remaining. De Kock made an impression on his first appearance by scoring an unbeaten 28 off 23 while chasing. He also kept wicket and gloved two catches.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand won the toss, electing to bat, resting Daniel Vettori, Jamie How and Michael Mason who all {{played in}} the first ODI, as they had already won the series. New Zealand were in trouble early, with Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle both being {{dismissed}} before the side reached double figures. Despite 90 from Scott Styris, New Zealand failure at creating partnerships left <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> on 233. Dwayne Smith picked up 5-45.|$|E

25|$|Glamorgan Dragons broke their {{streak of}} four {{successive}} losses with a comfortable victory at Sophia Gardins. The two brothers David Harrison and Adam Harrison took two wickets each for Glamorgan, as Gloucestershire Gladiators crumbled to 57 for 7. Jon Lewis and Mark Alleyne shared a 68-run stand, but a quick burst of wickets from Robert Croft and Andrew Davies had <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 128 at Sophia Gardens. Croft and Matthew Elliott both made fifties as Glamorgan Dragons knocked off the runs with ten wickets and 7.3 overs to spare, helped by five no-balls and four wides from the Gloucestershire bowlers.|$|E
25|$|Australia won {{the first}} Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by 122 runs within 4 days. Australia scored 333 in their first innings with debutant Ed Cowan top scoring on 68. In reply India {{collapsed}} from 3/214 to 282 all out with Ben Hilfenhaus taking 5 wickets on his return to Test Cricket from injury. Australia then recovered from their own collapse to 4/27 with Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey building a partnership of 115 in Australia's 2nd innings total of 240. India was set a target of 292, but regular wickets to the Australian pacemen saw <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 169. Man of the Match was awarded to James Pattinson with figures of 18*, 2/55, and 4/53. He also made 37*.|$|E
25|$|The Scots {{went into}} this tournament as favourites, being holders of the Intercontinental Cup and the ICC Trophy. However, rain in Utrecht {{prevented}} them from a good start against the Dutch, who bowled well enough to have <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 217 on the first day. Ian Stanger hit his second first-class fifty and Ryan Watson 46, but South African-born Ryan ten Doeschate took three important, albeit expensive, wickets and medium-pacer Edgar Schiferli finished with four for 46. In reply, Maurits van Nierop lashed out, taking 24 off the Scottish bowlers as the Dutch made 31 for 0 to see them to stumps on day 1. Play was impossible on the next two days, and the Scots now needed to thump Ireland in Aberdeen {{if they were to}} have any hope of qualifying for the semi-finals.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon {{receiving}} his degree, Moscati {{joined the}} staff of the Ospedale degli Incurabili, eventually becoming an administrator. During this time he continued to study, conducting medical research when not performing his duties at the hospital. Already recognized for his commitment to his duties, he won further recognition for his actions {{in the aftermath of the}} eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 8 April 1906. One of the hospitals for which Moscati was responsible, at Torre del Greco, was located a few miles from the volcano's crater. Many of its patients were elderly, and many were paralytics as well. Moscati oversaw the evacuation of the building, getting <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> just before the roof collapsed due to the ash. He sent a letter to the general director of the Neapolitan hospital service, insisting on thanking those who had helped in the evacuation, yet not mentioning his own name.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire {{closed the}} gap to the {{promotion}} spots from 6.5 to 1.5 points after a three-wicket win at New Road over Worcestershire. Matthew Hoggard got a good return to form after being smashed out of the Twenty20 format with an economy rate of 11, taking three for 68 in Worcestershire's first innings, yet the hosts made 345 before being bowled out shortly before stumps on day 1. Richard Pyrah, playing his first first-class game of the season, and Craig White then rescued Yorkshire from 113 for 4 with fifties, but Nadeem Malik and Kabir Ali finished with three wickets each to get <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> for 300, trailing by 45. Then, Tim Bresnan took two early wickets before stumps, and continued on day three to end with career-best figures of five for 42. However, another England prospect, Kabir Ali, took four more wickets, as Yorkshire were 222 for 6 overnight - needing 46 runs to win. They lost wicket-keeper Ismail Dawood early, but were not pegged back further, and Richard Dawson made 51 not out to lead them to the target. Worcestershire were also docked two points for a slow over rate.|$|E

500|$|About 1860, Holmes {{invented the}} [...] "American stereoscope", a 19th-century {{entertainment}} in which pictures were viewed in 3-D. He later wrote {{an explanation for}} its popularity, stating: [...] "There was not any wholly new principle involved in its construction, but, it proved so much more convenient than any hand-instrument in use, that it gradually drove <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>out</b> of the field, in great measure, {{at least so far}} as the Boston market was concerned." [...] Rather than patenting the hand stereopticon and profiting from its success, Holmes gave the idea away.|$|E

Schaffner added: [...] "True, the critics had been unfair, even vicious.

Abigail, the eldest daughter of Sarah's aunt, Elizabeth Hill (Jennings), was working as a servant to Sir John Rivers of Kent when Sarah first learned of her existence. As Sarah's grandfather Sir John Jennings had had twenty-two children, she had a multitude of cousins and could not know <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> <b>Out</b> of kindness and a sense of family solidarity, [...] she gave Abigail employment within her own household at St Albans, and after a tenure of satisfactory service, Abigail was made a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Anne in 1704.
