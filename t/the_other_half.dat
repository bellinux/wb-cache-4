5|$|The predation-avoidance {{behavior}} of sleeping {{with one eye}} open, allowing one brain hemisphere to remain aware while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> sleeps, was first demonstrated in mallards, although it {{is believed to be}} widespread among birds in general.|$|E
5|$|They do not {{generally}} sleep at the surface, {{but they must}} continue to breathe. Possibly only half of their brain sleeps at one time, with one half managing the surface-blow-dive process without awakening <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half.</b>|$|E

On July 8, 2006, the $30billion state budget, with the sales tax agreement, passed both houses and Governor Corzine signed the budget into law ending the budget impasse.|$|E
5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, {{its position in the}} array is returned. If the target value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> from consideration.|$|E
5|$|Half of {{the sermon}} {{is used to}} criticise the Whigs and their {{political}} activities. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> is devoted to condemning Tories who betray other Tories as criminals, to gain favour with the Whigs. The Whigs are characterised as the persecutors of the early Christians, and betraying Tories are characterised as apostates.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, Oberstreit {{was divided}} between two lordships, {{and this is}} {{reflected}} in the coat of arms. The “countercompony” pattern (two chequered rows) on the dexter (armsbearer’s right, viewer’s left) side are a reference to (half) the village’s former allegiance to the Counts of Sponheim, while the charge on the sinister (armsbearer’s left, viewer’s right) side, the fish, is a reference to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half’s</b> former allegiance to the Counts of Salm, Salm being a German word for “salmon”.|$|R

5|$|The {{energy sector}} is {{represented}} by the Kola Nuclear Power Plant near Polyarnye Zori, which produces about half of all energy, and a network of seventeen hydroelectric and two thermal power stations, generating <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half.</b> The energy surplus, accounting for about 20% of the total generated energy, is transferred to the unified energy system of Russia, as well as exported to Norway and Finland via the NORDEL system.|$|E
5|$|The {{new wave}} of {{construction}} brings the university's stock of houses to 328, including several duplexes. Not including these new additions, as of 2005, the university owned 225 houses in the Ghetto, with the rest on the Darkside, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> of the University of Dayton campus.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> of {{the matchup}} {{would consist of}} either Notre Dame or the first {{selection}} from the Big East Conference after that conference's automatic BCS bid.

5|$|Benioff and Weiss write each {{of their}} episodes together, {{with one of them}} writing {{the first half of the}} script and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>the</b> second <b>half.</b> After that they begin with passing the drafts back and forth to make notes and rewrite parts of it.|$|R
60|$|The {{fishing vessels}} were still crowded together, running to and fro, out and in, without {{definite}} purpose, plunging over the heaving swells--some of them visible on <b>the</b> crests, <b>others</b> <b>half</b> hidden in <b>the</b> hollows--and behaving generally like living creatures that were impatiently awaiting {{the signal to}} begin a race.|$|R

5|$|Unlike most animals, {{whales are}} {{conscious}} breathers. All mammals sleep, but whales cannot afford to become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. They are believed to exhibit unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, in which they sleep {{with half of the}} brain while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> remains active. This behavior was only documented in toothed whales until footage of a humpback whale sleeping (vertically) was shot in 2014.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, the CGI cutscenes were created by Digital Frontier. The staff numbers, including those working on the cutscenes, went from around one hundred for Path of Radiance to around 200 for Radiant Dawn: half the staff worked on the game itself, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> worked on the cutscenes. For the cutscenes, Digital Frontier were asked to show a more epic scope rather than just focusing on the characters, a trend from Path of Radiance the developers felt was wrong. All of the character movements in cutscenes were mapped using motion capture, with between 100 and 150 animations per character to implement.|$|E

5|$|Basiliscus fled in {{the heat}} of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This {{is the reason why}} the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Black {{contacts}} Seattle Police Department detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) {{for information}} on Rothenburg. Her husband found her when he came home, assuming that she had surprised a burglar. Elsewhere, her attacker shoots the clerk in a liquor store, again hearing the victim give permission to be killed. Black and Bletcher review security camera footage of the crime, which leads to them discovering half a playing card—the Jack of Spades—at the scene. Rothenburg's home is searched and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> is found there.|$|E
50|$|Haiti, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> (western) <b>half</b> of <b>the</b> {{island of}} Hispaniola, {{had a similar}} experience. It was a US {{protectorate}} from 1915 to 1936, after five US military commanders, there was one High Commissioner, John H. Russell, Jr., who served from 11 February 1922 to 16 November 1930.|$|R

5|$|Carr Hill Nook {{has a high}} {{proportion}} of lone parent households at some 19.3% of all households. This is the fourth highest figure in Gateshead and compares with a borough average of 11.5%. Some 36.9% of households have dependent children, as opposed to 29.5% nationally and 28.4% in Gateshead. This is also the fourth-highest figure in Gateshead. The Index of Multiple Deprivation, which divides England into 32,482 areas and measures quality of life to indicate deprivation, splits Carr Hill into halves and lists one half in the top 5% of all deprived areas in England in 2008. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> is listed in the top 20% of all deprived areas.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when {{elections for the}} Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} analysis, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>half</b> were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due to {{scavenging}} or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E
30|$|Class IV {{incorporates}} {{all cases}} of unilateral formed uterus with aplasia or dysplasia of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> uterine <b>half.</b> It is a formation defect, but {{the necessity of}} classifying it separately from full aplasia comes from {{the presence of a}} fully developed functional uterine hemicavity, which does not exist in cases of aplasia.|$|R
