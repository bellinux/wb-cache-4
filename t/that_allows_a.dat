5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{introduced}} and supported legislation to increase benefits {{and pay for}} federal workers, {{in part due to}} the Federal Government’s large presence within the 8th District – 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds. He introduced a bill signed into law that allows FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service. Moran also authored a law <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> federal worker’s unused sick leave to count toward their annuity. In the 112th Congress, he also spoke against attempts by Republicans to cut back the size of the federal workforce.|$|E

More specifically, if n {{is the number of}} edges, and m is the number of concave vertices of the polygon, we show how to compute: • in O(m 4 / 3 log 1 / 3 m + K) time, all K combinations <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> form-closure grasp with two contacts; • in O(n 2 log 4 m + K) time, all K combinations <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> form-closure grasp with three contacts; • in O(n log 4 m + (nm) 2 / 3 log 2 +δ m + K) time, all K combinations of one concave vertex and one edge <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> grasp with one contact on the vertex and one contact on the interior of the edge, satisfying Czyzowicz’s weaker conditions for immobilization; • in O(n 2 log 3 n + K) time, all K combinations of three edges <b>that</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> grasp with one contact on the interior of each edge, satisfying Czyzowicz’s weaker conditions for immobilization. ...|$|R

5|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} and treatment are important {{in the care of}} TBI; if the injury is not diagnosed shortly after the injury, the risk of complications is higher. Bronchoscopy is the most effective method to diagnose, locate, and determine the severity of TBI, and it is usually the only method <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> definitive diagnosis. Diagnosis with a flexible bronchoscope, which allows the injury to be visualized directly, is the fastest and most reliable technique. In people with TBI, bronchoscopy may reveal that the airway is torn, or that the airways are blocked by blood, or that a bronchus has collapsed, obscuring more distal (lower) bronchi from view.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick is a rule at the {{professional}} and high school levels of American football <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> team that has just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and if it passes over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is scored to the offensive team.|$|E
5|$|The two {{possible}} stacked forms differ in which pairs {{of the arms}} are stacked with each other; {{which of the two}} dominates is highly dependent on the base sequences nearest to the junction. Some sequences result in an equilibrium between the two conformers, while others strongly prefer a single conformer. In particular, junctions containing the sequence A-CC bridging the junction point appear to strongly prefer the conformer <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> hydrogen bond to form between the second cytosine and one of the phosphates at the junction point. While most studies have focused on the identities of the four bases nearest to the junction on each arm, it is evident that bases farther out can also affect the observed stacking conformations.|$|E

5|$|Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} , is a third-person shooter. Players can control each transformer in both its robot and vehicle forms. Instead {{of a traditional}} health system, the game features a system similar to the Halo series of video games. The player character has both a regenerating shield and health, the latter {{of which can be}} replenished by a health pack. The weapon selection in Fall of Cybertron is expanded, with new weapons that can take on very significant upgrades, including one <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> weapon to fire up to 75% faster. These are purchased through Teletran 1 kiosks found throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|Unlike modern amphibians, many temnospondyls {{are covered}} in small, closely packed scales. The undersides of most temnospondyls {{are covered in}} rows of large ventral plates. During early stages of development, they first have only small, rounded scales. Fossils show, as the animals grew, the scales on the undersides of their bodies {{developed}} into large, wide ventral plates. The plates overlap {{each other in a}} way <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> wide range of flexibility. Later semiaquatic temnospondyls, such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs, have no evidence of scales. They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow cutaneous respiration, the absorption of oxygen through the skin.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound <b>that</b> <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E
