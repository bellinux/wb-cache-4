60|$|My Lords, I do {{not mean}} now to go further than just to remind your Lordships of this, that Mr. Hastings's {{government}} was one whole system of oppression, of robbery of individuals, of destruction of the public, and of suppression of the whole system of the English government, in order <b>to</b> <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> {{the worst of the}} natives all the powers that could possibly exist in any government,--in order to defeat the ends which all governments ought in common to have in view. Thus, my Lords, I show you at one point of view what you are to expect from him in all the rest. I have, I think, made out as clear as can be to your Lordships, so far as it was necessary to go, that his bribery and peculation was not occasional, but habitual,--that it was not urged upon him at the moment, but was regular and systematic. I have shown to your Lordships the operation of such a system on the revenues.|$|E

6000|$|That {{the hardships}} of his case being {{frequently}} represented to Warren Hastings, Esquire, he did suggest a doubt whether [...] "that little ought to be still subject to tribute," [...] indicating that the said tribute might be hard and inequitable,--but, whatever its justice might have been, that, [...] "from the earliest period of our connection with the present Nabob of Oude, it had invariably continued {{a part of the}} funds assigned by his Excellency as a provision for the liquidation of the several public demands of this government [Calcutta] upon him; and in consequence of the powers the board deemed it expedient <b>to</b> <b>vest</b> <b>in</b> the Resident at his court for the collection of the Company's assignments, a sezauwil [a sequestrator] has always been stationed to enforce by every means in his power the payment of the tribute." [...] And the said tribute was, in consequence of this arrangement, not paid to the Nabob, but to the British Resident at Oude; and the same being therefore under the direction and for the sole use of the Company, and indeed the prince himself wholly dependent, the representatives of the said Company were responsible {{for the protection of the}} prince, and for the good government of the country.|$|E
