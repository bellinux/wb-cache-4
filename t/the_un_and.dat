5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> North Korea, {{locked in a}} bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E
5|$|The {{resolution}} {{called on}} the North to immediately halt its invasion and to move its troops back to the 38th parallel. Seen as a diplomatic victory for the United States, the resolution was completely ignored by North Korea. This brought <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> the US to take further action, setting the state for massive international involvement {{and the expansion of}} the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{sites were}} {{considered}} as temporary holding locations during renovations. In 2005, officials investigated establishing a new temporary site be created {{at the old}} Lake Success location. Brooklyn was also suggested as a temporary site. Another alternative for a temporary headquarters or a new permanent facility was the World Trade Center site. Once again, these plans met resistance both within <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> from the United States and New York governments and were abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Feminist economists join <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> {{others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind}} of work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was deeply suspicious of <b>the</b> <b>UN,</b> <b>and</b> was loath {{to do anything}} that would benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz {{for the establishment of a}} UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement {{was signed}} by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and <b>the</b> <b>UN,</b> <b>and</b> a ceasefire called.

5|$|Initially, Lumumba {{hoped that}} the United Nations (UN), which sent a multi-national {{peacekeeping}} force to the Congo in July 1960, would help the central government to suppress both Katangese and South Kasaian secessions. The UN was reluctant to do so, however, considering the secessions to be internal political matters and its own mission to be maintaining basic law and order. Rejected by both <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> United States, Lumumba sought military support from the communist Soviet Union. Within days of the secession and with Soviet logistical support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful. On 27 August, ANC soldiers arrived in Bakwanga.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{forces had}} four {{possible}} routes in the perimeter: to the south, the {{pass through the}} city of Masan around {{the confluence of the}} Nam and Naktong rivers; another southerly route through the Naktong Bulge and into the railroad lines at Miryang; through the route into Taegu in the north; and through Kyongju in the eastern corridor. North Korea mounted a large offensive in August, simultaneously attacking all four entries into the perimeter. As a result, the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was not one single engagement but a series of large battles fought between <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> North Korean divisions all along the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|On 25 November, the Chinese {{entered the}} war in defense of North Korea. The People's Liberation Army force, which totaled 260,000 troops, flooded into North Korea and caught the Eighth Army by surprise. Chinese forces crushed <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> South Korean forces with {{overwhelming}} numbers, surrounding and destroying elements of the US 2nd Infantry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and South Korean forces. The 24th Infantry Division, {{on the west coast}} of the Korean peninsula, was hit by soldiers from the 50th and 66th Chinese field armies. Amid heavy casualties, the Eighth Army retreated to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, 2006, Williams {{appeared}} on Larry King Live where Paul McCartney and then wife Heather Mills argued the seal hunt was inhumane because seal cubs were being clubbed to death. Williams said the annual hunt {{is supported by}} scientists, veterinarians and organizations like <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> the World Wildlife Fund, and that 90% of seals are killed by bullet. Williams accused the McCartneys of being used by IFAW, Greenpeace and PETA to help them raise funds. He then invited the McCartneys to visit Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, the Republic of China (Taiwan) {{has been}} {{excluded}} from <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> {{since then has}} always been rejected in new applications. Citizens of this country are also not allowed to enter the buildings of the United Nations with the passport of Taiwan. In this way, critics agree that the UN is failing its own development goals and guidelines. This criticism also brought pressure from the People's Republic of China, which regards the territories administered by Taiwan as their own territory.|$|E
5|$|The first {{meetings}} of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and the Security Council took place in London beginning 10 January 1946.

5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is undermined by the powerlessness of <b>the</b> <b>U.N.</b> <b>and</b> the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E
5|$|After Sukarno was {{replaced}} by Suharto, Soedjatmoko returned to public service. In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia's representatives at <b>the</b> <b>UN,</b> <b>and</b> in 1968 he became Indonesia's ambassador to the US; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees. He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik. After returning to Indonesia in 1971, Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks. After the Malari incident in January 1974, Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation {{for two and a}} half weeks and accused of masterminding the event. Although eventually released, he could not leave Indonesia {{for two and a half}} years. In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding, and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo. Two years after returning from Japan, Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest while teaching in Yogyakarta.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the time when he, as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>and</b> praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E
