5|$|According to Znaniecki, {{sociology}} can {{be divided}} into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from <b>the</b> <b>science</b> <b>of</b> psychology, which he held in low esteem.|$|E

Through analyzing "whole thought " <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sciences</b> <b>of</b> human settlements and problems of disassembling the object investigated in excess that currently exist at the Chinese urban planning work, the paper puts forward some suggestions that rebuild urban planning theory proceeding from whole thought, and change urban planning practice proceeding from achieving mastery through a comprehensive study of the subject.
