5|$|Later {{chapters}} {{provide evidence}} that evolution has occurred, supporting the idea of branching, adaptive evolution without directly proving that selection is the mechanism. Darwin presents supporting facts drawn from many disciplines, showing that his theory could explain a myriad of observations from many fields of natural history that were inexplicable under the alternate concept that species had been individually created. The structure of Darwin's argument showed the influence of John Herschel, whose philosophy of science maintained that a mechanism could be called a vera causa (true cause) if <b>three</b> <b>things</b> could be demonstrated: its existence in nature, its ability to produce the effects of interest, {{and its ability to}} explain a wide range of observations.|$|E

Caroline does her best to break up the relationship between Mac and Emily, but it is Emily who breaks up with Mac. Caroline accused Emily of being a fake but was proved wrong. Mac found this amusing and so Emily dumps him. Mac then tells Caroline that he felt <b>three</b> <b>things</b> when she had accused his then girlfriend: he was impressed and amused, but instead of saying the third thing he kisses her.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Various {{positive}} psychology interventions {{have been}} experimentally tested, but only few studies addressed {{the effects of}} such activities in participants aged 50 and above. Method: We tested the impact of four self-administered positive psychology interventions in an online setting (i. e., gratitude visit, <b>three</b> good <b>things,</b> <b>three</b> funny <b>things,</b> and using signature strengths in a new way) on happiness and depressive symptoms in comparison with a placebo control exercise (i. e., early memories). A total of 163 females aged 50 – 79 tried the assigned interventions or the placebo control exercise for one week and completed measures on happiness and depressive symptoms at five times (pre- and post-test, 1, 3, and 6 months). Results: Three out of the four interventions (i. e., gratitude visit, <b>three</b> good <b>things,</b> and using signature strengths in a new way) increased happiness, whereas two interventions (<b>three</b> funny <b>things</b> and using signature strengths in a new way) led to a reduction of depressive symptoms on at one post-measure. Conclusion: Positive psychology interventions yield similar results for people aged 50 and above as for younger people. The dissemination of such interventions via the Internet offers a valuable opportunity for older age groups as well...|$|R

25|$|Directed {{evolution}} is a mimic {{of the natural}} evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires <b>three</b> <b>things</b> to happen: variation between replicators, that the variation causes fitness differences upon which selection acts, and that this variation is heritable.

Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one round as the template for the next to achieve stepwise improvements.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} nine strengths-based {{positive}} interventions on well-being and depression was examined in an Internet-based randomized placebo-controlled study. The {{aims of the}} study were to: (1) replicate findings on the effectiveness of the gratitude visit, <b>three</b> good <b>things,</b> and using character strengths interventions; (2) test variants of inter- ventions (noting <b>three</b> good <b>things</b> for 2 weeks; combining the gratitude visit and <b>three</b> good <b>things</b> interventions; and noting <b>three</b> funny <b>things</b> for a week); and (3) test the effectiveness of the counting kindness, gift of time, and another door opens-interventions in an online setting. A total of 622 adults subjected themselves to one of the nine interven- tions or to a placebo control exercise (early memories) and thereafter estimated their degrees of happiness and depression at five times (pre- and post-test, 1 -, 3 -, and 6 months follow-up). Eight of the nine interventions increased happiness; depression was decreased in all groups, including the placebo control group. We conclude that happiness can be enhanced through some ‘‘strengths-based’’ interventions. Possible mechanisms for the effectiveness of the interventions are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Meaning and truth. The most {{important}} and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern propositional logic. The Stoics distinguished between utterance (phone), which may be noise, speech (lexis), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (logos), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory {{is the idea that}} what is expressed by a sentence, called a lekton, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a proposition. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, <b>three</b> <b>things</b> are linked together: that which signifies, that which is signified, and the object; for example, that which signifies is the word Dion, and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.|$|E
25|$|A {{priest of}} Aaron's lineage (i.e. Kohen) is {{forbidden}} by the Mosaic Law (Torah) {{to marry a}} divorced woman even {{if she were a}} native Israelite. Likewise, a male descendant from Aaron's line is prohibited to marry a Jewish woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew, whether she had been raped or she had willfully done so. So, too, he cannot marry a Jewish woman whose birth was by a father who is a Kohen but who violated one of these prohibitions. If he went ahead and did one of these <b>three</b> <b>things,</b> his male issue born from such union is no longer a priest (i.e. Kohen), but rather becomes a Ḥallal (Lev. 21:7, 14) - a term designating one who is no longer a priest, but profaned. A priest must maintain an untainted lineage, and his mother must be of Jewish birth. If he married a non-Jewish woman from the gentile nations, his children are no longer priests, but gentiles. Had a priest of Aaron's lineage transgressed this prohibition and married a divorced woman, and they had children together, all of his female issue - whether his, or his sons, or his grandchildren - would be prohibited from marrying into the priestly stock for all generations.|$|E
