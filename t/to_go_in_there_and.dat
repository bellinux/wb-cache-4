500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E
500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
2500|$|While Governor, Palin vetoed {{public funding}} for private, Christian schools, saying after the fact, [...] "I'm a Christian.... unconstitutional. It's illegal. You can't do that. I had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> veto those things and, of course, was accused then of being, 'Oh, you're {{not a real}} {{conservative}} or a real Republican. Otherwise, you would have fought for that.' No, illegal is illegal." ...|$|E

6000|$|The other cowboy, called Andy, {{manifested}} uneasiness, and he said: [...] "Aw, now, Jake, you ain't a-goin' {{to ask me}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there?...</b> An' me hatin' Germans the way I do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Anson {{rose with}} a sudden gesture. [...] "Jest hear her! whistlin' away like a lark. I don't see how I'm goin' <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> an' spoil all her fun; I can't do it, that's all." ...|$|R
2500|$|Project 86 has {{sometimes}} been labeled a [...] "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art {{to be the best}} conveyance of their message. Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. [...] "We're not going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs." [...] "If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...," [...] the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, [...] "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience." [...] In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined [...] "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{heard her}} whistle, but he {{remained}} at the saw-horse. It would do in the country, but not here. He had no right <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> eat.|$|E
6000|$|He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> {{throw some}} of those young pups out of the house! They talk down to me like I was the butler! I'd like to--" ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Don Imus, Paul was asked for {{his view of the}} Gaza flotilla raid. He responded, [...] "... I think it's absolutely wrong to prevent people that are starving and having problems, that are almost like in concentration camps, and saying yes we endorse this whole concept that we can't allow ships <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a humanitarian way..." ...|$|R
6000|$|The captain smiled. [...] "I don't {{think we}} will give up the caves just yet. I, for one, most {{certainly}} want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> again." [...] And then he {{told the story of}} the stone mound which he had discovered.|$|R
60|$|When {{they arrived}} at the cafe Lawson told Philip that they would have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> was hardly a bite in the autumn air, but Cronshaw had a morbid fear of {{draughts}} and even in the warmest weather sat inside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, I {{want this}} case explained. THEY wanted {{to explain it}} to me--as if there hadn't been emotion or {{excitement}} enough already. You knew my orders; how did you dare <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> get up that riot?" ...|$|E
60|$|When one grew old {{and wild}} {{and ran up}} bills, one somehow never ran them up with Gessler Brothers. It would not have seemed {{becoming}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> stretch out one's foot to that blue iron-spectacled glance, owing him for more than--say--two pairs, just the comfortable reassurance that one was still his client.|$|E
60|$|Rollo wished <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> see the grounds; {{but the boy}} walked on, and so Rollo {{followed}} him. After a {{time the}} guide turned off into a field, and there took a path which led down toward a wood, where they could hear water running. When they came into the wood they saw the water. It was a large stream, large enough for a mill stream, and it ran foaming and tumbling down over its rocky bed in a very picturesque manner.|$|E
60|$|They walked {{till they}} came {{almost to the}} {{wilderness}} at {{the south side of}} the park; but the girl, perceiving Amy offered <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> among the woods and trees, stopped short there, and would go no further; but said she would not <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Jude, it is lonely {{here in the}} weekday mornings, {{when you}} are at work, and I think and think of--of my--" [...] She stopped till she could control the {{lumpiness}} of her throat.

6000|$|... "It would indeed, also my temper," [...] {{he assured}} her. [...] "We {{are going to}} have a cocktail, you and I, within two minutes, young lady, and a steak afterwards. If you want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> with my hand on your neck, you can, but I think it would look better--" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{another place}} we were shown {{a sort of}} summer arbor, with a fence before it. We said that was nothing. We looked again, and saw, through the arbor, an endless stretch of garden, and shrubbery, and grassy lawn. We were {{perfectly}} willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> rest, but {{it could not be}} done. It was only another delusion--a painting by some ingenious artist with little charity in his heart for tired folk. The deception was perfect. No one could have imagined the park was not real. We even thought we smelled the flowers at first.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are safe}} here," [...] the lady said. [...] "I have just dined with my charges, and my duties are {{over for the}} day. No one is likely to disturb us here. This is my private sitting-room. My bedroom is next door. If any one is heard coming, you must hide there. I will go in at once and change my dress for a dressing-gown, and I can then lock the door; so that if any one comes, there will be time for you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> when I open it, and say I am {{preparing}} for bed, it will account for the door being locked." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{passed before}} {{the lights of}} Martin's restaurant, the most aristocratic in the city, and stopped. It {{was a place where}} he had often dined, in better days, and Martin knew him well. Standing aside, just out of the range of the light, he worshiped the quails and steaks in the show window, and {{imagined}} that may be the fairy times were not gone yet and some prince in disguise would come along presently and tell him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> take whatever he wanted. He chewed his stick with a hungry interest as he warmed to his subject. Just at this juncture he was conscious of some one at his side, sure enough; and then a finger touched his arm. He looked up, over his shoulder, and saw an apparition--a very allegory of Hunger! It was a man six feet high, gaunt, unshaven, hung with rags; with a haggard face and sunken cheeks, and eyes that pleaded piteously. This phantom said: ...|$|E
60|$|The Bon Ton Store--big as four barns--my! {{it would}} simply scare a person <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> with {{seven or eight}} clerks all looking at you. And the men's suits, on figures just like human. And Axel Egge's, like home, lots of Swedes and Norskes <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> and a card of dandy buttons, like rubies.|$|R

"I am {{inclined}} to believe, my good Boatfield," [...] quoth Sir Marmaduke, as he <b>went</b> back <b>to</b> the trestle-table, and poured himself out another half-glass full of brandy, [...] "I am {{inclined to}} believe that when you advised me not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> you spoke words of wisdom which I had done well to follow." ...|$|R
50|$|Unlike all {{the other}} Maids of Honour, Lady Grace loves to climb trees in {{orchards}} when she walks the dogs. In Whitehall she mainly climbs a cherry tree that reminds her of her mother. When Grace walks the Queen's dogs, she always <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> visit her friends Masou and Ellie in a hideout. Every time the Queen wants {{to move to another}} Palace, Masou and Ellie find a little hideaway <b>in</b> the orchard <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> their spare time, when they are not helping Lady Grace solve a new mystery.|$|R

50|$|Rhythm {{is such a}} {{big part}} of their culture and their own way of communicating, so we were able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> design a program around them.

5000|$|How many bits have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there?</b> <b>And</b> {{what is the}} informational {{content of}} that which {{produces}} these bits?

5000|$|According {{to him in}} {{the same}} interview, being [...] "uninsurable" [...] due to his quadriplegia, he was $50,000 in debt for his medical bills, and had been putting off a surgery for a year ("And, I mean, I could die only because I cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> again. I don't want to die, {{especially}} just because of I don't have enough money <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the hospital.").|$|R

Some time, Rock, {{when the}} team is up against it, when things are wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, ask them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy." ...|$|R
2500|$|He wrote briefly for {{publishing}} house Robbins Music and producer Mickie Most in 1967, and then shifted base to the Kennedy Street Enterprises show business management offices in Manchester. He remained there for four years, recalling: [...] "It {{was like an}} office. I used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> every morning at 10 o'clock and stay there, working on my songs, until I finished every evening at six o'clock. It was self-discipline and I need that." ...|$|R

5000|$|Transcripts of {{telephone}} conversations reveal that by December 1970 Nixon's {{dissatisfaction with the}} success of the bombings prompted him to order that they be stepped up. [...] "They have got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> I mean really go in," [...] he told Kissinger. [...] "I want them to hit everything. I want them to use the big planes, the small planes, everything they can that will help out there, and let's start giving them a little shock." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{looked forward}} to that, brother, when Vince Jr.told me to wrestle The Undertaker. Brother, I loved it. I loved it. I said, [...] "Why not?". Here's a kid that's blowing up.

6000|$|One of {{the points}} which I had found of most {{interest}} in '97 was the Blackfoot Agency, and as we sat in our tent on the Northern shore of Lake McDonald I gained Zulime's consent <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> for a few days.
