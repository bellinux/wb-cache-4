The distinction, when one is made, is that a machining center is a mill with features that pre-CNC mills never had, especially an automatic <b>tool</b> <b>changer</b> (ATC) that includes a tool magazine (carousel), and sometimes an automatic pallet changer (APC). In typical usage, all machining centers are mills, but not all mills are machining centers; only mills with ATCs are machining centers.|$|E

50|$|Simple CNC {{machines}} {{work with}} a single tool. Turrets can {{work with a}} large number of tools. But if even more tools are required, then ATC is provided. The tools are stored on a magazine. It allows the machine to work {{with a large number}} of tools without an operator. The main parts of an automatic <b>tool</b> <b>changer</b> are the base, the gripper arm, the tool holder, the support arm and tool magazines. Although the ATC increases the reliability, speed and accuracy, it creates more challenges compared to manual tool change, for example the tooling used must be easy to centre, be easy for the changer to grab and there should be a simple way to provide the tool's self-disengagement. Tools used in ATC are secured in toolholders specially designed for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication and characterization of a device able to exchange the tip part (so-called the tools) of a two fingered microgripper. The principle of this <b>tool</b> <b>changer</b> {{is based on}} the use of a thermal glue whose state (liquid or solid) is changed by heating or cooling. Several kinds of pairs of tools have been designed. The suitable pair of tools can be chosen according to the size, shape and material of the object to manipulate. The <b>tool</b> <b>changer</b> enables one to perform a sequence of elementary micromanipulation tasks (i. e. an assembly sequence) by using only one gripper mounted on only one manipulator. The <b>tool</b> <b>changer</b> has been automated and successfully tested in air and in the vacuum chamber of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). It brings flexibility to the micromanipulation cell and contributes to reduce the costs, the used space and experimentations time for micromanipulations in the SEM. The assembly of a ball bearing (the balls are 200 µm in diameter) has been successfully tested using the microgripper equipped with the <b>tool</b> <b>changer</b> in a SEM.

50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill).

The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|R

40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. Two novel 4 -DOF {{very fast}} {{parallel}} robot was designed. This paper introduces the new parallel mechanism designs which are named the Manta and the kanuk. In {{order to reduce}} manipulator overall costs, the actuator and encoder numbers are minimized to the exact effective degrees-of-freedoms (DOF) which is usually {{not the case in}} most parallel robot designs. The robots allow end-effector displacements along the three Cartesian translations and one platform transversal rotation. The two remaining rotations are blocked by the intrinsic mechanical structure including the rotation along the platform normal which is always limited in range. The main advantages are high stiffness through the multiple kinematic chain structure which allow for low mass designs. Moreover, it features simple mechanical construction.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} an adaptive planning system for automatic <b>tool</b> <b>changers</b> in flexible manufacturing systems. The conventional models of predictive control usually cannot adapt to a real time dynamic environment. The proposed adaptive control model is capable of self adjusting to changing environments. The algorithm {{is based on a}} decision logic, which is constructed by breaking up knowledge and converting them into mathematical form in order to cover all possible conditions that can exist during the implementation phase. Expert thoughts and knowledge from decision logic are stored in the decision tree, which consists of circular nodes, arcs and decision nodes. The suggested system is capable of accepting further rules, new nodes and branches to the tree when additional attributes are needed. This whole knowledge is encoded in the form of production rules and each rule represents a small chunk of knowledge relating to the given domain of tool replacement. A number of related rules collectively respond to highly useful conclusions. The system uses VP Expert development shell, contains an inference engine and, a user interface. The originality of the proposed strategy lies in that a knowledge-based expert system is developed to identify and analyze the current conditions and then readjust the output that reflects the real-time environment. Compared with the various classical models, the approach can synthesize and analyze as many variables as possible to adequately and reliably identify the real-time conditions.

40|$|High {{strength}} steel materials, {{coated sheet}} metals and other metallic materials for manufacturing car bodies require an advanced {{quality of the}} cutting tools and deep drawing dies. Laser beam hardening has been established as the standard technology for increasing strength and lifetime of cutting edges and deep drawing tools. Laser cladding can be applied advantageously as a repair technology for tools. But {{more important is the}} application as »negative milling«-technology for fast design changes during the fitting loops of the tools. Once made at external specialists these technologies are getting integrated in manufacturing lines of tool makers. Fraunhofer IWS developed systems and components for applying these technologies. Automated processing supported by measuring and control systems reduce existing application barriers at operators who are well skilled in mechanical treatment but less experienced with heat treatment and cladding. Since laser beam hardening and cladding is frequently necessary in the same line machine costs can be reduced if both processes share a laser. The optimum beam quality for both processes is quite similar and can be delivered by modern fiber coupled high power diode lasers. Since the precision demands a rather moderate articulated robots can be used as machine system. They can get extended by linear axis or turning tables for achieving a larger field of operation. Fraunhofer IWS has developed laser process modules which can be adapted to a robot hand via robotic <b>tool</b> <b>changers.</b> With a simple subroutine a laser hardening machine can get transferred into a laser cladding machine and reverse.
