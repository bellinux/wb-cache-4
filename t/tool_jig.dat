40|$|M. Ed. The Technical Colleges are {{important}} {{links between the}} community and industry since it is eminently responsible for the academic training of mid-level manpower, namely artisans and apprentices. The responsibility of Technical Colleges is to make post-school education available. This post-school training is offer {{with a view to}} the practice of a career and is geared towards any school leaver, who requires practical-orientated career training. Technical Colleges offer training on a continual basis where the differentiated secondary school system ceases to prepare students to be able to practice a career, trade-or professional skill in commerce and industry. The technical college focuses on career training aimed towards the practice, which is market orientated and set towards job opportunities. With reference to the aforementioned mission of the Technical Colleges, it becomes essential that theory becomes reconciled with practice in order to apply practice-orientated career training. III This study is aimed at compiling a syllabus for Fitting and Machining Theory (N 1 N 3) at Technical Colleges on a scientific basis, which will comply with the demands and needs of the community and industry. The study has been carried out on the ground that a need has been established during an ATC (Association of Technical Colleges (now Committee of Technical College Principals CTCP) seminar for the curriculum development of the subject Fitting and Machining (N 1 -N 3) at Technical Colleges. The researcher, as chairman of the CTCP sub-subject committee for Fitting and Machining (N 1 -N 3) as well as <b>Tool,</b> <b>Jig</b> and Die Maker's Theory (N 2 and N 3) undertook this study with the approval and support of the CTCP {{under the direction of the}} University of Pretoria. The dissertation was eventually finalised and completed at the Rand Afrikaans University. A literary study has been undertaken in order to be able to choose a curriculum model based on the opinions of a number of curriculum experts. This should be useful in setting a direction according to which the present Fitting and Machining Theory syllabi (N 1 -N 3) at Technical Colleges can be developed. The research includes the distribution of scientifically based questionnaire, which were sent to selected respondents, as well as with structured interviews. This was done to pinpoint the similarities between and the differences in the Fitting and Machining syllabus at Technical Colleges and the training schedules in the Metal Industries. The purpose with this information which has been computerised and processed by the Department of Information Management, Section: Research and Training Support, at the University of Pretoria is to compile well-founded syllabi for Fitting and Machining (N 1 -N 3). It is nonetheless imperative that the curriculum development of Engineering Studies syllabi at Technical Colleges be developed on a regular basis and in co- IV operation with the industry with cognisance of technological development in order to offer career training in the real sense of the word...|$|E

50|$|In 1947, the FBI became {{interested}} in the operation and the Royal Canadians filed to extradite Levine, as the plant was in Canada was under his name. As a result, Levine was persona non grata in Canada and wasn’t permitted to enter Canada for at least 10 years. At that point, some of the machine components had been sent to Levine’s plastics warehouse in the Bronx. From there, Slavin and Levine bought boilers, took the tubes out and filled them with all of the <b>tools,</b> <b>jigs</b> and fixtures so that it appeared that they were shipping over boilers. They had a proper export license and were connected to a factory in Palestine that had the import license, and they clandestinely shipped the boilers. The boilers got through to Palestine and were placed in underground plants.

50|$|The Lockheed CL-1200 Lancer was a late 1960s company-funded {{proposal}} for an improved Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. It {{was intended for}} the export market and was in direct competition with the Northrop F-5E Tiger II, Dassault Mirage F1, Northrop YF-17 and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. Lockheed hoped to capitalize on its F-104 production experience through commonality of parts and systems, and minimize expenses by reusing <b>tooling,</b> <b>jigs</b> and existing factory facilities. Lockheed was also experienced in consortium production and further hoped to continue this arrangement with the CL-1200. It was projected that CL-1200 deliveries could begin in 1972.|$|R

Levine and Slavin eventually found a cooperating factory and rented space; they did not inform the property owner of details, they only said they were using the space to do research {{in connection with the}} Weizmann Institute. Slavin, Levine and their team set up an engineering department, made individual blueprints of component pieces of the weapon, and distributed those to approximately 20 machine shops in Toronto to ensure that the project remained a secret.|$|R

25|$|It {{is common}} to have holes in the {{benchtop}} that <b>tools</b> or <b>jigs</b> can be bolted to. In applications where repeated removal and reinstallation of the <b>tool</b> or <b>jig</b> is desirable, screwing into the wood of the benchtop with woodscrews or lag bolts is not an ideal solution, because the wooden threads don't lend themselves to repeated disassembly and reassembly. In such cases, {{it is useful to}} create hardpoints, which are metal threads embedded in the wood. These hardpoints make repeated disassembly and reassembly trouble-free. They are essentially nuts that are embedded into the wood in one way or another. T-nuts (aka tee nuts) are an easy way to create a hardpoint. Custom nuts similar to T-nuts but with holes for woodscrews in place of the spikes are sometimes machined for the purpose.|$|R
5000|$|STEP-NC {{reflects}} the same theme, {{which can be}} viewed as yet another step along a path that started with the development of machine <b>tools,</b> <b>jigs</b> and fixtures, and numerical control, which all sought to [...] "build the skill into the tool." [...] Recent developments of G-code and STEP-NC aim to build the information and semantics into the tool. This idea is not new; from the beginning of numerical control, the concept of an end-to-end CAD/CAM environment was the goal of such early technologies as DAC-1 and APT. Those efforts were fine for huge corporations like GM and Boeing. However, small and medium enterprises went through an era of simpler implementations of NC, with relatively primitive [...] "connect-the-dots" [...] G-code and manual programming until CAD/CAM improved and disseminated throughout industry.|$|R

50|$|A good, simplistic way to {{summarize}} the change in ideas is to compare {{the making of a}} certain product in different time periods. In 1750, a rifle was made in a workshop by a craftsman using hand tools, and if he needed a new tool, it is likely that he would make it himself using the same tools and methods that he would use to make his product, the rifle (smithy, files, woodcarving knives, etc.) This type of craftsmanship can still be done today, but it is expensive in terms of skilled labor time per unit of output, and therefore it implies small total output volume and high unit price. However, today the way to make rifles in large quantity with low unit price is to first do the tool-and-die work (toolroom work) (that is, make, or have someone else make, machine <b>tools,</b> <b>jigs,</b> and fixtures), and then use those specialized tools to mass-produce the rifles in an automated way that involves no toolroom methods.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice to}} move forward with the Gregorie option was {{primarily}} based on the availability of the assets of the former Grantham operation at a significant discount.

25|$|The {{greatest}} {{tribute to}} the Hs 123 usefulness came in January 1943 when Generaloberst Wolfram von Richthofen, then commander-in-chief of Luftflotte 4, asked whether production of the Hs 123 could be restarted because the Hs 123 performed well in a theater where mud, snow, rain and ice took a heavy toll on the serviceability of more advanced aircraft. However, the Henschel factory had already dismantled all <b>tools</b> and <b>jigs</b> in 1940.|$|R

However, there are applications in which the hobbyist can benefit from the range of fasteners that are available. They are easier and require less skill to install than some of the other more traditional techniques.|$|R
50|$|Interchangeability {{of parts}} was finally {{achieved}} by combining {{a number of}} innovations and improvements in machining operations and machine tools, which were developed primarily for making textile machinery.

500|$|The TSR-2 <b>tooling,</b> <b>jigs</b> {{and many}} of the part {{completed}} aircraft were all scrapped at Brooklands within six months of the cancellation. Two airframes eventually survived: the complete XR220 at [...] the RAF Museum, Cosford near Wolverhampton, and the much less complete XR222 at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. The only airframe ever to fly, XR219, along with the completed XR221 and part completed XR223 were taken to Shoeburyness and used as targets to test the vulnerability of a modern airframe and systems to gunfire and shrapnel. Four additional completed airframes, XR224, XR225, XR226 and one incomplete airframe XR227 (X-06,07,08 and 09) were scrapped by R J Coley and Son, Hounslow Middlesex. Four further airframe serials XR228 to XR231 were allocated but these aircraft were allegedly not built. Construction of a further 10 aircraft (X-10 to 19) allocated serials XS660 to 669 was started but all partly built airframes were again scrapped by R J Coley. The last serial of that batch, XS670 is listed as [...] "cancelled", as are those of another batch of 50 projected aircraft, XS944 to 995.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, our {{analytical}} method for detecting amino acids is highly sensitive, and {{the concentrations of}} the detected amino acids on our witness coupons {{are similar to those}} on the blank witness coupon. This result means that our method can detect most amino acids that exist at levels only a few times higher than those found on the blank as primary signals from the samples handled in CC 2. In CC 2, most of the <b>tools,</b> <b>jigs</b> and containers were introduced just after being ultrasonically cleaned by following the methods described by Ishibashi et al. (2012). Baking the items before introduction to CC 2 resulted in a decrease in the level of contamination. In addition, it is important to continue monitoring the amino acid contamination level in CC 2 on a regular basis to maintain the cleanliness and to detect any accidental increases in the contamination level. It is also useful to understand the detection limits of amino acids in the Hayabusa 2 -returned samples processed in CC 2.|$|R

5000|$|Winer Malone (born November 1, 1929), {{the last}} of a great {{generation}} of Bahamian wooden boat builders, single-handedly crafted over 200 Abaco dinghies in his lifetime. [...] Ranging from 10-14 feet, his boats were hewn from memory without the use of power <b>tools,</b> <b>jigs</b> or templates, and from trees he cut himself on the Abaco Islands. Malone's Abaco dinghy is open-hulled and single-masted with a small [...] "banana board" [...] supporting the top of the sail. [...] "Scooting joyfully under sail across harbors and bights, Abaco dinghies are distinctive at a distance. Even at anchor they display a corky energy. Their design is as traditionally perfect for their intended use as is the Native American canoe." [...] Before the advent of outboard motors in the 1950s, Bahamian dinghies often provided the sole means of transportation for fishermen, farmers, and visiting families, as well as the occasional smuggler and rum-runner. If the wind died, a boat could be propelled with a single, long sculling oar off the transom. When fiberglass hulls finally supplanted wood construction in the 1960s, Malone's Abaco dinghies remained in strong demand, primarily from American sailing enthusiasts.|$|R
