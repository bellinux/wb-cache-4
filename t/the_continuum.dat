5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category to add to <b>the</b> <b>continuum,</b> and instead argued as {{the lack of a}} sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, anxiety or sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

40|$|Assessing student {{learning}} in university courses is commonly done using a rubric that arranges the assessment criteria and standards descriptors in a matrix style or grid format. This paper introduces an alternative style of grading tool known as <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> {{model of a}} guide to making judgements, which arranges assessment criteria based on a continuum of quality {{to look for in}} student work. The research participants attended focused professional development workshops then revised their criteria sheets based on <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> model and implemented them in teacher education classes. Interviews were conducted so that participants could reflect upon their experiences implementing <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> model and provide information about the design and efficacy of this new grading tool. The data suggests that <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> model has significant advantages over the traditional, matrix-style criteria sheet.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Continuum</b> hypothesis, {{introduced}} by Cantor, was presented by David Hilbert {{as the first}} of his twenty-three open problems in his address at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. Cantor's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert's celebrated encomium. The US philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce praised Cantor's set theory, and, following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Zurich in 1897, Hurwitz and Hadamard also both expressed their admiration. At that Congress, Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind. From 1905, Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator Philip Jourdain on the history of set theory and on Cantor's religious ideas. This was later published, as were several of his expository works.|$|E

In the year 2015, the A-Humans of A-Earth have created genetically engineered A-Humans capable of super intelligence and strength, as well as parasitic co-existence with machinery and animals, particularly humans. A terrorist organization known as Scarlet rose up within this race and sought to dominate the rest of the A-Humans and A-Earth by locking the planet down and keeping anyone else out. During the height of Scarlet's power, an assassination attempt on the group's leader, Epsilon-Eagle, was carried out by a special forces group. Scarlet fought back with their powers, and the battle somehow breached the space-time continuum. Epsilon was gravely injured and cast somewhere into <b>the</b> <b>continuum.</b>|$|E

Building from these perspectives and from continuing research in Philadelphia’s Cambodian and Puerto Rican communities, we propose an expanded continua model which takes into account not only biliterate contexts, media, and development, but also, crucially, the content of biliteracy. We conclude with comments on how the insights of <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> model of biliteracy can contribute to our understanding not only of linguistically diverse classrooms, but also of all classrooms...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis, first {{proposed}} as a conjecture by Cantor, was listed by David Hilbert {{as one of}} his 23 problems in 1900. Gödel showed that <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis cannot be disproven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with or without the axiom of choice), by developing the constructible universe of set theory in which <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis must hold. In 1963, Paul Cohen showed that <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> hypothesis cannot be proven from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (Cohen 1966). This independence result did not completely settle Hilbert's question, however, as it is possible that new axioms for set theory could resolve the hypothesis. Recent work along these lines has been conducted by W. Hugh Woodin, although its importance is not yet clear (Woodin 2001).|$|E

Though contributing many conceptual constructs, these fields have not focused on constructing an intercultural decision making model that is applicable for intercultural research. This article focuses on constructing a culture-general intercultural decision making model (ICDM model).

25|$|The {{validity}} of <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> assumption {{is dependent on}} the density of the gas and the application in question. For <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> assumption to be valid, the mean free path length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> assumption is reasonable. <b>The</b> <b>continuum</b> assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000ft/90km) or satellites in Low Earth orbit.

The Knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.|$|E

40|$|We study coupled axial and polar {{axisymmetric}} oscillations of {{a neutron}} star endowed with a strong magnetic field, having both poloidal and toroidal components. The toroidal component of the magnetic field is driving the coupling between the polar and axial oscillations. The star is composed of a fluid core {{as well as a}} solid crust. Using a two dimensional general relativistic simulation and a magnetic field B = 10 ^ 16 G, we study the change in the polar and axial spectrum caused by the coupling. We find that the axial spectrum suffers a dramatic change in its nature, losing its continuum character. In fact, we find that only the 'edges' of <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> survive, generating a discrete spectrum. As a consequence the crustal frequencies, that in our previous simulation could be absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>continua,</b> if they were embedded inside it, are now long living oscillations.
