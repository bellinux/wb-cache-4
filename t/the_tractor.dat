5|$|Bianchi {{collided}} with the rear of <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> crane, which caused extensive damage to his car; its roll bar was destroyed as it slid underneath. The impact jolted <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> crane off the ground, causing Sutil's car (suspended in the air by the crane) to fall to the ground. Marshals {{moved away from the}} scene to avoid being struck by Bianchi's Marussia. Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre. Transport by helicopter was impossible due to the weather; Bianchi was taken by ambulance with a police escort to Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, about 15km (9.3mi, a 32-minute drive) from the track.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, Aulie's {{father was}} using a tractor to clear snow off a frozen dugout in {{anticipation}} of an outdoor shinny game on New Year's Day. The ice could not support the weight of <b>the</b> <b>tractor,</b> and he fell through. Aulie was able to pull his father {{out of the water}} and get him to safety. The Canadian Red Cross honoured Aulie with their Rescuer Award for his act.|$|E
5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the couch with them.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tractors</b> had 8 h.p., 11 h.p., or 12 h.p. engines. The 7.25 pint {{fuel tank}} {{provided}} approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes of continuous mowing. <b>The</b> <b>tractors</b> also featured wide pneumatic tyres.|$|R
5|$|On lap 43 of the race, Bianchi {{lost control}} {{of his car and}} veered right towards the run-off area {{on the outside of the}} Dunlop Curve (turn seven) of the Suzuka Circuit. He {{collided}} with the rear of a tractor crane tending to the removal of Adrian Sutil's Sauber after Sutil had spun out of control and crashed in the same area a lap before. Spectators' video footage and photographs of the accident revealed that the left side of Bianchi's Marussia car was extensively damaged and the roll bar destroyed as it slid under <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> crane. The impact was such that <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> crane was partially jolted off the ground causing Sutil's Sauber, which was suspended in the air by the crane, to fall back to the ground. The race was stopped and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in {{the city}} began to wind down on 14 March. The day was spent with the LSSAH {{clearing}} the remnants of Soviet resistance, pushing east along a broad front. By {{the end of the}} day, the entire city was declared to be back in German hands. Despite the declaration that the city had fallen, fighting continued on 15 and 16 March, as German units cleared the remnants of resistance in <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> works factory complex, in the southern outskirts of the city.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{industry}} included <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> factory of David Brown Limited, {{which was}} located in Leigh following the acquisition in 1955 of Harrison, McGregor and Guest's Albion range of farm machinery products. Rope-manufacture was another local industry: Mansley's Rope works on Twist Lane made rope by hand, using a rope walk. The factory burnt down in 1912. Anchor Cables had a large works close to the Bridgewater Canal. The company was bought by Callender's Cables, in 1903, later to become British Insulated Callender's Cables (BICC), part of Balfour Beatty. Another major 20th century employer was Sutcliffe Speakman, which made activated carbon and brick-making equipment.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Armstrong <b>Tractor</b> Company again started {{production}} of Speedex Tractors. This company {{was based in}} Armstrong, PA. The company only produced <b>tractors</b> with <b>the</b> Speedex name {{for a short period}} before changing the name of <b>the</b> <b>tractors</b> to Strongland. Armstrong continued {{production of}} <b>the</b> <b>tractors</b> in <b>the</b> same basic design as <b>the</b> Speedex <b>Tractors</b> and continued producing parts and accessories for owners of the Speedex line of tractors.|$|R
5000|$|The Mechanical Transport Committee {{remained}} {{convinced of}} <b>the</b> <b>tractor's</b> possibilities, provided {{it was used}} in careful conjunction with horse teams. However, the Royal Artillery disagreed. The Director of Artillery, Brigadier General Stanley von Donop, emphasized <b>the</b> <b>tractor's</b> shortcomings and was unenthusiastic.|$|R
25|$|The {{technology}} for <b>the</b> driverless <b>tractor</b> has been evolving since its beginnings in the 1940s. There are now several {{different approaches to}} building and programming <b>the</b> <b>tractors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him aside to tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set of wheels, allowing the operator to turn <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{manufactures}} {{truck and}} bus tyres sold under the Nokian Hakkapeliitta brand. Steer, traction, and trailer tyres are marketed. Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines, including <b>the</b> <b>Tractor</b> Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres, which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary. Nokian forestry tyres include the Skidder and Cut-To-Length model lines. The Skidder tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre tread measurement. Smaller bar angles are associated with higher traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to {{the ups and downs}} of world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands, followed by more price rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market. A series of Acts of Parliament followed, designed to give price support and grants to farmers. After the Second World War and the associated rationing, there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production. This lasted until the late 1970s, resulting in more intensive farming. More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies. At the same time, the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three. There was increasing mechanisation of Scottish agriculture. The horse was replaced by <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> and the combine harvester. This meant that farming became less labour-intensive. In 1951, 88,000 people worked in Scottish agriculture full-time, but by 1991 it had fallen to about 25,000, leading to more depopulation of rural areas. This helped make Scottish agriculture among the most efficient in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise then learns of {{an unmarked}} vessel {{approaching}} Haven. Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) recognizes it as Tarellian, {{a race that}} they had thought to be wiped out by a highly lethal and contagious virus. When they contact the ship, they find a handful of Tarellian refugees that have been travelling at sub-light speeds to Haven in hopes of finding an isolated location to live {{out the rest of}} their lives in peace. Picard insists they cannot go to the planet for fear of spreading the virus, and has the Tarellian vessel placed in a tractor beam. Wyatt recognizes one of the Tarellians, Ariana (Danitza Kingsley), from his dreams, and she too recognizes Wyatt. Wyatt tells Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) that he will transport some medical supplies to them, but transports himself along with the supplies. When the crew discovers this, Wyatt's parents demand Picard bring Wyatt back to the Enterprise, but Picard insists that he cannot return, as Wyatt would now carry the Tarellian virus. Wyatt promises his parents, Troi, and the rest of the crew that he knew that this would be destiny, and is happy to try to help cure the Tarellian virus. Wyatt convinces the Tarellians to leave Haven and search for help elsewhere. Picard orders <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> beam to be dropped and allows the vessel to depart the system.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{incursion}} was countered by the RAR, {{but after a}} tactical error in its third engagement with the guerrillas led to casualties, the African Rifles were joined by 2 Commando, RLI on 25 August 1967. The insurgents were consistently undone in their incursions by the suspicion of Rhodesia's rural blacks, whose tribal chiefs and headmen would often work together to inform the police and security forces of the infiltrators' presence. This proved to be no exception: when a cadre visited a local kraal early on 31 August to obtain food, an old woman invited him to stay and kept him there while she sent a young girl to alert the security forces. 7 Troop, 2 Commando arrived at 07:20 and captured the insurgent, who then guided 7 Troop, led by Lieutenant Charl Viljoen, and a platoon of RAR men to where his five comrades were encamped. The combined force surrounded the guerrillas and opened fire, killing four; the fifth escaped and returned to Zambia. The next day, on 1 September, some 2 Commando troops in ambush were informed by a tractor driver {{that he had been}} given money by 14 guerrillas the previous night to buy mielie-meal for them, and that they would be collecting it from him at his kraal that evening. A sweep was planned; <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> driver was briefed and returned to the kraal with the mielie-meal while 2 Commando and the RAR formed a cordon around it. The following morning the soldiers performed their sweep but failed to find the enemy, who were already gone. The insurgents, who were actually 17 in number and all South African Umkhonto fighters, crossed the border into Botswana and were arrested there on 3 September. Of the 79 cadres who had crossed the border on 1 August, 29 were killed and 17 captured within Rhodesia, 29 were arrested in Botswana, where one also died, one was arrested in Durban and one escaped back to Zambia. One remained unaccounted for. Nickel was officially closed at 06:00 on 8 September 1967.|$|E
50|$|By this time, Perkins had {{numerous}} influential supporters and {{the sale of}} <b>the</b> <b>tractors</b> continued. In 1803, Thomas Green Fessenden published his poem “Terrible Tractoration” in favor of Perkins and as a satire on other physicians. Perkins' son died in 1810. Only after that did the popularity of <b>the</b> <b>tractors</b> begin to wane.|$|R

5|$|NYU has 470,000 living alumni as of 2015. At least 37 Nobel Prize {{winners are}} {{affiliated}} with NYU. NYU {{is associated with}} a great number of important inventions and discoveries. For example, cardiac defibrillator and artificial cardiac pacemaker (Barouh Berkovits), closed-chest cardiac defibrillator (William B. Kouwenhoven), laser (Gordon Gould), atom bomb (Frederick Reines), polio vaccine (Albert Sabin), RFID (Mario Cardullo), telephone handset (Robert G. Brown), wireless microphone (Hung-Chang Lin), first digital image scanner (Russell A. Kirsch), television (Benjamin Adler), light beer (Joseph Owades), non-stick cookware (John Gilbert), black hole thermodynamics (Jacob Bekenstein), polymer science (Herman Francis Mark), microwave (Ernst Weber), X-ray crystallography (Paul Peter Ewald), barcode (Jerome Swartz), structure of the DNA (Francis Crick), tau lepton (Martin Lewis Perl), processes for creating food coloring, decaffeination and sugar substitute (Torunn Atteraas Garin), processes for the mass production of penicillin (Jasper H. Kane), X-ray generator and rotational radiation therapy (John G. Trump), nuclear reactor and hydrogen bomb (John Archibald Wheeler), and contact lenses (Norman Gaylord), among many others. Alumnus Fred Waller who invented Cinerama and the Waller Gunnery Trainer, also obtained the first patent for a water ski. The first patents for touch screen cash machine (Richard J. Orford), and zoom lens (Leonard Bergstein), were also obtained by NYU alumni. Some of the most prolific inventors in American history are NYU alumni, for example Jerome H. Lemelson whose 605 patents involved the cordless telephone, fax machine, videocassette recorder and camcorder, among others; Samuel Ruben whose inventions include electric battery; James Wood who invented cable-lift elevator, fabricated the steel cables for the Brooklyn Bridge and contributed to the development of lockmaking, submarine, electric generator, electric motor, transformer and the design of the refrigerator; and Albert Macovski whose innovations include the single-tube color camera and real-time phased array imaging for ultrasound. NYU is the birthplace of <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> beam and 5G. Before and during World War II, NYU's Tandon School of Engineering worked on problems whose solution {{led to the development of}} radar, and later broke ground in electromagnetic theory, electronics in general, and solved re-entry problems of the manned space capsules, as well as helped develop and design the NASDAQ Automated Quote System and trading floors. Developer of the early telephone systems in the United States Bancroft Gherardi Jr., developer of the submarine communications facilities Jack M. Sipress, inventor of Italy's first computer Mario Tchou, designer of the Panama Canal locks Henry C. Goldmark, designer of the Pentagon Hugh John Casey, designer of the Apollo Lunar Module Thomas J.

25|$|Driving <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> {{with the}} furrow-side wheels in the furrow bottom {{provides}} the most efficient line of draft between tractor and plough. It is also easier to steer <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> and driving with the front wheel against the furrow wall will keep the front furrow at the correct width. This is less satisfactory when using a tractor with very wide front tyres, for although they make better use of <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> power, the tyres may compact part of the last furrow slice turned on the previous run. The use of furrow widener or a longer mouldboard on the rear body will overcome the problem. The latter moves the soil further towards the ploughed land leaving more room for <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> wheels on the next run.|$|E
25|$|Articulated lorries or {{semi-trailers}} feature two number plates {{placed at}} the rear of the trailer. One is designated for <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> unit, and another for the trailer it pulls. <b>The</b> <b>tractor</b> unit's license number follows standard conventions for motorised vehicles, while the trailer's own number plate uses a T/Sx #### format, with the T/ prefix is a constant for all Malaysian trailers. Both plates have white characters on a black background.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the {{majority}} of fully autonomous tractors navigate using lasers that bounce signals off several mobile transponders located around the field. These lasers are accompanied with 150MHz radios to deal with line-of-sight issues. Instead of drivers, <b>the</b> <b>tractors</b> have controllers. Controllers are people that supervise <b>the</b> <b>tractors</b> without being inside them. These controllers can supervise multiple tractors on multiple fields from one location.|$|R

25|$|A tractor is a {{distinctive}} farm vehicle {{specifically designed to}} deliver a high tractive effort at slow speeds, {{for the purposes of}} hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on <b>the</b> <b>tractor,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized. While steam powered tractors had been built earlier, In 1892, John Froelich invented and built the first gasoline-powered tractor in Clayton County, Iowa.|$|E
25|$|Modern ploughs {{are usually}} {{multiple}} reversible ploughs, {{mounted on a}} tractor via a three-point linkage. These commonly have between two {{and as many as}} seven mouldboards– and semi-mounted ploughs (the lifting of which is supplemented by a wheel about halfway along their length) can have as many as eighteen mouldboards. The hydraulic system of <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> is used to lift and reverse the implement, as well as to adjust furrow width and depth. The ploughman still has to set the draughting linkage from <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> so that the plough is carried at the proper angle in the soil. This angle and depth can be controlled automatically by modern tractors. As a complement to the rear plough a two or three mouldboards-plough can be mounted on the front of <b>the</b> <b>tractor</b> if it is equipped with front three-point linkage.|$|E
