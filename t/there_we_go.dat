6000|$|Leaving him {{standing}} <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{up to the}} top room. I tapped at the door, and a little shrill voice inside said, [...] "We are locked in. Mrs. Blinder's got the key!" ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{next day}} mamma {{planned to take}} the four o'clock car back to [...] Hartford.

I have been ill and out of heart, and ill again and again ill, till I am weary of it, and glad indeed to try the pitch-farthing hazard of a trip to Colorado or New Mexico. <b>There</b> <b>we</b> <b>go,</b> if I prove fit for the start, on August 20th.|$|E

6000|$|When <b>we</b> got <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> {{into a room}} by ourselves, and Miss Griffin {{called in}} to her assistance, Mesrour, chief of the dusky guards of the Hareem.

60|$|Moreover, we {{have good}} news from East London. General Gatacre is stolidly and patiently {{repairing}} the opening misfortune of his campaign: has learned by experience {{much of the new}} conditions of the war. Strange that the Boers did not advance after their victory; stranger still that they retired from Dordrecht. Never mind whether their stillness be due to national cautiousness or good defensive arrangements. Since they don't want Dordrecht, let us go there; and <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> accordingly. Out of this there arises on New Year's Day a successful skirmish, in the account of which the name of De Montmorency is mentioned. In Egypt the name was associated with madcap courage. Here they talk of prudent skill. The double reputation should be valuable.|$|E

It was Citizen Captain Sullivan who gave the toast.|$|R

5000|$|Ahí Vamos (Spanish for <b>There</b> <b>We</b> <b>Go)</b> is a 2006 studio album by Argentine rock {{musician}} Gustavo Cerati. The {{album was}} met with both positive reviews by critics and popularity, especially in Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. The first single released from the album was [...] "Crimen", which received airplay starting in April 2006 and gained huge popularity in Latin America and Spain. The second single, released in September was [...] "La Excepción". The album was certified Platinum in Argentina with only pre-ordered sales, and attained Gold status in Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|A {{special case}} of {{semantic}} syllepsis {{occurs when a}} word or phrase is used both in its figurative and literal sense at the same time. Then, {{it is not necessary}} for the governing phrase to relate to two other parts of the sentence. One example, from the song [...] "What's My Name?", is: [...] "Okay, <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> / Only thing we have on is the radio." [...] Another example is in an advertisement for a transport company: [...] "We go a long way for you." [...] This type of syllepsis is similar to a homonymic pun.|$|E

60|$|We rode {{on toward}} camp, and out upon a bench that bordered the lofty red wall of rock. From <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> down into heavy forest again, dim and gray, with its dank, {{penetrating}} odor, and oppressive stillness. The forest primeval! When we rode {{out of that}} into open slopes the afternoon was far advanced, and long shadows lay across the distant ranges. When we reached camp, supper and a fire to warm cold wet feet were exceedingly welcome. I was tired.|$|R

40|$|A self-avowed French {{characteristic}} is ronchonner—to complain, grumble, grouse—and when {{it comes}} to corpora, there is certainly much to be unhappy about in France. This is especially true of spoken corpora, or applications of corpus linguistics in language learning, never mind the two together. We begin here by examining some of the possible causes and implications of the current state of affairs. Drawing on our own corpora in French of over 400, 000 words, we show that that characteristic features of speech a) are not random, b) can be modelled, and c) are often communicatively efficient in terms of conversational strategies and information organisation. Given these three basic precepts, we argue that they ought to find their place in language learning materials. From <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> on to discuss major theoretical reasons for promoting spoken corpora as a means both of identifying spoken features, as well as for teaching and learning them. In particular, we suggest that giving learners direct access to corpora allows them to build their own knowledge inductively based on authentic spoken texts, and promotes learner autonomy. This discussion is placed {{in the context of a}} new project at the CRAPEL to create an internet site to facilitate the integration of foreign students into French academic life...|$|E

More than a decade has passed since research on automatic recognition of emotion from speech has become a new field of research in line with its 'big brothers' speech and speaker recognition. This article attempts to provide a short overview on where we are today, how we got there and what this can reveal us on where to go next and how we could arrive there. In a first part, we address the basic phenomenon reflecting the last fifteen years, commenting on databases, modelling and annotation, the unit of analysis and prototypicality. We then shift to automatic processing including discussions on features, classification, robustness, evaluation, and implementation and system integration. From <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> to the first comparative challenge on emotion recognition from speech-the INTERSPEECH 2009 Emotion Challenge, organised by (part of) the authors, including the description of the Challenge's database, Sub-Challenges, participants and their approaches, the winners, and the fusion of results to the actual learnt lessons before we finally address the ever-lasting problems and future promising attempts.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we ask what societal, cultural, {{political}} and disciplinary purpose that Landsarbejdstjenesten (LAT) served {{and how the}} national socialist ideology expresses itself in the organisation. After having introduced the subject and {{the social and political}} situation that led to the rise of national socialism, we go through the historiography and our methodological considerations during our gathering of source material. We then go through a brief explanation of national socialist ideology before {{we take a look at}} the political party Danmarks Nationalsocialistiske Arbejderparti (DNSAP), from which LAT was founded. We then introduce LAT and the german Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD) in order to take a closer look at their internal relations. After introducing LAT and RAD we go through the role of anti-communism and anti-semitism in creating an enemy of the national socialist vision. From <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through the propaganda and recruitment campaigns of LAT and DNSAP. After going through the different work camps, the paper focuses on the education of LAT‟s leaders and workers. We then go on to analyse LAT‟s gender- and body ideals, before we end with a chapter on the role and integration of symbols in LAT‟s creation of identity. In the end, we conclude that the national socialist ideology is an inseparable part of LAT, and that the main reason that we have not seen LAT make public displays of racism, is because of the lack of political support for DNSAP and national socialism in general...|$|E
