40|$|Drought {{conditions}} in 2012 {{were some of}} the most severe in recent history. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the impact of drought on quality, quantity, and <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> (<b>TEY)</b> of three bioenergy feedstocks, corn stover, mixed grasses from Conservation Reserve Program lands, and Miscanthus × giganteus. To assess drought effects on these feedstocks, samples from 2010 (minimal to no drought) and 2012 (severe drought) were compared from multiple locations in the US. In all feedstocks, drought significantly increased extractives and reduced structural sugars and lignin; subsequently, TEYs were reduced 10 – 15 %. Biomass yields were significantly reduced for M. × giganteus and mixed grasses. When reduction in quality and quantity were combined, TEYs decreased 26 – 59 %. Drought negatively affected biomass quality and quantity that resulted in significant TEY reductions. Such fluctuations in biomass quality and yield may have significant consequences for developing lignocellulosic biorefineries...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{suitability}} of three perennial, herbaceous, lignocellulosic grasses (Arundo donax, Saccharum spontaneous spp. aegyptiacum and Miscanthus x giganteus) {{for the production of}} second-generation bioethanol in semi-arid Mediterranean environment was studied. Crops were established in spring 2002, supplying irrigation and nitrogen fertilization up to 2004 / 2005 growing season. Subsequently, crops were grown without any agronomic input and harvested annually. Data reported in this paper refers to 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010 growing seasons. Aboveground dry matter (DM) yield was higher in Arundo (35. 4 ± 2. 1 Mg ha – 1 in 2009 and 32. 2 ± 1. 9 Mg ha – 1 in 2010 harvest) than in Saccharum (27. 3 ± 2. 0 and 23. 9 ± 1. 9 Mg ha – 1, respectively) and Miscanthus (19. 6 ± 2. 8 and 17. 2 ± 1. 6 Mg ha – 1, respectively). Structural polysaccharides of the raw material were higher in Miscanthus (63. 4 % w/w) followed by Saccharum (61. 5 % w/w) and Arundo (57. 6 % w/w). The same trend was identified for the cellulose content (41. 0 %, 36. 8 % and 34. 6 %, respectively). The highest values in the total hemicellulose complex were observed in Saccharum (24. 7 %), followed by Arundo (23. 1 %) and Miscanthus (22. 4 %). The composition of structural polysaccharides leads to a higher <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> (<b>TEY)</b> from one dry ton of Miscanthus feedstock (kg DM Mg – 1), followed by Saccharum and Arundo. On the other hand, the TEY per unit surface (Mg ha – 1) was greater in Arundo than in Saccharum and Miscanthus. When compared to other lignocellulosic sources used in the second-generation bioethanol technology, such as agricultural residues, woody species and other herbaceous perennial crops, Arundo, Saccharum and Miscanthus showed a great potential in terms of TEY ha – 1. Given the high levels of biomass yield and composition of structural polysaccharides, the three species might be introduced into the Mediterranean cropping systems to supply lignocellulosic biomass for second-generation industrial plants or bio-refineries...|$|E

The <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> was reported taking into account the biomass yield per surface area unit.|$|R
40|$|Jerusalem {{artichoke}} (Helianthus tuberosus L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} suitable materials for ethanol production as it contains nearly 20 % of carbohydrates, 70 - 90 % of which is inulin. In the present study, the batch ethanol fermentation of Jerusalem artichoke juices by the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis TISTR 548 was investigated. Acid and enzymatic hydrolysis of inulin in Jerusalem artichoke juices were compared and the results show that acid hydrolysis at 80 oC for 40 min using concentrated sulfuric acid gave the maximum reducing sugars content as well as <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> (0. 42 g g- 1 utilized sugars) and ethanol productivity (0. 65 g l- 1 h- 1) with 83. 19 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield.</b> Effect of initial pH of ethanol production medium and the inoculum size of Z. mobilis on ethanol production of acid hydrolyzed Jerusalem artichoke juices was determined.

40|$|The {{chemical}} conservation {{was chosen}} {{in the study}} as the method for preserving fresh corn grain for distilleries. Five types of preserved corn samples were prepared. The control (with no additives) and four preserved with the preparation, based on formic and propionic acids (KemiSile 2000 Plus), at different levels. All the samples were stored for two months. Ethanol fermentations of low-temperature-cooked and pressure-cooked corn starch were carried out using commercial distillery yeast. The yeast strain, after starch hydrolysis with two enzymes, was able to produce 86 - 93 % of <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> from low-temperature-cooked corn. The ethanol production was almost equal to that produced from pressure-cooked corn starch (121 &deg;C), which was 87 - 94 % of <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield.</b> The quality of distillates was also investigated. The most common by-products found were: acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, propanol, isobutanol and 3 -metylo- 1 -butanol.

30|$|<b>Ethanol</b> <b>yields</b> were {{calculated}} at two levels: an overall yield and a metabolic <b>yield.</b> The overall <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> {{was based on}} total supplied glucose and xylose; i.e. the sum of glucose and xylose present in the slurries, including monomers, oligomers, and polymers. The metabolic <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> was based on consumed glucose and xylose. The mass of glucose and xylose available {{in the form of}} polymers in the WIS were corrected with factors 1.111 and 1.136, respectively, to account for the addition of water to the monomeric units during hydrolysis. The percentage of maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> was based on a theoretical stoichiometric yield of 0.51  g·g− 1 on glucose and xylose.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, {{expression}} of the flocculent phenotype appears to negatively affect ethanol production, with both recombinant strains producing less ethanol than the wild-type when incubated at 30 °C; but the difference was minimal when the yeast were grown at 42 °C (Figure 5 B). Accordingly, the fermentation efficiency (estimated as the maximal <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> per substrate consumed) followed the same pattern as the ethanol production by the three strains (Figure 5 C).|$|R

A three-year field study was conducted to evaluate three cultivars of sweet sorghum as bioenergy crops in the Southeast United States (Fort Valley, Georgia) : Dale, M 81 E and Theis. Parameters evaluated were: plant density, stalk height, and diameter, number of nodes, biomass yield, juice yield, °Bx, sugar production, and <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields.</b> Yields were measured at 85, 99, and 113 days after planting. Plant fresh weight was the highest for Theis (1096 g) and the lowest for Dale (896 g). M 81 E reported the highest stalk dry weight (27 Mg ha− 1) and Theis reported the lowest (21 Mg ha− 1). Theis ranked the highest °Bx (14. 9), whereas M 81 E was the lowest (13. 2). Juice yield was the greatest for M 81 E (10915 L ha− 1) and the lowest for Dale (6724 L ha− 1). Theoretical conservative sugar yield was the greatest for Theis (13 Mg ha− 1) and the lowest for Dale (9 Mg ha− 1). <b>Theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> was the greatest for Theis (7619 L ha− 1) and the lowest for Dale (5077 L ha− 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{actual and}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields</b> from biomass {{conversion}} {{processes such as}} simultanteous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) requires expensive, complex fermentation assays, and extensive compositional analyses of the biomass sample. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-destructive technology {{that can be used}} to obtain rapid, low-cost, high-throughput, and accurate estimates of agricultural product composition. In this study, broad-based NIRS calibrations were developed for switchgrass biomass {{that can be used to}} estimate over 20 components including cell wall and soluble sugars and also ethanol production and pentose sugars released as measured using a laboratory SSF procedure. With this information, an additional 13 complex feedstock traits can be determined including <b>theoretical</b> and actual <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields</b> from hexose fermentation. The NIRS calibrations were used to estimate feedstock composition and conversion information for biomass samples from a multi-year switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) biomass cultivar evaluation trial. There were significant differences among switchgrass strains for all biomass conversion and composition traits including actual <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields,</b> ETOHL (L Mg− 1) and <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields,</b> ETOHTL (L Mg− 1), based on cell wall and non-cell wall composition NIRS analyses. ETOHL means ranged from 98 to 115 L Mg− 1 while ETOHTL means ranged from 203 to 222 L Mg− 1. Because of differences in both biomass yields and conversion efficiency, there were significant differences among strains for both actual (2, 534 – 3, 720 L ha− 1) and theoretical (4, 878 – 7, 888 L ha− 1) ethanol production per hectare.

It is currently deemed as a highly suitable additive and substitute energy source to replace fossil based fuel. In this study, bioethanol was produced from sago hampas by using commercial amylase, cellulase and Saccharomyces cerevisiae via sequential saccharification and simultaneous fermentation (SSSF), {{a modified version of the}} simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process. SSSF was performed on sago hampas at 2. 5 and 5. 0 % (w/v) feedstock load for five days. The samples taken from the SSSF broths were analysed via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for ethanol, glucose and acetic acid production. From the results obtained, SSSF with 5. 0 % sago hampas loading exhibited the highest ethanol production at 14. 13 g/L (77. 43 % of <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield),</b> while SSSF using 2. 5 % sago hampas loading produced ethanol at 6. 45 g/L (69. 24 % of <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield).</b> This study has shown that ethanol not only can be produced from sago hampas using different enzyme mixtures and S. cerevisiae via SSSF, but yields were also high, making this process highly promising for the production of cheap and sustainable ethanol as fuel...|$|R
40|$|Canna edulis ker is a {{potential}} feedstock for ethanol production because of its low nutrition requirements and the high starch content of its tubers. The processing of C. edulis {{is limited by the}} high viscosity of the biomass. In this study, cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) containing acid xylanase and beta-glucanase were successful in reducing the viscosity (from 167. 30 Pa s to 8. 66 Pa s) at 50 degrees C for 120 min. The effect of CWDEs on simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) was investigated. Addition of CWDEs before SSF, resulted in an increase in total sugar and fermentable sugar. Meanwhile, the viscosity decreased sharply from approximately 200. 00 Pa s to 2. 98 Pa s, thereby improving the fermentation parameters and the mass fraction of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> was 94. 5 %. Only special demand of nutritional ingredients was nitrogen, urea at 750 mg kg (1) was found to be suitable for this purpose. In the verification experiments, the mass fraction of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> in a 5 L fermentor was 98. 3 %.

40|$|Background While {{simultaneous}} saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) {{is considered}} to be a promising process for bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol, there are still relatively little demo-plant data and operating experiences reported in the literature. In the current work, we designed a SSCF process and scaled up from lab to demo scale reaching 4 % (w/v) ethanol using xylose rich corncobs. Results Seven different recombinant xylose utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were evaluated for their fermentation performance in hydrolysates of steam pretreated corncobs. Two strains, RHD- 15 and KE 6 - 12 with highest <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> and lowest xylitol yield, respectively were further screened in SSCF using the whole slurry from pretreatment. Similar <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields</b> were reached with both strains, however, KE 6 - 12 was chosen as the preferred strain since it produced 26 % lower xylitol from consumed xylose compared to RHD- 15. Model SSCF experiments with glucose or hydrolysate feed in combination with prefermentation resulted in 79 % of xylose consumption and more than 75 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> on available glucose and xylose in lab and PDU scales. The results suggest that for an efficient xylose conversion to ethanol controlled release of glucose from enzymatic hydrolysis and low levels of glucose concentration must be maintained throughout the SSCF. Fed-batch SSCF in PDU with addition of enzymes at three different time points facilitated controlled release of glucose and hence co-consumption of glucose and xylose was observed yielding 76 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> on available glucose and xylose at 7. 9 % water insoluble solids (WIS). With a fed-batch SSCF in combination with prefermentation and a feed of substrate and enzymes 47 and 40 g l- 1 of ethanol corresponding to 68 % and 58 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> on available glucose and xylose were produced at 10. 5 % WIS in PDU and demo scale, respectively. The strain KE 6 - 12 was able to completely consume xylose within 76 h during the fermentation of hydrolysate in a 10 m 3 demo scale bioreactor. Conclusions The potential of SSCF is improved in combination with prefermentation and a feed of substrate and enzymes. It was possible to successfully reproduce the fed-batch SSCF at demo scale producing 4 % (w/v) ethanol which is the minimum economical requirement for efficient lignocellulosic bioethanol production process...|$|R

Two hundred and thirty-four yeast isolates from Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries, i. e., Thailand, The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Vietnam were obtained. Five thermotolerant yeasts, designated Saccharomyces cerevisiae KKU-VN 8, KKU-VN 20, and KKU-VN 27, Pichia kudriavzevii KKU-TH 33 and P. kudriavzevii KKU-TH 43, demonstrated high temperature and ethanol tolerance levels up to 45 °C and 13 % (v/v), respectively. All five strains produced higher ethanol concentrations and exhibited greater productivities and yields than the industrial strain S. cerevisiae TISTR 5606 during high-temperature fermentation at 40 °C and 43 °C.

40|$|Abstract Background Corn stover {{composition}} changes considerably {{throughout the}} growing season and also varies between the various fractions of the plant. These differences can impact optimal pretreatment conditions, enzymatic digestibility and maximum achievable sugar yields {{in the process of}} converting lignocellulosics to ethanol. The goal of this project was to determine which combination of corn stover fractions provides the most benefit to the biorefinery in terms of sugar yields and to determine the preferential order in which fractions should be harvested. Ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) pretreatment, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis, was performed on early and late harvest corn stover fractions (stem, leaf, husk and cob). Sugar yields were used to optimize scenarios for the selective harvest of corn stover assuming 70 % or 30 % collection of the total available stover. Results The optimal AFEX conditions for all stover fractions, regardless of harvest period, were: 1. 5 (g NH 3 g - 1 biomass); 60 % moisture content (dry-weight basis; dwb), 90 °C and 5 min residence time. Enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted using cellulase, β-glucosidase, and xylanase at 31. 3, 41. 3, and 3. 1 mg g - 1 glucan, respectively. The optimal harvest order for selectively harvested corn stover (SHCS) was husk > leaf > stem > cob. This harvest scenario, combined with optimal AFEX pretreatment conditions, gave a <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> of 2051 L ha - 1 and 912 L ha - 1 for 70 % and 30 % corn stover collection, respectively.

Resources may be more effectively spent on improving sustainable harvesting, thereby increasing potential <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields</b> per hectare harvested, and optimizing biomass processing rather than focusing on the selective harvest of specific corn stover fractions. </p...|$|R

It was also discovered that the lowest energy consumption occurred when energy input was fixed at 108. kJ (900. W for 2. min), amounting to 33. kJ and 69. kJ to produce one gram glucose after hydrothermal hydrolysis and one gram ethanol after fermentation, respectively. The developed technique for SPW resulted in higher energy saving compared to previous techniques {{in the absence of}} enzymes, acid or base catalyst...|$|R
40|$|The maximum {{growth rate}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 96581, adapted to {{fermentation}} of spent sulphite liquor (SSL), was 7 times higher in SSL of hardwood than the maximum {{growth rate of}} bakers' yeast. ATCC 96581 was studied in the continuous fermentation of spruce hydrolysate without and with cell recycling. Ethanol productivity by ATCC 96581 in continuous fermentation of an enzymatic hydrolysate of spruce was increased 4. 6 times by employing cell recycling. On-line analysis of CO 2, glucose and ethanol (using a microdialysis probe) was used to investigate the effect of fermentation pH on cell growth and ethanol production, and to set the dilution rate. Cell growth in the spruce hydrolysates was strongly influenced by fermentation pH. The fermentation was operated in continuous mode for 210 h and a <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> on fermentable sugars was obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} engineered Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius strain is an industrially potent thermophilic ethanologen. We {{employ a}} systematic approach {{to improve our}} understanding of the fermentation process using cellobiose as the substrate. Dynamic metabolic flux analysis clearly shows that the fluxes from pyruvate to lactate and formate are both strictly constrained throughout the process and that both the maximum <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> (0. 46 C/C) and the maximum specific productivity (19. 8 mmolC (gDCW) h) occur at late-exponential growth phase. Accordingly, extreme pathway analysis reduces the metabolic network into a macro reaction scheme, on which a dynamic metabolic model is built. The model is validated with experimental data, parameters are identified with confidence intervals, and global sensitivity analysis (Sobol' method) is performed. Model-based optimization predicts that ethanol productivity could increase from 34. 2 in a typical batch process to 55. 3 mmolLh in an optimum fed-batch process with higher <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield.</b> Furthermore, the optimal operating regime was identified to be continuous fermentation process with gas stripping, in which a high ethanol productivity of 113 mmolLh, i. e., 26. 8 mmolC (gDCW) h, corresponding to 90. 2 % of the maximum <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> could be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Surveys of {{indigenous}} weeds in six provinces {{located in the}} low northern part of Thailand were undertaken to determine the potential of weed biomass for bio-energy and bio-ethanol. The results reveal {{that most of the}} weed samples had low moisture contents and high lower heating values (LHVs). The LHVs at the highest level, ranging from 17. 7 to 18. 9 Mg/kg, and at the second highest level, ranging from 16. 4 to 17. 6 Mg/kg, were obtained from 11 and 31 weed species, respectively. It was found that most of the collected weed samples contained high cellulose and low lignin contents. Additionally, an estimate of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields</b> based on the amount of cellulose and hemicellulose in each weed species indicated that a high <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> resulted from weed biomasses with high cellulose and hemicellulose contents. Among the collected weed species, the highest level of <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield,</b> ranging from 478. 9 to 548. 5 L/ton (substrate), was achieved from 11 weed species. It was demonstrated that most of the collected weed species tested have the potential for thermal conversion and can be used as substrates for ethanol production...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} pretreatment technologies, including sulfuric acid, hot-water, NaOH, and MgCl 2 pretreatments, on the fermentation of xylose and glucose to ethanol by Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 24858 and Escherichia coli KO 11 were investigated. In this study, cattail {{was used as}} the feedstock. The use of aquatic plant cattails to produce biofuel will add value to land and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by replacing petroleum products. The pretreated biomass first was enzymatically hydrolyzed for 2 days, followed by a 2 -day Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) using S. cerevisiae. The glucose to <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields</b> were approximately 85 to 91 % of the theoretical yield for this S. cerevisiae strain. Glucose and xylose released from cattail cellulose and hemicellulose could be fermented to ethanol using E. coli KO 11, resulting in approximately 85 % of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> using either a Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation (SHF) process or a SSF process. In order to improve the sugars to <b>ethanol</b> <b>yields,</b> a detoxification process is necessary to remove the inhibitory compounds produced during the acid pretreatment process. Among the four pretreatment methods, the dilute acid pretreatment was found to be superior, and additional research is required to optimize the economics of the overall biorefinery process...|$|R
40|$|NfnAB catalyzes the {{reversible}} {{transfer of}} electrons from reduced ferredoxin and NADH to 2 NADP. The NfnAB complex has been hypothesized {{to be the}} main enzyme for ferredoxin oxidization in strains of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum engi-neered for increased ethanol production. NfnAB complex activity was detectable in crude cell extracts of T. saccharolyticum. Activity was also detected using activity staining of native PAGE gels. The nfnAB gene was deleted in different strains of T. sac-charolyticum to determine its effect on end product formation. In wild-type T. saccharolyticum, deletion of nfnAB resulted in a 46 % increase in H 2 formation but otherwise little change in other fermentation products. In two engineered strains with 80 % <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield,</b> loss of nfnAB caused two different responses: in one strain, <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> decreased to about 30 % of the theoretical value, while another strain had no change in <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield.</b> Biochemical analysis of cell extracts showed that the nfnAB strain with decreased <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> had NADPH-linked alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity, while thenfnAB strain with unchanged <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield</b> had NADH-linked ADH activity. Deletion of nfnAB caused loss of NADPH-linked ferredoxin oxi-doreductase activity in all cell extracts. Significant NADH-linked ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity was seen in all cell extracts, including those that had lost nfnAB. This suggests that there is an unidentified NADH:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (distinct from nfnAB) playing a role in ethanol formation. The NfnAB complex {{plays a key role in}} generating NADPH in a strain that had be-come reliant on NADPH-ADH activity...|$|R
40|$|Published {{online in}} Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary. com) The {{performances}} of five yeast strains under {{three levels of}} toxicity were evaluated using hydrolysates from lodgepole pine pretreated by Sulfite Pretreatment to Overcome the Recal-citrance of Lignocelluloses (SPORL). The highest level of toxicity was represented by the whole pretreated biomass slurry, while intermediate toxicity was represented by the hydroly-sate with partial loading of pretreatment spent liquor. The zero toxicity was represented using the enzymatic hydrolysate produced from thoroughly washed SPORL lodgepole pine solids. The results indicate that strains D 5 A and YRH 400 can tolerate the whole pretreated biomass slurry to produce 90. 1 and 73. 5 % <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield.</b> Strains Y 1528, YRH 403, and FPL 450 did not grow in whole hydrolysate cultures and were observed to have lower ethanol productivities than D 5 A and YRH 400 on the hydrolysate with intermedi-ate toxicity. Both YRH 400 and YRH 403 were genetically engineered for xylose fermentatio...|$|R
40|$|Arundo donax {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the effect of enzyme and substrate concentration on hydrolysis, pre-hydrolysis and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (PSSF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). Hydrolysis was performed at 37 and 50 °C. At the highest biomass (10 %) and enzyme (69. 63 FPU g- 1 cellulose) loading, the highest glucose concentration (32. 35 g L- 1) was obtained (at 50 °C). SSF resulted in a cellulose conversion (91. 93 %) and an ethanol concentration (19. 77 g L- 1) higher than those obtained using PSSF with pre-hydrolysis at 37 °C (86. 86 %; 18. 78 g L- 1) and PSSF with pre-hydrolysis at 50 °C (81. 62 %; 17. 66 g L- 1). A positive correlation between cellulase concentration, cellulose conversion and ethanol content was observed. In PSSF, the increase in solid loadings caused {{a reduction in the}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>ethanol</b> <b>yield,</b> but the <b>ethanol</b> concentration in PSSF and SSF increased. SSF appears to be an advantageous strategy for bioethanol production from Arundo donax...|$|R
