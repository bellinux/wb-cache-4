25|$|Chimborazo then erupted {{several times}} during the Holocene, the last time around 550 AD ± 150years. The eruptions after the {{collapse}} were primarily andesitic, or blocky, coagulated lava flow. These eruptions produced pyroclastic surges that went down as far as 3800 meters altitude. There has been at least 7 eruptions in the past 10000 years. Chimborazo is officially considered inactive, but studies show that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> eruption in the future. The average time between eruptions for Chimborazo is 1000 years, and the last eruption was 1400 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Dyson {{also did}} {{work in a}} variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and random matrices. There is an {{interesting}} story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist Hugh Montgomery was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his pair correlation conjecture concerning the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg who said it looked like something in mathematical physics and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> unexpected connection between the distribution of primes 2,3,5,7,11,... and the energy levels in the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium.|$|E

25|$|Associations with {{species of}} pitcher plants {{are so many}} and varied {{that the study of}} Nepenthes infauna is {{something}} of a discipline in its own right. Camponotus schmitzi, the diving ant, has an intimate degree of mutualism with the pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata; it not only retrieves prey and detritus from {{beneath the surface of the}} liquid in the pitchers, but repels herbivores, and cleans the pitcher peristome, maintaining its slippery nature. The ants have been reported to attack struggling prey, hindering their escape, so <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> element of myrmecotrophy to the relationship. Numerous species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in the liquid, where their larvae play various roles, depending on species; some eat microbes and detritus, as is common among mosquito larvae, whereas some species of Toxorhynchites also breed in pitchers, and their larvae are predators of other species of mosquito larvae. Apart from the crab spiders on pitchers, an actual small, red crab Geosesarma malayanum will enter the fluid, robbing and scavenging, though reputedly it does so at some risk of being captured and digested itself.|$|E

[...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old when I made the decision, and I thought it was my one shot at the prize." ...|$|E

500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, Eudora Welty noted Pilgrims narrator being [...] "the {{only person in}} [...] book, {{substantially}} {{the only one in}} her world .... Speaking of the universe very often, she is yet self-surrounded". [...] Dillard seemingly refers to the idea of an [...] "invisible narrator" [...] in the sixth chapter of Pilgrim at Tinker Creek; while referring to the [...] "infinite power" [...] of God, the narrator notes that [...] "invisibility is the all-time great 'cover'". [...] Nancy C. Parrish, author of the 1998 book Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers, notes that despite its having been written in the first person, Pilgrim is not necessarily autobiographical. [...] The narrator, [...] "Annie Dillard", therefore becomes a persona through which the author can experience and describe [...] "thoughts and events that the real Annie Dillard had only heard about or studied or imagined." [...] Critic Suzanne Clark also points to the [...] "peculiar evasiveness" [...] of Dillard-the-author, noting that [...] "when we read Annie Dillard, we don't know who is writing. [...] There is a silence in the place where <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> image of the social self—of personality, character, or ego". [...] While most critics assume that the narrator is female, mostly due to the autobiographical elements of the book and the assumption that the narrator is Dillard herself, Clark questions whether the narrator is male. [...] Stating that Dillard uses [...] "a variety of male voices, male styles" [...] throughout the book, Clark asks, [...] "When Dillard quit writing Pilgrim at Tinker Creek in the persona of a fifty year old man, did she then begin to write as a woman?" ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that sense authorship is an illusion. Unconscious causes of thought and action might facilitate thought and action, while the agent experiences the thoughts and actions as being dependent on conscious will. We may over-assign agency because of the evolutionary advantage that once came with always suspecting <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> agent doing something (e.g. predator). The idea behind retrospective construction is that, while part of the [...] "yes, I did it" [...] feeling of agency seems to occur during action, there also seems to be processing performed after the fact – after the action is performed – to establish the full feeling of agency.|$|E
2500|$|Orthostatic tremor is {{characterized}} by fast (>12Hz) rhythmic muscle contractions {{that occur in the}} legs and trunk immediately after standing. Cramps are felt in the thighs and legs and the patient may shake uncontrollably when asked to stand in one spot. [...] No other clinical signs or symptoms are present and the shaking ceases when the patient sits or is lifted off the ground. The high frequency of the tremor often makes the tremor look like rippling of leg muscles while standing. Orthostatic tremor may also occur in patients who have essential tremor, and <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> overlap between these categories of tremor.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the failure}} of Miller's {{expectations}} for October 22, 1844, the date {{became known as the}} Millerites' Great Disappointment. Hiram Edson recorded that [...] "Our fondest hopes and expectations were blasted, and such a spirit of weeping came over us as I never experienced before... We wept, and wept, till the day dawn." [...] Following the Great Disappointment most Millerites simply gave up their beliefs. Some did not and viewpoints and explanations proliferated. Miller initially seems to have thought that Christ's Second Coming was still going to take place—that [...] "the year of expectation was according to prophecy; but...that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> error in Bible chronology, which was of human origin, that could throw the date off somewhat and account for the discrepancy." [...] Miller never gave up his belief in the Second Coming of Christ; he died on December 20, 1849, still convinced that the Second Coming was imminent. Miller is buried near his home in Low Hampton, NY and his home is a registered National Historic Landmark and preserved as a museum: [...]|$|E
2500|$|As {{software}} and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system. The words [...] "anomaly" [...] and [...] "discrepancy" [...] can be used, {{as being more}} neutral terms, to avoid the words [...] "error" [...] and [...] "defect" [...] or [...] "bug" [...] where <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> implication that all so-called errors, defects or bugs must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment {{can be made to}} determine if changes to remove an anomaly (or discrepancy) would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the change(s) unnecessary. Not all issues are life-critical or mission-critical in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long-term, than living with the known problem(s) (where the [...] "cure would be worse than the disease"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a [...] "zero-defects" [...] mandate, where people might be tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero defects. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same [...] "bugs" [...] occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system.|$|E
