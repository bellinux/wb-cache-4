40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the basic freezing point of buffalo milk. Bulk milk samples were collected from buffalo and cattle farms in Caserta area from 2008 to 2014. The analysis involved a total of 1886 buffalo milk samples and 1711 bovine milk samples. These were also tested for fat, protein and lactose contents by means of infrared spectrometry. The freezing point was determined by means of a <b>thermistor</b> <b>cryoscope.</b> Data underwent statistical analysis. Our research showed an average freezing point of - 0. 528 °C for buffalo milk and - 0. 522 °C for bovine milk. Given the lack of data on the freezing point of buffalo milk, our study provides the first indication of a basic freezing point of the milk of this species in Italy...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{freezing}} point (FP) {{was established in}} 48 bulk tank samples of raw and 48 samples of pasteu-rized goat milk that were collected {{in the course of}} lactation. Alongside, non-fat solids (NFS) content was moni-tored. Milk {{freezing point}} measurements were carried out using the <b>thermistor</b> <b>cryoscope</b> method in compliance with the standard CTS 570538 (1998). The mean freezing point of raw milk was found to be in an interval of – 0. 5513 ± 0. 0046 °C, variation ranged from – 0. 5466 °C to – 0. 5567 °C, with higher values in the spring months and a drop at the end of lactation. FP corresponded to the NFS content. The average freezing point of goat milk heat-treated on the farm to the temperature of 72 °C over a period of 20 s was – 0. 5488 ± 0. 0046 °C, pasteurisation brought an average increase in FP by 0. 0025 °C...|$|E
40|$|In {{the dairy}} industry, raw milk samples {{collected}} for quality testing {{should be tested}} or refrigerated immediately to control bacterial growth. A <b>thermistor</b> <b>cryoscope</b> is used to accurately determine the freezing point depression (FPD) of raw milk. Milk containing extraneous amounts of water will have a grossly elevated FPD. Milk that has been spoiled or adulterated with other sources, such as sugar, salt, or milk powder, will depress the freezing point, potentially masking the addition of added water. The pH of milk is a general measure of acidity in the sample. Lower pH values indicate an acidification process such as bacterial spoilage. Impedance methods monitor changes in the metabolic processes and will measure lactic acid as a by-product of lactose, for example. The {{purpose of this study}} was to show the effects that storage conditions have on FPD, pH, and impedance of raw milk. In two identical experiments, 20 raw milk samples were stored at 20 - 25 °C, and 20 at 2 - 8 °C, for 168 hours. All samples were tested at numerous intervals throughout this time period. Spoiled and unspoiled milk samples generated similar results using all 3 methods up to 24 hours of storage. Between 24 and 48 hours, the FPD of the spoiled milk was erroneously depressed by an average of 102. 4 m°C, the pH was lowered by an average of 1. 19 units, and the impedance measurement dropped by an average of 19. 1 ohms. The FPD, pH, and impedance data collected generally indicate that raw milk samples with or without refrigeration can be tested up to 24 hours without showing an appreciable shift in response due to bacterial spoilage...|$|E
40|$|A Wescor Vapor Pressure Osmometer {{measured}} the osmolality {{of a solution}} by sensing the vapor pressure above the solution in a closed chamber. The instrument sensing element comprised a precision thermocouple which {{measured the}} dew point temperature depression, {{a function of the}} water vapor pressure in the chamber. It used approximately 5 - 7 microliter samples to saturate a 0. 64 cm filter paper disc. The instrument fixed a milliosmolal digital reading and signaled test completion in 110 seconds. The instrument weighed approximately 3. 62 kilograms, was 26. 7 x 24. 1 x 10. 2 cms in size and had a range of 0 to 1999 milliosmolal. The modular solid state osmometer contained no mechanical moving parts, required no refrigerated components, sample pipetting, sample tube, and no operator attention following sample insertion. Cleaning the sample chamber pocket between tests with an acetone impregnated tissue improved repeatability of the osmometer and reduced the coefficient of variability from O. 76 % to 0. 70 % on a raw milk sample. Two hundred individual cow milk samples from 20 herds were run in February, 1974, to establish a mean freezing point in Cache Valley herds for that period. The mean and standard deviation was 280 ± 3. 0 millisomolal. Results of milk samples containing 0 to 25 % added water measured by the osmometer were compared to those obtained from an Advanced <b>thermistor</b> <b>cryoscope.</b> The coefficient of correlation was 0. 991. A collaborative study was conducted involving eight hospitals and industry laboratories. When the results of two laboratories were discarded, due to instrument maintenance problems, {{there were no significant differences}} among the laboratories in their abilities to quantitate added water. Proper maintenance of the osmometer in order to keep the thermocouple clean and frequent calibration checks are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se comparar metodologias de referência com a espectroscopia de infravermelho com transformada de Fourier para análises do pH e do ponto de congelamento sob diferentes condições de conservação em amostras de leite bovino cru. Foram coletadas amostras de leite de tanques de expansão em 57 propriedades. Cada amostra foi subdividida em 45 frascos (40 mL), que foram distribuídos de acordo com a temperatura de armazenamento (- 20; 7 e 25 ºC), a idade da amostra (0, 3, 6 e 9 dias) e os níveis de adição de água (0, 2, 4 e 6 %). Foi adicionado {{bronopol}} a 44 frascos e um foi mantido sem adição do conservante para controle. O pH e o ponto de congelamento foram determinados pela metodologia de referência (potenciômetro e crioscópio eletrônico, respectivamente) e pela metodologia alternativa por meio do equipamento MilkoScanTM FT+. Os resultados obtidos em cada metodologia nas diferentes condições de conservação das amostras foram avaliados por análise de variância e comparação de médias. A análise de regressão linear foi realizada para avaliar as metodologias (referência e alternativa) quanto aos resultados do ponto de congelamento em função da idade da amostra. O bronopol não alterou as médias de pH, porém reduziu o ponto de congelamento. Foram calculados fatores de correção para eliminar esse efeito nos resultados do ponto de congelamento. As médias de pH em amostras com três dias, mantidas a - 20 e 25 ºC foram mais baixas que as amostras a 7 ºC. A idade da amostra influenciou os resultados de pH quando as amostras foram submetidas a 25 ºC. O aumento da temperatura de armazenamento para 25 ºC reduziu as médias do ponto de congelamento em amostras sem adição de água e com nove dias de armazenagem. O aumento na idade da amostra a - 20 e 7 ºC não tem efeito sobre médias do ponto de congelamento. Há forte correlação entre as metodologias em função da idade da amostra para o ponto de congelamento. The {{objective of}} this work was to compare reference methodologies to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for analysis of pH and freezing point (FP) under different storage conditions on samples of raw bovine milk. Milk samples were collected from bulk tank milk on 57 farms. Each sample was subdivided into 45 vials (40 mL) which were distributed according to storage temperature (- 20 ºC, 7 ºC and 25 ºC), age of the sample (0, 3, 6 and 9 days) and levels of water addition (0, 2, 4 and 6 %). Bronopol was added into 44 flasks and one was maintained without addition of preservative for control. Frozen point and pH were determined by the standard methods (<b>thermistor</b> <b>cryoscope</b> and potentiometer, respectively) and by the alternative methodology by using MilkoScanTM FT+. The results from each method, at different conditions of conservation of the samples, were evaluated by analysis of variance and comparison of means. The linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the methodologies (reference and alternative) for results of the frozen point in function {{of the age of}} the sample. Bronopol did not alter pH means, but it reduced frozen point. Correction factors were calculated to eliminate this effect on the results of the frozen point. Means of pH in three-day samples, kept at - 20 ºC and 25 ºC were lower than the samples at 7 ºC. The age of the samples affected the results of pH when they were submitted to 25 ºC. The increase of storage temperature to 25 ºC reduced means of frozen point in samples without addition of water and at nine days of storage. The increase in age of sample at - 20 ºC and 7 ºC does not affect means of frozen point. There is a strong correlation among methodologies in function of age of the sample for frozen point...|$|E
