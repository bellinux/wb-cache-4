5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were posted}} by the Weather Bureau {{for the entire}} Alabama coast, and portions of the Mississippi coast from Biloxi eastward prior to the storm. Merchants in potentially affected areas prepared their stores ahead of the hurricane. The potential storm surge threat forced boats in Biloxi <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> shelter in a nearby landlocked harbor.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the council in a litter. A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E

5|$|A serious {{accident}} occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill. All the bogies {{on the leading}} coach left the rails, causing fifteen people (nine women and six men) to be injured seriously enough for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the Western Infirmary.|$|E
5|$|After {{debarking}} her passengers at San Juan on 1 May, {{the ship}} took on supplies {{needed by the}} American ground forces in Santo Domingo: gasoline, oil, and ammunition. She docked in Santo Domingo on 2 May and exchanged her cargo for 450 more evacuees <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> San Juan. In all, Yancey carried {{almost a quarter of}} those fleeing the Dominican Republic. She returned to Norfolk soon thereafter, and resumed her role of training and cruising off the eastern seaboard and into the Caribbean basin. On 1 January 1969, Yancey was redesignated as LKA-93.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{when two}} or more rats from the same litter are {{of the same sex}} they live {{together}} with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> provide security for both rats.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the present day dollar {{shortage}} comes from the structural change of the world economy.

He {{requested}} in his will <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the cemetery without any funeral, and to be moved to Buenos Aires thereafter. Balcarce informed Rosas and the foreign minister Felipe Arana of San Martín's death. Balcarce oversaw the embalming of his remains and their temporary stay in a chapel of the city. He also sent San Martin's saber to Rosas.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1945 Z31, Z34 and Z38 laid {{mines in}} Magerøya, Laafjord, and Brei Sounds. On 25 January, Z31, Z34, and Z38 sailed out of Tromsø, making for the Baltic. On 28 January, while off the Sognefjord, the three destroyers were intercepted by a {{squadron}} of British ships, including the light cruisers Diadem, and Mauritius. During the battle, one of Z38s funnels caught fire, splitting a boiler tube. After this Z38 broke off from the battle, and made for Kiel alongside Z34.

5|$|The 19th century saw major {{development}} in healthcare in Arbroath. In 1836 a dispensary {{was set up}} by public subscription to provide medical care for the poor. In 1842 a typhus epidemic in the town {{led to the creation of}} a small fever ward to keep patients in isolation. The following year subscriptions began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> develop this into Arbroath Infirmary, which opened in 1845, and moved to new premises in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian was {{a former}} two-decked 44-gun frigate, but had been armed en flûte and loaded with stores <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> the British colony at Botany Bay. In {{addition}} to these stores, consisting of seeds, plants, farm machinery and livestock with a total value of some £70,000, the Guardian was also to transport a number of convicts and their overseers. Aboard the Guardian was a young midshipman named Thomas Pitt, the son of politician Thomas Pitt, and nephew of Prime Minister William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|The Hudson's Bay Company {{had lost}} a full year in the {{northern}} fur trade, and pressed for further steps <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> prevent another smallpox outbreak. Dr. D.W.J. Hagarty was appointed as medical superintendent of the Manitoba and North-West Superintendencies in October 1878. His mission was to vaccinate all Native persons resident in the Manitoba Superintendency. Every spring vaccinations were administered to thoe {{people who were not}} away hunting.|$|E

5|$|The road {{over the}} pass was barely capable of {{handling}} the massive amounts of silver ore coming out of Aspen's mines. At first they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Leadville by mule train to be smelted. Plants {{were built in the}} city soon afterwards, but it was still difficult and expensive to transport the silver obtained. The market was growing {{in the wake of the}} Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the U.S. government to buy the metal on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement.

5|$|A {{long and}} winding route had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, {{was at the}} extreme ends of the decks, {{and so was the}} {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock {{and the structure}} of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper in defiance of the Privy Council's instruction for them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> Edinburgh for trial.|$|E

Since the classification was done in increasing order of weight, the Western Australians were designated Class C, after the NZASM 40 Tonner (Class A) and 46 Tonner (Class B). The Western Australians were renumbered {{in the range from}} 203 to 208.|$|R
