The mediatory role of online technologies is considered in this regard. In turn, Rian Terblanche’s installation-performance owner’s MANual to conSEXtualisation is used to discuss how a performance located in a designated physical space demonstrates how such online persona constructions are indicative of constantly shifting subject–object positions, often culminating in what this study refers to as the pornstarification of the persona. This investigation is primarily informed by the work of Turkle and Benedetti, and establishes a link between Turkle’s notion of the distributed self and Benedetti’s notion of the expanded self as one way to allow online and offline spaces to conceptually speak to one another around gay male identity.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the role of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> program {{coordinator}} in an attempt to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> program coordinator's perception of his/her role differed significantly from the primary elementary classroom teacher's perception of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator’s role. <b>The</b> overall aim of this study was to help clarify the role of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> program coordinator in Newfoundland and Labrador. More specifically, the study attempted to determine the following: (a) the role of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator as discussed in the literature; (b) primary/elementary teachers’ and Reading coordinators’ perceptions of the role of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator in Newfoundland and Labrador; (c) primary/elementary teachers' and reading coordinators' perceptions regarding the importance of the role of <b>the</b> district <b>reading</b> coordinator; and (d) primary/elementary teachers' and reading coordinators' perceptions regarding the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator's time. [...] Two methods of gathering data were employed. First, literature related to the role of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator was analyzed to help define the role of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator. Second, data was obtained from responses to two questionnaires which were administered to reading coordinators and classroom teachers. The questionnaire consisted of thirty-eight tasks and three categories of task areas: (a) Knowledge Area; (b) Interpersonal Skills and Attitudes; and (c) Administrative and Organizational Activities. The data from the questionnaire was analyzed for each of the three categories of tasks. The questionnaire also required repsondents to indicate their perceptions of the importance of the role of <b>the</b> district <b>reading</b> coordinator and their perceptions regarding distribution of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator's time. [...] The findings from this study have shown that <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator's own role conception differs from the classroom teacher's perception of <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> coordinator's role.

The data {{of the study was}} gathered from three sources. First, we analysed <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts used at three different educational levels, namely, secondary (two textbook series), preparatory, and FYU level in three disciplines - English and Translation study, Medicine, and Engineering. Second, we obtained students’ perceptions at the three educational levels through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews about {{the suitability of}} <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts used at their level and/or the previous level in preparing them to deal with <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts encountered at the current and/or the subsequent educational level. Finally, we obtained teachers’ perspectives on text suitability at the three educational levels by using semi-structured interviews. The study adopted a mixed methods approach. The data was analysed quantitatively using SPSS, and qualitatively using thematic analysis. The findings revealed marked differences between <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts in <b>the</b> two secondary level English series. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts offered at preparatory level were less demanding than <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts at <b>the</b> preceding level. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts at <b>the</b> pre-university levels differ greatly from <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> that <b>the</b> students encounter at the FYU level, especially in medicine and engineering disciplines. Furthermore both secondary and preparatory level students and teachers believed that <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts currently offered at each level did not adequately prepare students for their <b>reading</b> at <b>the</b> next educational level. Finally, medicine and engineering students and their teachers at FYU level concurred that <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> texts at <b>the</b> preparatory level are not sufficient in preparing students to read specialist university textbooks. The English and translation students and their teachers however found <b>the</b> <b>reading</b> at preparatory level was useful preparation, due to their first year reading not being in fact of academic specialist subject textbooks.
