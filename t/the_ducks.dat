5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> were {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round of the 2008 playoffs, he again contemplated retirement, but quickly made the decision to return for the 2008–09 season. He regained captaincy of <b>the</b> <b>Ducks,</b> and played in his fifth All-Star Game during the season in which he scored 59 points in 82 games. In what proved to be his final season, 2009–10, Niedermayer scored 48 points in 80 games. He announced his retirement as a player on June 22, 2010, but remained with <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> organization as a consultant to general manager Bob Murray. He turned to coaching in 2012–13 season, serving as a Special Assignment Coach with <b>the</b> <b>Ducks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} games were in Anaheim, both won by <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> by one-goal margins. Game 3 went to the Senators, but Game 4 in Ottawa was won by <b>the</b> <b>Ducks,</b> for an insurmountable three games to one lead. <b>The</b> <b>Ducks</b> would finish the series in Game 5 at home. <b>The</b> <b>Ducks</b> had been favoured to win the Cup since before the season started. The Senators were the third {{consecutive}} Canadian franchise to reach the Final and they suffered the same fate as the Calgary Flames of 2004 and the Edmonton Oilers of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Following the Cup win, Selänne {{contemplated}} retirement. He remained undecided on a return—and {{as a free}} agent, out of <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> lineup {{to begin}} the 2007–08 season—until he finally chose to return and signed a one-year contract with Anaheim on January 28, 2008. He made his return on February 5 against the New York Islanders, and <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> posted the League's best record from that point {{to the end of}} the regular season by winning 20 of 26 games. In his third game back, Selänne scored his 670th point as a member of <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> with an assist in a 4–2 victory over the Calgary Flames. With it, he broke Kariya's franchise record of 669.|$|E

5|$|The duckers of Aylesbury {{would buy}} eggs from the breeders, or {{be paid by}} a breeder to raise <b>the</b> <b>ducks</b> on their behalf, and would raise the ducklings in their homes between November and August as a {{secondary}} source of income.

5|$|Kariya and Selänne joined {{an already}} high-powered Avalanche team that {{included}} such forwards as Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Milan Hejduk and Alex Tanguay. Despite {{high expectations for}} the duo's reunion, Kariya and Selänne both struggled in their sole years with Colorado. After beginning the 2003–04 season on a line with Selänne centred by Joe Sakic, Kariya suffered a sprained right wrist {{in a game against}} the Boston Bruins on October 21, 2003. After being sidelined for ten games, he returned in mid-November, but re-injured his wrist in his first contest back. Due to the injury, Kariya missed playing against <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> {{for the first time in}} a home game on November 18. Still recovering a month later, he remained sidelined for a return to Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond on December 20. Kariya's departure from <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> drew criticism from his previous team's fans. In anticipation of the Avalanche-Ducks game on December 20, Anaheim fans began a fund that raised over $1,200 to be given to the favourite charity of <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> player who scores the game-winning goal against Colorado. The idea was precipitated by reports that Kariya had given Selänne $3,000 for scoring the game-winning goal against <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> on November 18 (it is an informal tradition in the NHL for players to offer rewards to teammates who score against former teams). Kariya returned to the Avalanche lineup in time for their next game against <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> on January 13, 2004, at the Pepsi Center. He scored one goal in a 3–1 win. Later that month, he played his first game against <b>the</b> <b>Ducks</b> in Anaheim on January 30. Booed every time he touched puck, he recorded two assists, as the Avalanche lost 4–3 in overtime. Limited by injuries, Kariya scored below his career pace with 11 goals and 36 points over 51 games. Selänne recorded 32 points, while playing in 78 games. In the final game of the regular season, Kariya injured his right ankle against the Nashville Predators on April 4. As a team, Colorado lost their division for the first time in nine years to the Vancouver Canucks. Qualifying for the 2004 playoffs as the fourth seed in the West, they lost in the second round to the Sharks. Kariya returned to the Colorado lineup in time for Game 6 against the Sharks, recording an assist as the Avalanche were eliminated by a score of 3–1.|$|E

In an interview with SportsNet on January 3, 2017, Raymond revealed that he refused to report to the AHL largely to spend time with his wife, who had been diagnosed with Lyme disease.|$|E
