25|$|The matrix {{substances}} {{in the walls}} of gram-positive bacteria may be polysaccharides or teichoic acids. The latter are very widespread, but have been found only in gram-positive bacteria. There are two main types of teichoic acid: ribitol teichoic acids and glycerol teichoic acids. The latter one is more widespread. These acids are polymers of ribitol phosphate and glycerol phosphate, respectively, and only located {{on the surface of}} many gram-positive bacteria. However, the exact function of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid</b> is debated and not fully understood. A major component of the gram-positive cell wall is lipoteichoic acid. One of its purposes is providing an antigenic function. The lipid element {{is to be found in}} the membrane where its adhesive properties assist in its anchoring to the membrane.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria use various {{resistance}} {{strategies to}} avoid antimicrobial peptide killing. Some microorganisms alter net surface charges. Staphylococcus aureus transports D-alanine from the cytoplasm to the surface <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid</b> which reduces the net negative charge by introducing basic amino groups. S. aureus also modifies its anionic membranes via MprF with L-lysine, increasing the positive net charge. The interaction of antimicrobial peptides with membrane targets can be limited by capsule polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> {{that are}} {{anchored}} to the lipid membrane {{are referred to as}} lipoteichoic <b>acids</b> (LTAs), whereas <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> that are covalently bound to peptidoglycan are referred to as wall <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> (WTA).|$|R
50|$|The main {{function}} of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> {{is to provide}} rigidity to the cell-wall by attracting cations such as magnesium and sodium. <b>Teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> can be substituted with D-alanine ester residues, or D-glucosamine, giving the molecule zwitterionic properties. These zwitterionic <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> are suspected ligands for toll-like receptors 2 and 4. <b>Teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> also assist in regulation of cell growth by limiting the ability of autolysins to break the β(1-4) bond between the N-acetyl glucosamine and the N-acetylmuramic acid.|$|R

The rates of {{expansion}} and the shapes of the resultant giant colonies were distinct for different strains of laboratory stocks and clinical isolates. The colony spreading abilities did not correlate with the biofilm-forming abilities in these strains. Insertional disruption of the dltABCD operon, which functions at the step of d-alanine addition to <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids,</b> and of the tagO gene, which is responsible for the synthesis of wall <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids,</b> decreased the colony spreading ability. The results indicate that wall <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> and d-alanylation of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> are required for colony spreading...|$|R

50|$|Like other Gram-positive microbes, S. haemolyticus has a thick, rather homogenous, {{cell wall}} (60-80 nm) {{composed}} of peptidoglycan, <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and protein. Peptidoglycan of group A3 (with L-lysine as the diamino acid in position 3 of the peptide subunit and a glycine-rich interpeptide bridge) is a characteristic {{feature of this}} microbe, and the two predominant cross-bridges are COOH-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-NH2 and COOH-Ala-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-NH2. Alterations of these cross-bridges are implicated in glycopeptide resistance. S. haemolyticus teichoic acids are water-soluble polymers with repeating phosphodiester groups covalently linked to peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan type L-Lys-Gly 3.5-4.0, L-Ser0.9-1.5 <b>Teichoic</b> <b>acid</b> contains both glycerol and N-acetylglucosamine. The major cell wall fatty acids are CBr-15, CBr-17, C18, and C20.|$|E

5000|$|Members of {{the genus}} Macrococcus are Gram-positive, nonmotile, nonspore-forming cocci that are coagulase {{negative}} and catalase positive. They can be distinguished phenotypically from most staphylococci {{on the basis of}} their cellular morphology (they are 2.5 - 4.0 times larger in diameter compared to Staphylococcus aureus) and their positive cytochrome c oxidase reaction. Species in this genus are resistant to bacitracin and lysozyme and sensitive to furazolidone. The DNA base content is 38-45 mol% G+C.

50|$|Numerous coagulase-negative staphylococci appear {{commonly}} on {{the skin}} of human. Of these species, S. epidermidis and S. hominis are the most abundant. While S. epidermidis tends to colonize {{the upper part of}} the body, S. hominis tends to colonize in areas with numerous apocrine glands, such as axillae and the pubic region. In a certain study, S. hominis was calculated to account for 22% of the total staphylococcal species recovered from individuals, second to S. epidermidis at 46%. S. hominis is the predominant species on the head, axillae, arms, and legs.S. hominis, as well as most other staphylococcal species common on the human skin, is able to produce acid aerobically from glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, and glycerol. Some strains were also able to produce acid from turanose, lactose, galactose, melezitose, mannitol, and mannose. Most strains colonize {{on the skin}} for relatively short periods of time compared to other Staphylococcus species. They, on average, stay on the skin for only several weeks or months.The cell wall contains low amounts of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid</b> and glutamic acid. The cell wall <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid</b> contains glycerol and glucosamine.S. hominis cells are Gram-positive cocci, usually 1.2 to 1.4 μm in diameter.

50|$|Autolysins {{exist in}} all {{bacteria}} containing peptidoglycan. The peptidoglycan matrix is very rigid, so these enzymes {{break down the}} peptidoglycan matrix in small sections so that growth and division of cells can occur. Autolysins do this by hydrolyzing the β-(1,4) bond between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine molecules. Autolysins are naturally produced by peptidoglycan containing bacteria, but excessive amounts will degrade the peptidoglycan matrix and cause the cell to burst due to osmotic pressure. Gram-positive bacteria regulate autolysins with <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid</b> molecules attached to the tetrapeptide of the peptidoglycan matrix.|$|E
50|$|Butyrivibrio is a genus of {{bacteria}} in Class Clostridia. Bacteria of this genus {{are common in}} the gastrointestinal systems of many animals. Genus Butyrivibrio was first described by Bryant and Small (1956) as anaerobic, butyric acid-producing, curved rods (or vibroids). Butyrivibrio cells are small, typically 0.4 - 0.6 µm by 2 - 5 µm. They are motile, using a single polar or subpolar monotrichous flagellum. They are commonly found singly or in short chains {{but it is not}} unusual for them to form long chains. Despite historically being described as Gram-negative, their cell walls contain derivatives of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and electron microscopy indicates that bacteria of this genus have a Gram-positive cell wall type. It is thought that they appear Gram-negative when Gram stained because their cell walls thin to 12 to 18 nm as they reach stationary phase.|$|E
40|$|Background: Electroporation is {{a method}} of choice to {{transform}} living cells. The ability of electroporation to transfer small or large chemicals across the lipid bilayer membrane of eukaryotic cells or Gram-negative bacteria relies on the formation of transient pores across the membrane. To exist, these pores rely on an insulator (the bilayer membrane) {{and the presence of}} a potential difference {{on either side of the}} membrane mediated by an external electric field. In Gram-positive bacteria, however, the wall is not an insulator but pores can still form when an electric field is applied. Past works have shown that the electrostatic charge of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids,</b> a major wall component; sensitizes the wall to pore formation when an external electric field is applied. These results suggest that <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> mediate the formation of defects in the wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Methods: We model the electrostatic repulsion between <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> embedded in the bacterial wall composed of peptidoglycan when an electric field is applied. The repulsion between <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> gives rise to a stress pressure that is able to rupture the wall when a threshold value has been reached. The size of such small defects can diverge leading to the formation of pores. Results: It is demonstrated herein that for a bonding energy of about 1 − 10 kBT between peptidoglycan monomers an intra-wall pressure of about 5 − 120 kBT/nm 3 generates spherical defects of radius 0. 1 − 1 nm diverging in size to create pores. Conclusion: The electrostatic cavitation of the bacterial wall theory has the potential to highlight the role of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> in the formation pores, providing a new step in the understanding of electroporation in Gram positive bacteria without requiring the use of an insulator...|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{identify}} the major complement-consuming heteropolysaccharides in pigeon excreta, a number of <b>teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria were examined as possible substitutes. <b>Teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> from the cell wall and membrane of Lactobacillus buchnerii were found suitable. Samples of freshly voided pigeon droppings were cultured under anaerobic conditions and the bacteria were identified, subcultured, and extracted with phenol-water.

Purification and chemical characterization indicated the major antigen from Lactobacillus in this respect to be an acylated heteropolysaccharide...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Teichoic</b> <b>acids</b> (cf. Greek τεῖχος, teīkhos, [...] "wall", to be {{specific}} a fortification wall, as opposed to τοῖχος, toīkhos, a regular wall) are bacterial copolymers [...] of glycerol phosphate or ribitol phosphate and carbohydrates linked via phosphodiester bonds.|$|R
50|$|The gram-positive {{cell wall}} is characterised by the {{presence}} of a very thick peptidoglycan layer, which is responsible for the retention of the crystal violet dyes during the Gram staining procedure. It is found exclusively in organisms belonging to the Actinobacteria (or high %G+C gram-positive organisms) and the Firmicutes (or low %G+C gram-positive organisms). Bacteria within the Deinococcus-Thermus group may also exhibit gram-positive staining behaviour but contain some cell wall structures typical of gram-negative organisms. Imbedded in the gram-positive cell wall are polyalcohols called teichoic acids, some of which are lipid-linked to form lipoteichoic acids. Because lipoteichoic acids are covalently linked to lipids within the cytoplasmic membrane they are responsible for linking the peptidoglycan to the cytoplasmic membrane. Teichoic acids give the gram-positive cell wall an overall negative charge due to the presence of phosphodiester bonds between <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid</b> monomers.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{like all}} other viruses, T-even phages don't just {{randomly}} attach {{to the surface of}} their host; instead they [...] "search" [...] and bind to receptors, specific protein structures, found {{on the surface of the}} host. These receptors vary with the phage; <b>teichoic</b> <b>acid,</b> cell wall proteins and lipopolysaccharides, flagella, and pili all can serve as receptors for the phage to bind to. In order for the T-even phage to infect its host and begin its life cycle it must enter the first process of infection, adsorption of the phage to the bacterial cell. Adsorption is a value characteristic of phage-host pair and the adsorption of the phage on host cell surface is illustrated as a 2-stage process: reverrsible and irreversible. It involves the phages tail structure that begins when the phages tail fibers helps bind the phage to the appropriate receptor of its host. This process is reversible. One or more of the components of the base plate mediates irreversible process of binding of the phage to a bacterium.|$|E
5000|$|Gram-positive cell {{walls are}} thick and the {{peptidoglycan}} ( [...] {{also known as}} murein) layer constitutes almost 95% of the cell wall in some gram-positive bacteria and as little as 5-10% of the cell wall in gram-negative bacteria. The gram-positive bacteria take up the crystal violet dye and are stained purple. The cell wall of some gram-positive bacteria can be completely dissolved by lysozymes which attacks the bonds between GA and MA. In other gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, the walls are resistant to the action of lysozymes. They have O-acetyl groups on carbon-6 of some MA residues.The matrix substances in the walls of gram-positive bacteria may be polysaccharides or teichoic acids. The latter are very widespread, but have been found only in gram-positive bacteria. There are two main types of teichoic acid: ribitol teichoic acids and glycerol teichoic acids.
