5|$|At their 2007 meeting, the BCHL {{board of}} {{governors}} rejected moving <b>the</b> <b>Williams</b> Lake TimberWolves to Dawson Creek, but then voted to allow the move if the Burnaby Express (who was also seeking relocation) moved to Fort St. John. However, the Society {{was not able to}} recruit sufficient support in Fort St. John to form an ownership group and the Burnaby Express re-arranged its management and ownership so that it could stay in Burnaby. <b>The</b> <b>Williams</b> Lake TimberWolves, after one year of dormancy, relocated to Wenatchee, Washington. Efforts at relocating an Alberta Junior Hockey League team were also unsuccessful as no team expressed interest in moving at that time.|$|E

The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday {{practice}} sessions were again held in dry and sunny conditions.
