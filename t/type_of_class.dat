25|$|Italy has {{class action}} legislation. Consumer {{associations}} can file claims {{on behalf of}} groups of consumers to obtain judicial orders against corporations that cause injury or damage to consumers. These types of claims are increasing and Italian courts have recently allowed them against banks that continue to apply compound interest on retail clients’ current account overdrafts. The introduction of class actions is on the new government’s agenda. On November 19, 2007, the Senato della Repubblica passed a class action law in Finanziaria 2008, a financial document for the economy management of the government. Now (from 10 December 2007), in order of Italian legislation system, the law is before the House {{and has to be}} passed also by the Camera dei Deputati, the second house of Italian Parliament, to become an effective law. In 2004, the Italian parliament considered the introduction of a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>class</b> action, specifically in the area of consumers’ law. To date, no such law has been enacted, but scholars demonstrated that class actions (azioni rappresentative) do not contrast with Italian principles of civil procedure. Class action is regulated by art. 140 bis of the Italian consumers' code and will be in force from 1 July 2009.|$|E

40|$|Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) {{is a very}} {{important}} candidate gene which generates several IGF-I mRNA variants. Because of its alternative splicing this gene is involved in very complex biological functions such as the mediation effect of promoting the growth activities of growth hormone. The mammalian IGF-I gene contains 6 exons of which exon 1 and 2 produced various leader sequences and exon 5 and 6 produced different E domain by different splicing forms. In this study, the 3 ′ends sequences of IGF-I messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in Chinese red steppes liver were cloned by 3 ′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (3 ′RACE) technique. Researchers found that there are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> 3 ′ends sequences containing exon 5 (Eb) and 6 (Ea) in Chinese red steppes. According to the result of 3 'RACE and the reports about leader exons, we have assembled the possible transcripts; <b>type</b> Ea <b>of</b> <b>class</b> 1, <b>type</b> Eb <b>of</b> <b>class</b> 1, <b>type</b> Ea <b>of</b> <b>class</b> 2 and <b>type</b> Eb <b>of</b> <b>class</b> 2.
