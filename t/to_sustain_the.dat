5|$|Although Liverpool {{regained the}} {{championship}} a year later, the club's dominance waned. In February 1991, Dalglish resigned as Liverpool manager after an FA Cup replay against Merseyside rivals Everton, citing stress {{as the principal}} cause. His successor, Graeme Souness, struggled <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> club's success with a conservative hierarchy and ageing squad, despite investing in youth players. Liverpool throughout the 1990s and 2000s declined as a league force and as of 2017, have not been crowned as top-flight champions.|$|E
5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E

5|$|Deserted {{for about}} 30 years, {{the town was}} {{repopulated}} by Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians, beginning in the 1720s. It was following this new settlement that Chiprovtsi became a major centre of the Bulgarian carpet industry. Other traditional industries have been stock breeding, agriculture and fur trade. Today, Chiprovtsi municipality experiences a declining population and above-average unemployment.

5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} also {{considered}} to be sustainable thanks to its power <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> Earth’s intricate ecosystems.

Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.|$|E

5|$|In nature, uranium {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and {{uranium-235}} (0.7204%). Isotope separation concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 {{for nuclear weapons}} and most nuclear power plants, except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> nuclear chain reaction. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve {{this is called a}} 'critical mass'.|$|E

5|$|Very {{massive stars}} can undergo core {{collapse}} when nuclear fusion becomes unable <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> core against its own gravity; passing this threshold {{is the cause}} of all types of supernova except Type Ia. The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>the</b> energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

The ABC lifted the bar's liquor license in 1963, the night before its annual Halloween party.
