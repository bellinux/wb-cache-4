50|$|Modern day devices with analog outputs have {{typically}} omitted channel 3 and 4 outputs {{in favor of}} composite and S-video outputs (or have switched to using HDMI or other digital formats) as composite and S-video have become more common as inputs for TVs. In addition, many TV sets sold these days no longer have analog <b>television</b> <b>tuners</b> and cannot accept channel 3/4. But because composite video has a well-established market for both devices that convert it to channel 3/4 outputs, as well as devices that convert things like VGA to composite, it has offered opportunities to repurpose older composite monitors for newer devices.|$|R
5000|$|The first small format video {{recording}} devices were open reel-to-reel 1/2" [...] "portable" [...] EIAJ-1 recorders, {{most of which}} came with <b>television</b> <b>tuners</b> to record off the air TV. These never caught on in the consumer market but did {{find their way into}} educational television and were the mainstays of early public-access television stations. The uniformity of the EIAJ-1 format, {{was the result of a}} developmental format war between Sony and Panasonic, each of whom were aiming at this marketplace.

50|$|An ATSC (Advanced Television Systems Committee) tuner, {{often called}} an ATSC {{receiver}} or HDTV tuner {{is a type}} of <b>television</b> <b>tuner</b> that allows reception of digital television (DTV) television channels transmitted by television stations in North America, parts of Central America and South Korea that use ATSC standards. Such tuners may be integrated into a television set, VCR, digital video recorder (DVR), or set-top box that provides audio/video output connectors of various types.|$|E
50|$|Video capture is {{the process}} of {{converting}} an analog video signal—such as that produced by a video camera or DVD player—to digital video. The resulting digital data are computer files referred to as a digital video stream, or more often, simply video stream. This is in contrast with screencasting, in which previously digitized video is captured while displayed on a digital monitor. TV tuner cards have a <b>television</b> <b>tuner</b> with the capabilities to capture broadcast television.|$|E
50|$|An ATSC tuner {{works by}} {{generating}} {{audio and video}} signals that are picked up from over-the-air broadcast <b>television.</b> ATSC <b>tuners</b> provide the following functions: selective tuning, demodulation, transport stream demultiplexing, decompression, error correction, analog-to-digital conversion, AV synchronization and media reformatting to fit the specific type of TV screen optimally.|$|R
50|$|The {{tunnel diode}} showed great promise as an {{oscillator}} and high-frequency threshold (trigger) device since it operated at frequencies {{far greater than}} the tetrode could, well into the microwave bands. Applications for tunnel diodes included local oscillators for UHF <b>television</b> <b>tuners,</b> trigger circuits in oscilloscopes, high-speed counter circuits, and very fast-rise time pulse generator circuits. The tunnel diode {{can also be used}} as a low-noise microwave amplifier. However, since its discovery, more conventional semiconductor devices have surpassed its performance using conventional oscillator techniques. For many purposes, a three-terminal device, such as a field-effect transistor, is more flexible than a device with only two terminals. Practical tunnel diodes operate at a few milliamperes and a few tenths of a volt, making them low-power devices. The Gunn diode has similar high frequency capability and can handle more power.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} of using an LNB are that cheaper cable {{can be used}} to connect the indoor receiver to the satellite television dish and LNB, and that the technology for handling the signal at L-band and UHF was far cheaper than that for handling the signal at C-band frequencies. The shift to cheaper technology from the hardline and N-connectors of the early C-band systems to the cheaper and simpler 75-ohm cable and F-connectors allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified UHF <b>television</b> <b>tuners</b> which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to a lower intermediate frequency centered on 70 MHz, where it was demodulated. This shift allowed the satellite television DTH industry to change from being a largely hobbyist one where only small numbers of systems costing thousands of US dollars were built, to a far more commercial one of mass production.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reason for}} using the LNB to do the {{frequency}} translation at the dish is so that the signal can be carried into the residence using cheap coaxial cable. To transport the signal into the house at its original Ku band microwave frequency would require an expensive waveguide, a metal pipe to carry the radio waves. [...] The cable connecting the receiver to the LNB are of the low loss type RG-6, quad shield RG-6, or RG-11. RG-59 is not recommended for this application as it is not technically designed to carry frequencies above 950 MHz, but will work in many circumstances, depending {{on the quality of}} the coaxial wire. [...] The shift to more affordable technology from the 50 Ohm impedance cable and N-Connectors of the early C-Band systems to the cheaper 75 Ohm technology and F-Connectors allowed the early satellite television receivers to use, what were in reality, modified UHF <b>television</b> <b>tuners</b> which selected the satellite television channel for down conversion to another lower intermediate frequency centered on 70 MHz where it was demodulated.|$|R
5000|$|Nuvistors {{are among}} the highest {{performing}} small signal receiving tubes. They feature excellent VHF and UHF performance plus low noise figures, and were widely used throughout the 1960s in television sets (beginning with RCA's [...] "New Vista" [...] line of color sets in 1961 with the CTC-11 chassis), radio and high-fidelity equipment primarily in RF sections, and oscilloscopes. They competed with the solid state revolution, and along with GE's Compactron, probably held it at bay for a few years. RCA discontinued their use in <b>television</b> <b>tuners</b> for its product line in late 1971. One famous application was in the Ampex MR-70, a costly studio tape recorder whose entire electronics section was based on nuvistors. Another limited application of this very small tube was in studio-grade microphones from that era, the AKG/Norelco C12a, which employed the 7586, being a good example. It was also later found that, with minor circuit modification, the nuvistor made a sufficient replacement for the obsolete Telefunken VF14 tube, used in the famed Neumann U 47 studio microphone.. Tektronix also used nuvistors in several of its high end oscilloscopes of the 1960s, before replacing them later with JFET transistors.|$|R
