5|$|The {{book was}} {{translated}} into 28 languages and released simultaneously around the world by 33 publishers. In the Canadian market, it peaked on the best seller lists at number one in Maclean's and number two in The Globe and Mail, but did not place on the New York Times Best Seller List in the American market. Some critics found the writing to be typical of Atwood or even one of her finest works, while others found some aspects, like <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> maids, disagreeable.|$|E

Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.|$|E

5000|$|Handel's music gives <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> <b>of</b> Roman pagans, {{presented}} in the libretto as evil people gloating over the torture of Christians, [...] "immense verve and charm". This is contrasted with the quiet, deep conviction of the music for <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> <b>of</b> Christians. <b>The</b> <b>chorus</b> [...] "He saw the lovely youth", Handel's favorite <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> he wrote, depicts Jesus' raising from the dead of the widow's son in Luke, chapter 7. Beginning with slow and solemn chromatic figures in a minor key, the music switches to major as the youth returns to life and ends with joy as the boy is restored to his mother.The work is notable for many passages of exalted and radiant beauty {{as well as for}} skilled characterisation through music. There are three duets, the last being a sublime piece in which Theodora and Didymus die.|$|R

5|$|It is a dance-pop {{song with}} heavy, {{pounding}} synths. The song {{also has a}} fast techno beat with electroclash and Eurodisco influences. Gaga speaks the first verse and parts of <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> the song faux-German, as {{the name of the}} song is German. The lyrics have a feminist tone, speaking of female empowerment. The song received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who complimented its heavy dance beat and catchy chorus, despite criticizing the faux-German lyrics and Gaga's accent. The song charted on the South Korean Gaon Music Chart and US Billboard dance charts, as well as entering the component charts in Canada, Germany, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|At the Powhatan River, Smith, Rolfe, Percy, Walter, Larry, Robin, and Alice {{disembark}} from a barge as <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> {{soldiers and}} adventurers sing about {{the joy of}} reaching the shore. Larry, Walter, Alice (Walter’s wife), and Robin reminisce about love, and Robin admits to Larry his lustful feelings about Alice. Meanwhile, Nima is preparing a bridal gown for Pocahontas in the royal village of Werocomoco, but Pocahontas expresses displeasure about the arrangement her father made for her to marry Miami, a rival Indian prince. Smith is then attacked by a party of Indians, including Nantaquas, Pocahontas’s brother. Due to his fighting prowess, Nantaquas thinks he is a god, but Smith explains he is only a trained warrior from across the sea. The Indians capture Smith {{to bring him to}} their chief. Back at the Powhatan River, Robin attempts to seduce Alice, but is foiled by Walter and Larry. When Walter tells the group about Smith’s capture, they depart to go after him.

Again, Beyoncé comes back to sing <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> the song, now at the barbecue party, with scenes of her dancing in a room of the mansion and scenes from the movie in which she is singing on a stage in front of a large audience with a group of people behind her. With the end of the final chorus, the song moves back to Elliott and Lyte, with the former on her rollerskates as in the beginning and the latter {{in front of the}} semi-circle of men. The video ends with the four of them sitting at a picnic table at the barbecue party as two small girls clap hands on the opposite bench.|$|E

5|$|Jason pays Number 18's pimp {{enough money}} to take {{her out of the}} brothel for a weekend. Before he arrives to take her away, however, Mama finds and confiscates the money Jason has {{previously}} paid Number 18, and correctly guesses that he does not intend to bring her back. When Jason arrives to collect Number 18, Mama tells him she is dead and offers a refund. Believing Number 18 is still alive, Jason becomes violent. Mama mocks him, saying the Western culture he is part of is hedonistic and responsible for people in the Third World being sexually trafficked. Jason stops short of hurting Mama and leaves to report to Marta. Through her connections, Marta discovers that Number 18 is alive. Marta tries to save Number 18, posing as a lawyer protecting Number 18's rights. The pimp forces Marta off with a gun. When Jason makes another attempt to rescue Number 18, the pimp kills her. Number 18 joins <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> dead child prostitutes who have been watching over and commenting on events throughout the play.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> <b>of</b> {{the song}} begins, two women pull Gaga {{out of the}} bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
