Wixson decided to become a model, and studied old copies of Vogue, looking at the careers of supermodels like Gisele, Christy and Kate. Wixson first signed with a local agent in Kansas, but had no success, so her parents made the decision to take out a loan and drive down to Los Angeles.|$|E

With regard to oral implantology, patient situations of an edentulous maxilla and mandible {{as well as}} a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> in regions 16 and 46 were simulated. Radiation doses were measured between 0. 2 and 22. 5 mGy to organs and tissues {{in the head and neck}} region when the complete maxilla or mandible was examined. When examining a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap,</b> only 8 % to 40 % of that radiation dose was generally observed. Based on these results, the mortality risk was estimated according to a calculation model recommended by the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations. The mortality risk ranged from 31. 4 x 10 (- 6) for 20 -year-old men to 4. 8 x 10 (- 6) for 65 -year-old women when cross-sectional imaging of the complete maxilla was performed. The values decreased by 70 % when a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> in the molar region of the maxilla was radiographed. The figures for the mortality risk for examinations of the complete mandible were similar to those for the complete maxilla, but the mortality risk decreased by 80 % if only a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> in the molar region of the mandible was examined.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A two-stage surgical protocol was used. Each patient was followed for 5 years after the definitive prosthesis insertion. Clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed at the yearly follow-up visit, and prosthetic complications were recorded. Statistical analysis (Wilcoxon signed rank test) {{was used to compare}} any difference in biologic and radiographic parameters between implants and the natural contralateral teeth. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the changes over time (from baseline to the last follow-up) of clinical and radiographic parameters. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients with a single posterior <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> were treated with 85 implants supporting 47 Ti and 38 Zr abutments, respectively. All-ceramic (38) and metal-ceramic (47) single crowns were fabricated. Four patients were classified as dropouts.

40|$|Objectives: Implant {{supported}} single metal-ceramic crowns cemented either extraorally or intraorally were comparatively {{evaluated by}} clinical, radiologic, biomarker, and microbiological parameters. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with bilateral single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> in the maxillary posterior region received two locking-taper implants; 4. 5 mm width, 8 mm length. Selection of intraoral (IOC) or extraoral cementation (EOC) using screwless titanium abutments was done randomly. Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF), gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) {{samples were collected}} from the implants, adjacent teeth, and bleeding on probing, soft tissue thickness, keratinized tissue width were recorded before starting the prosthetic procedures (baseline) and 3, 6 months after implant loading. Crestal bone loss was measured on radiographs taken immediately and 6 months after cementation. Cytokine levels, amounts of bacteria were determined in PICF/GCF samples. Data were tested by appropriate statistical analyses. Results: Clinical findings were similar in the crowns cemented extraorally or intraorally at all times (P[*]&# 60;[*]. 05). PICF and GCF data were similar. At 3 month, interleukin- 17 E and osteoprotegerin levels were lower in the intraorally cemented crowns.

40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is presented by which the cutting forces in gear form milling process are predicted using the mechanistic approach. To use this approach, {{a detailed description of}} the chip geometry is needed. Eccentricity and run-out tool errors are considered, which is of great importance as the chip thickness will by these errors vary for the subsequent cuts. The chip geometry is determined by comparing the path of the cutting edge with already removed material. The boundary of the chips is determinable from the cutting edge geometry, which is here derived in parametric form so spur and helical gears are manufactured correctly. Locally on the cutting edge, the cutting forces are resolved from orthogonal cutting data and on the basis that these forces are proportional to the instantaneous chip thickness. The load each individual cutting tooth experience in operation, as well as the complete load on the tool, are resolved by summing the forces along the cutting edge. In the model, all cut chips are determined for each machined gear <b>tooth</b> <b>gap,</b> with the gear blank boundaries considered.

40|$|The task of {{this study}} was to examine post exodontia {{dynamics}} that lead to the use of an equine dental spacer on cheek teeth. Research involved the conceptualization of a spacer, which should negate a variety of undesirable consequences resulting from tooth removal. The application of the spacer should be non traumatic and easy for the practitioner to handle as well as economically feasible for the owner. Additionally, the newly designed spacers were to be tested on the patient. The cited literature is extensive and provided detailed information, for example, on how to approach the sedated standing patient, which can be manipulated in the mouth for a longer period of time. Information on cheek tooth replacement was limited and almost no practical solutions for the treatment of pathological consequences of a cheek <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> without general anaesthesia were found. Moreover, indications of long term effects in the dentition after cheek tooth removal appeared to be incomplete and the potential of specific tooth replacement was not discussed. Dentition radiographs of 70 patients (42 were studied clinically within this paper) and 4 sculls served to examine whether teeth move after exodontia, which teeth move, where teeth move, reason for movement, the rate of speed at which teeth move, and lastly the width of movement. Additionally, the factors influencing movement and the pathologies created by these movements were investigated. Radial calculations on the skulls, the radiographs and the clinical examinations which included dental gap impressions revealed that in all cases studied (P 2, P 3, M 1, M 2; n = 66) the teeth adjacent to the gap tipped quickly in the first few months, while later the rate of tipping declined. The tipping process terminated when teeth met and led to pathological conditions in all patients of the study. According to the requirements, dental spacers were constructed from horse teeth, urethane plugs and from metal. The spacers were tested on skulls, slaughter heads, and patients. While initially spacers had to be therapeutically effective, practicable, easy and gently to use as well as cost effective, demands on the spacer evolved to be additionally applicable for tipping correction, stable to anchor, usable on the standing patient and medically unobjectionable. Moreover the evolution of the final spacer design necessitated the use of a Dremel tool for application, whereas the prior designs were applied with adhesive, intraoral steel pins, and activated with a custom made long handled wrench. The use of the Dremel tool as a drill in the last design was to bore holes in the adjacent teeth to apply the spacer. The spacer was inserted into the holes by spring-loaded nipples and then activated by adjusting a threaded mechanism to the correct gap width. Thereby, the idea of a fast and easy adaptable plastic spacer which can be pressed in the <b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> had to be renounced. With most models it was difficult to insert the spacer into the maxilla without causing trauma to the soft tissues. Although model 13 b (adjusting screw without tooth pieces, base piece and side piece; passive fixation through spring-loaded nipples, which snap into tooth borings) could not be tested due to the lack of an appropriate dental drill, preliminary results indicated that only this model may meet all criteria for a dental spacer...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{frequency}} of and factors associated with the decision to perform single implant treatment after tooth extraction by general practitioners in a private, fee-for-service setting. Material and methods: One hundred practitioners with a general dental practice in Ghent were randomly selected. Clinicians were asked to fill in a study form for every single extraction they performed during an 8 -week period. The form related to the treatment decision {{and a number of}} patient- and clinician-related factors. Results: Ninety-four general dentists (52 males, 42 females; mean age 49; range 24 – 68) agreed to participate and extracted 1180 single teeth. After exclusion of third molars and cases where the reason for tooth loss would generally prohibit replacement, 900 cases were identified. In 24 % of these patients there was no treatment decision and in 18 % replacement was deemed unnecessary. When replacement was necessary (n = 526), removable partial denture (RPD), fixed partial denture (FPD), single implant treatment and resin-bonded bridge were chosen in 54 %, 24 %, 21 % and 1 % of the patients, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the decision-making process for single implant treatment against RPD and FPD. In relation to RPD, single implant treatment was more likely in highly educated patients with few missing teeth and no bone loss at adjacent teeth. In relation to FPD, single implant treatment was more likely in patients with intact adjacent teeth and when the tooth was extracted by a female dentist. Experience in implant prosthetics was positively associated with single implant treatment in all analyses. Conclusions: Single implant treatment is not the most common procedure in daily practice to restore a single <b>tooth</b> <b>gap.</b> Patient’s education, oral factors and clinician-related factors may affect the decision-making process, whereas medical factors may not...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of the clinical success and complication rates associated with autologous bone grafts harvested from the mandibular ramus for alveolar ridge augmentation and the identification of possible risk factors for graft failure. Methods: In a consecutive retrospective study 86 patients could be included. In these patients a total of 104 bone grafts from the mandibular ramus were harvested for alveolar ridge augmentation. Medical history, age of patient, smoking status, periodontal status and complications were recorded. The need for bone grafting was defined by the impossibility of installing dental implants of adequate length or diameter to fulfill prosthetic requirements, or for aesthetic reasons. The surgical outcome was evaluated concerning complications at the donor or at the recipient site, risk factors associated with the complications and graft survival. All patients were treated using a two-stage technique. In the first operation bone blocks harvested from the retromolar region were placed as lateral or vertical onlay grafts using augmentation templates and were fixed with titanium osteosynthesis screws after exposure of the deficient alveolar ridge. After a healing period of 3 – 5 months computed tomography scans were performed followed by virtual implant planning and the implants were inserted using guided dental implantation. Results: 97 of the 104 onlay bone grafts were successful. In only a graft failure occurred after a postsurgical complication. No long-term nerve damage occurred. Postoperative nerve disturbances were reported by 11 patients and had temporary character only. After the healing period between 4 to 5 months, 155 implants were placed (39 in the maxilla, 116 in the mandible). A final rehabilitation with dental implants was possible in 82 of the 86 patients. Except the failures, all recorded complications were minor complications which could be easily treated successfully without any long-term problems. Complications at the donor site were recorded in 3 patients and experienced complications at the recipient site. Three of with graft failure, were secondarily augmented with a new retromolar graft, harvested from the contra-lateral site and dental implants could be successfully inserted later. No association between complications and smoking habit, age of patient, jaw area, and dental situation (<b>tooth</b> <b>gap</b> or free dental arch) could be detected. Conclusions: Retromolar bone grafts are an effective and safe method for the reconstruction of small- to medium-sized alveolar defects of the maxilla and mandible prior to dental implantation and show a low graft failure rate...|$|E
40|$|In several European countries, dental {{composites}} are replacing mercury-containing amalgams as {{the most}} common restorative materials. The problems with dental composites are they can induce pain for the patient, fracture of the <b>tooth,</b> <b>gap</b> between the tooth and the filling what will induce secondary caries. The main reason is residual stresses. The factors affecting residual stresses are known; it is Young's modulus, volume changes, relaxation, geometry, but their importance is unknown. A model approach has been chosen {{in order to determine}} what are the main factors. An experimental set-up, shown in the second paper, to measure residual stresses has been made based on the bimetallic experiment. The dental composite is cured on an aluminum substrate and two strain gages register the bending of the substrate. From this experiment, the residual stresses in the composite could be determined. The modeling, treated in the second paper of this thesis, can be divided in sub-models. The first one is the cure kinetics in order to obtain the degree of cure. From this sub-model, the volume change and the Young's modulus can be determined. From the two last sub-models and the geometry, the stresses can be calculated. The chemical shrinkage was considered as linearly dependent on the degree of conversion. A simple pseudo-autocatalytic model was used for the cure kinetics. In order to do the calculation the change of modulus as a function of degree of cure has to be model. The viscoelastic properties of pure resin samples light-cure at different degree of conversion were determined using dynamic mechanical analysis and time-temperature superposition. The viscoelastic Young's modulus has been represented by a discrete exponential series and it has been observed that time-cure superposition works, what means that the weight factors do not depend on the degree of cure. Only the relaxed modulus, the unrelaxed modulus, and the principal relaxation time (time at which the relaxation spectrum has its maximum) depend on the degree of cure. A linear relation was found between the logarithm of these parameters and the degree of cure. An elastic Young's modulus model was done by taking the same expression as for viscoelasticity, but replacing the time by 1 s what corresponds to the change of the 1 Hz modulus as a function of degree of cure. The calculations were done for 2 D-constraint geometry like for the bimetallic experiment. Finite difference was used for the calculations. The changes of physical properties as a function of degree of cure were done on pure resin, but we need the changes for different filler content. This is the reason why the first paper deals with micro-mechanical models to predict the effect of filler on the Young's modulus and the chemical shrinkage. The Young's modulus is well described by the upper bound of Hashin's sphere model. Whereas the chemical shrinkage is well described by a modified Rosen and Hashin's model that was developed for the thermal coefficient expansion. Since this two models work well they were used for the calculation of the composite chemical shrinkage and the calculation of relaxed and unrelaxed Young's modulus considering that the weight factors and relaxation time were the same as for the resin. Two isothermal models have been done: one elastic and one viscoelastic. The viscoelastic model gives stresses that are 15 % lower than elastic case. The viscoelastic model gives good results at the beginning compare to the experimental data, but after it overestimates a lot the stresses. There are two main reasons. First the modeling of shrinkage is inadequate, it is believed that the shrinkage decreases near vitrification so the linear relation do not hold and induce an overestimation of stresses. The second factor is {{the fact that there is}} an exotherm from room temperature to 55 ºC in the case of pure resin, so the isothermal conditions are not fulfilled. This study shows us the validity of time-cure superposition. It also demonstrates that the modeling of shrinkage should be done more carefully and that the non-isothermal conditions should certainly be taken into account. The results of this thesis are presented in following papers: P. Lingois and L. Berglund, "Modeling Young's modulus and volume shrinkage of dental composites" P. Lingois, L. Berglund, A.
