60|$|This was {{the only}} voyage which I may say I was {{successful}} in all my adventures, and which I owe to the integrity and honesty of my friend the captain; under whom also I got a competent knowledge of the mathematics and the rules of navigation, learnt how <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> of the ship's course, take an observation, and, in short, to understand some things that were needful to be understood by a sailor: for, as he took delight to instruct me, I took delight to learn; and, in a word, this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant: for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure, which yielded me in London at my return almost £300, and this filled me with those aspiring thoughts which have so completed my ruin.|$|E

My captain also taught me navigation, how <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> of the ship's course, take an observation, and led me into the knowledge of several useful branches of the mathematics. And indeed this voyage made me both a sailor and a merchant; for I brought home five pounds nine ounces of gold-dust for my adventure which produced, at my return to London, almost three hundred pounds.

At this especial point in his career ready money was very valuable to him, but his concerns were of such magnitude that £250 could make but little difference. But there had grown upon the man during the last few months an arrogance, a self-confidence inspired in him by the worship of other men, which clouded his intellect, and robbed him of much of that power of calculation which undoubtedly he naturally possessed. He remembered perfectly his various little transactions with Sir Felix. Indeed it was one of his gifts to remember with accuracy all money transactions, whether great or small, and <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> book in his head, which was always totted up and balanced with accuracy. He knew exactly how he stood, even with the crossing-sweeper to whom he had given a penny last Tuesday, as with the Longestaffes, father and son, to whom he had not as yet made any payment on behalf of the purchase of Pickering. But Sir Felix's money had been consigned into his hands for the purchase of shares,--and that consignment did not justify Six Felix in taking another sum of money from his daughter. In such a matter he thought that an English magistrate, and an English jury, would all be on his side,--especially as he was Augustus Melmotte, the man about to be chosen for Westminster, the man about to entertain the Emperor of China! ...|$|E
6000|$|The mere use of one's eyes in Venice is {{happiness}} enough, {{and generous}} observers {{find it hard}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> of their profits in this line. Everything the attention touches holds it, keeps playing with it--thanks to some inscrutable flattery of the atmosphere. Your brown-skinned, white-shirted gondolier, twisting himself in the light, seems to you, as you lie at contemplation beneath your awning, a perpetual symbol of Venetian [...] "effect." [...] The light here {{is in fact a}} mighty magician and, with all respect to Titian, Veronese and Tintoret, the greatest artist of them all. You should see in places the material with which it deals--slimy brick, marble battered and befouled, rags, dirt, decay. Sea and sky seem to meet half-way, to blend their tones into a soft iridescence, a lustrous compound of wave and cloud and a hundred nameless local reflections, and then to fling the clear tissue against every object of vision. You may see these elements at work everywhere, but to see them in their intensity you should choose the finest day in the month and have yourself rowed far away across the lagoon to Torcello. Without making this excursion you can hardly pretend to know Venice or to sympathise with that longing for pure radiance which animated her great colourists. It is a perfect bath of light, and I couldn't get rid of a fancy that we were cleaving the upper atmosphere on some hurrying cloud-skiff. At Torcello there is nothing but the light to see-- nothing at least but a sort of blooming sand-bar intersected by a single narrow creek which does duty as a canal and occupied by a meagre cluster of huts, the dwellings apparently of market- gardeners and fishermen, and by a ruinous church of the eleventh century. It is impossible to imagine a more penetrating case of unheeded collapse. Torcello was the mother-city of Venice, and she lies there now, a mere mouldering vestige, like a group of weather-bleached parental bones left impiously unburied. I stopped my gondola {{at the mouth of the}} shallow inlet and walked along the grass beside a hedge to the low-browed, crumbling cathedral. The charm of certain vacant grassy spaces, in Italy, overfrowned by masses of brickwork that are honeycombed by the suns of centuries, is something that I hereby renounce once for all the attempt to express; but you may be sure that whenever I mention such a spot enchantment lurks in it.|$|E

A large number of factories in this and adjoining states which have until recently separated all the milk used at the creamery, now receive more or less cream from patrons using their own small separators. The general adoption of the system of paying for milk according to the amount of fat contained, makes it desirable that those furnishing cream be paid on the same basis.

The reforms began in 1924, when Nakhudas were required <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> separate <b>account</b> book for each diver and a boat-licensing tax was introduced. The former change was aimed to protect divers' interests, while the latter provided large income to the state (~Rs. 50,000 in 1924). There were several other changes in favor of the divers such as preventing the Nakhudas from punishing divers on board the boat, preventing selling of pearls without the presence and consent of divers, and assigning a minimum wage for divers.

This credit was known as bank money. Being always in accord with mint standards, and always of the same value, bank money was worth more than real coinage. At the same time a new regulation was introduced; according to which all bills drawn at Amsterdam worth more than 600 guilders must be paid in bank money. This both removed all uncertainty from these bills and compelled all merchants <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> with the bank, which in turn occasioned a certain demand for bank money.|$|E

As cannon came into use, the officers also required gunnery experts; specialist gunners began to appear in the 16th century and also had warrant officer status. Literacy was one thing that most warrant officers had in common, and this distinguished them from the common seamen: according to the Admiralty regulations, [...] "no person shall be appointed to any station in which he is to have charge of stores, unless he can read and write, and is sufficiently skilled in arithmetic <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> of them correctly".

The adaptive multi-robot system and its dynamic environment are modeled through a set of probabilistic equations which give an explicit description of the influence of the different variables of the system on the data collecting performance of the group. Further, we implement the multi-robot system in experiments with a group of Khepera robots and in simulation using Webots, a 3 -D simulator of Khepera robots.

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{the field}} of land-use {{hydrology}} it is frequently of value <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>a</b> chronological <b>account</b> or balance {{of the components of}} the water resource of a water-shed. In this paper a time period for studying this balance is described. Essentially it is the annual period between times of maximum watershed storage {{at the end of the}} dormant season. Changes in ground-water storage are taken into account, and by choosing the beginning and end points of the year at times of field capacity, water storage changes in the soil mass are eliminated. Sample data for an experimental watershed are given. In the management of water resources, it is of considerable value to be able <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> accounts of the resource in all of its phases of the hydrologic cycle. This is particularly true when an at-tempt is made to evaluate the effects of land use changes and land management practices on sev-eral components of the water cycle. Much progress has been made in establishing practical ac-counting methods with the use of the storage equation inflow = outflow + storage and other balanc-ing procedures [see "References " at end of paper; HURSH, HOOVER, and FLETCHER, 1942; HOYT and others, 1936; HOUK, 1921; VERMULE, 1894]...|$|R
