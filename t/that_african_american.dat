5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether negative aspects of the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, both Stanton and Anthony {{broke with}} their {{abolitionist}} backgrounds and lobbied strongly against {{ratification of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, which granted African American men the right to vote. Believing <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men, {{by virtue of the}} Thirteenth Amendment, already had the legal protections, except for suffrage, offered to white male citizens and that so largely expanding the male franchise in the country would only increase the number of voters prepared to deny women the right to vote, both Stanton and Anthony were angry that the abolitionists, their former partners in working for both African American and women's rights, refused to demand that the language of the amendments be changed to include women.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason that}} churches were so {{segregated}} within the United States {{was that there}} was little push from African American church leaders to have integrated churches. It was often that White religious leaders pushed for integrated churches, while African American leaders preferred separate congregations. This may be in part due to several factors, including the lack of opportunity to pursue leadership roles in predominantly White or segregated churches, the fact <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> churches allowed a place to build community, and for interests in practicing Christianity differently.|$|E
50|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that these {{official}} arrest statistics do not fully reflect actual criminal behavior as the criminal stereotype <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> hold influences the decisions to make arrests. Specifically, because the stereotype of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> is pervasive and embedded in society, police officers unconsciously believe <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> are dangerous {{and are therefore more}} likely to arrest <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|R
40|$|Data mining {{was used}} to {{investigate}} two facts: <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> represent 15 % of the population but 38 % of patients needing treatment in a hospital emergency room for shortness of breath and <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> have extremely high rates of lung cancer while reporting lower rates of cigarette smoke and exposure to toxic chemicals. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) containing locations of businesses that release toxic chemicals were combined with information concerning patient treatment and outcomes for shortness of breath.

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that SAT scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students. However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown to depend on the dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment (for example, high parental involvement in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and Hispanic women are the most stoic.|$|E

Holding the rank of major {{throughout}} the war, Loving was initially charged with investigating subversive activities by African American leaders, attending meetings and rallies in plainclothes and developing a network of informants. In one of his reports he would assert <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> socialists were [...] "the most radical of all radicals" [...] as well as allege [...] "vicious and well-financed propaganda" [...] campaigns run in black newspapers as being the impetus for the Chicago race riot of 1919.

500|$|The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South is a {{book written}} by American {{historian}} John W. Blassingame. Published in 1972, {{it is one of}} the first historical studies of slavery in the United States to be presented from the perspective of the enslaved. The Slave Community contradicted those historians who had interpreted history to suggest <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> slaves were docile and submissive [...] "Sambos" [...] who enjoyed the benefits of a paternalistic master-slave relationship on southern plantations. Using psychology, Blassingame analyzes fugitive slave narratives published in the 19th century to conclude that an independent culture developed among the enslaved and that there were a variety of personality types exhibited by slaves.|$|E
500|$|Phillips's {{interpretation}} of slavery was challenged by Kenneth M. Stampp in The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South (1956) and Stanley M. Elkins in Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life (1958). Stampp's study lacks the racist interpretation found in American Negro Slavery and approaches the {{issue from the}} position {{that there is no}} innate difference between blacks and whites. He questions the reality of plantation paternalism described by Phillips: [...] "the reality of ante-bellum paternalism ... needs to be separated from its fanciful surroundings and critically analyzed." [...] Elkins also dismisses Phillips's claim <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> slaves were innately submissive [...] "Sambos". He argues that slaves had instead been infantilized, or [...] "made" [...] into Sambos, by the brutal treatment received at the hands of slaveowners and overseers. Elkins compares the process to the infantilization of Jews in Nazi concentration camps.|$|E

500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing". The director affirmed <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E

African American feminist {{sociologist}} Siobhan Brooks while working at the club had noticed <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> dancers were discriminated against and filed a complaint.

50|$|One {{specific}} {{study showed}} <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> {{are less likely}} than whites to be referred for cardiac catheterization and bypass grafting, prescription of analgesia for pain control, and surgical treatment of lung cancer. Both <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Latinos also receive less pain medication than whites for long bone fractures and cancer. Other studies showed <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> are reported to receive fewer pediatric prescriptions, poorer quality of hospital care, fewer hospital admissions for chest pain, lower quality of prenatal care, and less appropriate management of congestive heart failure and pneumonia.|$|R
2500|$|On July 4, 1865, {{after the}} Civil War ended, Boutwell {{gave a speech}} that {{advocated}} African American suffrage, echoing Thomas Jefferson's principal view from the Declaration of Independence that [...] "all men are created equal."

2500|$|Addressing {{slavery in}} the Constitution, Madison set out with a view <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> slaves as an [...] "unfortunate race" [...] and {{believed}} their true nature was both human and property. On February 12, 1788, Madison, in Federalist No. 54, stated that the Constitutional three-fifths compromise clause was the best alternative for the slaves' current condition and for determining representation of citizens in Congress. Madison believed that slaves, as property, would be protected by both their masters and the government.|$|E

Two, an acknowledgement <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> used military service as a way to demonstrate their legitimacy as American citizens. Finally, military service proved to be a viable method of resistance to the institution of slavery during both the American Revolution and the War of 1812.

2500|$|Among African Americans, {{proximal}} stressors {{were described}} by early social psychological theorists. For example, Erving Goffman observed that racial minorities approach social interactions {{with a high}} degree of anxiety, because they have been discriminated against in the past. Similarly, Gordon Allport asserted <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> individuals display vigilance after exposure to prejudice, actively scanning the social environment for potential threats. [...] Such vigilance is presumed to be taxing, sapping emotional and cognitive energy from minority individuals and thus becoming stressful. [...] Proximal stressors also have been demonstrated among African Americans in terms of stereotype threat. Researchers have shown that, when African Americans are reminded of their racial minority status in an academic context, they face a high degree of anxiety, causing their intellectual performance to suffer.|$|E

But I do think that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is.

2500|$|Edwards Pierrepont (March 4, 1817 [...] March 6, 1892) was {{a popular}} American attorney, reformer, jurist, traveler, New York U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney General, U.S. Minister to England, and orator. Having {{graduated}} from Yale in 1837, Pierrepont studied law and {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1840. During the American Civil War, Pierrepont was a Democrat, although he supported President Abraham Lincoln. Pierrepont initially supported President Andrew Johnson's conservative Reconstruction efforts having opposed the Radical Republicans. In both 1868 and 1872, Pierrepont supported Ulysses S. Grant for President. For his support, President Grant appointed Pierrepont United States Attorney in 1869. In 1871, Pierrepont gained the reputation as a solid reformer, having joined New York's Committee of Seventy that shut down Boss Tweed's corrupt Tammany Hall. In 1872, Pierrepont modified his views on Reconstruction and stated <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> freedman's rights needed to be protected.|$|E

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> are two to {{four times}} more likely to develop {{dementia}} as Non-Hispanic Whites. This increased risk among <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> represents a critical health disparity that affects nearly 43 million Americans. The present study tested the hypothesis <b>that</b> older <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> with elevated beta-amyloid would show greater neurodegeneration (smaller hippocampal volumes and decreased cortical thickness) than older Non-Hispanic Whites with elevated beta-amyloid. Data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) were used to form a group of older <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and two matched groups of Non-Hispanic White adults. Amyloid-positive <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had decreased cortical thickness in most of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature regions compared with amyloid-positive Non-Hispanic Whites. This factor was negatively correlated with age and white matter hypointensities. Using support vector regression, we also found some evidence <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> have an older “brain age” than Non-Hispanic Whites. These findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> might be more susceptible to factors causing neurodegeneration, which then might accelerate the rate of a diagnosis of AD...|$|R
