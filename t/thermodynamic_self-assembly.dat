40|$|Abstract- The {{creation}} of structural hierarchies in open natural biosystems {{within the framework}} of quasi-closed systems is investigated by the methods of hierarchic thermodynamics (thermostatics). During the evolution of natural open systems, every higher hierarchic level j appears as a consequence of <b>thermodynamic</b> self-organization (<b>self-assembly)</b> of the structures of the lower (j- 1) -th level. Such a self-assembly proceeds as a result of stabilization of the j-th level. This is related to the Gibbs ` (Helmholtz`) specific function of formation {{of the structure of the}} j-th level tending to a minimum. As a result of action of the principle of substance (matter) stability, the structures of the j-th level are enriched with less stable structures of the (j- 1) -th level in the course of evolution. This provides a thermodynamic feedback between the structures of the higher j-th level and lower (j- 1) -th level, thus preventing full structural stabilization of the j-th level and causing "thermodynamic rejuvenation " of biosystems. The latter enhances "thermodynamic " deceleration of evolution and practically unlimited maintenance of life. Examples of quantitative correlations are provided that cal...|$|R

Yet, {{little is known}} about the thermodynamically stable phases of polyhedrally-shaped building blocks, such as faceted nanoparticles and colloids. Although hard particles are known to organize due to entropy alone, and some unusual phases are reported in the literature, the role of entropic forces in connection with polyhedral shape is not well understood. Here, we study <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>self-assembly</b> of a family of truncated tetrahedra and report several atomic crystal isostructures, including diamond, β-tin, and high- pressure lithium, as the polyhedron shape varies from tetrahedral to octahedral. We compare our findings with the densest packings of the truncated tetrahedron family obtained by numerical compression and report a new space filling polyhedron, which has been overlooked in previous searches. Interestingly, the self-assembled structures differ from the densest packings. We show that the self-assembled crystal structures can be understood as a tendency for polyhedra to maximize face-to-face alignment, which can be generalized as directional entropic forces.

40|$|This 'Perspective' article summarises {{recent work}} from the authors' {{research}} group on the exploitation of the simple fac/mer geometric isomerism of octahedral metal tris-chelates {{as a tool to}} control the chemistry of coordination cages based on bis(pyrazolyl-pyridine) ligands, in two different respects. Firstly this geometric isomerism {{plays a major role in}} controlling the guest binding properties of cages because a fac tris-chelate arrangement of pyrazolyl-pyridine chelates around a metal ion vertex results in formation of a convergent set of inwardly-directed C-H protons in a region of high positive electrostatic potential close to a metal cation. This collection of δ+ protons therefore provides a charge-assisted hydrogen-bond donor site, which interacts with the electron-rich regions of guest molecules that are of the correct size and shape to occupy the cage cavity, and the strength of this hydrogen-bonding interaction plays a major role in guest recognition in non-aqueous solvents. Secondly the ability to prepare mononuclear complexes with either a fac or mer arrangement of ligands provides an entry into the controlled, stepwise assembly of heterometallic cages based on a combination of kinetically inert and kinetically labile metal ions at different sites. This has allowed introduction of useful physical properties such as redox activity or luminescence, commonly associated with inert metal ions which are not amenable to participation in <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>self-assembly</b> processes, to be incorporated in a predictable way into the superstructures of coordination cages at specific sites...|$|E
40|$|A {{paintable}} {{computer is}} defined as an agglomerate of numerous, finely dispersed, ultra-miniaturized computing particles; each positioned randomly, running asynchronously and communicating locally. Individual particles are tightly resource bound, and processing is necessarily distributed. Yet computing elements are vanishingly cheap and are regarded as freely expendable. In this regime, a limiting problem is the distribution of processing over a particle ensemble whose topology can vary unexpectedly. The principles of material self-assembly are employed to guide the positioning of "process fragments" - autonomous, mobile pieces of a larger process. These fragments spatially position themselves and reaggregate into a running process. We present the results of simulations to show that "process self-assembly" is viable, robust and supports a variety of useful applications on a paintable computer. We describe a hardware reference platform as an initial guide to the application domain. We describe a programming model which normatively defines the term process fragment and which provides environmental support for the fragment's mobility, scheduling and data exchange. The programming model is embodied in a simulator that supports development, test and visualization on a 2 D particle ensemble. Experiments on simple combinations of fragments demonstrate robustness and explore the limits of scale invariance. Process fragments are shown interacting to approximate conservative fields, and using these fields to implement scaffolded and <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>self-assembly.</b> (cont.)

40|$|Incorporating an {{ionic liquid}} into one block {{copolymer}} microphase provides {{a platform for}} combining the outstanding electrochemical properties of ionic liquids {{with a number of}} favorable attributes provided by block copolymers. In particular, block copolymers thermodynamically self-assemble into well-ordered nanostructures, which can be engineered to provide a durable mechanical scaffold and template the ionic liquid into continuous ion-conducting nanochannels. Understanding how the addition of an ionic liquid affects the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>self-assembly</b> of block copolymers, and how the confinement of ionic liquids to block copolymer nanodomains affects their ion-conducting properties is essential for predictable structure-property control. The lyotropic phase behavior of block copolymer/ionic liquid mixtures is shown to be reminiscent of mixtures of block copolymers with selective molecular solvents. A variety of ordered microstructures corresponding to lamellae, hexagonally close-packed cylinders, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic oriented micelles are observed in a model system composed of mixtures of imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ([Im][TFSI]) and poly(styrene-b- 2 -vinyl pyridine) (PS-b-P 2 VP). In contrast to block copolymer/molecular solvent mixtures, the interfacial area occupied by each PS-b-P 2 VP chain decreases upon the addition of [Im][TFSI], indicating a considerable increase in the effective segregation strength of the PS-b-P 2 VP copolymer with ionic liquid addition. The relationship between membrane structure and ionic conductivity is illuminated through the development of scaling relationships that describe the ionic conductivity of block copolymer/ionic liquid mixtures as a function of membrane composition and temperature. It is shown that the dominant variable influencing conductivity is the overall volume fraction of ionic liquid in the mixture, which means there is incredible freedom in designing the block copolymer architecture in order to optimize the mechanical and other properties of the membrane without sacrificing conductivity. The derived scaling relationships are shown to be general for many block copolymer and ionic liquid chemistries. In certain cases, the mechanism of ion conduction in the ionic liquid is affected by block copolymer nanoconfinement. The introduction of excess neutral imidazole to [Im][TFSI] leads to enhanced proton conductivity as well as a high H+ transference number due to facilitated proton hopping between imidazole molecules. We show that there is increased proton hopping when the nonstoichiometric ionic liquid is confined to lamellar block copolymer nanodomains, which we hypothesize is due to changes in the hydrogen bond structure of the ionic liquid under confinement. This, in combination with unique ion aggregation behavior, leads to a lower activation energy for macroscopic ion transport compared to that in a corresponding homopolymer/ionic liquid mixture. Through this work, we further the understanding of the relationship between membrane composition, structure, and ion transport.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of nanometer-sized entities of defined structure on the nanometer scale {{is a challenge}} hardly achievable by large-scale top-down procedures. In particular, alternative techniques are needed to structure surfaces at very small length scales. In nanotechnology the process of self-assembly has become a potent method which allows to vanquish these difficulties. Self-assembly is a mechanism by which randomly distributed small units arrange into large, ordered structures under equilibrium conditions. Information about the final morphology of the self-assembled structure is encoded at least partially in the basic building units. The environment constitutes an additional parameter which influences the self-assembly process, impairing both its thermodynamics and kinetics.

40|$|A model {{treating}} the competition, under <b>thermodynamic</b> control, between <b>self-assembly</b> and nonlinear random polymerization is presented. The fundamental quantities {{on which the}} treatment is based are the effective molarity (EM) of the assembly and the equilibrium constant for the intermolecular model reaction between monofunctional reactants (Kinter). Knowledge of these quantities allows {{the evaluation of the}} distribution curve of the self-assembling complex. In order for effective self-assembly to take place, the product KinterEM must be no lower than a limit value easily computable on the basis of simple structural parameters such as the number of molecules in the assembly (N), the number of bonds joining them (B), and the number of interaction sites in the monomers. This limit decreases on decreasing N and on increasing B, and the most obvious way to realize this condition is by increasing the degree of cyclicity of the assembly (B − N + 1). The yield of an assembly {{with a high degree of}} cyclicity is very sensitive also to modest changes of KinterEM about its limit value.

40|$|Five {{polymeric}} architectures with {{a systematic}} increase in architectural complexity were synthesized by "click" reactions from a toolbox of functional linear polymers and small molecule linkers. The amphiphilic architectures {{ranged from a}} simple 3 -miktoarm star block copolymer to the more complex third generation dendrimer-like block copolymer, consisting of polystyrene (PSTY) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). Micellization of these architectures in water at a pH of 7 under identical ionic strength gave spherical micelles {{ranging in size from}} 9 to 30 nm. Subsequent calculations of the PSTY core density, average surface area per PAA arm on the corona-core interface, and the relative stretching of the PAA arms provided insights into the effect of architecture on the self-assembly processes. A particular trend was observed that with increased architectural complexity the hydrodynamic diameter, radius of the core in the dry state and the aggregation number also increased {{with the exception of the}} third generation dendrimer. On the basis of these observations, we postulate that <b>thermodynamic</b> factors controlling <b>self-assembly</b> were the entropic penalty of forming PSTY loops in the core counterbalanced by the reduction in repulsive forces through chain stretching. This results in a greater number of aggregating unimers and consequently larger micelle sizes. The junction points within the architecture also play an important role in controlling the self-assembly process. The G 3 dendrimer showed results contradictory to the aforementioned trend. We believe that the self-assembly process of this architecture was dominated by the increased attractive forces due to stretching of the PSTY core chains to form a more compact core.

40|$|Functional {{materials}} that are active at nanometer scales and adaptive to environment have been highly desirable for a huge array of novel applications ranging from photonics, sensing, fuel cells, smart materials to drug delivery and miniature robots. These bio-inspired features imply that the underlying structure {{of this type of}} materials should possess a well-defined ordering as well as the ability to reconfigure in response to a given external stimulus such as temperature, electric field, pH or light. In this thesis, we employ computer simulation as a design tool, demonstrating that various ordered and reconfigurable structures can be obtained from the self- and directed-assembly of soft matter nano-building blocks such as nanoparticles, polymer-tethered nanoparticles and colloidal particles. We show that, besides <b>thermodynamic</b> parameters, the <b>self-assembly</b> of these building blocks is governed by nanoparticle geometry, the number and attachment location of tethers, solvent selectivity, balance between attractive and repulsive forces, nanoparticle size polydispersity, and field strength. We demonstrate that higher-order nanostructures, i. e. those for which the correlation length is much greater than the length scale of individual assembling building blocks, can be hierarchically assembled. For instance, bilayer sheets formed by laterally tethered rods fold into spiral scrolls and helical structures, which are able to adopt different morphologies depending on the environmental condition. We find that a square grid structure formed by laterally tethered nanorods can be transformed into a bilayer sheet structure, and vice versa, upon shortening, or lengthening, the rod segments, respectively. From these inspiring results, we propose a general scheme by which shape-shifting particles are employed to induce the reconfiguration of pre-assembled structures. Finally, we investigate the role of an external field in assisting the formation of assembled structures that would not be accessible from self-assembly. As an example, we show the assembly of magnetic Janus particles with a highly ordered alignment and a tunable gradient density, which are likely to be applicable to photonic band gap materials.

The <b>thermodynamic</b> parameters governing <b>self-assembly</b> of BCPs generally leads to periodic morphologies with characteristic length scales ranging from 10 to 100 nm. Several applications have been demonstrated utilizing BCPs as a template for the fabrication of nanostructured materials. Fabricating structures beyond the 10 - 100 nm range, remains a challenge and constitutes {{one of the goals of}} the proposed research. This dissertation is divided into two parts. The first focuses on the sub 10 nm length scale, when by chemically converting one of the blocks of the BCP, segmental interactions can be made extremely non-favorable, enabling smaller size scale structure to be achieved. The second is related to the study of brush block copolymers (BrBCPs) that can produce structured with characteristic length scales that can span from the sub- 10 nm to 100 s of nm. In first part, poly (styrene-b-solketal methacrylate) (PS-b-PSM) was investigated to generate the highly ordered microphase separated structures with deep sub 10 nm period. This novel BCP contains the solketal group which can be hydrolyzed readily into the glyceryl group in dry state under acidic conditions. The phase-mixed PS-b-PSM BCPs were forced into highly ordered lamellae microdomain of poly(styrene-b-glyceryl methacrylate) (PS-b-PGM) by substantial increase of Flory-Huggins segmental interaction parameter by the acid triggered hydrolysis reaction. The weakly segregated microdomains of the PS-b-PSM was successfully driven into the strongly segregated regime microdomains of the PS-b-PGM. Highly ordered lamellae microdomain of the PS-b-PGM with deep sub 10 nm domain size was achieved in thin film by conversion in dry state from the precursor PS-b-PSM thin films. The lamellae microdomain orientation was controlled into perpendicularly oriented to the substrate by novel design of conversion BCP thin film in a gradient manner. In second part, BrBCPs blends containing homopolymers in bulk and thin films were investigated. BrBCPs have been achieved great attention to achieve microphase separated structures with extremely large microdomain size over 100 nm readily compared to the conventional linear BCP. Its unusual rigid-like structure from the densely-grafted side chains to the backbone can prohibit it from the chain entanglement so as to provide the fast kinetics of the self-assembly. By adding homopolymers to the BrBCPs, the microdomain size was further increased. The morphologies and microdomain size of BrBCPs blends with homopolymers were studied using small angle x-ray scattering measurement. Perdeuterated homopolymers were used to detect the exact location and distribution of homopoymers in thin films by performing neutron reflectivity.
