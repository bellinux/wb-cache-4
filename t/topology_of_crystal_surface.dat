The nucleation rate was calculated and the critical nuclei were identified using a mean first-passage time analysis. The nucleation rate was found to be insensitive to the chain length in this range of molecular weight. The critical nucleus contains about 150 carbons on average and is significantly smaller than the radius of gyration of the chains, at this supercooling. A cylinder model was used to characterize the shape <b>of</b> the <b>crystal</b> nuclei and to calculate the interfacial free energies. A chain segment analysis was performed to characterize the <b>topology</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crystal</b> <b>surface</b> in terms <b>of</b> loops (including folds) and tails. The length distribution of loops is broad, supporting the “switchboard model” for the early stage crystals formed at deep supercooling. Using the survival probability method, the critical nucleus size was determined as a function of temperature. The interfacial free energies were found to be temperature-dependent. The free energy barrier and nucleation rate as functions of temperature were also calculated and compare favorably with experiments. Exxon Mobil Corporatio...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a multiple-scale {{experimental study of}} mineral dissolution kinetics, utilizing direct measurement <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>surface</b> morphology in great detail to determine rates and mechanisms acting at the reactive solid-solution interface. The overall approach uses primarily vertical scanning interferometry (VSI) to analyze three­dimensional <b>crystal</b> <b>surface</b> morphological change and quantify rates of dissolution. Integration of VSI with atomic force microscopy (AFM), theoretical kinetic models, and thermodynamic calculations has permitted the recognition of rate-controlling processes and mechanisms, thus strengthening our ability to link dissolution kinetics over {{a broad range of}} length and time scales. The motivation for this thesis arises from an incomplete understanding of how molecular-scale surface processes, acting at the solid-solution interface, control large-scale natural dissolution phenomena. Mineral dissolution is a fundamental geologic process that exerts control over a number of significant geochemical events which can affect both man and the environment over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. At the Earth surface, rates of dissolution are largely surface-controlled, and thus influenced by the three­dimensional nature <b>of</b> the <b>crystal</b> <b>surface.</b> The goals <b>of</b> this thesis involve improving overall understanding of dissolution rate-scaling issues by investigation <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>surface</b> dissolution kinetics, identification ofrate-controlling mechanisms. This thesis reports investigations into the dissolution kinetics of calcite, rhyolite and uraninite over a range of far-from-equilibrium laboratory conditions. The results presented within this work demonstrate that: 1. Monomolecular "rough" step retreat controls the overall rate <b>of</b> calcite <b>crystal</b> dissolution, which in turn can be inhibited by impurity adsorption at a level dependent on the physical and chemical properties of the adsorbing impurity and the presence of carbonate in solution. 2. Heterogeneous retreat of volcanic glass phases control overall rhyolite dissolution rate and the steady-sate release of ions into solution, which in turn may be influenced by the formation of a surface reprecipitation phase. 3. Dissolved carbon species influence the steady-state dissolution uraninite, although this dissolution fails to produce resolvable surface-normal retreat.
