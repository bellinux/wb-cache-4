5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> a taped {{broadcast of the}} final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, sat alone {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993.

40|$|Recognized {{musicians and}} {{researchers}} {{in the field of}} music improvisation, like George Lewis and Vijay Iyer, claim that listeners to improvised music improvise as well and, in so doing, they employ the notion of improvisation in the aesthetics of reception, as opposed to its more usual employment in the aesthetics of production. In this paper I aim to discuss if and how should we make sense of this claim. Furthermore I will try to answer a more general question, that is, whether, and in which sense, we can extend the idea of improvisational <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> every <b>listening,</b> <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> as such, not only <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> an improvisation...|$|R
