Bühlmann recognized <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> {{associated with}} altitude diving, and proposed {{a method that}} calculated maximum nitrogen loading in the tissues at a particular ambient pressure by modifying Haldane's allowable supersaturation ratios to increase linearly with depth.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> with the {{original}} design, in summer 1542 work recommenced on the castle, well after the initial invasion scare was over, lasting until August 1543.

Oxenbridge appears to have stayed on as the pay master and acted as {{the master of the}} works, with von Haschenperg remaining in his role as engineer almost {{until the end of the}} project, despite the difficulties with his earlier work. The cost of the second phase of work was much higher than the first, around £10,000.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> {{of mental}} {{causation}} is a conceptual {{issue in the}} philosophy of mind.

The Jury aims to order <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6.

30|$|It {{is worth}} noticing that: (i) The {{nonlinearity}} f and the pulse function {{in this paper}} are not positive, so our hypotheses on the nonlinearity f and the pulse function are weaker than condition of [18].
