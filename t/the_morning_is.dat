25|$|RA {{typically}} manifests {{with signs}} of inflammation, with the affected joints being swollen, warm, painful and stiff, particularly {{early in the}} morning on waking or following prolonged inactivity. Increased stiffness early in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour. Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in early stages of the disease. These signs help distinguish rheumatoid from non-inflammatory problems of the joints, such as osteoarthritis. In arthritis of non-inflammatory causes, signs of inflammation and early morning stiffness are less prominent with stiffness typically less than one hour, and movements induce pain caused by mechanical arthritis.|$|E
25|$|The scroll of Eicha (Lamentations) is read in synagogue {{during the}} evening services. In addition, most of <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> spent {{chanting}} or reading Kinnot, most bewailing {{the loss of the}} Temples and the subsequent persecutions, but many others referring to post-exile disasters. These later kinnot were composed by various poets (often prominent rabbis) who had either suffered in the events mentioned or relate received reports. Important kinnot were composed by Elazar ha-Kalir and Rabbi Judah ha-Levi. After the Holocaust, kinnot were composed by the German-born Rabbi Shimon Schwab (in 1959, at the request of Rabbi Joseph Breuer) and by Rabbi Solomon Halberstam, leader of the Bobov Hasidim (in 1984). Since Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza, some segments of the Religious Zionist community have begun to recite kinnot to commemorate the expulsion of Jewish settlers from Gush Katif and the northern West Bank on the day after Tisha B'Av, in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Normal flatus {{volume range}} is around 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} flatus episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of intestinal gas in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of intestinal gas. It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of intestinal gas present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation. This process is thought not to affect solid and liquid intra-lumenal contents.|$|E

Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always said you would find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more.

500|$|In 2010, {{starting}} {{horses in}} 53 races for the year, she also {{took over the}} training of then-two-year-old Mucho Macho Man when her husband Tim stopped training horses because he began working {{as part of the}} management at Gulfstream Park. [...] Working with owners Reeves Thoroughbred Racing, the horse ran in the 2011 Kentucky Derby. Ritvo was only the 14th woman to train a horse entered in the Kentucky Derby in the 137 years it had been run to that date, and the third-place finish of the horse was the best for a woman trainer {{in the history of the}} race. [...] She kept her perspective: [...] "I'm so proud to be in the Derby, but just to get up in <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> amazing." [...] She next ran Mucho Macho Man in the other two legs of the Triple Crown, the 136th Preakness Stakes and the 143rd Belmont Stakes, where he finished sixth and seventh respectively. Only 13 women trainers had saddled a starter prior to the 2011 Preakness, and Ritvo was only the 10th woman trainer to start a horse in the Belmont. [...] Mucho Macho Man had overcome his own health problems in order to race, including having appeared to be lifeless at birth. Comparing her own experiences to the horse, Ritvo stated, [...] "From the moment I opened my eyes, I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have long}} noted Shakespeare's {{widespread}} use {{of light and dark}} imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as [...] "symbolic of the natural beauty of young love" [...] and later critics have expanded on this interpretation. For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun, brighter than a torch, a jewel sparkling in the night, and a bright angel among dark clouds. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her [...] "beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light." [...] Juliet describes Romeo as [...] "day in night" [...] and [...] "Whiter than snow upon a raven's back." [...] This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony. For example, Romeo and Juliet's love is a light {{in the midst of the}} darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>is</b> gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet. The [...] "light" [...] theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.|$|E

Going to bed before the usual hour is a frequent cause of night-mare, as it either occasions the patient to sleep too long or to lie long awake in the night.
