The <b>tree</b> domatic <b>number</b> of G is {{the maximum number}} of pairwise disjoint tree dominating sets in V(G).

This access must be organized {{in terms of the}} information content of information sources {{and in terms of the}} discovery of the network location of those information sources. We have developed an approach to providing organized access to information sources based on a scheme of hierarchical classifiers and identifiers of the servers providing access to those information sources. This approach uses MeSH <b>tree</b> <b>numbers</b> as both classifiers and identifiers of servers. MeSH <b>tree</b> <b>numbers</b> are used to indicate the information content of servers, and also as OSF/DCE server identifiers.
