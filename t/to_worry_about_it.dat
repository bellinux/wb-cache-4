500|$|So the {{pamphlet}} could be published {{as soon as}} she finished writing it, Wollstonecraft wrote frantically while her publisher Joseph Johnson printed the pages. In fact, Godwin's Memoirs of Wollstonecraft tells that the sheets of manuscript were delivered to the press as they were written. Halfway through the work, however, she ceased writing. One biographer describes it as a [...] "loss of nerve"; Godwin, in his Memoirs, describes it as [...] "a temporary fit of torpor and indolence". Johnson, perhaps canny enough at this point in their friendship to know how to encourage her, agreed to dispose of the book and told her not <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Ashamed, she rushed to finish.|$|E

500|$|Tyndall was antisemitic. From earlier fascists like Chesterton, he had {{inherited}} {{a belief that}} there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, opining that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both communism and international finance capitalism, using both to their own ends, and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. Tyndall also believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of a Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. He had expressed the view that [...] "if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about...</b> <b>It</b> is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?" [...] Another of his comments, made in 1963, was that [...] "Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. The Jews are more clever and more financially powerful than other people and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples".|$|E

Following the track list reveal for the album, on February 7, 2014, producer DJ Mustard revealed that he co-produced [...] "Sanctified" [...] with Kanye West. The song was also produced by Mike Dean, along with being written by William Roberts, Sean Anderson, Kanye West, and Dijon McFarlane. Betty Wright lent her vocal talent to the song during a late night studio session she did {{as a favor to}} DJ Khaled in order for him to meet a deadline. She recorded the hook in fifteen minutes while sitting on a sofa [...] In the song, West raps about how he feels about people playing up his earlier works and dismiss who he is now, before saying that he's not going <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Then later he says, [...] "Wipe my forehead with a handkerchief and wash my sins in the blood of Jesus, People sayin', 'Ye, we need another Yeezus."

500|$|The reveal of the in-series {{documentary}} crew in [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] received {{large amounts}} of critical attention. E! Online named the reveal one of the [...] "Best TV Moments of the Week". Verne Gay of Newsday called the scene a [...] "historic" [...] moment for the show. Conversely, Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club wrote an article that argued that the mockumentary format made the camera [...] "an audience surrogate", and that by revealing the documentary crew, [...] "the audience no longer felt welcome". The subplot involving Brian (played by Chris Diamantopoulos), a boom mic operator for the in-series documentary, was met with mostly negative reviews. Michael Tedder of Vulture called it [...] "the least interesting way this camera crew reveal could have gone". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic criticized the reintroduction of the character in the episode [...] "Promos", noting that his reappearance felt [...] "forced". McNutt called it [...] "an abandoned novelty". Daniels later revealed {{in an interview that}} the subplot was a red herring to keep viewers emotionally invested in Pam and Jim's story. He explained, [...] "we never intended him to actually , but wanted people <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> so they would be engaged in the story." ...|$|E

[...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E

[...] Tyndall added Holocaust denial to the anti-Semitic beliefs inherited from Chesterton, believing that the Holocaust was a hoax created by the Jews to gain sympathy for themselves and thus aid their plot for world domination. Among those to endorse such anti-Semitic conspiracy theories was Griffin, who promoted them in his 1997 pamphlet, Who are the Mind Benders?. Griffin also engaged in Holocaust denial, publishing articles promoting such ideas in The Rune, a magazine produced by the Croydon BNP. In 1998, these articles resulted in Griffin being convicted of inciting racial hatred.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, Gravano {{and several}} {{other members of the}} Gambino family became disenchanted with Gotti's lust for the media and {{high-profile}} antics, feeling they brought too much heat. Several members of the family informed Gravano that Gotti's high profile and large gatherings of mob members at the Ravenite Social Club were constant targets for the FBI and that the media attention put a large spotlight on the Gambinos. Many members of the family, according to Gravano, complained to him about Gotti's use of Gravano in murders despite Gravano's position as underboss of the family. Members were also concerned about Gotti's frequent appearances in court. He was first tried for assaulting a refrigerator repairman over a parking space. Through witness intimidation, he was acquitted. Gravano had paid a juror in Gotti's second trial to vote in favor of an acquittal allowing Gotti to beat the RICO charges lodged against him. Gotti's third trial on state assault charges ended the same way. Gotti's ego began to bother Gravano as well as several other members of the family. Gotti was first known as the [...] "Dapper Don" [...] in the press for his Brioni suits and hand-painted ties as well as his well-combed hair and quick wit with reporters. Gotti required Gravano and Gambino consigliere Frank LoCascio to be at the Ravenite social club five days a week and all of his captains to make an appearance once a week. When Gravano warned Gotti about the negative attention from reporters as well as the constant surveillance from the FBI, Gotti instructed Gravano not <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> as Gotti said that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E

50|$|Because Southern {{senators}} and congressmen had their seniority <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> as <b>it</b> determined places on committees, few of Georgia’s congressmen would risk openly supporting Thurmond once Truman was established as the “Democratic” candidate. Consequently, Truman {{had no trouble}} carrying the state by 40.49 percentage points, and Thurmond gained a majority in just ten of 159 counties. Almost all of these Thurmond counties were located adjacent to the South Carolina governor’s home county of Edgefield, South Carolina, whilst in most counties north of Atlanta Thurmond’s percentage remained in single figures.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} the Worry Inventory for Managers (WIM), a 24 -item measure of job-related worries in managers. After item selection by expert ratings, a sample of 138 managers rated each item for the intensity of <b>worry,</b> the extent <b>to</b> which they <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> during work, and the extent <b>to</b> which they <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> after work. In addition, measures of pathological worrying, job involvement, and self-reliance were administered. Factor analysis of the WIM revealed two facets of job-related <b>worry,</b> namely <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> (1) Organizational Processes and (2) Work Overload, of which the latter predominated after work. Job-related and pathological worry showed distinct patterns of correlation with the three factors of self-reliance, that is Counterdependence, Overdependence, and Secure Relationships. The potentially detrimental effects of worry both during work (e. g., performance decrements) and after work (e. g., recreation failure) are briefly discussed...|$|R
