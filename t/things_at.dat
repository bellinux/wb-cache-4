5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton {{went on to}} say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw <b>things</b> <b>at</b> each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Heathen festivals {{can be held}} on {{the same}} day each year, {{although}} they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those practitioners who work during the week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as <b>Things.</b> <b>At</b> these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.|$|E
5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and {{is confined to}} the couch for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean his room and while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his <b>things.</b> <b>At</b> school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn's {{next film}} was Undercurrent (1946), a film noir with Robert Taylor and Robert Mitchum that was poorly received. A fourth film with Tracy came in 1947: a drama {{set in the}} American Old West {{entitled}} The Sea of Grass. Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love, a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success {{both at home and}} abroad. The same year, Hepburn portrayed Clara Wieck Schumann in Song of Love. She trained intensively with a pianist for the role. By the time of its release in October, Hepburn's career had been significantly affected by her public opposition to the growing anti-communist movement in Hollywood. Viewed by some as dangerously progressive, she was not offered work for nine months and people reportedly threw <b>things</b> <b>at</b> screenings of Song of Love. Her next film role came unexpectedly, as she agreed to replace Claudette Colbert only days before shooting began on Frank Capra's political drama State of the Union (1948). Tracy had long been signed to play the male lead, and so Hepburn was already familiar with the script and stepped up for the fifth Tracy–Hepburn picture. Critics responded positively to the film and it performed well at the box-office.|$|E

25|$|Barrie {{was very}} perspicacious in noticing {{many aspects of}} children's mental {{development}} decades before they were studied by cognitive psychologists.
