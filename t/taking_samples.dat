25|$|The {{suspected}} {{source for}} the epidemic was the Artibonite River, from {{which most of the}} affected people had drunk water. Suspicion among Haitians centered on a UN military base on a tributary of that river home to peacekeepers from Nepal. MINUSTAH officials issued a press statement denying the possibility that the base could have caused the epidemic, citing stringent sanitation standards. The next day, 27 October, reporter Jonathan M. Katz of the Associated Press visited the base and found gross inconsistencies between the statement and the base's actual conditions. Katz also happened upon UN military police <b>taking</b> <b>samples</b> of ground water to test for cholera, despite UN assertions that it was not concerned about a possible link between its soldiers and the disease. Neighbors told the reporter that waste from the base often spilled into the river. Later that day, a crew from Al Jazeera English including reporter Sebastian Walker filmed the soldiers trying to excavate a leaking pipe; the video was posted online the next day and, citing AP's report, drew increased awareness to the base. MINUSTAH spokesmen later contended that the samples taken from the base proved negative for cholera. However, an AP investigation showed that the tests were improperly done at a laboratory in the Dominican Republic with no experience of testing for cholera.|$|E

500|$|Approximately 40% {{of cases}} {{are related to}} obesity. Endometrial cancer is also {{associated}} with excessive estrogen exposure, {{high blood pressure and}} diabetes. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a progestogen in combination, as in most birth control pills, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as [...] "uterine cancer", although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as cervical cancer, uterine sarcoma, and trophoblastic disease. The most frequent type of endometrial cancer is endometrioid carcinoma, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by endometrial biopsy or by <b>taking</b> <b>samples</b> during a procedure known as dilation and curettage.

2500|$|Brooke {{graduated}} {{from one of}} the earliest classes of the United States Naval Academy and became a lieutenant in the United States Navy in 1855. He worked for many years with Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO), charting the stars as well as assisting in taking soundings of the ocean's bottom to determine the shape of the sea floor. [...] Many believed the sea floor was flat, but all previous soundings as deep as eleven miles (18km) could not find the ocean bottom. Part of this was due to powerful undercurrents far below, rivers in the ocean traveling in various directions. In the struggles with soundings, which nobody had done anything of value at great depths, it was Maury's failure with a unique device he invented that gave Brooke an idea of taking deep sea soundings. Brooke perfected a [...] "deep-sea sounding device" [...] which was used afterwards by navies of the world until modern times and modern equipment replaced it. [...] At Maury's direction, Brooke also added a [...] "core-sampling device" [...] for <b>taking</b> <b>samples</b> of the material of the sea floor.|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{worked at}} one of the estate's older mines, the Mearns Pit at High Littleton, part of the Somerset {{coalfield}} and the Somerset Coal Canal. As he observed the rock layers (or strata) at the pit, he realised that they were arranged in a predictable pattern and that the various strata could always be found in the same relative positions. Additionally, each particular stratum could be identified by the fossils it contained, and the same succession of fossil groups from older to younger rocks could be found in many parts of England. Furthermore, he noticed an easterly dip of the beds of rock—low near the surface (about three degrees), then higher after the Triassic rocks. This gave Smith a testable hypothesis, which he termed The Principle of Faunal Succession, and he began his search to determine if the relationships between the strata and their characteristics were consistent throughout the country. During subsequent travels, first as a surveyor (appointed by noted engineer John Rennie) for the canal company until 1799 when he was dismissed, and later, he was continually <b>taking</b> <b>samples</b> and mapping the locations of the various strata, and displaying the vertical extent of the strata, and drawing cross-sections and tables of what he saw. This would earn him the name [...] "Strata Smith". As a natural consequence, Smith amassed a large and valuable collection of fossils of the strata he had examined himself from exposures in canals, road and railway cuttings, quarries and escarpments across the country. He also developed methods for the identification of deposits of Fuller's earth to the south of Bath.|$|E

By <b>taking</b> <b>samples</b> of water near the mouth of a river (but above the influence of the tide) at a sufficient number of points in its channel and at different depths, and repeating this daily or at other short intervals throughout the year, it is easy to determine the {{quantity of}} solid matter held in suspension and solution; and if corresponding observations determine the quantity of water that is discharged, the total amount of solid matter brought down annually may be calculated. But besides this, a considerable quantity of sand or even gravel is carried along the bottom or bed of the river, and this has rarely been estimated, so that the figures hitherto obtained are usually under the real quantities. There is also another source of error caused by the quantity of matter the river may deposit in lakes or in flooded lands during its course, for this adds to the amount of denudation performed by the river, although {104} the matter so deposited does not come down to the sea.

Seasonality of the flies were {{investigated}} using baited monoconical traps by <b>taking</b> <b>sample</b> every month for five consecutive days for twelve months and diel activity pattern was investigated by <b>taking</b> <b>sample</b> every hour for three consecutive days. The density of G. m. submorsitans {{was found to be}} high during wet months and decrease during dry months. It was widely distributed during the rainy season in the savanna woodland; while its distribution was patchy during the dry season. G. m. submorsitans showed a bi-modal daily activity pattern with morning peak followed by mid day depression and then afternoon peak. Its activity rhythm showed a dual relation with temperature, positively correlated in the morning when the temperature is less than 30 °C and negatively correlated when temperature is greater than 30 °C. Its relation with relative humidity was also both positively and negatively correlated at different time of the day.
