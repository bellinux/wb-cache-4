5|$|The Prince {{begins his}} quest alone, but is later {{joined by two}} cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey {{at the same time}} as the Prince of Midenhall, they save the Princess of Moonbrooke from Hargon's assault on Moonbrooke Castle, which is reduced to ruins. As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure a ship that allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, {{including}} Alefgard, which is where Dragon Quest took place. There they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information. He tells them that by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create <b>the</b> <b>Charm</b> of Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions. After obtaining <b>the</b> <b>Charm</b> of Rubiss, the party travels to Hargon's castle in the ice-covered plateau of Rhone and confronts Hargon in his throne room. Hargon is defeated, but he offers himself to Malroth and the demon emerges to destroy the heroes. Together, the three heroes slay Malroth and return to Midenhall, where the Prince is named the new king.|$|E

In her new book... {{although there is no}} diminution in <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> and drollery of the drawings, Miss Potter's fancy is not what it was. The story is inconclusive.

5|$|Fauré's {{music has}} been {{described}} as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, jazz and the atonal music of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.|$|E
5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending {{from the front of}} the hat and over his face. The developers considered to have <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E
5|$|Lewis' {{presence}} on the Street infuriates Gail, who still holds a grudge {{for the way he}} treated Audrey. Gail hopes Lewis may have left for good when he attends court on charges of fraud. However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech about the way he let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service. The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Lewis turns on <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> and quickly wins the reviewer over. Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E

As they journey, the two dragons witness the growing conflict between <b>the</b> <b>Charmed</b> and <b>the</b> Naturals, which threatens to culminate in all-out war between the two species. They encounter signs everywhere that magic is leaving the world: trolls lie dying beneath the landscape, giants build enigmatic stone circles and faeries are evolving into proto-humans.|$|R

5|$|Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas were Glimcher's ideal {{choices for}} the roles of Cesar and Nestor Castillo. Prior to The Mambo Kings, Assante had {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} films but had not yet broken out as a major star. Banderas, a Spanish actor, had moved to Los Angeles, California, hoping to make an international debut with his first English speaking role. Warner Bros., however, wanted to cast Jeremy Irons as Cesar and Ray Liotta as Nestor. Both actors had received critical acclaim for their performances in Reversal of Fortune and Goodfellas respectively, and the studio felt that they would appeal to a wider audience. Through a translator, Glimcher told Banderas to work on improving his English for one month before performing a screen test opposite Irons. The Spanish actor, lacking the ability to speak English, learned his lines phonetically. Despite Irons's excellent screen test, Glimcher thought he was wrong for the part and insisted on Assante; he thought <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> and seductiveness of Assante made him perfect for the role, and the studio eventually gave in.|$|E
5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E

The villagers then blamed her for the disappearance, and she was dragged before the George pub and pelted with rotten fruit and stones, almost killing her. Somebody from Tom Heys' Farm then took <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> but, {{after a series of}} disasters — including milk not churning and animals not feeding — <b>the</b> <b>charm</b> was reluctantly exorcised by Reverend Baddeley.|$|E

50|$|Ireland was now {{master of}} the 70-ton, 60-man, 8-gun Amity. They sailed to Adam Baldridge’s pirate trading post near Madagascar to repair and refit in December 1695. Baldridge tipped them off that <b>the</b> <b>Charming</b> Mary under captain Richard Glover left shortly before and was still nearby. Ireland pursued <b>the</b> <b>Charming</b> Mary, {{capturing}} it and putting Glover on the Amity. The crew elected Richard Bobbington as Captain of <b>the</b> <b>Charming</b> Mary.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} two groups of Anglo-Saxon charms: six charms for {{remedying}} theft; and six charms intended to staunch bleeding. The {{aim of this study}} is to build up a picture of the life of these charms and their recording, use, performance and transmission by examining the contents and manuscript context of <b>the</b> <b>charms.</b> I argue that by modifying methodologies presented in previous scholarship, it is possible to develop a new approach to Anglo-Saxon <b>charms,</b> enabling <b>the</b> scholar to reconstruct the ways in which an Anglo-Saxon might have recorded, transmitted and performed charms. I suggest that by taking into account the content of <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> and <b>the</b> way in which they are structured, one can investigate the manuscript context of <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> in order to reveal the worldviews and beliefs of the scribes, users and performers of <b>the</b> <b>charms.</b> <b>The</b> final chapter of the thesis explores the ways in which <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> relate to oral and literate culture, material culture and performance. Thus, I break down the modem dichotomies so often applied to charms, specifically oral/written, magic/religion, prayer/charm and male/female. By combining these investigations of charm content with manuscript context, I reconstruct the Anglo-Saxon experiences of charming. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
