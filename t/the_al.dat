5|$|Chesbro won 41 {{games in}} New York's 1904 season, still an AL record. New York contended for <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> pennant with the Boston Americans (later nicknamed the Red Sox); Johnson aided New York by helping the team acquire {{multiple}} players in trades, including Boston's Patsy Dougherty. Boston and New York {{faced each other}} in a season-ending five-game series that decided the pennant winner, and was played from October 7–10. Boston won two of the first three games, which meant that New York needed to win the two contests scheduled on October 10 to win <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> title. With the score of the first game tied 2–2 in the ninth inning, Chesbro threw a wild pitch that allowed a runner on third base to score, giving Boston a 3–2 victory that clinched <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> pennant; New York won the now-meaningless second game.|$|E
5|$|For {{the sixth}} {{time in his}} major league career, Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and {{featured}} the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo {{home run in the}} eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in <b>the</b> <b>AL,</b> which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.|$|E

5|$|Kelley {{moved back}} to the infield, {{becoming}} the regular first baseman in 1901. After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he would jump from the Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of <b>the</b> American League (<b>AL),</b> <b>the</b> former Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises. However, the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after <b>the</b> <b>AL's</b> successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to <b>the</b> Baltimore Orioles <b>AL.</b> Kelley's father-in-law, John Mahon, was president and principal share holder of <b>the</b> <b>AL's</b> Orioles.|$|R

He defeated the Cincinnati Redlegs in that game, and the Yankees won the series in a four games to zero sweep. Ruffing won 21 games during the 1939 season. His four shutouts in the 1939 season again tied him for <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> lead, while he finished second in wins behind Bob Feller, and fourth in ERA (2.93) behind Grove, Lyons, and Feller.

5|$|After a 71-win 1991 season, the Yankees {{replaced}} their incumbent manager, Stump Merrill, with Buck Showalter, who {{increased the}} playing time given to young players. While the 1992 Yankees were 20 games behind <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> East winner, offseason acquisitions—third baseman Wade Boggs, pitcher Jimmy Key, and outfielder Paul O'Neill—helped the 1993 team to an 88–74 record and New York's highest finish (second) in seven seasons. By 1994, the Yankees had progressed {{to the point}} where they led <b>the</b> <b>AL</b> with a 70–43 record going into the homestretch of the regular season. Their campaign was cut short by a players' strike, which resulted in the cancellation of the playoffs and 1994 World Series. Many media members believed that the Yankees might have reached the World Series if not for the strike. A year later, the team reached the playoffs and gave Mattingly his first career postseason appearance by winning the first AL wild card berth, but it was eliminated in a five-game Division Series (ALDS) against the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
