40|$|WiMAX and WiFi {{are the two}} proliferating {{wireless}} technologies with different physical and Media Access Control (MAC) layers. Today, WiFi radio is present in almost all <b>the</b> <b>devices,</b> and most of <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> <b>are</b> <b>equipped</b> with WiMAX radio.

To cope up with the scenario, a method for routing in a heterogeneous infrastructure based mesh network is proposed. The heterogeneous network consists of a coordinator node and a subscriber node. In this paper, {{we assume that the}} coordinator nodes <b>are</b> <b>equipped</b> with both WiMAX and WiFi radios, whereas, the subscriber nodes need not have WiMAX radio. The protocol used for routing data is based on the bee-hive algorithm, in which the entire network is divided into foraging zones/regions. We propose a technique in which the intra-foraging zone communication happens through WiFi and the nodes across the foraging zone communicate via the coordinator using WiMAX. It is observed through simulations that our technique improves the overall network performance by making use of both the radios efficiently...|$|R

The coating chamber consists of two parts, a confined space where the particle is levitated and a droplet insertion cone where the coating solution is injected into the particle suspending gas flow.
