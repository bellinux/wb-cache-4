5|$|<b>The</b> <b>drip</b> {{painting}} {{works of the}} modern artist Jackson Pollock are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 Number 14 has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, Blue Poles, took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.|$|E
5|$|Before its {{purchase}} by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, The Swimming Hole {{appears to}} have undergone seven different conservatory treatments. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the glazes and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and <b>the</b> <b>drip</b> was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The Brooklyn Museum performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, The Swimming Hole received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>drip</b> line or trickle acclimating {{method is}} a safe and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set {{on the floor next to}} the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust <b>the</b> <b>drip</b> rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E

25|$|Annery limekiln has a ramp {{facing the}} river, three kilns (or burning 'pots'), seven {{entrance}} doorways and nine lower apertures {{for the removal}} of the calcined limestone. The arrangement of the kilns gives an L-shaped compact structure. Some of the entrances led to arched lobbies or 'eyes', at the back of which were the grates and separate 'poking holes' to insert metals rods for 'working' the charge and helping with aeration. A 'lean-to' slated roof may have slotted beneath part of <b>the</b> <b>drip</b> course of projecting stones, which runs around the exterior walls of the kiln. The arched entrances to the kiln allowed for the sheltered and safe collection of the quicklime, which reacted violently to water.|$|E
25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if <b>the</b> <b>drip</b> edge of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1963 {{a portion}} of the site had been {{excavated}} to a depth of [...] and shored with timbers, while the upper three cultural zones (layers36–38) were removed across the site. During the 1964 season layers29–35 were removed and some zones were excavated much more deeply. In 1965 layers24–28 were removed from the central area of the alcove. By this time it was clear that excavation would proceed for the full depth of the site, and that the disposal of a considerable quantity of excavated debris would need to be addressed. A bulldozer was brought in to remove sections of fill beyond <b>the</b> <b>drip</b> line of the shelter. The 1966 season was directed by Wilfred M. Husted.

500|$|The Cretaceous Seaway {{was already}} {{retreating}} east {{and to the}} south {{by the time the}} locally [...] thick Straight Cliffs Formation was deposited. Its members represent various stages in this process. The cliff-forming sandstone of the Tibbet Canyon Member was conformably deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments. Shale and sandstone from the Smoky Hollow Member were deposited on top of its basal layer of coal-rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on the shore of the seaway. While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps, lagoons and fluvial environments, one member, <b>the</b> <b>Drip</b> Tank, is not found in the Bryce Canyon area. This formation erodes into almost unclimbable cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow-gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone.

2500|$|Alternatively, the wet/dry filter may {{be placed}} below the tank. In this design, water is fed by gravity to the filter below the aquarium.

The waste laden water from the aquarium spreads over <b>the</b> <b>drip</b> plate, and rains down through a medium. This may be a filter wool/plastic grid rolled into a circular shape (DLS or [...] "Double Layer Spiral") or any number of plastic media commonly known as Bio Balls. As the water cascades over the media, CO2 is given off, oxygen is picked up, and bacteria convert the waste from the tank into less harmful materials. From here the water enters the sump. The sump may contain a number of compartments, each with its own filtration material. Often, heaters and thermostats are placed in the sump.|$|E

2500|$|As garden trees, {{they have}} some drawbacks, in {{particular}} the falling nuts, and the releasing of the allelopathic compound juglone, though a number of gardeners do grow them.

Juglone is toxic to plants such as tomato, apple, and birch, and may cause stunting and death of nearby vegetation. [...] Juglone appears {{to be one of the}} walnut's primary defence mechanisms against potential competitors for resources (water, nutrients and sunlight), and its effects are felt most strongly inside the tree's [...] "drip line" [...] (the circle around the tree marked by the horizontal distance of its outermost branches). However, even plants at a seemingly great distance outside <b>the</b> <b>drip</b> line can be affected, and juglone can linger in the soil for several years even after a walnut is removed as its roots slowly decompose and release juglone into the soil.|$|E
