5|$|In early January 1959, {{there were}} {{plans for a}} {{federation}} linking <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> Republic with Senegal, Dahomey, and the Upper Volta in a federation of autonomous states. By April, however, neither Dahomey's nor Upper Volta's legislatures had ratified the federation, and so the Mali Federation was formed with only <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> Republic and Senegal. In 1959, Modibo Keïta's RDA party won all 70 seats in the legislative elections in <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> Republic and joined forces with the dominant party in Senegal, headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The federation achieved independence on 20 June 1960 within the French Community; however, divisions between Senghor and Keïta on the governance of the federation resulted in its dissolution on 20 August 1960. The area of French Sudan formally proclaimed itself the Republic of Mali and, with increasing radicalization of Keita, left the French Community in September 1960.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1956, {{the history of}} Sudan {{has been plagued by}} internal conflict, viz. <b>the</b> First <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War (1955-1972), <b>the</b> Second <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War (1983-2005), culminating in the secession of South Sudan on 9 July 2011, and the War in Darfur (2003-2010).|$|R
5|$|The British had ceded {{some power}} in Egypt with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The 1936 treaty was {{designed}} to counter Benito Mussolini's ambition to link Libya to Ethiopia via Sudan in a new Italian empire. The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal. It allowed for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. <b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> were not consulted.|$|E
5|$|Egypt gained full {{independence}} {{with the}} Egyptian Revolution of 23 July 1952 in which King Farouk was overthrown {{by a group}} of officers that included Gamal Abdel Nasser, later to emerge as the sole ruler in 1954. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman visited London and met the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden on 11 November 1952. On 10 January 1953 the Egyptian government ratified an agreement with the Umma representatives and other pro-independence Sudanese parties that gave <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> the right of self-determination. During a transition period no longer than three years parliamentary elections would be held and a Sudanese government formed. British and Egyptian troops and officials would leave the country and would be replaced by Sudanese.|$|E
5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E

5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the French National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories. In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA) won the elections in French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. <b>The</b> <b>Sudanese</b> Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E
5|$|Jabarona {{was filled}} with Dinka {{refugees}} who had fled the fighting {{in the south of}} Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by <b>the</b> <b>Sudanese</b> police for telling his friends and neighbors that he was a slave. Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in Khartoum and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied that he was a slave. He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> Second <b>Sudanese</b> Civil War, <b>the</b> {{town was}} a {{garrison}} town of <b>the</b> Khartoum-based <b>Sudanese</b> Armed Forces (SAF).

50|$|In 2009, Sudan {{initiated}} a Southern Sudanese census {{ahead of the}} 2011 independence referendum, which would also include <b>the</b> South <b>Sudanese</b> diaspora; however, this initiative was criticised for leaving out countries with a high share of <b>the</b> South <b>Sudanese</b> diaspora, rather counting countries where the diaspora share was low.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after, {{there was}} an {{attempted}} coup to oust Garang by senior SPLA commanders, Riek Machar and Lam Akol, in August 1991. The coup {{turned out to be}} premature - however, it did expose the deep ethnic divides within the SPLA. <b>The</b> Southern <b>Sudanese</b> communities became more divided than ever before in their history. These organic divides among <b>the</b> Southern <b>Sudanese</b> communities were exacerbated by the deliberate [...] "divide and rule" [...] policies instituted by the regimes in Khartoum, in order to maintain their power over <b>the</b> Southern <b>Sudanese</b> peoples.|$|R
