50|$|Up to six trains daily were {{operated}} {{in each direction}} and a printed timetable was published on 16 September 1856 by Charles Easton Spooner who, following his father, served as Manager and Clerk for 30 years. It shows departures from the Quarry Terminus (later referred to as Dinas, sometimes as Rhiwbryfdir or Rhiw) at 7:30, 9:28, 11:16, 1:14, 3:12 and 5:10. Trains waited ten minutes at the intermediate stations called Tunnel Halt, Hafod y Llyn and Rhiw Goch. The fastest journey time from Quarry Terminus to Boston Lodge was 1 hour 32 minutes, including three stops. From Boston Lodge, the slate wagons were hauled to and from Porthmadog harbour by horses. Up trains took nearly six hours from Boston Lodge to the Quarry Terminus and each train ran in up to four sections, each hauled by a horse and comprising eight empty slate wagons plus a horse dandy. This timetable gave a maximum annual capacity of 70,000 tons of dressed slate. Two brakesmen travelled on each down <b>train,</b> <b>controlling</b> the speed by the application of brakes as needed. At passing loops, trains passed {{on the right and}} this continues to be a feature of Ffestiniog Railway operation.|$|E

The overall solution comprises of a central database server system with redundancy, Controller's Controlling Interface for remote monitoring and controlling and a TCP/IP network which interconnects all the above mentioned components of the total systems. Outstation Railway Control Unit is a manually operated system with a Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) voice communication system integrated to a computer system that runs on an Internet Protocol (IP) based network. The man drawback of the existing system is lack of accuracy and permits less time for the controllers to make decisions in controlling the train. Since the given standards graph paper is not design accurately, as the divisions for the hours along the time axis are not uniformly distributed. Therefore the predictions done by the controller are not perfect. All the reports are generated by pen and paper manually which have made the work of the controller more complicated. At {{the end of the day}} all these drawbacks results in trains getting delayed.

We call these <b>train</b> <b>control</b> systems “East Japan <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> system ” (EJTC). “Level 0 ” system, the Automatic Train Stop device (ATS-S), was introduced into Japanese National Railways (JNR) to prevent train collision. This system has been replacing with Pattern type ATS (ATS-P); “Level 1 ” system. ATS-P was developed to eliminate the weaknesses of the ATS-S. The Automatic <b>Train</b> <b>Control</b> (ATC) system was originally developed to support safe, super-high speed railway transportation utilizing Japan’s Shinkansen and introduced into conventional commuter lines to shorten the train interval. However {{it was difficult to}} realize efficient operations in high-density lines due to limitations of existing ATC technology. Then the D-ATC system (Digital and Decentralized ATC) had been developed as “Level 2 ” system using ADS technology. In D-ATC system, the device on each train autonomously calculates permitted speed of each train. This system is introduced to Keihn-tohoku Line as D-ATC and Shinkansen Line as DS-ATC (Digital Communication & Control for Shinkansen-ATC). Recent remarkable progress in the field of information technology makes possible a new <b>train</b> <b>control</b> system where <b>train</b> itself detects its location and communicates with other trains through radio transmission.

Due to unreliable wireless communications and complicated wave propagation environment, <b>train</b> <b>control</b> performance can be significantly affected by the WLAN-based train-ground communications [3]. Performance issues in CBTC systems have attracted a lot of interests recently. A handoff mechanism designed for high-speed railway systems is proposed in [4] by building up a neighboring cell list to improve handoff performance. In [5], a new handoff algorithm of GSM-R is developed based on on-vehicle for railway systems. The cross-layer approach is also introduced in CBTC system to enhance performance of <b>train</b> <b>control</b> [6]. In [7], energy-efficient <b>train</b> <b>control</b> schemes are studied in CBTC systems.
