One of <b>those</b> <b>issues,</b> <b>that</b> of leaking munitions, was an issue long before the weapons arrived at Deseret and the primary reason that Gov.

The institutions that define land tenure and the means of delivering tenurial rights is one great theme of China's experience [...] and this book. The impacts of spillovers from policy reform in other sectors and from general economic growth is another. It also reflects on <b>those</b> new <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> arose subsequent to the analyses of the other chapters and <b>those</b> additional <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> are becoming important only now, in the twenty-first century. Forest environmental issues are particularly complex. Finally, tenure continues to be an issue, sometimes with a distributive theme, sometimes with an efficiency theme. Restrictions on household harvest and shipments as well as high levels of forest taxation continue to constrain household forestry incentives. The central government recognizes these issues, but local administratiors will largerly determine whether future growth in China's forestry sector is characterized by imports and product substitution or by domestic production...|$|R

This means that the less direct experience people have with an issue, the greater is the news media's influence on public opinion on that issue.|$|E
