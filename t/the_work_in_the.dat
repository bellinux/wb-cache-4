5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E

It debuted atop The New York Times Best Seller list. Romney donated his earnings from the book to charity.|$|E
5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{noted in}} 1922 {{that the work}} of intense {{expression}} was singular in the sacred music of its period, with a convincing musical interpretation of the biblical text and its manifold shades of emotion. Paul Hindemith wrote a trimmed adaption which probably helped to keep <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. It was first performed in Wiesbaden, where the composer studied, in 2003. The celebration of the Reger Year 2016 led to several performances.|$|E

5|$|Birkin becomes {{accepted}} into the Nonconformist family of Mr Ellerbeck the station master (Jim Carter), with whom he dines on Sundays; the hospitality of the chapel congregation is contrasted against the established church, which has consigned the penniless Birkin {{to sleep in the}} church belfry. Ellerbeck's children eventually persuade Birkin to preach a sermon at a nearby Methodist chapel. Birkin also forms an emotional, albeit unspoken, attachment to Alice Keach (Natasha Richardson), the young wife of the vicar. The vicar himself (Patrick Malahide) is portrayed unsympathetically as an obstruction to <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church, viewing the medieval painting as symptomatic of the superstition prevalent in the community.|$|E
5|$|Further, {{the work}} shows {{evidence}} of its having been {{put together in}} a very haphazard and hasty fashion, with little to no subsequent editing of the material to form a cohesive narrative. Birley sees {{an example of the}} carelessness with which the author approached <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction of Marcus Aurelius' biography, where midway through the Life of Marcus Aurelius the author found himself in a muddle, probably because he had historical material in excess of what he required, and also because he had already used up much of his source to write separate biographies of Lucius Verus and Avidius Cassius, whose lives intersected with Marcus'. The answer he came up with was to use Eutropius as his source for a brief overview of Marcus' principate following the death of Lucius Verus. However, he found that in doing so, the narrative's ending was too abrupt and so, after including some gossip about Commodus not being his son, he once again began an account of Marcus' reign after the death of Verus.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century {{and into the}} 21st, the symphony was {{performed}} {{in all parts of}} the world. A succession of premieres in the Far East culminated in October 2002 in Beijing, when Long Yu led the China Philharmonic Orchestra in the first performance of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> People's Republic of China. The Sydney Olympic Arts Festival in August 2000 opened with a performance of the Eighth by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under its chief conductor Edo de Waart. The popularity of the work, and its heroic scale, meant that it was often used as a set piece on celebratory occasions; on 15March 2008, Yoav Talmi led 200 instrumentalists and a choir of 800 in a performance in Quebec City, to mark the 400th anniversary of the city's foundation. In London on 16July 2010 the opening concert of the BBC Proms celebrated the 150th anniversary of Mahler's birth with a performance of the Eighth, with Jiří Bělohlávek conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This performance was its eighth in the history of the Proms.|$|E
5|$|Ring {{did most}} of {{his work in the}} non-Test {{first-class}} matches, in which he sent down 3,088deliveries. This was second only to Johnston, who bowled 3,251. In contrast, Lindwall and Miller sent down only 2,105 and 1,749deliveries outside the Tests respectively, as Bradman sought to preserve them for hostile bursts with the new ball against England. Along with Lindwall, Ring was the equal third highest wicket-taker in first-class matches excluding the Tests, with 59 scalps, doing a large part of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county matches so that the leading bowlers could conserve energy for the Tests.|$|E

Cancellara, meanwhile, said that, although he was disappointed with the result in itself, he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure.

50|$|From 1768, when Abraham Darby III {{took over}} the management, he {{remained}} associated with the concern, and greatly improved <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interests of his workpeople.

5|$|The {{influence}} of Olivier Messiaen on Takemitsu was already apparent {{in some of}} Takemitsu's earliest published works. By the time he composed Lento in Due Movimenti, (1950), Takemitsu had already come into possession of a copy of Messiaen's 8 Préludes (through Toshi Ichiyanagi), and the {{influence of}} Messiaen is clearly visible in <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of modes, the suspension of regular metre, and sensitivity to timbre. Throughout his career Takemitsu often made use of modes from which he derived his musical material, both melodic and harmonic among which Messiaen's modes of limited transposition to appear with some frequency. In particular, the use of the octatonic, (modeII, or the 8–28 collection), and modeVI (8–25) is particularly common. However, Takemitsu pointed out that he had used the octatonic collection in his music before ever coming across it in Messiaen's music.|$|E
5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E
5|$|The work {{caused a}} scandal in contemporary, still-partitioned Poland; it was {{discussed}} even before its unveiling. It offended {{a number of}} society figures, many tracing direct lineage to the major magnate families whose members are portrayed in the painting as traitors to the Polish cause. There {{were a number of}} critical reviews of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contemporary press, Matejko received anonymous threats, and some aristocrats are said to have considered buying the painting only to destroy it. Some accused him of defeatism, pessimism, exploiting public sentiment over a historical scandal for contemporary publicity; it was thus criticized by notable artists such as Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and Cyprian Norwid. In Paris, a French-Polish aristocrat, Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski, campaigned against including it in an exhibition. The painting, however, quickly garnered supporters, who in turn reproduced modified copies of it, replacing historical figures with major contemporary critics. Responding to the public outcry, Matejko painted a response — a painting titled Judgement on Matejko (Wyrok na Matejkę, 1867), in which he portrayed his execution by some of his most vocal critics.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> operas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bayreuth canon are {{the last}} ten of the {{thirteen}} that Wagner completed. He rejected the first three – Die Feen, Das Liebesverbot and Rienzi – as apprentice works.

The term Bayreuth canon is therefore sometimes taken to mean the composer's mature operas.

5|$|Walton's {{first major}} {{composition}} after Belshazzar's Feast was his First Symphony. It was not written to a commission, and Walton worked slowly on the score from late 1931 until he completed it in 1935. He had composed {{the first three}} of the four movements by the end of 1933 and promised the premiere to the conductor Hamilton Harty. Walton then found himself unable to complete the work. The end of his affair with Imma von Doernberg coincided with, and may have contributed to, a sudden and persistent writer's block. Harty persuaded Walton to let him perform the three existing movements, which he premiered in December 1934 with the London Symphony Orchestra. During 1934 Walton interrupted work on the symphony to compose his first film music, for Paul Czinner's Escape Me Never (1934), for which he was paid £300. After a break of eight months, Walton resumed work on the symphony and completed it in 1935. Harty and the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave the premiere of the completed piece in November of that year. The symphony aroused international interest. The leading continental conductors Wilhelm Furtwängler and Willem Mengelberg sent for copies of the score, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra premiered <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US under Harty, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra gave the New York premiere, and the young George Szell conducted the symphony in Australia.|$|E
