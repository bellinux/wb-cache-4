40|$|We {{have built}} an Ad hoc Protocol Evaluation testbed (APE) {{in order to}} perform large-scale, {{reproducible}} experiments. APE aims at assessing several different routing protocols in a real world environment instead of by simulation. We present the APE testbed architecture and report on initial experiments with up to 37 physical nodes that show the reproducibility and scalability of our approach. Several scenario scripts have been written that include strict choreographic instructions to the testers who walk around with ORiNOCO equipped laptops. We introduce a metric called Virtual Mobility that we use to compare different <b>testruns.</b> This metric {{is based on the}} measured signal quality instead of the geometric distance between nodes, hence it reflects how a routing protocol actually perceives the network’s dynamics. ...|$|R
40|$|A self {{stabilizing}} homopolar induction bearing withintegrated {{touch down}} bearings {{has been developed}} forhigh-speed applications like flywheels, small gas turbines andcompact vacuum cleaners. Stability is achieved without any control electronics thanksto stabilizing eddy currents induced by permanent magnets. Eddycurrent losses are reduced to a minimum using a homopolardesign with ring magnets instead of multipole or halbacharrays. The bearing currents and forces are simulated using steadystate 3 D-FEM analysis, which is enabled thanks to theimplemented Minkowskij transform. From these results ananalytical model has been developed, and the results arecompared. Efforts are made to develop a qualitative understanding ofthe bearing physics. Results are converted into usefulrotordynamic data that is easily understood by machineengineers. Finally some experiences from the first experimental <b>testruns</b> at 90. 000 RPM are discussed.

40|$|Current {{approaches}} to the recognition of emotion within speech usually use statistic feature information obtained by application of functionals on turn- or chunk levels. Yet, {{it is well known}} that thereby important information on temporal sub-layers as the frame-level is lost. We therefore investigate the benefits of integration of such information within turn-level feature space. For frame-level analysis we use GMM for classification and 39 MFCC and energy features with CMS. In a subsequent step output scores are fed forward into a 1. 4 k large-feature-space turn-level SVM emotion recognition engine. Thereby we use a variety of Low-Level-Descriptors and functionals to cover prosodic, speech quality, and articulatory aspects. Extensive <b>testruns</b> are carried out on the public databases EMO-DB and SUSAS. Speaker-independent analysis is faced by speaker normalization. Overall results highly emphasize the benefits of feature integration on diverse time scales...|$|R
40|$|In an {{efficient}} market, share prices reflect all available information. The study of efficient market hypothesis helps to take right decisions related to investments. In this research,weak form efficiency {{has been tested}} of Karachi Stock Exchange—KSE covering the period of 2 nd November 1991 to 2 nd November 2011. Descriptive statistics indicated the absence of weak form efficiency while results of non-parametric tests, showed consistency as well. We employed non-parametric tests were KS Goodness-of-Fit <b>test,run</b> test and autocorrelation test to find out serial independency of the data. Results prove that KSE is not weak-form-efficient. This happens because KSE is an emerging market and there, {{it has been observed}} that information take time to be processed. Thus it can besaid that technical analysis may be applied to gain abnormal returns...|$|E
40|$|In 2010, the Netherlands {{introduced}} Genomically Enhanced Breeding Values (GEBV) {{in their}} national evaluation. These GEBV {{were based on}} a post-processing step. For further optimization, a very basic method is proposed to incorporate the DGV based on genomic data directly into the conventional breeding value estimation: mass-selection. The DGV are transformed to pseudo-observations which are analyzed as correlated trait (to the trait of interest) with a mass-selection model. The correlation between the trait of interest and this pseudo-trait is 1, and the heritability of the pseudo-trait is set to the predictive value of the DGV (estimated from cross-validation). In this way the pseudo-trait EBVaffects the EBV of the trait of interest of genotyped individuals, which in turn affects the EBV of relatives, effectively dropping the genomic information down the pedigrees of the trait of interest. Results for a <b>testrun</b> on Udder health data are shown as application of this method...|$|E

Particularly, its tilting pad journal {{bearings}} and shaft journals had suffered complete wiping?out and deep crack damages, respectively. For an emergency restoration, both cracked journals had been machined {{out as much}} as 2 % per the specified design diameter, and a series of design, analysis and manufacturing of the retrofit journal bearings had been carried out to have practically identical overall design characteristics to the OEM bearings. To verify operational reliability, the restored GT rotor had been <b>test?run</b> at KIMM's high?speed balancing facility. Since the test results had been favorable, the rotor had been put into an onsite operation, immediately. The restored GT system has been continuously running a stable commercial operation for more than 41 months up until now. This presentation introduces design analysis of the retrofit bearings, test run result of the restored GT rotor?bearing system, and the lessons learned...|$|E
40|$|The {{program for}} the DC 8 -D 3 flight {{planning}} was slightly modified for the three dimensional flight planning for DC 10 aircrafts. Several test runs of the modified program over the North Atlantic and North America were made for verifying the program. While geopotential height and temperature were used in a previous program as meteorological data, the modified program uses wind direction and speed and temperature received from the National Weather Service. A scanning program was written to collect required weather information from the raw data received in a packed decimal format. Two sets of weather data, the 12 -hour forecast and 24 -hour forecast based on 0000 GMT, are used for dynamic processes in <b>testruns.</b> In order to save computing time only the weather data of the North Atlantic and North America is previously stored in a PCF file and then scanned one by one...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{application}} of the SPACAL spaghetti calorimeter prototype 1; 2) in the CERN hyperon beam experiment WA 89. First results {{on the performance of}} the upgraded SPACAL calorimeter in a high rate experimental environment are presented. In order to reconstruct invariant masses from ΣΓ hyperons in final states, the energy of the decay neutrons and their impact point have to be determined with the best possible accuracy. As a first step in the analysis, ΣΓ beam particles have been easily reconstructed. For future runs we intend to trigger on the neutrons from ΣΓ decays using fast calorimeter information and a scintillating tile predetector. Testbeam results on both components will be presented. 1 Motivation The performance of the almost compensating (e/h= 1. 15) electromagnetic and hadronic SPACAL spaghetti calorimeter has been extensively investigated in two <b>testruns</b> in 1990, and many results on its intrinsic properties as well as on shower [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} was conducted using the InnovITS proving ground in Nuneaton. Thirty cars with volunteer drivers {{were asked to}} drive around a tight closed road circuit causing them to pass repeatedly through a cross-roads junction from all directions. The junction was signalized. In different <b>testruns</b> of the experiment the traffic lights were controlled by either an automated fixed-time system or by a human using remote control. All vehicles in the test were instrumented using GPS and bluetooth. Video footage from two cameras was also recorded. The goal of the {{experiment was}} {{to collect data on}} the performance of human junction controllers. This was motivated by earlier work indicated that human controllers could perform well at this task in a simulated ‘computer game’ environment. In particular this paper examines {{some of the issues that}} arise when trying to simulate an urban road junction in this manner. For example results are presented indicating differences in network performance depending on whether the drivers were instructed to follow a fixed route or a random route of their choice. Thus providing some guidance for maximizing the fidelity of this type of simulation in the future. The paper also presents a detailed analysis of the sensor data and video footage to measure the performance of the junction under the different modes of control...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{networks}} with autonomous mobile nodes, called ad hoc networks, {{have become}} increasingly interesting {{with the growth of}} wireless communication technologies. Several proposals for protocols to handle routing in such environments are under consideration by the Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) Working Group of the IETF. Simulations have been the driving force in development and evaluation of ad hoc routing protocols, but real world testing is currently lacking. The goal of this master’s thesis has been to develop a testbed such that large scale, real world tests of 50 or more nodes can be conducted. The testbed makes use of choreographed node movements through instructions to the user in order to reproduce testruns as accurately as possible. A new mobility metric called virtual mobility based on signal strength is introduced and enables post <b>testrun</b> analysis and characterization of network mobility. Initial results based among others on testruns with 40 nodes and analysis of this metric show that it has “fingerprint ” like properties that makes it useful when verifying similarities between repeated testruns. The APE software has been put in the public domai...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a scintillating fiber detector prototype for tracking under high rate conditions is investigated. A spatial resolution of about 100 #mu#m is aimed for the detector. Further demands are low occupancy and radiation hardness up to 1 Mrad/year. Fibers with different radii and different wavelengths of the scintillation light from different producers have been extensively tested concerning light output, attenuation length and radiation hardness, with and without coupling them to light guides of different length and diameter. In a <b>testrun</b> at a 3 GeV electron beam the space dependent efficiency and spatial resolution of fiber bundles were measured by means of two external reference detectors with a precision of 50 #mu#m. The light output profile across fiber roads has been determined with the same accuracy. Different technologies were adopted {{for the construction of}} tracker modules consisting of 14 layers of 0. 5 mm fibers and 0. 7 mm pitch. A winding technology provides reliable results to produce later fiber modules of about 25 x 25 cm" 2 area. We conclude that {{on the basis of these}} results a fiber tracker for high rate conditions can be built. (orig.)

40|$|A {{few years}} ago, an {{experimental}} facility composed of networking gear and simulation tools was sufficient for testing {{the main features}} of a prototype before the final product could be launched to the Internet market. This paradigm has certainly changed, {{but the lack of}} platforms enabling the realistic assessment of the different facets of a product, including cross-cutting trials across different testbeds, poses strong limitations for researchers and developers. In light of this, we present an open platform that offers a versatile combination of heterogeneous experimental facilities called "TEstbed for Future Internet Services" (TEFIS). TEFIS provides a single access point for conducting cutting-edge experiments on testbeds that supply different capabilities, including testbeds dedicated to network performance, software performance, grid computing, and living labs. We shall show that TEFIS covers the entire life-cycle of a multifaceted experiment, with the advantage that a single <b>testrun</b> can seamlessly execute across different experimental facilities. In order to demonstrate the potential and versatility of the TEFIS platform, we describe the deployment of four distinct experiments and provide a set of results highlighting the benefits of using TEFIS. The experiments described in this article cover: (i) the experimentation with an open API called OPENER (which is an open and programmable environment for managing experimentation with SDN applications); (ii) an application for skiers and tourists at the Megeve ski resort in France; (iii) an application that can dynamically adapt the Quality of Experience (QoE) of multimedia services for mobile users; and (iv) an augmented reality workspace for remote education and learning purposes based on videoconferencing...|$|E
40|$|A {{wireless}} ad hoc network {{consists of}} a number of mobile nodes that temporarily form a dynamic infrastructure-less network. To enable communication between nodes that do not have direct radio contact, each node must function as a wireless router and potentially forward data traffic on behalf of the others. New routing protocols are needed as the existing protocols used in wired networks adapt too slowly to the frequent topology changes induced by mobility and are inefficient in terms of resource consumption. During the last five to ten years more than 60 different ad hoc routing protocols have been proposed, optimized and partially compared based on simulation studies. However, we believe that these simulation studies need to be complemented with real-world experiments in order to gain practical experience and reveal real-world effects that may not be visible in simulations. This thesis surveys the field of ad hoc routing and related real-world testbeds. We also describe our research results from three included papers: In our active networking approach to ad hoc routing, protocol logic is carried inside data packets, which enables new protocols to be independently deployed at run-time. As a proof of concept, we have implemented two ad hoc routing protocols and successfully used them for routing a real-time sensitive audio stream. This prototype gave us a good understanding of the practical aspects of wireless networking and prepared good ground for protocol comparisons. We have implemented a testbed called APE which enables easy management and analysis of real-world experiments. In real-world experiments, with up to 37 mobile nodes, we used the APE testbed to assess the reproducibility between repeated <b>testruns</b> and compared three different routing protocols. This testbed has become a crucial tool for discovering flaws in proposed protocols, as well as for benchmarking different routing styles. During our implementation of the AODV protocol we discovered a performance problem that we could relate to some invalid assumptions about the wireless link characteristics. We explored this "communication gray zone" problem and implemented three countermeasures which we compared by using the APE testbed. As a result we could eliminate the performance discrepancy between simulated AODV and its implementation in the real-world...|$|R
