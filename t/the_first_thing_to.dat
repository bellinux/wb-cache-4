25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E

The first supplement of quadratic reciprocity states that 1 is a quadratic nonresidue (mod q), so that for any integer x, one of x and x is a quadratic residue and the other one is a nonresidue. Thus, if r [...] a2 (mod q) is a quadratic residue, then if a [...] b2 is a residue, r [...] a2 [...] b4 (mod q) is a biquadratic residue, and if a is a nonresidue, a is a residue, a [...] b2, and again, r [...] (a)2 [...] b4 (mod q) [...] is a biquadratic residue.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the New England Anti-Slavery Convention on May 30, 1850, an {{announcement}} was made that a meeting would be held to consider whether to hold a woman's rights convention. That evening, Paulina Kellogg Wright Davis presided over a large meeting in Boston's Melodeon Hall, while Lucy Stone served as secretary. Stone, Henry C. Wright, William Lloyd Garrison, and Samuel Brooke spoke of the need for such a convention. Garrison, whose name had headed the first woman suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature the previous year, said, [...] "I conceive that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done by the women of this country is to demand their political enfranchisement. Among the 'self-evident truths' announced in the Declaration of Independence is this – 'All government derives its just power from the consent of the governed.'" [...] The meeting decided to call a convention and set Worcester, Massachusetts, as the place and October 16 and 17, 1850, as the date. It appointed Davis, Stone, Abby Kelley Foster, Harriot Kezia Hunt, Eliza J. Kenney, Dora Taft, and Eliza H.

2500|$|On December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act {{aimed at}} {{stemming}} veteran suicides.

Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that despite {{his reputation as a}} budget hawk, Coburn should have recognized that the $22 million cost of the bill is worth the lives it would have saved. [...] “It’s a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,” he said. “If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress.” Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said “I object, not because I don’t want to save suicides, but because I don’t think this bill will do <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> change what’s happening,” arguing the bill" [...] "throws money and doesn’t solve the real problem" ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{realize is}} that the pawn {{may be able to}} queen unassisted by his king, simply by {{advancing}} to the queening square before the opposing king can capture or block the pawn. The rule of the square is useful in determining whether the pawn can queen unassisted, or whether the king can stop the pawn. In this position, the pawn is on the fifth square from the queening square (counting the queening square itself). [...] A square of five by five squares with the queening square in one corner and the pawn in an adjacent corner can be imagined. (Often, the easiest method of constructing the square is to draw a diagonal mentally from the pawn to the last rank; this is the diagonal of the square). [...] If the black king can move into this square, he can stop the pawn, otherwise the pawn wins the race. In this position, if it is Black's move, he can move to b4 and enter the square, therefore he can stop the pawn. If it is White's move, the pawn advances, the square shrinks to four by four, and the king cannot move into the square, so the pawn queens [...] See [...] for further discussion on the rule of the square.|$|E
