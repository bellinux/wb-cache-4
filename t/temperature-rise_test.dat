40|$|In this paper, {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields (MFs) were measured during the <b>temperature-rise</b> <b>test</b> of various electrotechnical equipment. The number of workers subjected to magnetic fields from the <b>temperature-rise</b> <b>test</b> is small; however, the exposure can be significant as the testing currents {{can be in the}} order of hundreds amperes. The resultant magnetic field during testing can exceed the ICNIRP limits for occupational exposure. The magnetic field exposure was recorded and statistical measures were extracted for three electrotechnical apparatus. It was found that the Time-Weighted Average exposure per unit current can reach 0. 0598 μT/A. Additionally, in order to mitigate the exposure, a rule of thumb regarding safety distances has been proposed. It is shown that the use of this rule of thumb can reduce the magnetic field exposure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{deals with}} the issue of cooling power converters. It {{describes}} the disposition of power converter M 50, produced by ELCOM, a. s., and the distribution and origin of heat losses in the converter. The thesis then describes the process of creating a 3 D CAD model of the converter in Solidworks and the procedure for heat simulation of the converter in default state and with cooling fan failures using Solidworks Flow Simulation. The thesis then evaluates the results of these simulations, and on their basis it suggests possible improvements in the design of converter‘s cooling system. These improvements are then evaluated in further simulations. The thesis then describes the verification of performed simulations by comparison with a <b>temperature-rise</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to test large induction motors without expensive facilities or suitable loading. This paper reports the findings {{in an attempt to}} assess the thermal properties of commercial induction motors by injecting phantom load currents into the windings. A multi-slice 2 -D time stepping finite element model is used to analyze the loss distributions in the machine with phantom loading and with normal direct loading. It can be shown that the high-order harmonic losses in the motor can be precisely estimated with the proposed method. Both experimental and simulation results confirm that phantom loading can be used as substitutes of direct full-load <b>temperature-rise</b> <b>test</b> of induction motors.

40|$|OVERVIEW: Hitachi has {{developed}} {{smaller and more}} reliable gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) in response to demands for lower costs and stable power supplies. Reliability of this GIS was improved and the enclosure diameter was reduced {{in order to minimize}} the installation space by using new analysis techniques and rationalization in insulation design and in temperature rise criteria. Furthermore, the use of vertical, single-break circuit breakers and a three-phase common GIB (gas-insulated bus) reduced the substation area to 46 % of its original size. A reliability test for the GIS was conducted in consideration of the service condition. The test included a limit-performance check test, a type test under hard operating conditions, a <b>temperature-rise</b> <b>test</b> at the site and factory, as well as other tests. The reliability of the GIS was improved by applying new structural design and manufacturing technologies. For example, high-precision parts and a GIS-specific assembling device were used. Large all-weather assembly houses were also used at the site and the assembly process was improved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe structure, cooling {{principle}} and operation characteristics of transformer split type cooling system {{was different from}} conventional cooling systems. Such as the research work of simulation test equipment in the field was few, causing a lack of scientific basis for the equivalence of simulation test, and parameters set of split type cooling system without scientific and professional analysis. The result {{is that so many}} features and operation characteristics were not fully grasped before. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out the corresponding research work. The experimental study was carried out in this paper. This paper would research the simulation test method of split cooling system based on a 10 kV distribution transformer. The test device can realize the flexible regulation for the vertical and horizontal position. According to the <b>temperature-rise</b> <b>test</b> method of transformers, performance test of split type cooling system was carried out based on the change of oil flow or radiator location. Finally, the research results of different pipe diameter, height and horizontal distribution were proposed. The study would provide more references for operation instruction of large power transformer's split type cooling devices...|$|E
