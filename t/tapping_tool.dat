Preface In practical production process, machining of internal thread for large diameter can be realized by using lathe tool for internal thread, but this method is difficult to machine internal thread of parts with small diameter, which is usually done by first drilling of base hole of the thread after machining process, and then using tapper to obtain the internal thread manually or with machine. By this traditional method for internal thread processing, the processes are distracted that increases time for handling, loading and unloading. It also lead to low efficiency, low accuracy of the perpendicularity error of thread. What’s more, tapper are always likely to break during tapping process, especially for parts with small diameter, and the depth of the thread is hard to control. To solve the problems mentioned above, a new type of <b>tapping</b> <b>tool</b> for machine use is developed. The tool bar could be inserted into the tapper hole on the lathe tailstock or installed o...|$|E
40|$|In many applications, {{an optical}} {{detector}} {{has to be}} located relative to mechanical reference points. One solution is to specify stringent requirements on (1) mounting the optical detector relative to the chip carrier, (2) soldering the chip carrier onto the printed circuit board (PCB), and (3) installing the PCB to the mechanical structure of the subsystem. Figure 1 shows a sketch of an optical detector mounted relative to mechanical reference with high positional accuracy. The optical detector is typically a fragile wafer that cannot be physically touched by any measurement tool. An optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) {{can be used to}} position optical detectors relative to mechanical reference points. This approach will eliminate all requirements on positional tolerances. The only requirement is that the PCB is manufactured with oversized holes. An exaggerated sketch of this situation is shown in Figure 2. The sketch shows very loose tolerances on mounting the optical detector in the chip carrier, loose tolerance on soldering the chip carrier to the PCB, and finally large tolerance on where the mounting screws are located. The PCB is held with large screws and oversized holes. The PCB is mounted loosely so it can move freely around. The optical CMM measures the mechanical reference points. Based on these measurements, the required positions of the optical detector corners can be calculated. The optical CMM is commanded to go to the position where one detector corner is supposed to be. This is indicated with the cross-hairs in Figure 2 (a). This figure is representative of the image of the optical CMM monitor. Using a suitable <b>tapping</b> <b>tool,</b> the PCB is manually tapped around until the corner of the optical detector is at the crosshairs of the optical CMM. The CMM is commanded to another corner, and the process is repeated a number of times until all corners of the optical detector are within a distance of 10 to 30 microns of the required position. The situation is sketched in Figure 2 (b) (the figure also shows the <b>tapping</b> <b>tool</b> and where to tap). At this point the fasteners for the PCB are torqued slightly so the PCB can still move. The PCB location is adjusted again with the <b>tapping</b> <b>tool.</b> This process is repeated 3 to 4 times until the final torque is achieved. The oversized mounting holes are then filled with a liquid bonding agent to secure the board in position (not shown in the sketch). A 10 - to 30 -micron mounting accuracy has been achieved utilizing this method. ...|$|E

5000|$|Tapered shank {{tools are}} removed from a socket using {{different}} approaches, depending {{on the design of}} the socket. In drill presses and similar tools, the tool is removed by inserting a wedge shaped block of metal called a [...] "drift" [...] into a rectangular shaped cross hole through the socket and tapping it. As the cross section of the drift gets larger when the drift is driven further in, {{the result is that the}} drift, bearing against the foremost edge of the tang, pushes the tool out. In many lathe tailstocks, the tool is removed by fully withdrawing the quill into the tailstock, which brings the tool up against the end of the leadscrew or an internal stud, separating the taper and releasing the tool. Where the tool is retained by a drawbar, as in some mill spindles, the drawbar is partially unthreaded with a wrench and then tapped with a hammer, which separates the taper, at which point the tool can be further unthreaded and removed. Some mill spindles have a captive drawbar which ejects the tool when actively unscrewed past the loose stage; these do not require tapping. For simple sockets with open access to the back end, a drift punch is inserted axially from behind and the <b>tool</b> <b>tapped</b> out.|$|R

With sufficient EST coverage, one or more alternatively spliced forms could be detected for nearly all genes examined. To identify high (> 95 %) confidence observations of alternative splicing, splice variants were clustered {{on the basis of}} having mutually exclusive structures, and sample statistics were then applied. Through this selection, alternative splices expected at a frequency of> 5 % within their respective clusters were seen for only 17 %– 28 % of genes.

40|$|The haptic sensations {{one feels}} when {{interacting}} with physical objects create {{a rich and}} varied impression of the objects, allowing one to gather information about texture, shape, compressibility, and other physical characteristics. The human sense of touch excels at sensing and interpreting these haptic cues, even when the object is felt through an intermediary tool instead of directly with a bare finger. Dragging, pressing, and <b>tapping</b> a <b>tool</b> on the object allow you to sense the object 2 ̆ 7 s roughness, slipperiness, and hardness as a combination of vibrations and forces. Unfortunately, the richness of these interaction cues is missing from many virtual environments, leading to a less satisfying and less immersive experience than one encounters in the physical world. However, we can create the perceptual illusion of touching a real object by displaying the appropriate haptic signals during virtual interactions. ^ This thesis presents methods for creating haptic models of textured surfaces from acceleration, force, and speed data recorded during physical interactions. The models are then used to synthesize haptic signals that are displayed to the user during rendering through vibrotactile and/or kinesthetic feedback. The haptic signals, which are {{a function of the}} interaction conditions and motions used during rendering, must respond realistically to the user 2 ̆ 7 s motions in the virtual environment. We conducted human subject studies to test how well our virtual surfaces capture the psychophysical dimensions humans perceive when exploring textured surfaces with a tool. ^ Three haptic rendering systems were created for displaying virtual surfaces using these surface models. An initial system displayed virtual versions of textured surfaces on a tablet computer using models of the texture vibrations induced when dragging a tool across the real surfaces. An evaluation of the system showed that displaying the texture vibrations accurately captured the surface 2 ̆ 7 s roughness, but additional modeling and rendering considerations were needed to capture the full feel of the surface. Using these results, a second system was created for rendering a more complete three-dimensional version of the haptic surfaces including surface friction and event-based tapping transients in addition to the texture vibrations. An evaluation of this system showed that we have created the most realistic haptic surfaces to date. The force-feedback haptic device used in this system, however, was not without its limitations, including low surface stiffness and undesired inertia and friction. We developed an ungrounded haptic augmented reality system to overcome these limitations. This system allowed us to change the perceived texture and friction of a physical three-dimensional object using the previously-developed haptic surface models. ...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic” is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} mitotically and meiotically heritable states of gene expression that are not due to changes in DNA sequence. Epigenetic events are important {{in all aspects of}} biology such as cell proliferation, development and differentiation. The maintenance of a correct epigenome is fundamental in the proper progression of silencing effect, pivotal during cellular differentiation. Multi-protein complexes required to enable the heterochromatic stable epigenetic inheritance are associated to the structural organization of heterochromatin that is determined at the time of replication, in mid-late S phase. MeCP 2 is a Methyl CpG-binding protein that preferentially binds methylated DNA, localizes with pericentric heterochromatin and it has a key role to mediate large-scale chromatin organization and compaction. While the impact of loss and mutations of MeCP 2 has been extensively studied as cause of RTT and other neurodevelopmental and autismspectrum diseases little is known about its function in pericentric heterochromatin replication, structure and epigenetic inheritance. To test whether MeCP 2 has a role in these processes, I used proliferating cells to study the effect of MeCP 2 functional ablation during cell-cycle S-phase. I found that MeCP 2 is not involved in heterochromatin replication, chromocenter organization and epigenetic modifications (H 3 K 9 me 3, H 4 K 20 me 3 and DNA methylation). Interestingly, MeCP 2 influences cell cycle progression without triggering a strong apoptotic effect. Intriguingly, low levels of LaminB, LBR and LaminA/C proteins were found, suggesting that MeCP 2 could be involved in nuclear lamina organization and/or in the expression of these genes. Besides, MeCP 2 silencing determines low levels of EZH 2 (component of PRC 2, one of the two Polycomb-Repressive Complexes). In the light of this finding is intriguing to investigate the link between MeCP 2 and EZH 2 due the fact {{that a large number of}} neuronal differentiation genes which are required for neuronal development cells are bound by Polycomb complexes, whereas MeCP 2 is a transcriptional regulator implicated in development of the brain that is required to interpret the DNA methylation signal in neurons. In parallel, using different biochemical <b>tools</b> (<b>TAP,</b> gel filtration, mass spectrometry) I investigated the ability of MeCP 2 to bind proteins involved in heterochromatin organization. A new interactor Np 95, component of pHDBs (pericentric heterochromatin duplication bodies), was found. My results show that MeCP 2 in addition to play a role in maturation of neurons and synaptic plasticity it is implicated in cell proliferation. Besides, MeCP 2 might be involved in nuclear envelope stability and/or in the expression of lamins, and in Polycomb proteins pathway. On the basis of this work further experiments should be done to better investigate the new functions of MeCP 2...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityBack {{one hundred}} and fifty years ago a man only as "the Frenchman" came to this area in Southeastern Massachusetts to {{establish}} an industry which later was to be stamped the "Jewelry Center of the World". The various skills, which this man exercised as an individual, eventually extended into the specialized skills and varied machines of several thousand workers. Despite the inevitable set-backs which plague any industry periodically, the jewelers prospered. The industry retained all the virtues of small business and a homey relationship between men and management developed. World War I had not disturbed it much, but the Second Great War rocked the local industry right down to its metal bases. Copper, zinc, tin, steel, the platinums and finally even gold and silver [...] the substance of its raw materials [...] were banned by government decree, since these were the essence of modern war instruments. The fact that they knew no other lines of manufacture; that big business was monopolizing war contracts; that both big government and big business looked down upon the jewelers' potentialities as war producers; that everyone regarded this type of manufacture as a luxury anyway [...] these undeniable facts added to the jewelers' pessimism as war clouds grew more menacing. These circumstances, however, did not cause the jewelers to receive such denials and misunderstandings in supine fashion. On the contrary they fought back! Fortunate indeed they ware to have developed over the past half century a high grade of leadership through their trade organization, the New England Manufacturing Jewelers' and Silversmiths' Association. This leadership, fed and propagated by truly democratic methods throughout the years, pursued an intelligent and courageous course. The early restrictions by government, due to the vigor and validity of their leaders' contentions, were modified and extended. Frequent modifications granted the jewelers time. What time so gained was to afford eventually, they could not perceive in those early days. But it proved an effective weapon and brought blessings. Thus the jewelers' arguments for conversation of the industry bore final fruit. The expanding revenue from excise tax [...] first 10, then 20 percent [...] were not to be overlooked in the feeding of so costly a monster as modern war. Their early contention that jewelry was a factor in fortifying the morale of the war worker by psychologically rewarding him for his long hours of labor, likewise can to be acknowledged. Their reasoning that infinitesimal amounts of copper would enable them to karat their gold and produce great quantities of jewelry which would return the Treasury millions in excise revenues proved sound. Their argument that the base metals should be made available in reduced quantities in order to grant the industry time to convert, and that partal continuance of normal manufacturing would keep production teams together and enable the jeweler to accomplish war contracts at a slightly over cost basis, at last became evident. Their opinion that no small business should be sacrificed to war and that big business would finally need their talents and skills were found true. Indeed, all these factors as they were diplomatically yet insistently promulgated by the industrial leaders of the Attleboros were borne out in the long run. Although handicapped by light machinery, handcraft methods, skills which were apparently non-transferable, and managements that were rutted in routine, the Attleboro jewelry industry proved its worth. World War II demanded electrical equipment in quantities never before experienced by the war makers. While the jewelers' initial concepts of war production were based on World War I notions of heavy type manufacture, a more careful analysis of modern war instruments disclosed a need for vast quantities of this electrical equipment and electronics devices. These proved a natural for the jewelry worker. His skills, built around the construction and assembly of small items, could be transferred to the construction and assembly of such products. His knowledge of 'working' metals, the 'plating' of metals, and the small stampings suited to his light power stamps and drop hammers likewise coincided. The ingenuity of the jewelry toolmaker and the long acquaintance of the industry with all types of fine soldering, enabled it to meet a variety of problems. New machines, jigs and fixtures, and new methods were devised in order to accomplish delicate mass soldering operations. These, the larger corporations were pleased to pass on to Attleboro's small industrialists whom they had previously slighted. Management, too, assumed problems and responsibilities with a genuine sense of adventure. Their actual accomplishments, the variety and quantity of war products, astounded both government and big business alike. <b>Tools,</b> <b>taps,</b> and dyes [...] electronic devices, radar parts, airborne radio equipment, crystals, switch contacts, circuit breakers, condenser assemblies [...] the plating of radio and radar parts, wave guides, sheet and wire tubing [...] gun parts, incendiary bomb parts, torpedo components, shells, and ammunition [...] soldering and assembling, welding, forging, 'tinning', stamping [...] military insignia, medals, identification bracelets, dog tags [...] these are but a sample list of the products and processes which the Attleboro jewelers adopted with great success as their contribution to America's war economy. The great record which they spread upon the pages of World War II production was based, nevertheless, on factors other than transferable skill of workers, versatility of management or the all-out efforts of both individuals and their trade association. In plant layout, engineering advice, new production methods, and in contacts with other areas of American industry they were greatly aided by the local W. P. B. engineer. An accelerated war production in the Attleboros dated from the opening of his office. Two surveys of facilities initiated his actions and the successful institution and operation of the 'hen and chicken' methods rapidly followed. The summit of war production for the Attleboros [...] 78 percent of all man-hours worked [...] as reached in January 1944. This, indeed, was {{in sharp contrast to the}} negligible contribution in 1917 - 18, a mere 5 percent conversion. In some individual cases where small plants converted 100 percent and so lost normal contacts, hardship was realized. Generally, however, definite benefits accrued to the industry. Tools and equipment were brought up to date. More streamlined methods were adopted and the advantages of mass production realized.
