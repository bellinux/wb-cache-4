He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them.

Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E

They're all cut from the same cloth and it annoys me that the biggest political icon in the last 30 years has been Margaret Thatcher. Someone who tried to destroy the working class. It freaks me out. So I don't really think there's anything left to vote for. I believe that I, as a person, can only change things once every 5 years and that's by voting, and my point is that even casting that vote means that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>guy</b> gets in, the only difference is one has a red tie and the other has a blue one." ...|$|E

But it's them performing inside of this wind-tunnel of light. It's a lot of smoke and mirrors, and a lot of camera tricks.

[...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar.

The album was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs (member of [...] Was (Not Was)) and David Bridie (produced My Friend the Chocolate Cake's 1991 self-titled album).

We get enough rain in winter. We don't want the summer rain. We want the sunshine". The lead single, [...] "Songs from the Sixteenth Floor" [...] was written by Kelly with John Clifforth of Deckchairs Overboard.

Kelly conceded the three songs were linked, [...] "'I’ve got a feeling it’s <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>guy.</b> He keeps coming back'. Maybe he’ll be in a happier place next time?
