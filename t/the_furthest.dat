5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' {{rivalry with}} the Boston Red Sox {{increased}} in intensity as the sides met multiple {{times in the}} American League Championship Series (ALCS), trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly reached the postseason, but were often defeated {{in the first two}} rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened a new Yankee Stadium and won the World Series for the 27th time in team history, an MLB record. <b>The</b> <b>furthest</b> the Yankees have gone in the postseason since then is the ALCS, in 2010, 2012, and 2017.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, {{even though it}} clearly met the criteria for doing so. Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point.

5|$|Polish {{headquarters}} {{decided to}} man the outer line of defences, <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> from the densely populated areas. The {{reason was that}} in the 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) were made of wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach <b>the</b> <b>furthest</b> ranging community members.|$|E
