Initially, heterodox economists including Joan Robinson, worked alongside mainstream economists, but heterodox groups isolated themselves and created insular {{groups in the}} late 1960s and 1970s.

5|$|Historians {{dispute the}} exact meaning of Urban's actions. <b>The</b> <b>mainstream</b> view, {{exemplified}} by British historian Peter Jackson, holds that Urban still regarded the Mongols as enemies at this time. This perception began changing {{a few years}} later, during the pontificate of Pope Clement IV (1265–68), when the Mongols were seen more as potential allies. However, the French historian Jean Richard argues that Urban's act signaled {{a turning point in}} Mongol-European relations as early as 1263, after which the Mongols were considered as actual allies. Richard also argues that it was in response to this forming coalition between the Franks, Ilkhanid Mongols and Byzantines, that the Mongols of the Golden Horde allied with the Muslim Mamluks in return. However, <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> view of historians is that though there were many attempts at forming an alliance, the attempts proved unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 59) This {{study examined}} 14 mainstreamed and 1 non-mainstreamed physically handicapped students {{between the ages}} of 8 and 12 years old, to determine <b>the</b> effect of <b>mainstreaming</b> on self-concept as measured by the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale for Children. The results indicated no relationship between school placement and self-concept. However, <b>the</b> <b>mainstreamed</b> children scored higher on "physical appearance," "intellectual," and "happiness" cluster scores on the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale. Both <b>the</b> <b>mainstreamed</b> and <b>the</b> non-mainstreamed groups scored low on the "popularity" cluster. The following variables were studied: age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, length of present school placement, severity of handicap, handicapped siblings, recent hospitalization, congenital handicaps, terminal handicaps, parental age, parental education, and the total self-concept score. No statistical correlation was found between these variables and the total self-concept score. An internal comparison of the cluster scores and the total score was performed on both <b>the</b> <b>mainstreamed</b> and non-mainstreamed group. The only positive correlation was that students in both groups with lower anxiety scored higher on self-concept. A demographic comparison of the two groups revealed that <b>the</b> <b>mainstreamed</b> children were from a higher socio-economic group and the non-mainstreamed children had more severe physical handicaps. The general conclusion is that other factors besides school placement account for self-concept of the physically handicapped child...|$|R

40|$|Children {{with autism}} {{or one of}} the related autistic {{spectrum}} disorders (2 ̆ 2 ASD 2 ̆ 2) are eligible for special education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (2 ̆ 2 IDEA 2 ̆ 2), which provides, in part, that disabled students must be educated with non-disabled peers as often as possible, a practice referred to as <b>mainstreaming</b> or inclusion. <b>The</b> federal circuit courts apply different tests to evaluate compliance with this mainstreaming requirement, but as argued in this Note, the circuit tests are effectively equivalent with respect to children diagnosed with ASDs. One significant issue in applying each of these tests is that tensions exist between <b>the</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> requirement of <b>the</b> IDEA and the clinical features of children with ASD diagnosis. Children with ASD have deficits in communicative and social behaviors that tend to minimize <b>the</b> importance of <b>mainstreaming</b> for these children. Part I of this Note provides a brief background on autism and methods of diagnosis and treatment. Part II reviews the development of the IDEA and outlines the main judicial tests for determining compliance with <b>the</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> requirement. Part III argues that despite differences in phrasing, the circuit tests as applied in the context of autistic children involve substantially the same inquiries. Part III also discusses the tentions that exist between the needs of children with autism and <b>the</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> requirement of <b>the</b> IDEA. This Note concludes that Congress and the Department of Education should relax <b>the</b> <b>mainstreaming</b> requirement in <b>the</b> context of autistic spectrum disorders...|$|R
