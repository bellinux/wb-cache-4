5|$|According to {{an article}} on The Conversation written by Robert Merkel, Heartbleed {{revealed}} a massive failure of risk analysis. Merkel thinks OpenSSL gives more importance <b>to</b> <b>performance</b> than to security, which no longer makes sense in his opinion. But Merkel considers that OpenSSL should not be blamed as much as OpenSSL users, who chose to use OpenSSL, without funding better auditing and testing. Merkel explains that two aspects determine the risk that more similar bugs will cause vulnerabilities. One, the library's source code influences the risk of writing bugs with such an impact. Secondly, OpenSSL's processes affect the chances of catching bugs quickly. On the first aspect, Merkel mentions {{the use of the}} C programming language as one risk factor which favored Heartbleed's appearance, echoing Wheeler's analysis.|$|E

25|$|The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 {{created the}} Office of Personal Management, {{to oversee the}} human {{resource}} management of the federal government, and the Merit Systems Protection Board, to regulate the merit system and prevent any abuse.

This merit pay system was a break in the long tradition of automatic salary increases based on length of service.
