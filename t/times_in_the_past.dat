5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses.

5|$|The {{music for}} The Rocketeer was {{composed}} and conducted by James Horner.

At various <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> the species has been thought to have a broader range. To date, although many potentially suitable colony sites have been searched, no colony has been conclusively identified as Novisuccinea chittenangoensis outside of the Chittenango Falls area.|$|E

5|$|A PIL {{was filed}} in the Karnataka High Court where in the {{petitioner}} requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi.

5|$|Charles Y. Harvey {{began work}} on Boy with Turtle at his studio in New York City, believing that this work {{was going to be}} his masterpiece. Almost {{immediately}} he began second guessing his design and feeling that it was inadequate. This negativity was a trait that he had shown many <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> Roughly a week after beginning the sculpture, Harvey began hearing voices commanding him to kill himself. A paper about restoring the sculpture written at Worcester Polytechnic Institute claims the voices he was hearing were coming from the partially carved sculpture itself. These voices set the date of Saturday January 27, 1912 for Harvey to kill himself. On that date he laid down his tools, headed to Bronx Park with two razors, and slit his own throat along {{the west bank of the}} Bronx River.|$|E
5|$|During the 2010–11 season, Bieksa's {{offensive}} production decreased, {{but he was}} lauded by {{the media}} and Head Coach Alain Vigneault for improving his defensive game. He had been criticized at <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> for making risk/reward plays that resulted in scoring chances for the opposing team, but his play improved to become more responsible in the defensive zone. In February 2011, he suffered a 2nd fractured bone in his foot. Playing in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Bieksa sustained the injury while blocking a shot. While he finished the game and initial x-rays came back negative, a subsequent CT-scan revealed the fracture. He became the sixth Canucks defenceman injured at the time. After missing 15 games, he returned to the line-up in late-March. Playing on a shutdown defensive pairing with Dan Hamhuis, his season-ending +32 plus-minus established a personal best and ranked second in the NHL, one point behind Boston Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Complementing his strong defensive play, he recorded six goals and 22 points in 66 games.|$|E

5|$|Of noble Burgundian descent, he was {{a student}} at the Brienne {{military}} school, then was a graduate of the Paris military school. Nansouty began his military career in 1785, as a sub-lieutenant in the regiment Bourgogne-Infanterie, where his father had served during the wars of Louis XV. A cavalry officer at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792, Nansouty was commissioned as an aide-de-camp to Marshal Nicolas Luckner. During the First Coalition, he saw service as a lieutenant-colonel and squadron commander in the 9th (heavy) Cavalry Regiment, campaigning with the French armies on the Rhine and in Germany. Promoted to Colonel in 1793 and given the command of the 9th Cavalry, he was noted for several well-led cavalry actions. Finally made a Brigadier General in 1799, after he had refused the promotion several <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> Nansouty fought the next year under General Jean Victor Moreau in southern Germany, in a decisive campaign of the Second Coalition.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} forms in North America {{that tend to}} intergrade with A.pantherina. In 2005, mycologist Rod Tulloss described Amanita aprica, a species that has been confused with A.gemmata several <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> According to mycologists Pierre Neville and Serge Poumarat, the Mediterranean species A.amici (synonymous with A.gemmata f. amici) is similar in appearance to A.gemmata but is larger. According to Tulloss however, their measurements of the cap and stem dimensions of A.amici fell within the range expected for A.gemmata, and for this reason, the two taxa should be considered conspecific. Neville and Poumarat suggest that the name A.gemmata still persists for Mediterranean collections because of its frequent historical misapplication to the native Italian species A.gioiosa, which had not {{been described as a}} distinct species until 2004. A.orientigemmata, a mushroom ranging from Japan to China, is a lookalike, but has clamps, unlike A.gemmata. Other differences between the two species include the slightly smaller spores of A.orientigemmata, and differences in the microstructure of the cap warts.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC–322 BC) {{wrote in}} his Meteorology of how the earth had the {{potential}} for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer Xenophanes (570 BC–480 BC) wrote of how inland marine fossils were evidence that massive periodic flooding had wiped out mankind several <b>times</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> but never wrote of land formation or shifting seashores. Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how {{what was once the}} Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands. The later Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.|$|E
