25|$|Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again is a non-fiction book by Donald Trump. It {{was first}} {{published}} in hardcover format by Regnery Publishing in 2011. It was reissued under the new title Time to Get Tough: Make America Great Again! by the same publisher in 2015, to match Trump's 2016 election campaign slogan. Trump had previously published The America We Deserve (2000) as preparation for his attempt to run in the 2000 U.S. presidential campaign with a populist platform. Time to Get <b>Tough</b> <b>in</b> contrast served as his prelude to the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, with a conservative platform.|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{called in}} James Ashmore Creelman (who {{was working on}} the script of The Most Dangerous Game at the time) and the two men worked {{together}} on several drafts under the title The Eighth Wonder. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, notably his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The 'beauty and the beast' angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and <b>tough</b> <b>in</b> the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.|$|E
25|$|The Bulls and the Miami Heat rivalry began {{once the}} Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade {{dominated}} by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, {{who went on to}} win the title each time. The rivalry has come back due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs in the post-Michael Jordan era and the emergence of Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose. The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player James Posey. The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4–1. Since LeBron James's departure from Miami, the Bulls-Heat rivalry has experienced a <b>tough</b> <b>in</b> comparison to the better part of the century as the Bulls chop the Heat's playoff hopes in the 2017 regular season.|$|E

25|$|The insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, {{is made up}} of two layers; the epicuticle, {{which is}} a thin, waxy, {{water-resistant}} outer layer and contains no chitin, and the layer under it called the procuticle. This is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers, the outer is the exocuticle while the inner is the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each other in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and sclerotized. The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects, especially the larval stages (e.g., caterpillars). Chemically, chitin is a long-chain polymer of a N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose. In its unmodified form, chitin is translucent, pliable, resilient and quite <b>tough.</b> <b>In</b> arthropods, however, it is often modified, becoming embedded in a hardened proteinaceous matrix, which forms much of the exoskeleton. In its pure form, it is leathery, but when encrusted in calcium carbonate, it becomes much harder. The difference between the unmodified and modified forms can be seen by comparing the body wall of a caterpillar (unmodified) to a beetle (modified).|$|E

In an interview with The Times in 2004, he said that while he was at Inter, he realised the importance of being mentally <b>tough</b> <b>in</b> order to survive: [...] "A lot of people there try to hurt you, not just physically but mentally as well, and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland, I had to adopt a tougher approach.

2500|$|After {{leaving the}} seminary, Fernandes moved to Bombay in 1949 {{in search of}} a job. His life was <b>tough</b> <b>in</b> Bombay, and he had to sleep on the streets, until he got a job as a {{proofreader}} for a newspaper. He relates to the beginning of his career by saying, [...] "When I came to Bombay, I used to sleep on the benches of Chowpatty Sands. In {{the middle of the night}} policemen used to come and wake me up and ask me to move on." [...] He came into contact with veteran union leader Placid D'Mello, and the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, who were the greatest influences on his life. Later, he joined the socialist trade union movement. He rose to prominence as a trade unionist and fought for the rights of labourers in small scale service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Emerging as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, Fernandes was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s. As a labour organiser, he served many prison terms when his workforce engaged in fights with company goons. He served as a member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from 1961 to 1968. He won in the civic election in 1961 and, until 1968, continuously raised the problems of the exploited workers in the representative body of the metropolis.|$|E
2500|$|After {{beginning}} her {{stand-up comedy}} in 1992, Silverman {{was part of}} the 1993–94 season of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season where only one of the sketches she wrote survived to dress rehearsal and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. Bob Odenkirk, a former SNL writer, explained, [...] "I could see how it wouldn't work at SNL because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her." [...] She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job. She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so <b>tough</b> <b>in</b> her career. Later, she was grateful that her SNL time was short because it didn't end up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared on The Larry Sanders Show episode [...] "The New Writer" [...] (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers.
