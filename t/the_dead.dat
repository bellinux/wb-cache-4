5|$|A Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Elwood's hometown, {{the pair}} {{meet up with}} Gamma's long-time partner C.T. Smith, another wanted powder hunter. Smith has {{infiltrated}} the ranks of Ash Daughter, a gang which has found a Ring of <b>the</b> <b>Dead.</b> The three challenge the gang's leader, Ranewater Calder, and Gamma slays Calder using his mastery of the fictional sword art karin zanjutsu, a martial art which grants its users pyrokinesis. Elwood, Gamma, and Smith thereby gain a second Ring of <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> concluding the first arc and volume of the series.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Bahadur Shah came to {{know about}} his brother's death, he sent men to {{retrieve}} the corpse. They were attacked by Wala-Jah, but Wala-Jah fainted and died. Around 8 o'clock in the evening, Bahadur Shah's aide, Rustam Dil Khan, mounted <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> prince's elephant, beheaded the prince, {{and made his way}} to Bahadur Shah. However, instead of praises, he received reproaches for his action. His elephant was followed by two other elephants; the first one contained <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> body of Ali Tabar, the other one carried <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> princes' women, who were assured protection by Bahadur Shah.|$|E

5|$|Attica is a war-torn city {{under assault}} by the Persian Empire and their pet basilisk, {{and is the}} site of Eurybiades' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, Morpheus. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, which sits atop the Sun Chariot, which has {{plummeted}} to Earth in Helios' absence. Boreas, Zephyros, Euros, and Notos, gods of the north, west, east, and south winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess Eos, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of Triton. The Underworld is the underground realm of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> and is host to the River Styx and ferryman of <b>the</b> <b>dead,</b> Charon. Tartarus is the prison of <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> and the Titans where the massive Titan Hyperion is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.|$|E

5|$|By the 17th dynasty, the Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> {{had become}} {{widespread}} {{not only for}} members of the royal family, but courtiers and other officials as well.

5000|$|The song {{is closely}} {{associated}} with the Grateful Dead; a studio version appeared on their first album <b>The</b> Grateful <b>Dead</b> (1967), and <b>the</b> song was a standard part of <b>the</b> <b>Dead's</b> repertoire throughout their career. They would often open with the song, or perform it early in the first set. [...] Unlike Chandler's recording, in <b>the</b> <b>Dead's</b> version of <b>the</b> lyrics the husband generally laments his mistreatment at his greedy wife's hands, but does not kill her. The lyrics from <b>the</b> Grateful <b>Dead's</b> version were adapted from an earlier recording by Obray Ramsey.|$|R

5|$|During the 25th and 26th dynasties, the Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> was updated, {{revised and}} standardised. Spells were {{consistently}} ordered and numbered {{for the first}} time. This standardised version is known today as the 'Saite recension', after the Saite (26th) dynasty. In the Late period and Ptolemaic period, the Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> remained based on the Saite recension, though increasingly abbreviated {{towards the end of}} the Ptolemaic period. New funerary texts appeared, including the Book of Breathing and Book of Traversing Eternity. The last use of the Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> was in the 1st century BCE, though some artistic motifs drawn from it were still in use in Roman times.|$|E

5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E

5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more {{copies of}} the Book of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> are found in hieratic script.

5|$|Funerary art is {{any work}} of art forming, or placed in, a {{repository}} for the remains of <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> The term also encompasses cenotaphs ("empty tombs"), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains; and communal memorials to <b>the</b> <b>dead</b> (such as war memorials), {{which may or may}} not contain human remains.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of <b>the</b> <b>Dead</b> on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of <b>the</b> <b>Dead.</b> The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of <b>the</b> <b>Dead,</b> these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E
