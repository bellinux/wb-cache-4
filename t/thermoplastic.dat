5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or <b>thermoplastic</b> by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
5|$|Welding <b>thermoplastic</b> is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, viscous liquid. Two heated {{interfaces}} can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Thermoplastics are a {{category}} of polymers that can be reheated and reshaped, {{and there are several}} ways that they can be used to create a bicycle frame. One implementation of <b>thermoplastic</b> bicycle frames are essentially carbon fiber frames with the fibers embedded in a <b>thermoplastic</b> material rather than the more common thermosetting epoxy materials. GT Bicycles {{was one of the first}} major manufacturers to produce a <b>thermoplastic</b> frame with their STS System frames in the mid 1990s. The carbon fibers were loosely woven into a tube along with fibers of <b>thermoplastic.</b> This tube was placed into a mould with a bladder inside which was then inflated to force the carbon and plastic tube against the inside of the mould. The mould was then heated to melt the <b>thermoplastic.</b> Once the <b>thermoplastic</b> cooled it was removed from the mould in its final form.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thermoplastics,</b> by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some <b>thermoplastics</b> may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline <b>thermoplastics</b> have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for <b>thermoplastics).</b> Examples of <b>thermoplastics</b> include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|R

25|$|Profiled <b>thermoplastic</b> {{markings}} {{are created}} by fusing <b>thermoplastic</b> to the pavement and create alternating elevation and recession pattern. This can be done as inverted-profile markings or raised-profile markings. Inverted-profile markings {{are created by}} pressing a cog rolling over the markings while they are wet to make them corrugated. Raised-profile markings are created by extruding extra thickness of <b>thermoplastic</b> at a specific interval to create bumps. Raised-profile markings are sometime known as convex traffic lines.|$|E

5000|$|One {{important}} {{classification of}} plastics {{is by the}} permanence or impermanence of their form, or whether they are: <b>thermoplastics</b> or thermosetting polymers. <b>Thermoplastics</b> are the plastics that, when heated, do not undergo chemical change in their composition and so can be molded again and again. Examples include: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).

50|$|Most <b>thermoplastics</b> {{have a high}} {{molecular}} weight. The polymer chains associate through intermolecular forces, which weaken rapidly with increased temperature, yielding a viscous liquid. Thus, <b>thermoplastics</b> may be reshaped by heating and are typically used to produce parts by various polymer processing techniques such as injection molding, compression molding, calendering, and extrusion. <b>Thermoplastics</b> differ from thermosetting polymers, which form irreversible chemical bonds during the curing process.

50|$|Short fiber {{reinforced}} <b>thermoplastics</b> have a {{broad range}} of applications due to fiber reinforcement properties. Short fiber <b>thermoplastics</b> are able to withstand up to 30,000 psi of applied tensile load and have an elastic modulus on the order of 2 x 106 psi. They are ideal for applications for which toughness is of critical importance, high volume production is involved, and long shelf life and scrap recycling are important issues. With all of these performance capabilities, one of the greatest advantages to using short fiber reinforced <b>thermoplastics</b> is their ease of processing and reprocessability.Ease of processing has been the key factor to the widespread use of short fiber reinforced <b>thermoplastics.</b> Effective processing techniques and the ability to recycle scrap offer significant cost reductions that compare to those of thermoset compounds and metals. Because of this, short fiber reinforced <b>thermoplastics</b> are desired in the electrical and electronic, automotive, oilfield, chemical process, and defense industries. Although short fiber <b>thermoplastics</b> have progressed considerably over the years and have a secured spot in a colossally-sized market, further refinement of compounding and process technology along with improvements in part design could allow the performance window of these materials to widen significantly, allowing them to be used for more applications in the future.|$|R
