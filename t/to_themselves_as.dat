5|$|Residents of Arbroath {{are called}} Arbroathians but often refer <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Red Lichties after the red lamp that shone from the harbour light and foghorn tower at the {{entrance}} to the harbour as an aid to shipping entering the aforementioned harbour.|$|E
5|$|Frank Case, {{owner of}} the hotel, ensured a daily luncheon for the talented group of young writers by {{treating}} them to free celery and popovers; more importantly, they were provided with their own table and waiter. Edna Ferber, Franklin P. Adams, George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Marc Connelly eventually joined the group, expanding its membership.

5|$|Historical {{coats of}} {{arms of the}} U.S. states {{date back to the}} {{admission}} of the first states to the Union. Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> states shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E
50|$|While in the 2011 census Protestants outnumbered Catholics in {{only half}} of the districts in Northern Ireland, those who {{considered}} themselves British outnumbered those who considered themselves Irish in twenty of the twenty-six districts. This is partly because Catholics were more likely <b>to</b> see <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> British than Protestants were <b>to</b> see <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Irish, but is also partly because those of no religion were substantially more likely <b>to</b> see <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> British <b>as</b> see <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Irish.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} a strong {{correlation}} in Northern Ireland between religious background and the perception of which geographical area forms the nation to which that person feels they belong, it is not a strict relationship and national identity is not simply distributed proportionally in accordance with the percentages of different religions in a particular area. For example, Catholics overall are almost five times more likely <b>to</b> view <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> being British only, than Protestants are <b>to</b> view <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> being Irish only. In the 2011 census there were four of the twenty-six districts in Northern Ireland, all on the eastern seaboard, where Catholics were more likely <b>to</b> view <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> being British than Irish; Carrickfergus, Larne, North Down and Ards, whereas even in those districts where Protestants were most likely <b>to</b> view <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Irish, such as Derry, Fermanagh and Newry and Mourne, Protestants were still more than ten times more likely <b>to</b> view <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> British than Irish.|$|R

5|$|Little Busters! story {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Riki Naoe, a young male high school student. When Riki was a child, his parents died, leaving him hopeless and depressed. He was saved by a group—three boys and a girl, all his age—who referred <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> the Little Busters, a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice. The leader of the group was Kyousuke Natsume who had a younger sister named Rin. The other two members were Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa, who were friends despite being rivals. They took Riki out and played together with him during his time of need, making him the fifth Little Busters member. In time, Riki enjoyed playing with them, and his grief over his parents gradually faded away. When the story begins, Riki and his friends are seemingly in their second year of high school, except for Kyousuke {{who is in his}} third year. They still hang out together, and enjoy their school life.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{supported}} clubs in Europe. The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200officially recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly and Reclaim The Kop. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Liverpool fans often refer <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Kopites, a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had been priced out of watching Premier League football.|$|E
5|$|Many Greek Orthodox populations, {{particularly}} {{those outside the}} newly independent modern Greek state, continued to refer <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Romioi (i.e. Romans, Byzantines) well into the 20th century. Peter Charanis, born {{on the island of}} Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island was taken from the Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‘‘What are you looking at?’’ one of the soldiers asked. ‘‘At Hellenes,’’ the children replied. ‘‘Are you not Hellenes yourselves?’’ the soldier retorted. ‘‘No, we are Romans,’’ the children replied.|$|E

5|$|A {{major element}} of the plot {{is based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used it at the end of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E
5|$|Although the Klan {{had four}} million members in 1924, the group's {{membership}} quickly shrank after Stephenson's widely publicized trial. The Indiana Klan {{lost more than}} 90% of its members {{by the end of}} the proceedings, and there were mass resignations in other states as well. Other scandals emerged, further damaging Klan enrollment. Although the Colorado Klan had seen strong growth, Evans asked the Grand Dragon, John Galen Locke, to resign after local corruption scandals in 1925 involving Klan members who served as police. Evans' request was poorly received by Colorado Klan members; local enrollment subsequently plummeted. He encountered difficulties with Klan leaders in Pennsylvania in 1926, after many of them concluded that he was too autocratic. In response, he revoked the charters of several local Klan groups and removed John Strayer, a state legislator, from his position of authority in the Klan. When the Pennsylvania groups continued to refer <b>to</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> the Ku Klux Klan, Evans sued them in federal court. Pennsylvania Klan members launched a detailed legal offensive against Evans and other Klan leaders, alleging misdeeds, including participation in kidnappings and lynchings. Evans' suit was unsuccessful and, as many newspapers reported the scandalous allegations aired in court, the Pennsylvania Klan suffered a serious decline in membership and support.|$|E
