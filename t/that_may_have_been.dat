5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are now considered to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E

5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{a fossil}} rodent from the Miocene of the United States, the only {{species in the}} genus Apeomyoides. It is known from fragmentary jaws and {{isolated}} teeth from a site in the early Barstovian, around 15–16 million years ago, of Nevada. Together with other species from scattered localities in the United States, Japan, and Europe, Apeomyoides is classified in the subfamily Apeomyinae of the extinct rodent family Eomyidae. Apeomyines are a rare but widespread group <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> adapted to a relatively dry habitat.|$|E
5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions.

5|$|Structure 4 (or Structure IV) is a {{group of}} three temples {{on the east side of}} the Central Plaza. It is divided into three sections, {{labelled}} Structures 4a, 4b and 4c. The central Structure 4b is built upon a substructure dating to the Preclassic period.

5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch.

50|$|The Temple <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{built in}} the 2nd century BCE under the Greeks in India (Indo-Greeks).

5|$|The {{species is}} {{suspected}} of being toxic {{as is the case}} in most of its close relatives. Handling the mushroom is harmless; poisoning occurs only on ingestion.

Symptoms of poisoning in humans include reversible impairment of kidney function. A Meixner test revealed that amatoxins were not involved in the Puebla case.|$|E
5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus).
