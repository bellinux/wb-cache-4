It also analyses features of tax provisions which are peculiar to the Italian system. On these bases, it looks at measures affecting the tax burden on the Italian banking system over the period 2000 - 09. Inter alia, the analysis shows the role played by the rules for a firm’s tax base and for tax relief and considers the increasing importance of deferred tax assets. The comparison between the Italian banking sector and those of other countries, in relation to commercial banks, shows that over the period 1998 - 2008 all jurisdictions experienced a reduction in both effective and statutory tax rates. Even if the tax burden on Italian banks has seen one of the largest reductions, this <b>tax</b> <b>indicator</b> is still the highest among the countries considered. tax burden, banks...|$|E
40|$|All <b>tax</b> <b>indicator</b> estimates, whether {{based on}} aggregate- or micro data, {{need to be}} corroborated by other {{information}} and preferably also other tax indicators before policy conclusions can reasonably be drawn. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the way the (macroeconomic implicit tax rate on labour income is calculated in the European Commission Structures of the Taxation Systems in the EU? publication, to show its relationship to the widely recognised (microeconomic) tax wedge indicator for an average production worker from the "Taxing Wages" approach of the OECD, and to illustrate its use. It appears from the European Commission report that evidence from the implicit tax ratio at the macro level in a single year cannot simply be projected to observations for an average worker at the micro level, and conversely. With a few exemptions, however, both the macroeconomic and the microeconomic indicator appear to have comparable informative content as regards to general increasing or decreasing trends over time. It should be noted that the changes in the macroeconomic implicit tax rate may reflect structural changes in the entire economy, such as changes in the distribution of wage income. The implicit tax rate relates to actual tax revenue data and it could be, for example, that the revenue effect of targeted reductions in personal income tax, at say, the lower end of the income scale, has been offset by increases in wage income at the top of the wage scale. The two indicators could then be considered complementary instruments for evaluating tax policy. European Union, Tax indicators, Effective tax rates, Taxes on labour, Non-wage labour costs...|$|E

Empirical evidence from a panel of OECD countries This paper examines the relationship between tax structures and economic growth by entering <b>indicators</b> of the <b>tax</b> structure into a set of panel growth regressions for 21 OECD countries, in which both the accumulation of physical and human capital are accounted for. The results of the analysis suggest that income taxes are generally associated with lower economic growth than taxes on consumption and property. More precisely, the findings allow {{the establishment of a}} ranking of tax instruments with respect to their relationship to economic growth. Property taxes, and particularly recurrent taxes on immovable property, seem to be the most growth-friendly, followed by consumption taxes and then by personal income taxes. Corporate income taxes appear to have the most negative effect on GDP per capita. These findings suggest that a revenue-neutral growth-oriented tax reform would be to shift part of the revenue base towards recurrent property and consumption taxes and away from income taxes, especially corporate taxes. There is also evidence of a negative relationship between the progressivity of personal income taxes and growth. All of the results are robust to a number of different specifications, including controlling for other determinants of economic growth and instrumenting <b>tax</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R

The estimated elasticity suggests that a 1 % reduction in host country tax rates leads to an increase of total FDI between 0. 3 % and 1. 8 %, depending on the specific <b>tax</b> burden <b>indicator.</b> In addition, it is shown that tax elasticity is lower when solely analyzing investments in production, plant and equipment (PPE).

40|$|With the European {{economic}} integration, {{the understanding}} of inflation and inflationary pressures requires to analyse both the national level and the whole Euro area level. This is true in particular for the inflation forecasts that are carried out within the Eurosystem and published {{four times a year}} in the ECB Monthly Bulletin. For that purpose, the Banque de France is currently building tools for the Euro area in addition to those already in use for France. The present study puts forward a simple model of short-term developments (one year ahead) in inflation, as measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) of the Euro area. This model {{does not take into account}} the feed-back effect of prices on activity, which should be considered in order to analyse medium-term price developments. It could hence be improved along these lines in the future. The model includes seven equations, explaining the total HICP of the Euro area and some of its sector-based sub-indexes (services, manufacturing sector, unprocessed food, processed food, energy and underlying inflation, defined as HICP inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy prices). It uses exogenous variables such as unit labour cost, import deflator, indicators of tightening in the labour market, or in the goods market, and indirect <b>tax</b> <b>indicators.</b> We have favoured an empirical approach rather than a strict compliance with theoretical models, paying particularly attention to the fit of the equations to the data. However, this model is able to provide relevant economic interpretations of recent price developments. Finally, we assess the forecasting performance of the model in traditional in-sample and out-of-sample rolling event evaluations. To do so, the forecasts were compared to the ones obtained from simple autoregressive equations, which are also commonly used to forecast short-term price developments. On the whole, the model provides more accurate forecasts than those provided by the autoregressive model, and a sector-based disaggregated approach outperforms a single equation to forecast total HICP. Part of this result may come from dummy variables that correspond to well identified shocks that improve both the econometric characteristics and forecast performance of the equations of our model.

At the beginning of the writing of this thesis, I thought that the tax system should primarily be transparent, simple, focusing on its primary fiscal function and should therefore be free of social politics.

40|$|In tax {{behavior}} research field, {{two dimensions}} compiling the “slippery slope framework” {{are regarded as}} main drivers of compliance, i. e., perceived trust in authorities and perceived power of authorities. The former grasps citizens’ cognitions towards the efforts tax authorities render in benevolently supplying public goods. The latter covers general cognitions about authorities’ capacity of detecting and efficiently inflicting punishments on tax dodgers. Following interactions which involve both parties of the tax game, a society’s common good is secured through the ensued tax compliance level. Nevertheless, like any outcome depending on cooperation, compliance is frail. This happens mainly because authorities are called to mediate an ongoing clash between citizens who abide by legal prescriptions, through voluntary or enforced compliance, and citizens who eschew them if opportunities arise, through avoidance or evasion. Depending on the chosen mediation approach (trust-based or power-based), one type of compliance prevails over another. The present writing explores new insights of the framework’s chief dimensions within {{the perimeter of the}} Latin American interaction tax climate (viz. Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru) by dint of economic, fiscal and psychological determinants. The proposed methodological apparatus ranges from operationalizing World Bank governance indicators (government effectiveness, rule of law, regulatory quality, control for corruption) as trust and power proxies, assessing economic growth through chain base indexes and rating ease of tax compliance based on reliable benchmarks (e. g., Paying <b>Taxes</b> <b>indicators,</b> shadow economy, corruption perceptions). The leading goal of the study is to make authorities, investors, international organizations and laypeople cognizant of the role trust in and power of authorities play for compliance levels reached in the Latin American tax climate. Grounding decision-making on comprehensive valuations of trust and power may prove cost-effective for any authority concerned with enacting the appropriate weighting of tax incentives and enforcement strategies in order to enhance compliance; it may urge taxpayers to match the actions of an equitable authority and cooperate; it may serve investors as a guide to determine the efficiency, credibility and stability of Latin American fiscal systems; it may assist financing international organizations to detect the possible risks and vulnerabilities of the relationship between authorities and taxpayers and evaluate the headway/regress registered by a particular country within this tax climate. In terms of trust, various countries in the region have implemented solid strategies to sustain competitiveness, infrastructure, innovation or health. In terms of power, several tax authorities are deemed as rather weak in mitigating noncompliance. Nevertheless, massive investments in infrastructure prove commitment in nixing evasion...|$|R
