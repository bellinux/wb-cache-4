With their growing popularity, huge amount of video content imposes a heavy burden on Internet <b>traffic</b> which, <b>in</b> turns, <b>influences</b> the user experience of the systems. Predicting and pre- fetching relevant content before user requests is one of the popular methods used to reduce the start-up delay. In this paper, a typical VOD system is characterized and user's watching behavior is analyzed. Based on the characterization, two pre- fetching approaches based on user behavior are investigated. One is to prediction relevant content based on access history. The other is prediction based on user-clustering. The results clearly indicate the value of pre-fetching approaches for VOD systems and lead to the discussions on future work for further improvement...|$|R

VISSIM is a traffic microscopic simulation software which has been widely used assessing traffic conditions. It is especially useful to evaluate different traffic management scenarios to choose the best alternative and optimization measures before implementation. This paper builds a road network model in VISSIM. Four different traffic organization plans are compared. Since the driving behaviors in Beijing are significantly different from USA or Europe, behavioral studies are conducted to calibrate parameters before model build-up in order to get more accurate results. This paper uses travel time, travel speed, queue length and delay as evaluation indicators to conduct the comparison. The results show that the one-way street organization plan inside CBD area performs the best...|$|R
