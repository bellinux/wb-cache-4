2500|$|Design of {{the engine}} {{was carried out by}} Frank Halford at his London {{consulting}} firm starting in April 1941. It was based on the basic design pioneered by Frank Whittle, using a centrifugal compressor providing compressed air to sixteen individual combustion chambers, from which the exhaust powered a single-stage axial turbine. Compared to Whittle designs, the H-1 was [...] "cleaned up" [...] in that it used a single-sided compressor with the inlet at the front, and a [...] "straight through" [...] layout with the combustion chambers exhausting straight onto the turbine. Whittle's designs such as the Power Jets W.2 used a [...] "reverse flow" [...] layout that piped the hot air back to the middle {{of the engine}}, in order to [...] "fold" [...] it and reduce its length and to reduce the <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature,</b> a safeguard necessary for the turbine materials available when Whittle was designing the engines. Although it eliminated the Whittle-style [...] "folding", the Goblin was still a very compact design.|$|E

50|$|The {{availability}} of superalloys during past decades {{has led to}} a steady increase in the <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the trend is expected to continue. Sandia National Laboratories is studying a new method for making superalloys, known as radiolysis. It introduces an entirely new area of research into creating alloys and superalloys through nanoparticle synthesis. This process holds promise as a universal method of nanoparticle formation. By developing an understanding of the basic material science behind these nanoparticle formations, there is speculation that {{it might be possible to}} expand research into other aspects of superalloys.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{principal}} advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump, the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point. By condensing the fluid, the work required by the pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle. The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature. Gas turbines, for instance, have <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures</b> approaching 1500 °C. Nonetheless, the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.|$|R

Quantitative models which include the interaction between fatigue–creep–oxygen attack need further development...|$|R
50|$|While many {{substances}} {{could be}} used as the working fluid in the Rankine cycle, water is usually the fluid of choice due to its favorable properties, such as its non-toxic and unreactive chemistry, abundance, and low cost, as well as its thermodynamic properties. By condensing the working steam vapor to a liquid the pressure at the turbine outlet is lowered and the energy required by the feed pump consumes only 1% to 3% of the turbine output power and these factors contribute to a higher efficiency for the cycle. The benefit of this is offset by the low temperatures of steam admitted to the turbine(s). Gas turbines, for instance, have <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures</b> approaching 1500°C. However, the thermal efficiency of actual large steam power stations and large modern gas turbine stations are similar.|$|R
50|$|The thrust lapse {{described}} above {{depends on the}} design specific thrust and, to a certain extent, on how the engine is rated with intake temperature. Three possible ways of rating an engine are depicted on the above Husk Plot. The engine could be rated at constant <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature,</b> shown on the plot as ''''''. Alternatively, a constant mechanical shaft speed could be assumed, depicted as ''''''. A further alternative is a constant compressor corrected speed, shown as ''''''. The variation of net thrust with flight Mach number can be clearly seen on the Husk Plot.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of a Rankine cycle is usually {{limited by the}} working fluid. Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °C (the creep limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 °C. This gives a theoretical Carnot {{efficiency of}} about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature</b> (compared with a gas turbine) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations.|$|E
50|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of a gas}} turbine is increased by raising the overall pressure ratio, requiring higher-temperature compressor materials, and raising the <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature,</b> requiring better turbine materials and/or improved vane/blade cooling. It is also increased by reducing the losses as the flow progresses from the intake to the propelling nozzle. These losses are quantified by compressor and turbine efficiencies and ducting pressure losses. When used in a turbojet application, where the output from the gas turbine is used in a propelling nozzle, raising the turbine temperature increases the jet velocity. This reduces the propulsive efficiency, giving a loss in overall efficiency, as reflected by the higher fuel consumption, or SFC.|$|E
40|$|A superalloy, or {{high-performance}} alloy, is an alloy able {{to withstand}} extreme temperatures that would destroy conventional metals like steel and aluminum. Nickel based superalloys are selected for use in certain applications due to their characteristics. These alloys have an exceptional combination of high temperature strength, toughness, and resistance to degradation in corrosive or oxidizing environments. Among the important characteristics are creep resistance at high temperatures, good surface stability, and corrosion and oxidation resistance. Because of these characteristics they are widely used in aircraft and power-generation turbines, rocket engines, nuclear power and chemical processing plants and other challenging environments. The availability of superalloys during past decades {{has led to a}} steady increase in the <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and this trend is expected to continue. New generations of superalloys can tolerate average temperatures of 1050 °C with occasional excursions to temperatures as high as 1200 °C, which is approximately 90 % of the melting point of the material. Increased operating temperatures and higher efficiency in gas turbines and jet engines can reduce CO 2 emission, thus contributing to the slowing of climate change...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{continuing}} demand to raise the operating temperature of jet engine turbine blades to meet the need for higher <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures</b> (TET) {{in order to increase}} thermal efficiency and thrust. Modern, high-pressure turbine blades are made from Ni-based superalloys in single-crystal form via the investment casting process. One important post-cast surface defect, known as 'surface scale', has been investigated on the alloy CMSX- 10 N. This is an area of distinct discolouration of the aerofoil seen after casting. Auger electron and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis were carried out on both scaled and un-scaled areas. In the scaled region, a thin layer (~ 800 nm) of Ni oxide is evident. In the un-scaled regions there is a thicker Al 2 O 3 layer. It is shown that, as the blade cools during casting, differential thermal contraction of mould and alloy causes the solid blade to 'detach' from the mould in these scaled areas. The formation of Ni Oxides is facilitated by this separation. Peer-reviewedPublisher Version 10895...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} in the specific work and cycle efficiency of gas turbines can be achieved through higher <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Maintaining adequate life at these high temperatures requires the development of materials and efficient cooling methods. One cooling method that has gained increasing importance is endwall film-cooling, where coolant air is discharged through discrete holes in {{the inner and outer}} endwalls (platforms) of a turbine blade passage. After leaving the holes, the coolant forms a protective layer between the hot mainstream gas and the surface that is to be protected. The ejected coolant interacts with the external flow near the endwall and generates aerodynamic and thermodynamic losses in the process. This reduces turbine stage efficiency and together with the consumption of cooling air is detrimental to the overall cycle efficiency. The keystone of this research project is an experimental investigation using a large-scale low-speed linear turbine cascade. The distribution of adiabatic film-cooling effectiveness on the endwall of this cascade has been measured using a new technique that has been developed as part of this project. Using this new technique, the achieved levels of cooling effectiveness are quantified and over- and under-cooled regions on the endwall are identified. Thes...|$|R
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the Rankine cycle {{is limited by the}} high heat of vaporization of the working fluid. Also, unless the pressure and temperature reach super critical levels in the steam boiler, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small: steam turbine entry temperatures are typically around 565 °C and steam condenser temperatures are around 30 °C. This gives a theoretical maximum Carnot efficiency for the steam turbine alone of about 63.8% compared with an actual overall thermal {{efficiency of}} up to 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low steam <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature</b> (compared to a gas turbine) is why the Rankine (steam) cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle to recover otherwise rejected heat in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations.|$|E
50|$|All {{practical}} airbreathing {{jet engines}} are internal combustion engines that directly heat {{the air by}} burning fuel, with the resultant hot gases used for propulsion via a propulsive nozzle, although other techniques for heating the air have been experimented with (such as nuclear jet engines). Most modern jet engine designs are turbofans, which have largely replaced turbojets. These modern engines use a gas turbine engine core with high overall pressure ratio (about 40:1 in 1995) and high <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature</b> (about 1800 K in 1995), and provide {{a great deal of}} their thrust with a turbine-power fan stage, rather than with pure exhaust thrust as in a turbojet. These features combine to give a high efficiency, relative to a turbojet. A few jet engines use simple ram effect (ramjet) or pulse combustion (pulsejet) to give compression.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the gas in the engine is highest just before the turbine, and the ability for the turbine to withstand these temperatures {{is one of the}} primary restrictions on total dry engine thrust. This temperature is known as the <b>Turbine</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>Temperature</b> (TET), one of the critical engine operating parameters. Because a combustion rate high enough to consume all the intake oxygen would create temperatures high enough to overheat the turbine, the flow of fuel must be restricted to an extent that fuel rather than oxygen becomes the limiting factor in the reaction, leaving some oxygen to flow past the turbine. After passing the turbine, the gas expands at a near constant entropy, thus losing temperature. The afterburner then injects fuel downstream of the turbine and reheats the gas. In conjunction with the added heat, the pressure rises in the tailpipe and the gas is ejected through the nozzle at a higher velocity. The mass flow is also slightly increased by the addition of the fuel.|$|E

In a free turbine the turbine driving the compressor rotates independently of that which powers the propellor or helicopter rotor.

The life of these coatings under operating conditions was desired to coincide with that of the components to be coated. The mechanical properties of the base material were not significantly to be influenced by the coating. The coating thickness was to be ca. 100 #mu#m -common in engine blades. It was shown that the creep strength of the single-crystal material even at high temperatures is adversely affected by the coating, only when the cross-section ratio between the base material and the coating is small, i. e. for thin specimens. The reduction of operating time until break observed in this case is caused by a disintegration of the #gamma#'-phase in the near surface region of the base material. (orig.)

Fine grain RR 1000 in both polished and shot-peened conditions was studied for classic (zero load) and statically loaded conditions using integrated two-stage isotopic tracing combined with focused-ion-beam secondary ion mass spectrometry (FIB-SIMS). Cr 2 O 3 external oxide formed with semicontinuous TiO 2 above and below. Preferential grain boundary Al 2 O 3 internal oxide formation, γ′-dissolution, and recrystallization occurred subsurface. Oxidation mechanisms were dominated by anionic/cationic growth in the external oxide with inward oxygen transport, initially through the partially unprotective external oxide, then along internal oxide/alloy interfaces. Loading did not influence the oxidation products formed but did bring about expedited oxidation kinetics and changes to the oxide morphology. The oxygen diffusivity D O * (× 10 − 13 cm 2 s− 1) ranged from 0. 39 for the polished alloy to 3. 7 for the shot-peened condition under compressive stress.

Bob worked at Rolls-Royce from 1979 on titanium alloys, moving onto hot section materials such as nickel superalloys and ceramics, and holding various managerial positions. In 1990, he decided {{to move away from}} the managerial route and pursued technical specialism, becoming Rolls-Royce’s UK specialist in turbine aerofoil materials, where he stayed until his retirement in 2006.

50|$|With {{increasing}} <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature,</b> it {{is important}} to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena occurring during creep deformation of single crystal superalloys under such extreme condition (i.e. high temperature and high stress). The creep deformation behavior of superalloy single crystal is strongly temperature, stress, orientation and alloy dependent. For a single-crystal superalloy, there are 3 different mode of creep deformation under regimes of different temperature and stress: Rafting, Tertiary and Primary. At low temperature (~750 °C), SX alloys exhibits mostly primary creep behavior. Matan et al. concluded that the extent of primary creep deformation depends strongly on the angle between the tensile axis and the <001>/<011> symmetry boundary. At temperature above 850 °C, tertiary creep dominates and promotes strain softening behavior. When temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the rafting effect is prevalent where cubic particles transform into flat shapes under tensile stress The rafts would also form perpendicular to the tensile axis, since γ phase was transported out of the vertical channels and into the horizontal ones. After conducting unaxial creep deformation of <001> orientated CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy at 1105 °C and 100 MPa, Reed et al. has established that rafting is beneficial to creep life since it delays evolution of creep strain. In addition, rafting would occur quickly and suppress the accumulation of creep strain until a critical strain is reached.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} analysis of two mid-sized oxy-fuel combustion combined cycles is performed. The two cycles are the Semi Closed Oxy-fuel Combustion Combined Cycle (SCOC-CC) and the Graz cycle. In addition, a reference cycle was established {{as the basis}} for the analysis of the oxy-fuel combustion cycles. The fuel for all three cycles is natural gas. A parametric study was conducted where the pressure ratio and the <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature</b> (also called combustor outlet temperature) were varied. The optimum net efficiency for the reference cycle is 56 % at a pressure ratio of 26. 2 and <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature</b> of 1400 C. The optimum net efficiency for the SCOC-CC was 46 % at a pressure ratio of 57. 3 and a <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature</b> of 1450 C. The optimum net efficiency for the Graz cycle was also 46 % at a lower pressure ratio than the SCOC-CC, at 36. 5 at the same <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperature</b> of 1450 C. The main reduction in effifciency for the oxy-fuel combustion cycles comes from the O 2 production and compression. The layout and the design of the SCOC-CC is considerably simpler than the Graz cycle while it achieves the same net efficiency. The fact that the efficiencies for the two cycles are close to identical differs from previously reported work. Earlier studies have reported around a 3 % points advantage in efficiency for the Graz cycle, which is attributed to the use of a second bottoming cycle. This additional feature, possible to include in both cycles, is omitted to make the two cycles more comparable in terms of complexity. Even in its simplified form the Graz cycle requires the use of intercooling and steam cooling, in contrast to the SCOC-CC. The Graz cycle, however, has substantially lower pressure ratio at the optimum efficiency and has much higher power density for the gas turbine than both the reference cycle and the SCOC-CC...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for high <b>Turbine</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>Temperatures</b> (TET) <b>turbines</b> for Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) require improved materials and sophisticated cooling. Cooling {{is critical to}} maintaining mechanical integrity of the turbine for temperatures > 1000 °C. Increasing TET {{is one of the}} solutions for improving efficiency after cycle optimum pressure ratios have been achieved but cooling as a percentage of mass flow will have to increase, resulting in cycle efficiency penalties. To limit this effect, it is necessary to know the maximum allowable blade metal temperature to ensure the minimum cooling fraction is used. The main objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the thermal efficiencies of four cycles in the 300 – 700 MW class for Generation IV NPPs, using two different turbines with optimum cooling for TETs between 950 °C - 1200 °C. The cycles analysed are Simple Cycle (SC), Simple Cycle Recuperated (SCR), Intercooled Cycle (IC) and Intercooled Cycle Recuperated (ICR). Although results showed that deterioration of cycle performance is lower when using improved turbine material, the justification to use optimum cooling improves the cycle significantly when a recuperator is used. Furthermore, optimised cooling flow and the introduction of an intercooler improves cycle efficiency by > 3 %, which is > 1 % more than previous studies. Finally, the study highlights the potential of cycle performance beyond 1200 °C for IC. This is based on the IC showing the least performance deterioration.

40|$|The {{intercooled}} cycle (IC) as {{an alternative}} to the simple cycle recuperated (SCR) and intercooled cycle recuperated (ICR) is yet to be fully analyzed for the purpose of assessing its viability for utilization within Generation IV nuclear power plants (NPPs). Although the benefits are not explicitly obvious, it offers the advantage of a very high overall pressure ratio (OPR) in the absence of a recuperator. Thus, the main objective of this study is to analyze various pressure ratio configurations, the effects of varying pressure ratio including sensitivity analyses of component efficiencies, ambient temperature, component losses and pressure losses on cycle efficiency, and specific work of the IC, including comparison with the SCR and ICR. Results of comparison between the IC and the SCR and ICR derived that the cycle efficiencies are greater than the IC by ∼ 4 %∼ 4 % (SCR) and ∼ 6 %∼ 6 % (ICR), respectively. However, the pressure losses for IC are lower when compared with the SCR and ICR. Nonetheless, heat from the turbine exit temperature of the IC can be used in a processing plant including the possibility of higher <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures</b> (TETs) to significantly increase the cycle efficiency in a bid to justify the business case. The analyses intend to bring to attention an alternative to current cycle configurations for the gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) and very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), where helium is the coolant.

40|$|International audienceFurther {{improvements}} in the efficiency of gas turbines are recognised to come from increases in <b>turbine</b> <b>entry</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Accurate temperature measurements are crucial to achieve these increases whilst maintaining reliability and economic component life. The combination of phosphor thermometry and thermal barrier coating (TBC) technology {{has led to the}} development of functional temperature sensor coatings which have several advantages over conventional temperature measurement techniques. Developments in sol–gel processing indicate that this method could be used for the production, or particularly, the repair of TBCs in the future. This paper demonstrates, for the first time, that sol–gel processing can be used to make sensor TBCs. The optimum concentration of SmO 1. 5 was 2 wt. % in YSZ to achieve the brightest phosphorescence emission. Above this concentration the overall intensity of the emission reduces and the transitions from 4 F 3 / 2 were suppressed. Furthermore, a similar suppression of these transitions was observed when the product of the sol–gel was heat treated to 1100 ◦C. This was concluded to be due to a higher degree of crystallinity allowing a greater interaction between the dopant ions. The dependence of the phosphorescence spectrum on heat treatment temperature provides the first indication that YSZ produced through sol–gel could be used to detect historic temperatures. An evaluation of the subsurface measurement and temperature capabilities has shown that the phosphorescence can be detected from relatively thin layers, 20 µm, even under 50 µm of undoped YSZ coating. Although the temperature detection range, 400 – 700 ◦C, is too low for advanced TBCs the material could be used in low temperature regimes or for health monitoring purposes...|$|R
