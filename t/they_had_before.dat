5|$|Enghien, {{having learned}} of the Imperial advance, left a {{blocking}} force at Carignano and assembled {{the remainder of his}} army at Carmagnola, blocking d'Avalos's route to the besieged city. The French cavalry, shadowing d'Avalos's movements, discovered that the Imperial forces were headed directly for the French position; on 10 April, d'Avalos occupied the village of Ceresole d'Alba, about five miles (8km) southeast of the French. Enghien's officers urged him to attack immediately, but he was determined to fight on ground of his own choosing; on the morning of 11 April 1544, the French marched from Carmagnola to a position some three miles (5km) to the southeast and awaited d'Avalos's arrival. Enghien and Montluc felt that the open ground would give the French cavalry a significant tactical advantage. By this point, the French army consisted of around 11,000–13,000 infantry, 600 light cavalry, and 900–1,250 heavy cavalry; Enghien and d'Avalos each had about twenty pieces of artillery. The battle came at a fortunate time for Enghien, as his Swiss troops were—as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>before</b> the Battle of Bicocca—threatening to march home if they were not paid; the news of the impending battle restored some calm to their ranks.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1964 riot in Hama and other cities, the radicals were on the retreat and the Aflaqites regained control for a brief period. Bitar formed a new government which halted the nationalisation process, reaffirm respect for civil liberties and private property. However, these policy changes did not win sufficient support, and the population at large still opposed Ba'ath Party rule. The upper classes continued to disinvest capital and smuggle capital out of the country, and the only foreseeable solution to this loss of capital was continuing with nationalisation. The party's left-wing argued that the bourgeoisie would never be won over unless they were given total control over the economy as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>before.</b> It was this power struggle between the moderate Aflaqites who dominated the National Command of the Ba'ath Party and the radicals who dominated the Syrian Regional Command of the Ba'ath Party which led to the 1966 coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis worsens {{with the}} {{severity}} of injury. Most TBIs are mild and do not cause permanent or long-term disability; however, all severity levels of TBI {{have the potential to}} cause significant, long-lasting disability. Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of mild injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries. Most mild TBI is completely resolved within threeweeks, and almost all people with mild TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>before</b> the injury, although a portion have mild cognitive and social impairments. Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently, although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing. Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently; middle ground is less common. Coma, as it is closely related to severity, is a strong predictor of poor outcome.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{overturn}} the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, {{at a time of}} increasing civil rights activism.

25|$|During the Great Depression, popcorn {{was fairly}} {{inexpensive}} at 5–10 cents {{a bag and}} became popular. Thus, while other businesses failed, the popcorn business thrived and became a {{source of income for}} many struggling farmers, including the Redenbacher family, namesake of the famous popcorn brand. During World War II, sugar rations diminished candy production, and Americans compensated by eating three times as much popcorn as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>before.</b> The snack was popular at theaters, much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners, who thought it distracted from the films. Their minds eventually changed, however, and in 1938 a Midwestern theater owner named Glen W. Dickson installed popcorn machines in the lobbies of his theaters. The venture was a financial success, and the trend soon spread.|$|E
