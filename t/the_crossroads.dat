The town market is a shady place controlled by a mysterious entity known as the Black Raven, the East District contains an abandoned warehouse, and Ely Street as well as Highyard Hill are primarily residential areas. On the outskirts of Highyard Hill lies the manor owned by the former mayor's children, who live away {{from the rest of the}} village. The townspeople believe that the manor is home to a witch.

5|$|Archaeological discoveries {{show that}} the first {{settlements}} {{in the area of}} present-day Białystok occurred during the Stone Age.

Since then, the Białystok area has been at <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> of cultures. Trade routes linking the Baltic to the Black Sea favored the development of settlements with Yotvingia-Ruthenian-Polish cultural characteristics.|$|E

5|$|At 02:00 on 13 June the 13th/18th Royal Hussars {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} 'C' Company's position at <b>the</b> <b>crossroads,</b> later followed by fifty-one {{men from the}} 22nd Independent Parachute Company. Bréville was now in British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June. But not in the numbers to defend against a German counter-attack, so the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles, part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, was moved into the village to take over from the survivors of the attack.|$|E
5|$|By 22:45 <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> {{had been}} secured by what {{remained}} of 'C' Company, the eighteen survivors of 'A' Company were in among the south-eastern buildings of Bréville. In the north-east of the village the twenty survivors of the Devonshire company had captured their objective. The shelling had stopped when 'B' Company reached the village unopposed and occupied abandoned German trenches beside the church. Fearing a German counter-attack on his weakened battalion, Parker ordered a defensive artillery bombardment. However, there was a misunderstanding when the order reached the artillery and a heavy bombardment landed on the British positions in the village, causing several casualties including three of the surviving officers.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade {{and he could see}} the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure <b>the</b> <b>crossroads</b> north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
