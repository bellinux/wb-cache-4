These compass programs use vector algebra to compute plane and lineation orientations from the accelerometer and magnetometer data, and permit rapid collection of many measurements. However, some problems are potentially present. Measurements made by smartphone geological compasses can potentially be susceptible to noise, mainly due to vibration or rapid hand movement. Users of a smartphone compass should carefully calibrate their devices and run several tests against traditional magnetic compasses {{in order to understand the}} limitations of their chosen program.|$|E

40|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} studied by many {{researchers}} as an agent that provides changes in the metabolism of microorganisms. The effects in biological systems are produced by a relative movement between mobile ions or intracellular free electrons and the magnetic field, which can generate electric fields within a cell. Despite of the interaction mechanism to be yet unclear, is known also that the direct action of magnetism cause changes in the conformational shape of cell proteins, altering its functions. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate whether static magnetic field (SMF) could be applied to increasing ethanol yield by S. cerevisiae and verifying the biological effects on growth stimulation or inhibition. The influence of aerobic and anaerobic conditions and the ability of the cells to induce their defensive enzymes were also explored. Batch fermentations of S. cerevisiae were conducted for 26 h, in YPD medium, in hyperbaric bioreactor (Parr 4563, Parr Instruments, USA) with 5 NdFeB magnets, with an average flux of 120 mT (measured by a PHYWI <b>Teslameter,</b> USA). The magnets were enclosed into a transparent flat polyethylene case with 4. 0 x 3. 5 cm and 1. 3 cm width. All magnets were disposed with the same polarity, so when closed the case every one showed similar north or south poles at each face of the case. As they repelled each one, the magnets maintained the maximal distance between them, in an “X” disposition, with a magnet in the center. Controls were performed in the same manner without magnets. To investigate the effects of gas, aerobic and anaerobic conditions trials were performed under air (1 bar and 5 bar) and nitrogen (1 bar). An increase of the cell dry weight and specific growth rate, under aerobic conditions (5 bar of total air pressure), of approximately 2 -fold was obtained compared with the experiments exposed to nitrogen, for both magnetized and non-magnetized cultures. The cellular growth was not stimulated by the application of SMF. In fact, an improvement of 2 -fold in specific growth rate was obtained in the control group, for aerobic and anaerobic conditions. An increase of approximately 3 -fold in biomass yield was obtained in aerobic cultures compared with anaerobic. The biomass yield of exposed group to SMF was similar to non-exposed one under 5 bar of air pressure and in nitrogen cultures. On the other hand, a stimulation of ethanol production was obtained in magnetized cultures relatively to those of the controls, for both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Generally, antioxidant enzymes were induced by total air. An increase of the SOD specific activity in magnetized cultures was obtained compared with the control experiments. Also, the SMF exposed cultures reached the highest values of the catalase specific activity. However, SMF exposure led to a decrease in the glutathione reductase activity. The marker malondialdehyde (MDA) is certainly the most widely used to assess the lipid peroxidation processes. The use of anaerobic conditions resulted in a reduction of MDA levels, for both exposed and nonexposed groups. Generally, the MDA concentration was similar for both magnetized and nonmagnetized cultures. This work shows that magnetic fields can be applied as a controlling factor of S. cerevisiae fermentations for ethanol or enzymes production...|$|E
40|$|Vertical Hall sensors {{are capable}} of {{measuring}} surface-parallel components of the magnetic field. They allow therefore relatively easy conception of single-chip multi-axial magnetic sensors compared to solutions using horizontal Hall plates. The modern trend {{in the field of}} Hall sensors is to integrate them into electronic circuitry for signal processing. Before this thesis, highly sensitive vertical Hall sensors completely compatible to a technology adequate for co-integration of electronic circuitry were not available. This is the reason why we present in this thesis the developed knowledge that is necessary for the design and manufacture of highly sensitive vertical Hall sensors in CMOS technology. We first present the principles of the technology choice. A wide selection of CMOS processes is presently available, but in order to obtain optimal sensitivity we have to choose "the right" one. The performances can vary easily by 50 % from one technology to another. The best choice are CMOS high-voltage technologies since they deliver n-diffusion layers with relatively low doping level and deep junction depth. We present a novel layout of vertical Hall sensors that has six contacts in the active sensor zone and is a development of the known layout that uses only four contacts. The additional contacts improve the sensitivity and reduce the systematic offset considerably. If we re-use layouts that were optimal for not-CMOS compatible technologies, we will see that the results are not satisfying. We have to develop our specific design parameters that are optimal for the chosen technology. The key for high sensitivities is the strong miniaturization of the devices down to technological limits given by the design rules, but sometimes even beyond that. Some of the design rules can be broken with benefit for the obtained sensor devices. In general, minimum contact sizes and contact distances are preferable as well as a minimum sensor thickness. The difficulty is however to find the absolute minimum before device degradation or even failure will occur. Our optimized sensors achieved voltage related sensitivities of about 0. 04 V/(VT) and current related-sensitivities up to 400 V/(AT) that are comparable to existing CMOS compatible horizontal Hall plates. Such sensitivities were never reported for a standard CMOS process, without any additional pre- or post-processing steps. The miniaturization of the Hall devices has however also negative aspects e. g. an increase in sensor offset, noise and output non-linearity. Although Hall sensors have many advantages in comparison to other magnetic sensors (simple structure, low fabrication costs, very good linearity, robustness) they have the drawback of a big Abstract offset voltage that is often too big for many applications. This is why an enormous effort was made by researchers in the past to develop offset reduction methods for horizontal Hall plates. We state in this thesis that, in principle, the same techniques are applicable on vertical Hall sensors but for an optimal efficiency certain principles/parameters have to be respected. We reveal the relations of important parameters as the type of layout (number of sensor contacts), the use of single or coupled sensors, the type of spinning-current, bias level etc. In the optimal case we can obtain residual offset values lower than 200 μT for bias voltages up to 2 V. The spinning current method was originally developed for offset compensation, but it has other beneficial influences on the sensor output signal as well. It is capable to remove a large amount of flicker noise if the spinning is executes at adequately high clock frequencies. We show that the efficiency of flicker noise removal is dependent on the bias current through the sensor. We discovered another positive side effect of the spinning-current method: the elimination of the planar Hall effect. While the planar Hall sensitivity for our sensors is initially about 1 % of the normal one at B = 2 T, we obtain with the compensation technique values of only 0. 02 %. After the presentation of general characteristics of the separate sensors, we present two microsystems based on the developed vertical Hall sensors. At first, we present a 2 D magnetic microsystem which is well adapted for the construction of contactless angular encoders with a measurement range of 360 °. We profit here especially from the very low offset (< 400 μT) obtained with the spinning current method, since offset is in general the main source of angular errors in such systems. Existing angular measurement systems need in general a special (offset) calibration of the sensor unit in order to achieve an accuracy of 2. 5 ‰ full scale. We obtain such a precision directly with our system for a wide temperature range from - 30 to 100 °C. With one specific sensor calibration for the compensation of residual offset, sensitivity mismatch and phase mismatch of the two axes, we attain a precision of about 0. 5 ‰ FS over the same temperature range, a performance never before reported with a magnetic sensor system. The microsystem is therefore an excellent candidate for the majority of low-cost angular measurement applications. As a second example we presented the first fully CMOS integrated three-dimensional Hall probe, consisting of a combination of one Hall plate and four vertical Hall devices. The microsystem allows an application as a universal magnetic field probe in the wide field range from 0. 1 mT to 20 T. The probe can be easily used for small volumes because of its small size {{and the fact that the}} signal processing circuitry already is directly integrated onto the chip. The precision as a 3 D magnetometer is limited by the sensitivity mismatch of about 5 % FS. The probe is an ideal candidate for low-cost <b>teslameter</b> applications with limited precision...|$|E
