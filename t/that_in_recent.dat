Other breeds were later added, and in 1886 a foal named Black Allan, now considered the foundation sire of the breed, was born. In 1935 the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' Association was formed, and the studbook closed in 1947. In 1939, the first Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration was held, an annual event <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years has attracted considerable attention and controversy.|$|E
5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue to have a high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E

Other wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson note <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years overproduction has introduced a lot of variable quality with some Sancerre blancs producing flavor profiles that are not that much different from generic Sauvignon de Touraine from the Middle Loire, though this varies depending on the producer and overall quality of the vintage.|$|E

25|$|In Bangladesh, poor {{socioeconomic}} {{position was}} associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits. As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living {{in the developing world}} live in countries that produce food surpluses. The economist Amartya Sen observed <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and famine were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.|$|E
25|$|Acts of {{violence}} involving Sunni Muslims and their Shia counterparts in Pakistan have been evident since the 1980s. They are {{generally considered to}} have arisen from attempts by the then national leader, Zia ul-Haq, to legitimise his military dictatorship and from the influx of weapons into the country following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Although the perpetrators often do not claim responsibility for the attacks, expert analysis suggests <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> times it is the Sunnis who are dominating the aggression {{and that they are}} motivated by the ideology of Al-Qaeda. The number of violent incidents has been increasing in recent years, although not all of them are classified by the police as being sectarian attacks.|$|E
25|$|A tape ball is {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in {{electrical}} tape and is used in playing street cricket. This modification of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play with than the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket has transformed the way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of tape ball <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years some companies have introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls.

He said that Islam is the current fastest growing religion in the world and has a major role and contribution to mankind and civilization. The core value of Islam is {{that there is only one}} God, people should do good deeds and people should love their fellow men and citizens. He personally believes that Taiwanese Muslims must emphasize the principle of Islam that stresses peace and love in order to enable others to understand the true nature of Islam. He further added <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years, Taiwan has made significant progress in expanding affairs with the Muslim world, creating a win-win situation for all parties involved and also triggering more interest in Islam among Taiwanese people. Although there are only around 60,000 Taiwanese Muslims, this community has made Taiwan becomes more diverse and richer in culture. He assured to the local Muslims that the Muslim people in Taiwan will always enjoy religious freedom and that the government will pay close attention to any raising needs to the group. He also hoped that Taiwanese Muslims will participate in Islamic-related international affairs and play even more role in helping Taiwan solidifies itself with the Islamic nations.|$|E

In view of these facts, the Safety Board believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.|$|E
500|$|Most historians today, {{including}} John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, {{argue that}} John was an unsuccessful monarch, but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers.

John Gillingham, {{author of a}} major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren, and describes him [...] "one of the worst kings ever to rule England". Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.
