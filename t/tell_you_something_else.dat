5000|$|Chávez's {{connection}} to Marxism was a complex one, {{though he had}} {{described himself as a}} Marxist on some occasions. In May 1996, he gave an interview with Agustín Blanco Muñoz in which he remarked that [...] "I am not a Marxist, but I am not anti-Marxist. I am not communist, but I am not anti-communist." [...] In a 2009 speech to the national assembly, he said: [...] "I am a Marxist to the same degree as the followers of the ideas of Jesus Christ and the liberator of America, Simon Bolivar." [...] He was well versed in many Marxist texts, having read the works of many Marxist theoreticians, and often publicly quoted them. Various international Marxists supported his government, believing it to be a sign of proletariat revolution as predicted in Marxist theory. In 2010, Hugo Chávez proclaimed support for the ideas of Marxist Leon Trotsky, saying [...] "When I called him (former Minister of Labour, José Ramón Rivero)" [...] Chávez explained, [...] "he said to me: 'President I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> before someone <b>else</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> ... I am a Trotskyist', and I said, 'well, what is the problem? I am also a Trotskyist! I follow Trotsky's line, that of permanent revolution," [...] and then cited Marx and Lenin.|$|R

I exhausted Spring and Morning and Snow and Memory, and the whole range of mythological topics, and then I had my knack lying idle. I observed that there was one subject that the other poets found inexhaustible, but somehow I felt myself disqualified for treating it. How could I sing of Love when I had never been in love? For I didn't count those youthful affairs when I was only in the Third Reader and {{the first part of the}} Arithmetic. I went about trying to be in love, as a matter of business; but I couldn't manage it. Suddenly it managed itself; and then I found myself worse disqualified than ever. I didn't want to mention it; either to myself or to her, much less to the world at large. It seemed a little too personal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it wasn't that way," [...] {{said the}} boy earnestly. [...] "And I want to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> that's just makin' me sick, Mr. Hamlin. You know I told you William Henry lives {{down at the bottom}} of Burroughs's garden, and how I showed Mrs. Burroughs his tricks! Well, only two days ago I was down there looking for him, and couldn't find him anywhere. There's a sort of narrow trail from the garden to the hill, a short cut up to the Ridge, instead o' going by their gate. It's just the trail any one would take in a hurry, or if they didn't want to be seen from the road. Well! I was looking this way and that for William Henry, and whistlin' for him, when I slipped on to the trail. There, in the middle of it, was an old bucket turned upside down--just the thing a man would kick away or a woman lift up. Well, Mr. Hamlin, I kicked it away, and"--the boy stopped, with rounded eyes and bated breath, and added--"I just had time to give one jump and save myself! For under that pail, cramped down so he couldn't get out, and just bilin' over with rage, and chockful of pizen, was William Henry! If it had been anybody else less spry, they'd have got bitten,--and that's just what the sneak who put it there knew." ...|$|E
