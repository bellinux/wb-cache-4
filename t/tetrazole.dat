40|$|In {{the last}} decades, the {{chemistry}} of <b>tetrazoles</b> underwent a great expansion, which was closely connected with their usage as an isosteric replacement of carboxylic acid moiety in the molecules of potential or clinically used drugs. In this work, existing methods of the preparation of 5 -substituted <b>tetrazoles</b> were modified by utilising microwave irradiation and by changing the reaction conditions and the reaction medium. First, Sharpless synthesis, consisting in the conversion of nitriles into 5 -substituted <b>tetrazoles</b> via the reaction of sodium azide and zinc halide in boiling water, was modified. The application of the microwave irradiation decreased reaction time while maintaining high yields of products. Furthermore, a new method for the preparation of 5 -substituted <b>tetrazoles</b> was developed, based on the reaction of nitrile with sodium azide and triethylammonium chloride in the polar aromatic solvents under microwave irradiation. By this method, 5 -substituted <b>tetrazoles</b> were prepared in high yields in short reaction times from nitriles, including those that react poorly using common methods.

40|$|<b>Tetrazoles</b> {{exhibit a}} very rich photochemistry, {{strongly}} influenced {{by the nature of}} substituents in the tetrazolic ring. Photolysis of representative <b>tetrazoles</b> trapped in a rigid environment of solidified noble gases at cryogenic temperatures (usually argon at 10 – 15 K) results in photofragmentation of the monomeric species {{with a wide range of}} exit channels. Since the obtained fragments are generally confined to the matrix cage where they are formed, no subsequent cross-reactions involving species resulting from photolysis can occur, strongly reducing the number of possible photoproducts in comparison with gas phase or solution studies. These conditions introduce a useful simplification for the interpretation of the reaction mechanisms and enable spectroscopic characterization of novel and/or highly reactive molecules. In this review, we provide an updated report on the photolysis of matrix-isolated <b>tetrazoles,</b> focusing on the scope and usefulness of this methodology for generation of rare molecules and investigation of photocleavage pathways.
