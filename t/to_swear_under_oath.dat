2500|$|On 9 August D'Aranda sailed for Rio de Janeiro, with Killwick still restrained, {{and bearing}} a {{dispatch}} explaining the situation from Greene to Rear-Admiral Manley Dixon in [...] Nancy arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 26 August. The Royal Navy, always {{concerned about the}} possibility of mutiny, had a formal procedure for the removal of commanding officers for insanity. Admiral Dixon came on board Nancy, together with the chief and assistant surgeons from Montagu, and they examined Killwick. Then Dixon, the surgeons, D'Aranda, and Nancys Assistant Surgeon all signed a Survey, a document attesting to their willingness <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that they had impartially assessed Killwick and found him unfit to command. Killwick then was taken to Montagu. The next month Dixon sent Killwick aboard a merchant vessel bound for London, together with two marines from Nancy to take care of him. Dixon then confirmed D'Aranda as Nancys captain.|$|E
50|$|Before the Democrats {{lost control}} of the House of Representatives in 1995, Waxman was a {{powerful}} figure in the House as chair of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment from 1979. In this role he conducted investigations into a range of health and environmental issues, including universal health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid coverage, AIDS and air and water pollution. In 1994, Waxman forced the chief executives of the seven major tobacco companies <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that nicotine was not addictive.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{enforcement}} of the measures demanded by the decretal, Lucius obligated all patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops to re-announce the excommunication on certain feasts and holidays. Those who did not observe this for three years consecutively would be deprived of their ecclesiastical offices. The bishops were furthermore obligated to [...] "seek out" [...] heretics. They were to make bi- or triannual rounds of their dioceses, visiting locations of suspicion and questioning the people about the existence of heresy. The people would be required <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> (compurgation) anything they knew about heretical activity. All oath-breakers were to be treated as heretics.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Britain {{experienced}} increased hostilities with Spain, which {{added to}} the anti-Catholic and anti-Spanish feelings by the authorities. In 1691 the British Crown ordered all New York officials <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>oaths</b> <b>under</b> the Test Act. These oaths consisted {{of a series of}} declarations against the authority of the Catholic Church and its religious practices. All potential officeholders were obliged <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> that they had not received privilege from the Pope. As tensions between England and Spain escalated, the Test Act was determined to be too lenient for Catholics. By 1700 the New York anti-priest law utterly outlawed the presence of Catholic priests under penalty of life imprisonment.|$|R
5000|$|At a HUAC {{hearing in}} April 1951, actor Marc Lawrence named Stander {{as a member}} of his Hollywood Communist [...] "cell", along with screenwriter Lester Cole and screenwriter Gordon Kahn. Lawrence testified that Stander [...] "was the guy who {{introduced}} me to the party line", and that Stander said that by joining the CP, he'd [...] "get to know the dames more"—which Lawrence, who didn't enjoy film-star looks, thought a good idea. Upon hearing of this, Stander shot off a telegram to HUAC chair John S. Wood, calling Lawrence's testimony that he was a Communist [...] "ridiculous" [...] and asking to appear before the Committee, so he could <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> that <b>under</b> <b>oath.</b> The telegram concluded: [...] "I respectfully request an opportunity to appear before you at your earliest possible convenience. Be assured of my cooperation." [...] Two days later, Stander sued Lawrence for $500,000 for slander. Lawrence left the country ("fled", according to Stander) for Europe.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, an Internal Revenue Service {{investigation}} into Grant's ministry resulted in Grant's imprisonment for tax evasion. He {{was found guilty}} of failing to report $375,000 in taxable income in the purchase of two homes, including his $1 million residence. An undercover video tape was alleged to show Grant admitting that he used $100,000 in 1988 from church members as {{a down payment on a}} $1.2 million home overlooking a Desoto, Texas, country club and not reporting it as income. Judge Joe Kendall criticized Grant for attempting to withdraw his plea, asking Grant, [...] "Did you watch the same videotape I watched?" [...] He continued, [...] "He's all over it admitting he's guilty. He <b>swore</b> <b>to</b> God <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> he is guilty". The judge sentenced Grant to 16 months in prison and a $30,000 fine, to be paid after his release, when he would also serve an additional year of probation. Kendall also ordered Grant to [...] "perform 100 hours of community service, publish details of his arrest and sentence for everyone on his mailing list and provide complete, continuing financial reports to the court." ...|$|R
5000|$|As a {{solution}} to the problem of the illegal voters, the Republicans proposed {{a solution}} of [...] "proportional reduction". Republicans claimed that it should be assumed that illegal votes were cast in the same percentages as other votes in the same precinct. For example, in a precinct where Gregoire won 60% of the vote, it would have been assumed that she received 60% of the illegal vote as well, and those votes would be subtracted from her total for the precinct. The Democrats countered that the Republicans' proposal was statistically invalid, an example of the ecological fallacy, and the best solution would be to call each of the felons into court and ask them <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> which political candidate they voted for, after which time their vote would be removed from the total.|$|E
5000|$|The Second Circuit {{held that}} the news {{accounts}} of the arrest did not become false and defamatory after the arrest was erased, so the articles could remain online and defendants did not owe damages.According to the court, Martin [...] "misunderstood {{the effect of the}} Erasure Statute",which were intended to affect legal status but [...] "cannot undo historical facts";for example, the statute [...] "bars the government from relying on erased record in a later trial"and [...] "entitles a defendant <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that he has never been arrested."But [...] "the reports of Martin's arrest were true at the time they were published," [...] and [...] "neither the Erasure Statute nor any amount of wishing can undo that historical truth."Judge Wesley, who authored the opinion, cited the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám: [...] "the Moving Finger has written and moved on." ...|$|E
5000|$|Southwell, who {{was arrested}} in 1592, was accused at his trial of having told a witness that {{even if she was}} forced by the {{authorities}} <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath,</b> it was permissible to lie to conceal the whereabouts of a priest. Southwell replied that that was not what he had said. He had said that [...] "to an oath were required justice, judgement and truth", but the rest of his answer goes unrecorded because one of the judges angrily shouted him down. Convicted in 1595, Southwell was hanged, drawn and quartered. More famous in his own era was Henry Garnet, who wrote a defense of Southwell in 1598; Garnet was captured by the authorities in 1606 due to his alleged involvement in the Gunpowder Plot. Facing the same accusations as Southwell, his attempts to defend himself met with no better result: later that year Garnet was executed in the same fashion.|$|E
50|$|Some {{alleged that}} Clarke had {{published}} {{the book to}} win a spot in a possible John Kerry administration. Clarke responded by <b>swearing</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> {{that he did not}} want another job in the government and would not accept one.|$|R
50|$|James Baker <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> {{that he had}} {{received}} the briefing book from William Casey, Reagan's campaign manager, but Casey vehemently denied this. The matter was never resolved as both the FBI and a congressional subcommittee failed to determine how or through whom the briefing book came to the Reagan campaign.|$|R
50|$|O'Dea <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> an {{affidavit}} {{that he had}} not made this remark. He later retracted this denial after a tape recording of the interview emerged. Damages were paid to Quinlivan by O'Dea following a High Court defamation challenge by Maurice Quinlivan in December 2009. O'Dea apologised for the remarks in court on 21 December.|$|R

5000|$|John {{soon found}} that he was unable to control the {{powerful}} Roman nobility as his father had so effortlessly done. At around the same time, Berengar II, King of Italy, began to attack the territory of the pope. In order to protect himself against political intrigues in Rome and the power of Berengar II, in 960 John sent papal legates to the King of Germany Otto I, who had previously been granted the rank of Patrician, asking for his aid. Agreeing to John’s invitation, Otto entered Italy in 961. Berengar quickly retreated to his strongholds, and Otto proceeded to enter Rome on 31 January 962. There he met with John and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that he would do everything to defend the pope: [...] "To thee, the Lord Pope John, I, King Otto, promise and swear, by the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, by the wood of the life-giving cross, and by these relics of the saints, that, if by the will of God I come to Rome, I will exalt {{to the best of my}} ability the Holy Roman Church and you its ruler; and never with my will or at my instigation shall you lose life or limb or the honour which you possess. And without your consent never, within the city of Rome, will I hold a placitum (plea) or make any regulation which affects you or the Romans. Whatever territory of St. Peter comes within my grasp, I will give up to you. And to whomsoever I shall entrust the kingdom of Italy, I will make him swear to help you as far as he can to defend the lands of St. Peter." ...|$|E
5000|$|Further court {{testimony}} {{alleged that}} Ford {{knew about the}} contents of the Independent in advance of publication. Investigative journalist Max Wallace noted that [...] "whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when James M. Miller, a former Dearborn Independent employee, <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that Ford had told him he intended to expose Sapiro." ...|$|R
25|$|For his {{position}} with the Office of Price Administration, Remington was required to undergo a loyalty-security check, which began in 1941. He admitted having been active in Communist-allied {{groups such as the}} American Peace Mobilization, but denied any sympathy with communism and <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that he was not and had never {{been a member of the}} Communist Party. His leftist affiliations raised concerns, but the investigation was superficial and his security clearance was approved.|$|R
5000|$|The {{commission}} {{is also the}} first to probe into the much publicized Soviet-connection. The basics of which are that Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose did indeed survive {{the end of the}} Second World War, and detained in a Siberian prison in the late 1950s. A former Russian General <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the commission, that he had seen a true Soviet-cabinet paper detailing and discussing a [...] "living" [...] Subhas Chandra Bose, one year after his supposed death.|$|R
5000|$|The {{occupational}} {{relationship to}} the Soviet news agency kept Todd under close government scrutiny, culminating in a subpoena to appear before a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on April 17, 1956. In his testimony Todd <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> {{that he had never}} {{been a member of the}} Communist Party at any time in his life. Moreover, Todd swore that he had [...] "never attended any Communist meeting in my life, to the best of my knowledge." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{person who}} alleges an offence, {{generally}} the police, <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> the facts supporting the charge. A Justice of the Peace {{at that point}} shall issue an Information. This is a document which contains the specific allegations. Under a private prosecution a hearing may be held and the Attorney General of the province in which the proceedings are taking place may intervene. Private prosecutions in Canada are usually restricted to regulatory offences such as practicing law without a licence and cruelty to animals.|$|R
50|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} began investigating possible illegal fund-raising by the Nixon {{re-election campaign}} in 1973 {{as part of}} the Watergate scandal. Cook was called before a grand jury to testify about the Vesco donations on April 19, 1973, and again on May 3 and May 7, 1973. He also testified before a Senate committee on May 1 and May 14, and before a House committee on May 22. During this testimony, Cook <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that he had never discussed the Vesco case with Stans until after the case was filed on November 27, 1972.|$|R
50|$|Quinlivan {{responded by}} {{launching}} a High Court defamation challenge against O'Dea. As {{part of his}} defence O'Dea <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> an affidavit {{that he had not}} made this remark. He was forced to retract his denial after the release of a recording of the conversation in which the allegations were made by O'Dea. The case was subsequently settled out of court with O'Dea paying an undisclosed sum in damages and apologising for the remarks. However O'Dea was forced to resign as Minister for Defence over accusations that he had committed perjury.|$|R
2500|$|Sharjah was {{the centre}} of Sir Paul Condon’s {{investigations}} into corruption in cricket. Although the report did not conclusively single out the venue much controversy raged. BBC Cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said in 2001 : “Sharjah has been pinpointed as being {{the centre of}} this activity [...] and, again, this is entirely plausible. I would <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> {{that two of the}} dozen or so matches I have witnessed on that desert ground over the years were fixed”. On the other hand Sharjah tournament organiser, and former Pakistan cricketer, Asif Iqbal denied this strongly:”To my mind, all the matches in Sharjah were fair and honest cricketing encounters”.|$|R

The word Černý translates as [...] "debauched" [...] does not necessarily imply mutual consent, so it is ambiguous whether or not Paneb and Aapehty's actions {{could be classified as}} rape.

50|$|Shortly afterwards, The Times ran {{an article}} {{claiming}} that the bust {{was the work of}} Lucas, having been commissioned to produce it from a painting. Lucas's son, Albert, then came forward and <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that the story was correct and that he had helped his father to make it. Albert was able to explain how the layers of wax had been built up from old candle ends; he also described how his father would stuff various debris, including newspapers, inside the bust.

50|$|The {{rule of the}} Rusca ended 1503, {{when the}} Confederates {{occupied}} Locarno, but failed to conquer the Visconti castle. After the battle of Novara in 1513, the French King Louis XII gave the Confederates the castle. In the Treaty of Freiburg in 1516, they received all of Locarno. The Twelve Cantons took turns appointing a governor (commissario), to rule over Locarno. The governor had both civil and criminal jurisdiction, except in certain cases after 1578, where seven judges were elected by the locals to try the cases. On taking office, the Governor <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> obey the statutes of Locarno. The Governor {{was supported by a}} local mayor, and criminal fines were usually given to local community.|$|R
50|$|José Balta {{returned}} to Peru in 1867 and led a movement against the Prado in Chiclayo, which was echoed in Arequipa, where he rose with General Pedro Diez Canseco. Both refused <b>to</b> <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> the new Constitution of 1860, which was proclaimed in force.|$|R
5|$|The {{election}} was {{opposed by the}} Cistercian monasteries of Yorkshire, and by the archdeacons of York. The Cistercians opposed {{on the grounds that}} the Second Lateran Council in 1139 had given the religious houses of a diocese the right to participate in the election of the bishop. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to recognise William's election due to allegations of simony, or the acquisition of church positions by bribery, and of interference by King Stephen. In 1143, Pope Innocent II ruled that William could be confirmed in office if he <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that the allegations were false. After he swore the oath, Henry of Blois, who was also papal legate, found William innocent, and he was consecrated as archbishop on 26 September 1143.|$|R
500|$|Stevenson <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that Breckinridge had {{no part in}} {{composing}} the [...] "True American" [...] article. Breckinridge publicly {{stated that}} Bradford's brother, Charles, had shown him {{a draft of the}} [...] "True American" [...] editorial prior to its publication and asked his opinion of it; Breckinridge advised him not to publish it, and Bradford temporarily obliged. An illness, Breckinridge said, had confined him to his home {{at the time of the}} editorial's publication, and he was not aware that the Independent Gazetteer had printed it until he attended the court at Frankfort days later; he immediately returned home and composed his rebuttal. In light of this evidence, few still maintained the credibility of the reports in the Kentucky Gazette by the time of the election. Every Kentucky elector voted for both Jefferson and Clinton.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} 19th century the Irish Tithe Composition Act {{permitted}} Protestant clergy to determine fixed payments {{in order to}} provide support for them and their families. there was great opposition from the mainly Catholic community to paying tithes. Young men formed organisation such as the Steelboys and Whiteboys who persuaded people not to pay tithes. They visited people's homes at night and had them <b>swear</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> that effect. They gathered in the surrounding hills at night and sounded horns in defiance. A particular O'Donnell man stood up to them saying that he intended to make his tenants pay their tithes and in 1837 five men broke into his house and threatened that if he attempted to pay any tithes his home and ditches would be levelled. The people gathered on the hills surrounding his house each night sounding horns.|$|R
2500|$|A libel {{lawsuit was}} brought by San Francisco lawyer and Jewish farm {{cooperative}} organizer Aaron Sapiro {{in response to}} the antisemitic remarks, and led Ford to close the Independent in December 1927.

During the trial, the editor of Ford's [...] "Own Page," [...] William Cameron, testified that Ford {{had nothing to do with}} the editorials even though they were under his byline. Cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to Ford for his approval.

50|$|In {{the first}} months of 1096, Henry and his cousin Raymond of Burgundy, husband of Queen Urraca, reached an {{agreement}} whereby each <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> that Raymond would give Henry the kingdom of Toledo and one-third of the royal treasury after King Alfonso's death and, if that was not possible, Henry would receive the kingdom of Galicia, while Henry, in turn, promised to support his cousin Raymond in securing all of the king's dominions and two-thirds of the treasury. King Alfonso, however, after becoming aware of this covenant, appointed Henry governor of all the land between the Minho River and Santarém, governed until then by Raymond, thereby limiting his son-in-law's government to Galicia. The two cousins then, instead of being allies, became rivals, each vying to obtain the king's favor. Upon the death of King Alfonso, Henry and Teresa continued governing these lands south of the Minho, and later, in December 1111 under the reign of Queen Urraca, were also governing Zamora.|$|R
50|$|The {{contents}} of the report, in particular Leuchter's methodology, are heavily criticised. James Roth, {{the manager of the}} lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, <b>swore</b> <b>under</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand. He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometres, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample. A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analysing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.|$|R
