These two financial strategies are shown to extend the ability of the farm operator to manage downside risk beyond the singular effects of a diversified farm plan. The analysis indicates that a trade-off occurs between these strategies, but that the reduction of debt has a greater impact on the distributions of net cash flow (before <b>taxes)</b> and <b>outstanding</b> term debt.

50|$|A tax exile is {{a person}} who leaves a country to avoid the payment of income tax or other taxes. It {{is a person}} who already owes money to the tax {{authorities}} or wishes to avoid being liable in the future to taxation at what he or she considers high tax rates, instead choosing to reside in a foreign country or jurisdiction which has no taxes or lower tax rates. In general, there is no extradition agreement between countries which covers extradition for <b>outstanding</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities. Going into tax exile is a form of tax mitigation or avoidance. A tax exile normally cannot return to their home country without being subject to <b>outstanding</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities, which may prevent them from leaving the country until they have been paid.|$|R

[...] The Social Democrats' failure reflected the party's inability to adapt, an increasingly technocratic profile, a failure to address immigration concerns, as well as Reinfeldt's success in managing the economy. The results draws parallels with a larger decline of European left parties. An article in Al Jazeera English asked if Western political dynamics were changing following the Swedish and United States elections. The article said that predictions after the election indicated [...] "an entirely new political landscape" [...] and [...] "the beginning of an era of sharper political division in Sweden." [...] It asked if the similar results [...] "reflect rather an underlying continuity in the generation-long evolution of Euro-American politics towards a fully neoliberalised system" [...] and that Sweden seemed to be [...] "moving towards an outdated model." [...] It also said that, while social policies were simarly moving to the right, economic policies were poles apart, with the emergence of far-right parties in Sweden and Denmark still supporting the welfare state and the American parties remaining on the economic right-wing.|$|R

The expectation that these future deficits {{would be at least}} partially financed by seigniorage revenues or an inflation <b>tax</b> on <b>outstanding</b> nominal debt led to a collapse of the fixed exchange rate regimes in Asia. We articulate this view using a simple model whose key feature is that a speculative attack is inevitable once the present value of future government deficits rises.
