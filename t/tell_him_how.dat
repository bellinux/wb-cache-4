Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to find the creature that attacked him.|$|E

He calls Cook to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with {{having sex with a}} girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship.

25|$|Seeing {{how fast}} the dragons can grow after feeding them a chunk of pizza, the {{children}} all drive to the beach {{in order to get}} the giants back to land so they can kill the dragons. The three nixies eventually agree to use their singing to lure the giants, and one of them is taken to the water with Nick and Jared in a surfboard (because since nixies are used to freshwater, salt water hurts their skin). Before they can accomplish this, however, Nick is taken underwater by the merfolk, who <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> they're glad that the land-dwellers are doomed and give him a magical cap in the process that allows him to breathe underwater. The nixies manage to get some of the giants to follow them to land, where they immediately start eating the small reptiles and fighting each other again. As the children drive away from the giants, their car falls into a sinkhole and only after some time do they manage to get out. A giant then attacks them, being saved by the showing up of Jack Junior, who suddenly decided to listen to his father and come help the children kill the giants (being surprised when they reveal him that killing giants is no longer their plan).|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. Feeling her anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus invited Brett Ratner, {{director}} of the [...] "7 Things" [...] music video, to her home to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much the song meant to her {{and what it was}} about. After proposing numerous ideas to each other, they decided to make the video [...] "simple with a white backdrop". Cyrus said that neither she nor Ratner wanted the video to be [...] "all about [...] " [...] because the song's message was universal; [...] "almost every girl in America could say they hate their ex or current boyfriend," [...] claimed Cyrus. As a result, the video features numerous adolescent girls including actresses Nicola Peltz, Liana Liberato, and Maiara Walsh. During the planning session, Cyrus showed Ratner a collection of personal items her ex had given her, such as photographs and his dirty socks, which she had stowed away beneath her bed. They decided to include some of these items as props in the music video. For example, the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex-boyfriend's medical identification tag, which he received because of his diabetes mellitus.|$|E
500|$|Media {{and public}} opinion was more hostile. The Sydney Morning Herald ran the {{headline}} [...] "Baggy Green Shame" [...] while The Australian wrote of the [...] "$11,000 price of disgrace". Many newspaper columns and {{letters to the editor}} attacked the players. The editorial of The Australian stated that [...] "Waugh and Warne said yesterday they had been naïve and stupid. Put the emphasis on the second adjective—and add greedy." [...] Readers called for the players to be banned from playing for Australia as well as the sacking of the ACB officials who had kept the matter secret; some said that the players should never be appointed to leadership roles in the cricket community. In the Weekend Australian of 12 December, Warwick Hadfield and Brian Woodley editorialised that [...] "Warne is in need of some good advice, but not from business managers and PR folk too happy to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> wonderful he is in order to flog a few more videos, books, pairs of duds, sports shoes or anti-smoking ads". Warne's major sponsors reviewed their partnerships with him, and three newspapers, the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom, The Age of Melbourne and the Sydney Morning Herald severed their ties with him.|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

Audrey becomes jealous when she tries to book Lewis herself and he explains someone has already hired him. Audrey attends the ball with a friend and is shocked to see Rita with Lewis. The two woman insult each other and Lewis and Rita leave. Susan Hill, writing for the Daily Star said that despite Lewis' apology for attending an event with Rita, Audrey is furious and confronts her friend. Rita tells Audrey she is [...] "acting like an old fool as Lewis can never be hers" [...] and Audrey slaps Rita across the face. Of Lewis' view of the situation, Havers commented, [...] "I think Lewis is genuinely concerned about Audrey. When Rita gets involved, he has to box clever, but he's very good at that." [...] Audrey decides to stop all contact with Lewis after realising she has {{fallen in love with}} him. Audrey's decision is prompted by her falling out with Rita and the fact she has read Lewis' diary, which contains details about his clients. Not wanting to get hurt by him, Audrey tells Lewis that she wants end their arrangement. Lewis is shocked and cannot understand why Audrey would want to stop seeing him. A show spokesperson commented, [...] "In the end she has to come clean and <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> she really feels – which prompts Lewis to kiss her. He then tells her he's developed feelings for her too." [...] Audrey is shocked by the kiss and Lewis' declaration of love.|$|E
500|$|Deprived of {{political}} power, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write {{and work on}} physics. He toured Europe and Japan, giving talks {{about the history of}} science, the role of science in society, {{and the nature of the}} universe. In September 1957, France made him an Officer of the Legion of Honor, and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in Britain. At the urging of many of Oppenheimer's political friends who had ascended to power, President John F. Kennedy awarded Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award in 1963 as a gesture {{of political}} rehabilitation. Edward Teller, the winner of the previous year's award, had also recommended Oppenheimer receive it, in the hope that it would heal the rift between them. A little over a week after Kennedy's assassination, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, presented Oppenheimer with the award, [...] "for contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, and for leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years". Oppenheimer told Johnson: [...] "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make this award today." [...] The rehabilitation implied by the award was partly symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free stipend, and its award outraged many prominent Republicans in Congress. The late President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, still living in the White House, made it a point to meet with Oppenheimer to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> much her husband had wanted him to have the medal. While still a senator in 1959, Kennedy had been instrumental in voting to narrowly deny Oppenheimer's enemy Lewis Strauss a coveted government position as Secretary of Commerce, effectively ending Strauss' political career. This was partly due to lobbying by the scientific community on behalf of Oppenheimer.|$|E
500|$|Although the team's {{prominent}} appearances are on {{the television}} series, there have been additional media appearances based around marketing tie-ins. In early 2007, Oliver Queen received a personal treatment with a promotional tie-in with Sprint, titled Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles. The series looked at the origins of Oliver's alternate identity. On April 19, 2007, a tie-in with Toyota promoting their new Yaris featured an online comic strip as interstitial programs during new episodes of Smallville—titled Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom. The interactive comic {{was based on the}} episode [...] "Justice", and picks up after the events of that episode, following Oliver, Bart, Victor and Arthur, as they seek to destroy all of LuthorCorp's secret experimental labs. The team eventually uncovers a prototype soldier LuthorCorp is working on, that combines the superpowers of various kryptonite enhanced individuals and places them into a single soldier. The online comic then directly ties-into the television series when Oliver and his team, off-screen, contact Clark in the episode Prototype, and <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> to defeat one of these soldiers. The online series allowed viewers to investigate alongside the fictional team in an effort to win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five episodes, while working with a team of artists for the illustrations. The plot for each comic episode would be given to Nilson {{at the same time the}} production crew for Smallville was filming their current television episode. Artist Steve Scott would draw comic book panels, which would be sent to a group called Motherland. That group would review the drawings and tell Scott which images to draw on a separate overlay. This allowed for multiple objects to be moved in and out of the same frame. Before and after the first appearance of the League on Smallville, there were talks among studio heads about spinning off individual characters, or the entire team, into their own television shows, but nothing came to fruition. Smallville is the first series—television or film—to feature live-action portrayals of Aquaman, Green Arrow, and Cyborg.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} summary {{synopsis of}} the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states, [...] "A poor widow who supports her two children, one a baby and the other girl of six, by scrubbing, weakens under her hard work, and finally dies. Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls {{on one of her}} mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one [...] One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> <b>how</b> they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry. The result is that there is now a 'scrub woman' whose duties are a sinecure although the wages are high, {{and the future of the}} 'little mother' and her baby are assured." ...|$|E
