5|$|The two {{subspecies}} {{are similar}} in coloration, but differ in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap. The northern subspecies, living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern subspecies, which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama. The southern subspecies also has more yellowish limbs and underparts.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also used}} for tooth whitening. It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. Hydrogen peroxide has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tooth can indeed become lighter. Hydrogen peroxide can be mixed with baking soda and salt to make a home-made toothpaste.|$|E

25|$|Ma'alim fi al-Tariq marked <b>the</b> {{culmination}} <b>of</b> Qutb's {{evolution from}} modernist author and critic, to Islamist activist and writer, {{and finally to}} Islamist revolutionary and theoretician. It was written in prison, where Qutb spent 10 years under charges of political conspiracy against Egypt's Nasser regime, and first published in 1964. Four of its thirteen chapters were originally written for Qutb's voluminous Quranic commentary, Fi Zilal al-Qur'an (In <b>the</b> <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur'an).|$|R
25|$|Qutb's written {{works are}} still widely {{available}} {{and have been}} translated into many Western languages. His best known work is Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq (Milestones), {{but the majority of}} Qutb's theory can be found in his Qur'anic commentary Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran). This 30-volume work is noteworthy for its innovative method of interpretation, borrowing heavily from the literary analysis of Amin al-Khuli, while retaining some structural features of classical commentaries (for example, the practice of progressing from the first sura to the last). For Qutb, the Qur'an was seen as the final arbiter in all matters relating to faith, while his main goal in writing the book, In <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Qur’an, was to restore the centrality of faith in the consciousness and imagination of Muslims, and to kindle a cognitive revolution that would bring about a political and social process that will lead to the renewal of the Islamic tradition.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation {{and fruit}} picking by hand is {{labour-intensive}} and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha.

25|$|Qutb's {{career as}} a writer also heavily {{influenced}} his philosophy. In al-Taswiir al-Fanni fil-Quran (Artistic Representation in the Qur'an), Qutb developed a literary appreciation of the Qur'an and a complementary methodology for interpreting the text. His hermeneutics were applied in his extensive commentary on the Qur'an, Fi zilal al-Qur'an (In <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quran), which served {{as the foundation for}} the declarations of Ma'alim fi-l-Tariq.|$|E

These works represent the final form of Qutb's thought, encompassing his radically anti-secular and anti-Western claims based on his interpretations of the Qur'an, Islamic history, and {{the social and political}} problems of Egypt. The school of thought he inspired has become known as Qutbism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{a person}} watches {{different}} marrow-cell images {{he or she}} can identify every type of cells easily. In this process, human’s visual system has ability to adapt <b>the</b> different <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> color marrow cells images. We propose a segmentation method for marrow-cell images based on fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). Firstly, <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> cluster is calculated out using <b>the</b> <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R-matrix <b>of</b> a RGB formatted marrow cells image. Secondly, the fuzzy c-means clustering method is done on the R-matrix. Finally, <b>the</b> pixel <b>of</b> G-matrix and B-matrix are divided into some clusters by “one to one correspondence ” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> pixels that belong to R-matrix, G-matrix or B-matrix. This paper’s contribution could be summarized into three points: 1) a frame work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuzzy c-means clustering for marrow-cell images segmentation is proposed. 2) Using FCM and <b>the</b> R-matrix component <b>of</b> a RGB formatted marrow-cell images to generate <b>the</b> count <b>of</b> clustering. 3) This method could adaption different <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> different marrow-cell images...|$|R

The newspapers reported 130 Dungarees arriving in Goodna, but as Lieutenant Binnie pointed out, there were often discrepancies in the numbers.

25|$|Dol Guldur is {{depicted}} in Peter Jackson's 2012-2014 film trilogy adaptation of The Hobbit. The first installment, , shows Dol Guldur as a massive castle in ruins, heavily overgrown with menacing brambles and thorny trees, situated on a hill. It is visited by the wizard Radagast, who has a brief skirmish with <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Witch-king of Angmar, before encountering the Necromancer and then fleeing to tell Gandalf what he has discovered. The {{second part of the}} trilogy, , depicts Gandalf himself entering Dol Guldur, where he discerns that a spell of illusion hangs over the entire fortress, making it appear abandoned even though a growing army of Orcs is amassing there. Gandalf encounters the Necromancer and engages in a magical duel with him, but is ultimately overpowered when the Necromancer unveils his true strength and identity as Sauron. In the third film, , Galadriel, Elrond and Saruman enter Dol Guldur, where they rescue the wounded Gandalf, and battle the Nazgûl. Radagast takes Gandalf out of Dol Guldur to recover, and Galadriel uses her power to force Sauron out of Dol Guldur.|$|E
25|$|The Dunav {{newspaper}} appeared — it was {{the first}} printed in Bulgaria and in Bulgarian. Some Bulgarian schools were founded.

25|$|After the Ghoris {{had assumed}} a {{position}} of Muslim supremacy over North India, Qutbuddin Aibak attempted to conquer Gujarat and annex it to his empire in 1197 but failed in his ambitions. An independent Muslim community continued to flourish in Gujarat for the next hundred years, championed by Arab merchants settling along the western coast belonging to the Shafi'ite madhhab. From 1297 to 1300, Allauddin Khilji, the Turkic Sultan of Delhi, destroyed the Hindu metropolis of Anhilwara and incorporated Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. After Timur's sacking of Delhi {{at the end of}} the 14th century weakened the Sultanate, Gujarat's Muslim Rajput governor Zafar Khan Muzaffar (Muzaffar Shah I) asserted his independence, and his son, Sultan Ahmed Shah (ruled 1411 to 1442), established Ahmedabad as the capital. Khambhat eclipsed Bharuch as Gujarat's most important trade port. Gujarat's relations with Egypt, which was then the premier Arab power in the Middle East remained friendly over the next century and the Egyptian scholar, Badruddin-ad-Damamimi, spent several years in Gujarat in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sultan before proceeding to the Bahmani Sultanate of the Deccan.|$|E

30|$|Ray casting [20] is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most basic}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many {{computer}} graphics rendering methods.

Using the material properties and light effect in the scene, rendering methods can determine <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object. Some hidden surface removal algorithms use ray casting to find the closest surfaces to the eye and eliminate all others that are at a greater distance along the same ray.
