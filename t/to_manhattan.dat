5|$|In 1978, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas studied four {{options for}} a tunnel from Brooklyn to New Jersey, some {{involving}} a tunnel to Staten Island.

The Greenville–Brooklyn tunnel would be about $331 million, which was cheaper than the approximately $405 million tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|On August 22, the British {{landed on}} the shores of Gravesend Bay in {{southwest}} Kings County, across the Narrows from Staten Island {{and more than a dozen}} miles south from the established East River crossings <b>to</b> <b>Manhattan.</b> After five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and captures, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented a larger portion of the army from being lost. The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army <b>to</b> <b>Manhattan</b> without the loss of supplies or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{according}} to agreement, the SPARS enlisted personnel received their indoctrination training {{on college campuses}} operated for such by the U.S. Navy. In March 1943, the USCG decided to establish its own training center for the indoctrination of enlisted recruits. The site selected was the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida. Beginning in late June, all enlisted personnel received their indoctrination and specialized training there. Some 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were {{given the opportunity to}} train in other fields. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach <b>to</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Beach, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} of ferry {{service to}} New Jersey, people moved to locations along the Hudson River waterfront there. In 1986, waterfront settlements like Bayonne, Highlands, Keyport, Port Liberte, and Weehawken saw a reinstatement of their ferry service <b>to</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> under {{the operation of}} NY Waterway. By 1989, around 3,000 of the settlements' combined 10,500 residents paid a $5.00 fare in each direction to board the NY Waterway ferries, despite competition from cheaper alternatives like the PATH train system. Around this time, there were plans to create ferry routes between Inwood and Atlantic City; South Amboy and Wall Street; and from the city proper to New Jersey, Connecticut, and Westchester.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} class of 14 June 1943, until the final class of 16 December 1944, more than 7,000 {{recruits}} were indoctrinated at the Palm Beach station. Approximately, 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were given the opportunity for training in other fields. Some attended other Navy schools and were trained as motion picture sound technicians, link trainer operators, parachute riggers, and air control operators. Others attended USCG schools and learned to be: cooks, bakers, radioman, pharmacist mates, radio technicians, and motor vehicle drivers. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach <b>to</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Beach, Brooklyn, New York, the largest USCG training station for men.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{recruits}} <b>to</b> <b>Manhattan</b> Project's Los Alamos National Laboratory, arriving in March 1943. He became acting head of the Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) Division. There was concern amongst the project leadership about Kennedy, as he was only 26 years old at the time. An approach was therefore made to Charles Thomas from Monsanto. Thomas agreed to co-ordinate the Chemistry efforts of the different Manhattan Project laboratories, but he did not wish to move to New Mexico. Despite his youth, Kennedy officially became CM Division leader in April 1944.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three games, Kansas outscored its opponents 162–16. As Kansas's Big 12 {{schedule}} began, the Jayhawks' winning ways continued, as they proved themselves against legitimate competition. On October 6, Kansas traveled <b>to</b> <b>Manhattan,</b> Kansas, home of then-ranked No.24 Kansas State University for the opening game of its Big12 schedule. In front of 50,924hostile fans, Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing struggled {{for the first time}} in the season. Late in the fourth quarter, Reesing threw a ball that bounced off the facemask of wide receiver Dexton Fields before being intercepted. The interception set up a Kansas State touchdown that put Kansas into a 2421 hole with seven and a half minutes remaining. Reesing and the Jayhawks struck back quickly, however, and scored a 30-yard touchdown to take the lead for good.|$|E
