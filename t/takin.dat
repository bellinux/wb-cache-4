5|$|In Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj {{joined the}} service of the tax {{supervisor}} of the local provinces, Abu'l-Abbas al-Bistam. He soon followed his new master to Egypt, and after al-Bistam's death in June 910 he continued serving the latter's son. Eventually, he gained the attention of the local governor, <b>Takin</b> al-Khazari, who sent him to govern the lands beyond the Jordan River, with his seat at Amman. In 918, he rescued a hajj caravan, among {{which was one of the}} ladies-in-waiting of al-Muqtadir's mother, from Bedouin raiders, thereby improving his standing at the Abbasid court. Two years later, Ibn Tughj gained an influential patron when he briefly served under the powerful Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, when he came to help defend Egypt from a Fatimid invasion. During the campaign, Ibn Tughj commanded the finest troops of the Egyptian army. The two men evidently established a rapport, and remained in contact thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the diverse}} bovid species occur in Africa. The maximum {{concentration}} is in the savannas of eastern Africa. Depending on their feeding habits, several species have radiated over large stretches of land, and hence several variations in dental and limb morphology are observed. Duikers inhabit the equatorial rainforests, sitatunga, and lechwe occur near swamps, eland inhabit grasslands, springbok and oryx occur in deserts, bongo and anoa live in dense forests, and mountain goats and <b>takin</b> live at high altitudes. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Sheep and goats are found primarily in Eurasia, though the Barbary sheep and the ibex form part of the African fauna. The muskox is confined to the arctic tundra. Several bovid species have been domesticated by human beings. The domestication of goats and sheep began 10 thousand years ago, while cattle were domesticated about 7.5 thousand years ago.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Takin</b> {{returned}} to Egypt as governor in 923, Ibn Tughj joined him there, {{but the two}} men fell out in 928 over Takin's refusal to give Ibn Tughj the post of governor of Alexandria. Ibn Tughj escaped the capital Fustat by a ruse, and managed to obtain for himself an appointment as governor of Palestine from Baghdad; the incumbent, al-Rashidi, fled the governor's seat at Ramla for Damascus, whose governorship he assumed. His flight, according to historian Jere L. Bacharach, may indicate that Ibn Tughj commanded a significant military force. Three years later, in July 931, Muhammad ibn Tughj was promoted to governor of Damascus, while al-Rashidi {{returned to}} Ramla. Both these appointments were likely the result of Ibn Tughj's relation with Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, who at this time was at the zenith of his power and influence.|$|E
30|$|Since Illumina Miseq {{sequencing}} of partial 16 S RNA genes could only provide the relative abundance of microbial taxa, fifteen pairs of group-specific primers {{were applied to}} quantify microbial populations in feces of <b>takins.</b> In order to {{explore the influence of}} individual factors (age, gender and sampling time) on the intestinal microbiota of <b>takins,</b> predominant microbial populations of three captive <b>takins</b> were monitored for 6  months.|$|R
50|$|Each spring, <b>takins</b> {{gather in}} large herds and migrate up the {{mountains}} to the tree line. As cooler weather approaches and food becomes scarce, the <b>takins</b> move down to forested valleys. As they move up, down, or across the mountains, <b>takins</b> use the same routes over and over. This creates a series of well-worn paths through the dense growths of bamboo and rhododendrons that lead to their natural salt licks and grazing areas.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{of their}} large, {{powerful}} bodies and impressive horns, Golden <b>Takins</b> have few natural enemies other than bears, wolves, leopards, and dholes. They are generally slow moving but can react quickly if angered or frightened. When needed, they can leap nimbly from rock to rock. If they sense danger, Golden <b>Takins</b> warn others {{with a loud}} [...] "cough" [...] that sends the herd running for cover in the dense underbrush, where they lie down to avoid being seen. <b>Takins</b> can also make an intimidating roar or bellow.|$|R
5|$|Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh soon proved {{incapable}} of restoring {{order to the}} increasingly turbulent province. By 935, the troops were rioting over lack of pay, and Bedouin raids had recommenced. At the same time, Takin's son Muhammad and the fiscal administrator Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali al-Madhara'i—the heir of a dynasty of bureaucrats that had handled the province's finances {{since the time of}} Ibn Tulun and amassed enormous wealth—undermined Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and coveted his position. Infighting broke out among the troops between the Easterners (Mashariqa), chiefly Turkish soldiers, who supported Muhammad ibn <b>Takin,</b> and the Westerners (Maghariba), probably Berbers and Black Africans, who backed Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh. With the support this time of the former vizier and inspector-general of the western provinces al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat, whose son was married to one of Ibn Tughj's daughters, Ibn Tughj was once more named the governor of Egypt. Taking no chances, Ibn Tughj organized an invasion of the country by land and sea. Although Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was able to delay the advance of the army, Ibn Tughj's fleet took Tinnis and the Nile Delta and moved on to the capital Fustat. Outmanoeuvred and defeated in battle, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh fled to the Fatimids. The victorious Muhammad ibn Tughj entered Fustat on 26 August 935.|$|E
5|$|<b>Takin</b> died in March 933, {{and his son}} and {{nominated}} successor, Muhammad, {{failed to}} establish his authority in Egypt. Ibn Tughj was named as the new governor in August but the appointment was revoked a month later before he could reach Egypt, and Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was appointed in his place. The timing of Ibn Tughj's recall coincides with the arrest (and subsequent murder) of Mu'nis by Caliph al-Qahir (r. 932–934) on 22 September, suggesting that Ibn Tughj's nomination was in all likelihood also due to Mu'nis. The fact that al-Qahir sent a eunuch called Bushri to replace Ibn Tughj in Damascus {{after the fall of}} Mu'nis reinforces this view. Bushri was able to take over the governorship of Aleppo (to which he also had been appointed), but Ibn Tughj resisted his replacement, and defeated and took him prisoner. The caliph then charged Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh with forcing Ibn Tughj to surrender, but although Ahmad marched against Ibn Tughj, both avoided a direct confrontation. Instead, the two men met and reached an agreement of mutual support, upholding the status quo.|$|E
5|$|The son of Tughj ibn Juff, {{a general}} of Turkic origin who served both the Abbasids and the {{autonomous}} Tulunid rulers of Egypt and Syria, Muhammad ibn Tughj {{was born in}} Baghdad but grew up in Syria and acquired his first military and administrative experiences at his father's side. He had a turbulent early career: he was imprisoned along with his father by the Abbasids in 905, was released in 906, participated {{in the murder of}} the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i in 908, and fled Iraq to enter the service of the governor of Egypt, <b>Takin</b> al-Khazari. Eventually he acquired the patronage of several influential Abbasid magnates, chiefly the powerful commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar. These ties led him to being named governor first of Palestine and then of Damascus. In 933, he was briefly named governor of Egypt, but this order was revoked after the death of Mu'nis, and Ibn Tughj had to fight to preserve even his governorship of Damascus. In 935, he was re-appointed to Egypt, where he quickly defeated a Fatimid invasion and stabilized the turbulent country. His reign marks a rare period of domestic peace, stability and good government in the annals of early Islamic Egypt. In 938 Caliph al-Radi granted his request for the title of al-Ikhshid, which had been borne by the rulers of his ancestral Farghana Valley. It is by this title that he was known thereafter.|$|E
5000|$|Each spring, Golden <b>Takins</b> {{gather in}} large herds and migrate up the {{mountains}} to the tree line, an altitude above 14,000 feet (4,300 meters). As cooler weather approaches and food becomes scarce, they move down to forested valleys. Golden <b>Takins</b> use the same routes during movement throughout the mountains despite where they are going. This creates a series of well-worn paths through the dense growths of bamboo and rhododendrons that lead to their natural salt licks and grazing areas.|$|R
50|$|Like {{cows and}} sheep, Golden <b>Takins</b> are {{ruminants}} and pass food {{into the first}} stomach, the rumen, when they first swallow it. Microbes in the rumen help digest very small particles of food. Larger particles pass into a second chamber that regurgitates these particles, called cud, back into the mouth to be chewed into pieces small enough to be digested properly. Golden <b>Takins</b> typically eat {{in the early morning}} and again in the late afternoon. They spend the day under the cover of dense vegetation, venturing into the open only on cloudy or foggy days.|$|R
50|$|<b>Takins</b> eat in {{the early}} morning and again in the late afternoon, and they rest when they are not feeding. Since they live at altitudes above 14,000 feet (4,300 meters), they feed on many kinds of alpine and {{deciduous}} plants and evergreens. When it comes to food, <b>takins</b> eat almost any vegetation within reach. This includes the tough leaves of evergreen rhododendrons and oaks, willow and pine bark, bamboo leaves, and a variety of new-growth leaves and herbs. They can easily stand on their hind legs, front legs propped against a tree, to reach for higher vegetation if they need to.|$|R
25|$|There is also {{a notable}} <b>takin</b> {{wildlife}} sanctuary in the district, named Motithang <b>Takin</b> Preserve.|$|E
25|$|At this point, 'Ali and <b>Takin</b> began {{corresponding}} {{with each}} other, and messages and courtesies were sent between the two. News of this reached Masrur al-Balkhi, which {{caused him to}} suspect Takin's loyalty. He therefore departed for al-Ahwaz and wrote to <b>Takin,</b> expressing approval of his conduct. Unsuspectingly, <b>Takin</b> agreed to meet with Masrur, but {{when he arrived at}} his camp he was disarmed and imprisoned. Upon learning that <b>Takin</b> was in custody, his troops began to disperse; several of them entered into the service of 'Ali ibn Aban, while others joined Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah. In order to prevent further defections, Masrur issued a guarantee of safe conduct for the troops that remained, whereupon they agreed to join his forces.|$|E
25|$|Ya'qub died in Junday Sabur in 879, and in {{that same}} year Masrur al-Balkhi {{appointed}} <b>Takin</b> al-Bukhari as military governor of al-Ahwaz. Upon arriving in the province, <b>Takin</b> learned that 'Ali ibn Aban was proceeding toward Tustar with a large army, so he set off for that city as well. When he reached Tustar, he found that 'Ali had surrounded the city and that it {{was on the verge of}} surrender. Without spending any time to prepare, <b>Takin</b> ordered an attack and successfully routed the Zanj, forcing them to withdraw from Tustar.|$|E
50|$|Golden <b>Takins</b> have unique adaptations {{that help}} them stay warm and dry during the bitter cold of winter in the rugged Himalayan Mountains. Their large, moose-like snout has large sinus {{cavities}} that heats inhaled air, preventing the loss of body heat during respiration. A thick, secondary coat is grown {{to keep out the}} cold of the winters and provide protection from the elements. Another protection is their oily skin. Although Golden <b>Takins</b> do not have skin glands, their skin secretes an oily, bitter-tasting substance that acts as a natural raincoat in storms and fog. Its skin is also said to be the source of the legend of the Golden Fleece.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Ranch" [...] {{that borders}} the Tapir House, new Ape House, and {{excavation}} {{site of the}} tunnel to Castle Rosenstein, was built as a temporary holding area in the 1980s. It houses <b>takins</b> and the zoo's bison, and an onager.|$|R
50|$|Marco Polo's Adventure Trek: {{opened in}} 1996. It {{is one of}} two areas to focus on animals from Asia. It {{features}} fauna encountered (or likely to have been encountered) by the explorer Marco Polo, including dromedary camels, moon bears, snow leopards, Sichuan <b>takins,</b> red-crowned cranes, and red pandas.|$|R
25|$|With <b>Takin</b> now imprisoned, Aghartmish was {{appointed}} as military governor of al-Ahwaz in his place. With orders {{to fight against}} 'Ali ibn Aban, Aghartmish and other commanders marched until they reached Tustar, where they killed a number of Zanj prisoners that <b>Takin</b> had taken captive. They then continued south and eventually reached 'Askar Mukram.|$|E
25|$|The Motithang <b>Takin</b> Preserve in Thimphu is a {{wildlife}} reserve area for <b>takin,</b> the National Animal of Bhutan. Originally a mini-zoo, it was {{converted into a}} preserve when {{it was discovered that}} the animals refrained from inhabiting the surrounding forest even when set free. The reason for declaring the <b>takin</b> as a National Animal of Bhutan on 25 November 2005 (Budorcas taxicolor) is attributed to a legend of the animal's creation in Bhutan in the 15th century by Lama Drukpa Kunley. The King of Bhutan believed that it was improper for a Buddhist country to confine animals for religious and environmental reasons, so he ordered the closure of the mini-zoo and the release of the animals into the forest. However, the <b>Takin</b> remained rooted to the town and were seen straying in the streets of Thimphu in search of fodder. Hence, an exclusive preserve was created for them to live freely.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, <b>Takin</b> was {{informed}} that 'Ali had sent a contingent to the Fars bridge, {{and that it was}} in a poor state of discipline. He therefore advanced against their position and staged a night assault, which killed several rebel commanders and forced the rest to flee. <b>Takin</b> then continued along the Nahr Masruqan and eventually reached 'Ali's camp, but the latter decided not to fight and withdrew instead.|$|E
50|$|Several zoos and {{wildlife}} parks keep Mishmi <b>takins</b> in captivity, notably Kolmården Wildlife Park (Sweden), Beijing Zoo (China), Skærup Zoo (Denmark), Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh-India), Tierpark Berlin (Germany), Wrocław Zoo (Poland), Tallinn Zoo (Estonia), Helsinki Zoo (Finland), Marwell Wildlife, Paignton Zoo, and the Highland Wildlife Park (all UK), Metro Richmond Zoo and Denver Zoological Gardens (both USA), and Nyíregyháza Zoo (Hungary).|$|R
30|$|Wild Sichuan <b>takins</b> {{generally}} are found on forested slopes at 1500 – 4000  m in elevation.

25|$|The {{national}} {{symbols of}} Bhutan include the national flag, national emblem, national anthem, and the mythical druk thunder featured in all three. Other distinctive symbols of Bhutan and its dominant Ngalop culture include Dzongkha, the national language; the Bhutanese monarchy; and the driglam namzha, a seventeenth-century code on dress, etiquette, and dzong architecture. Natural symbols of Bhutan are its national flower, the Himalayan blue poppy; its national tree, the Himalayan cypress; its national bird, the raven; and its national animal, the <b>takin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Wildlife include Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, bison, leopard, gaur, tiger, and crocodiles, {{as well as}} many bird species. Migratory birds come to {{the state}} during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, chinkara, <b>takin,</b> serow, pangolin, minivet and Kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project conserving the {{endangered}} Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species, such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile. The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. Recognizing its special conservation value, Sundarban area has been declared as a Biosphere Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Toward the {{beginning}} of 879, Sulayman ibn Jami' {{decided to make a}} new advance and set out with his elite commanders and troops. He first encountered <b>Takin</b> al-Bukhari at al-Shadidiyyah on the Nahr Barduda, and despite suffering substantial losses he defeated him and seized his barges. News of this engagement caused Ahmad ibn Laythawayh, who had been appointed as governor of the region, to advance to al-Shadidiyyah himself. The resulting battle went on inconclusively for two days, but on the third day Sulayman drew out Ibn Laythawayh's by ordering his men to fall back. The Zanj then turned around and defeated the government army; Ibn Laythawayh was thrown into the Nahr Barduda and only narrowly escaped being drowned.|$|E
50|$|The {{giant panda}} {{is the most}} famous species of the reserve. Other typical larger Carnivora are North-Chinese leopards, Ussuri dholes, Asian black bears, Asiatic golden cats, red pandas, hog badgers and yellow-throated martens. Hooved mammals are {{represented}} by Sichuan <b>takins,</b> wild boar, musk deer, mainland serows, Chinese gorals, tufted deer and sambar deer. Other noticeable mammals include golden snub-nosed monkeys, Tibetan macaques, complex-toothed flying squirrels, bamboo rats, and porcupines. Because the reserve comprises different altitudes, it includes tropical and temperate climate zones and harbors species typically for the tropics, like clouded leopards and sambar deer as well as species from temperate regions, like white-lipped deer, snow leopards and Turkestan lynxes.|$|R
