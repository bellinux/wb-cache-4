40|$|Shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> {{and band}} {{spreading}} machines were evaluated, {{in terms of}} their potential for reducing ammonia (NH) emission, by making measurements after application and in direct comparison with 3 surface broadcast applied cattle slurry (pig slurry on one occasion). Several sets of comparative measurements were made with each type of machine on both grassland and arable land (mostly cereal stubbles), covering a range of soil, crop and weather conditions. Measurements of NH 3 emissions were made for 5 – 7 days following application using a micrometeorological mass balance technique. Mean reductions in NH 3 emission achieved from grassland, in comparison with surface broadcast application, were 73, 57 and 26 % for shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> and band spreading, respectively, the latter not being significant (probability P> 005). Mean cumulative emissions, expressed as % total ammoniacal N applied in the slurry, were 13, 12 and 35 % for shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> and band spreading, respectively. There was a trend (probability P= 0029) for decreasing emissions with increasing sward height (between 10 and 20 cm) following <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> applications. Abatement was generally less effective when these techniques were used on arable land, with mean reductions of 23, 38 and 27 % achieved for shallow injection, <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe</b> and band spreading, respectively, with none achieving statistical significance (probability P> 005). There was considerable variation in the efficiency of shallow injection, with reductions achieved in individual experiments ranging from 0 to 90 %.

5000|$|The term [...] "leading/trailing" [...] {{means that}} only one shoe is [...] "leading", moving into the {{rotation}} of the drum and thus exhibiting a self-servo (or self-applying) effect. The leading shoe is [...] "dragged" [...] into the friction surface of the drum and thus achieving greater braking force. [...] The other shoe is [...] "trailing", moving against the direction of rotation, is thrown away from the friction surface of the drum and is far less effective. An advantage of an SLS brake is that is equally effective whether the vehicle is travelling forwards or in reverse. [...] When the vehicle is moving in reverse, the role of the leading and <b>trailing</b> <b>shoes</b> is switched. What would be the leading shoe when the vehicle is travelling forwards becomes the <b>trailing</b> <b>shoe,</b> and vice versa.|$|R
