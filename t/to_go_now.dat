25|$|Some {{people have}} objected against {{extending}} {{the results of}} model organisms to the plant world. One argument is {{that the effect of}} gene knockouts in lab conditions wouldn't truly reflect even the same plant's response in the natural world. Also, these supposedly crucial genes might not be responsible for the evolutionary origin of that character. For these reasons, a comparative study of plant traits has been proposed as the way <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although Abraham {{provided}} {{financial assistance}} {{on a few}} occasions and once visited Thomas during a bout of ill-health, {{when he was on}} his deathbed Abraham sent word to a stepbrother to: [...] "Say to him that if we could meet now, it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful than pleasant; but that if it be his lot <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now,</b> he will soon have a joyous meeting with many loved ones gone before; and where the rest of us, through the help of God, hope ere-long to join them." [...] Abraham preferred not to attend his father's funeral and would not pay for a headstone for his father's grave. [...] Aside from the distant relationship between father and son, Abraham's actions may have been influenced by a [...] "painful midlife crisis" [...] and depression.|$|E
2500|$|Sigismund sent Oswald back to Tyrol {{to prepare}} the county for an {{expected}} Hussite invasion of the Empire and invited the Hussites to the Council of Basel to negotiate. Sigismund himself fled to Milan and later to Piacenza under the pretext that he had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> to Rome to be crowned emperor. During this time Oswald commissioned the cloister Neustift to create a second manuscript collection of his songs. Sigismund called him {{to join him in}} Piacenza and Oswald obliged. The unpleasantness of his visit inspired him to write the complaint-song [...] "Wer die ougen vil verschüren", which he set to a French melody. In May of the same year, Oswald was sent by Sigismund to Basel. After over a year of negotiations, Sigismund was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 31 May 1433 by Pope Eugenius IV, with Oswald probably in attendance.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1996, Gordeeva {{returned}} to the ice, this time as a solo performer. Her first solo performance was a tribute to her late husband, skated to the 'Adagietto' section of Gustav Mahler's 'Symphony No. 5'. The number was publicly performed only twice, first at a preview performance at the Minto Skating Club in Ottawa Ontario, [...] and then on February 27, 1996, in a televised tribute to Grinkov, called [...] "Celebration of a Life", in which numerous skating luminaries took part. Gordeeva has said that {{she felt as if}} she skated with Sergei that night, that she was [...] "double strong" [...] because she felt him with her. The same year, with the aid of author E. M. Swift, she told her story in a book titled [...] In February 1998, CBS aired an eponymous docudrama based on the book. She published a second book in April 1998, titled A Letter for Daria. In 1998, she told an interviewer that [...] "My life of great skating, and skating with him, is over, ... I don't try <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> for Olympics. I take skating for a job." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{international}} politicians, including {{members of}} the U.S. congress and the Jamaican Prime Minister, {{expressed concern that the}} United States had interfered with Haiti's democratic process by removing Aristide with excessive force. According to Rep. Maxine Waters D-California, Mildred Aristide called her at her home at 6:30am to inform her [...] "the coup d'etat has been completed", and Jean-Bertrand Aristide said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti's chief of staff came to his house to say he would be killed [...] "and a lot of Haitians would be killed" [...] if he refused to resign immediately and said he [...] "has to go now." [...] Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York expressed similar words, saying Aristide had told him he was [...] "disappointed that the international community had let him down" [...] and [...] "that he resigned under pressure" [...] – [...] "As a matter of fact, he was very apprehensive for his life. They {{made it clear that he}} had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> or he would be killed." [...] When asked for his response to these statements Colin Powell said that [...] "it might have been better for members of Congress who have heard these stories to ask us about the stories before going public with them so we don't make a difficult situation that much more difficult" [...] and he alleged that Aristide [...] "did not democratically govern or govern well". Jamaican Prime Minister P. J. Patterson released a statement saying [...] "we are bound to question whether his resignation was truly voluntary, as it comes after the capture of sections of Haiti by armed insurgents and the failure of the international community to provide the requisite support. The removal of President Aristide in these circumstances sets a dangerous precedent for democratically elected governments anywhere and everywhere, as it promotes the removal of duly elected persons from office by the power of rebel forces." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aristide later {{stated that}} France and the U.S. {{had a role}} in what he termed [...] "a kidnapping" [...] that took him from Haiti to South Africa via the Central African Republic. However, {{authorities}} said his temporary asylum there had been negotiated by the United States, France and Gabon. On 1 March 2004, U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), along with Aristide family friend Randall Robinson, reported Aristide had told them that he had been forced to resign and had been abducted from the country by the United States and that he had been held hostage by an armed military guard. According to representative Maxine Waters D-California, Mildred Aristide called her at her home at 6:30am to inform her [...] "the coup d'etat has been completed", and Jean-Bertrand Aristide said the U.S. embassy in Haiti's chief of staff came to his house to say he would be killed [...] "and a lot of Haitians would be killed" [...] if he refused to resign immediately and said he [...] "has to go now". Aristide's letter, which is described as his resignation, does not actually have Aristide as clearly and officially resigning. Representative Charles Rangel, D-New York, expressed similar words, saying Aristide had told him he was [...] "disappointed that the international community had let him down" [...] and [...] "that he resigned under pressure" [...] – [...] "As a matter of fact, he was very apprehensive for his life. They {{made it clear that he}} had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>now</b> or he would be killed." [...] When asked for his response to these statements Colin Powell said that [...] "it might have been better for members of Congress who have heard these stories to ask us about the stories before going public with them so we don't make a difficult situation that much more difficult" [...] and he alleged that Aristide [...] "did not democratically govern or govern well". CARICOM, an organization of Caribbean countries that included Haiti, called for a United Nations investigation into Aristide's removal, but were reportedly pressured by the U.S. and France to drop their request. Some observers suggest the rebellion and removal of Aristide were covertly orchestrated by these two countries and Canada. In a 2006 interview, Aristide said the United States went back on their word regarding compromises he made with them over privatization of enterprises to ensure that part of the profits would go to the Haitian people and then [...] "relied on a disinformation campaign" [...] to discredit him.|$|E
