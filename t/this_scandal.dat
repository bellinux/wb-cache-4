5|$|The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & Lybrand {{to include}} an {{alternate}} reform proposal in their report, and after pressure from the Law Society, {{and several of the}} larger regional societies, the alternate proposal was used. This was far weaker than the original proposal, and kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required {{that the majority of the}} people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors). The events surrounding <b>this</b> <b>scandal</b> have been directly linked to the reforms pushed through in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which created an independent disciplinary body for solicitors.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{proposed}} measure—particularly its {{denial of the}} right to appeal—were voiced by the UK, US, and Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. The US, UK, IMF, and World Bank threatened that if Zimbabwe implemented the law, it would forfeit foreign aid packages. Responding to the criticisms, the government removed the ban on court appeals from the bill, which was then passed as law. Over the following few years, hundreds of thousands of acres of largely white-owned land were expropriated. In April 1994, a newspaper investigation found that not all of this was redistributed to landless blacks; much of the expropriated land was being leased to ministers and senior officials such as Witness Mangwede, who was leased a 3000-acre farm in Hwedza. Responding to <b>this</b> <b>scandal,</b> in 1994 the UK government—which had supplied £44 million for land redistribution—halted its payments.|$|E

5000|$|As an {{indication}} of <b>this</b> <b>scandal's</b> size, Martin Mayer wrote at the time, [...] "The theft from the taxpayer by the community that fattened on {{the growth of the}} savings and loan (S&L) industry in the 1980s is the worst public scandal in American history. Teapot Dome in the Harding administration and the Credit Mobilier in the times of Ulysses S. Grant have been taken as the ultimate horror stories of capitalist democracy gone to seed. Measuring by money, or by the misallocation of national resources ... the S&L outrage makes Teapot Dome and Credit Mobilier seem minor episodes." ...|$|R

5|$|In 2008, a {{graduated}} Steffy {{returns to}} Los Angeles and begins {{working for the}} family fashion house, Forrester Creations. She briefly dates Marcus Walton (Texas Battle), and discovers {{that he is the}} son of Brooke's sister, Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis). Phoebe is {{killed in a car accident}} after the car she was driving with her boyfriend Rick swerves off the road. Steffy mourns the loss of Phoebe and begins a romance with Rick to feel closer to Phoebe. Her family are horrified and eventually break up the relationship. When businessman Bill Spencer, Jr. (Don Diamont) takes over Forrester Creations, Steffy seduces him, (who is married to Katie Logan (Heather Tom), (Brooke's sister) in order to win the company back for the Forresters in February 2010, ensuring that the Logan sisters have been excluded as owners. Steffy takes an interest in Oliver (Zack Conroy)who is dating Brooke's daughter, Hope Logan (Kimberly Matula), but Oliver rejects her. At a pool party, Brooke has sex with Oliver, believing he was Ridge and he believing she was Hope. At Hope's graduation party, a tape supposedly narrated by Steffy appears to expose <b>this</b> <b>scandal.</b> After Ridge consequently fires Steffy from Forrester Creations, Taylor compensates by signing over her 25% shares to Steffy. However, it is soon revealed that Steffy's narration was manipulated by computer expert Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton), who is Bill's son. Steffy forgives Liam and later develops feelings for him, but he begins a romance with Hope who will not have sex with him until marriage. Steffy travels to Paris for an extended business trip.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the narrow}} victory, the Chrétien {{government}} established a pro-Canada advertising campaign. The {{aim was to}} sponsor hunting, fishing and other recreational events, {{and in doing so}} promote Canada within Quebec. While many of the events sponsored were legitimate, a large sum of money was mismanaged. Auditor General Sheila Fraser released a report in November 2003, outlining the problems. This eventually led to the Gomery Commission's investigation of the Sponsorship Scandal. Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe argued that Canada was trying to [...] "buy" [...] federalism and using it as an excuse to channel dirty money into Liberal-friendly pockets. <b>This</b> <b>scandal's</b> extensive coverage in Quebec contributed support to the sovereignty movement.|$|R

25|$|The first {{administration}} of Olusegun Obasanjo was {{a continuation of}} the Muritala Mohammed administration, and was focused on completing the transition program to democracy, as well as implementing the national development plans. Major projects including building new refineries, pipelines, expanding the national shipping and airlines as well as hosting FESTAC was done during the administration. A number of these national projects were conduits to distribute favors and enrich connected politicians. The famous Afrobeat musician, Fela Kuti, sang variously about major scandals involving the international telecommunication firm ITT led by Chief MKO Abiola in Nigeria, which the then Head of State, Gen Olusegun Obasanjo was associated with. In addition to this, the Operation Feed the Nation Program, and the associated land grab under the Land Use Decree implemented by the then Head of State was used as conduits to reward cronies, and his now famous Otta Farm Nigeria (OFN) was supposedly a project borne out of <b>this</b> <b>scandal.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Metra CEO Alex Clifford {{abruptly}} resigned his position with no public comment. It gradually {{was reported that}} his exit had been demanded by the Metra board, which negotiated a $871,000 severance package including a non-disclosure agreement. Clifford's ouster was allegedly arranged because he rejected requests for patronage hiring and promotion, including a request to promote a longtime supporter of State Representative Michael Madigan. In the wake of <b>this</b> <b>scandal,</b> five board members resigned. In August 2013, the remaining board members unanimously elected Don Orseno as interim CEO. (The six-member board was operating with reduced membership and thus lacked the authority to elect a permanent CEO. Orseno and Alex Wiggins shared duties as co-executive directors.) Orseno's long railroad career, beginning with work to set up trains and check doors for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad played favorably in the board's decision. By October 2013, local officials had restored Metra's board to 11 members. After reviewing four candidates, the re-constituted board formally appointed Orseno CEO of Metra in January 2014.|$|E

40|$|Thirty {{years after}} the initial break-in, Watergate holds a mythic status within the history of American journalism. Whether {{individuals}} consider Watergate the beginning of modern investigative journalism or maintain that The Washington Post’s reportage helped destroy {{the legitimacy of the}} American political process, the press’s role in <b>this</b> political <b>scandal</b> continues to inspire journalists and provide justification for First Amendment protection of the press. Quite apart from the actual experience of Watergate, this essay suggests that the most famous chronicle of <b>this</b> political <b>scandal,</b> All the President’s Men, codifies an ideology of journalism which has framed an understanding {{of the role of the}} press in the United States and Western Europe since the 1970 s. All the President’s Men can be read as an ur-text – a seminal text that illustrates a specific structure of feeling regarding the construction of contemporary journalistic practices.
