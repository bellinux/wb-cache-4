5|$|Keeping {{with the}} greater Hollywood tradition, every Bond film {{features}} chase scenes, usually {{more than one}} per film. Bond and his allies evade their pursuers {{in a wide variety}} of vehicles, including custom air- and watercraft, to trucks and even tanks and moon-buggies. Although most chase sequences feature Bond getting chased by <b>the</b> <b>villains,</b> such as the Aston-Martin DB5 in Goldfinger and the ski sequence in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, some feature Bond chasing <b>the</b> <b>villains,</b> such as the tank pursuit in GoldenEye and all sequences in Casino Royale. As the Eon series has progressed, the chases have repeated themselves with some variations and have all increased in extravagance.|$|E
5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him to inflate and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of <b>the</b> <b>villains</b> or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of <b>the</b> <b>villains</b> against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear fuel rod.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel as he did not want the Nazis to be <b>the</b> <b>villains</b> again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final storyline.
