50|$|Recipients {{may have}} to {{interpret}} the abbreviated words {{depending on the context}} in which they are being used. For instance, should someone use ttyl, lol they may probably mean <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>later,</b> lots of love as opposed to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>later,</b> laugh out loud. In another instance, if someone were to use omg, lol they may perhaps mean oh my god, laugh out loud as opposed to oh my god, lots of love.|$|E

50|$|The Internet Girls series {{comprises}} ttyl (<b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>later),</b> ttfn (ta ta for now), and l8r, g8r (later, gator). It features three friends—Zoe, Maddie, and Angela—who experience typical {{high school}} drama: boys, drugs, alcohol, parties, driving, and college prep. The novels ttyl and ttfn were both New York Times bestsellers, and ttyl {{was the first}} novel to be written entirely in instant messages. Most of Myracle's novels take place in Atlanta, Georgia and are inspired by her childhood friends and experiences, and her large diverse family.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{obstacle}} to communication in online settings {{is the lack of}} emotional cues. Facial cues dictate the mood and corresponding diction of two people in a conversation. During phone conversations, tone of voice communicates the emotions of the person on the other line. But with chat rooms, instant messaging apps and texting, any signals that would indicate the tone of a person's words or their state of emotion are absent. Because of this, there have been some interesting accommodations. Perhaps the two most prevalent compensating behaviors are the use of emoticons and abbreviations. Emoticons use punctuation marks to illustrate common symbols that pertain to facial cues. For example, one would combine a colon and parenthesis to recreate the symbol of the smiley face indicating the happiness or satisfaction of the other person. To symbolize laughter, the abbreviation [...] "LOL" [...] standing for [...] "laughing out loud" [...] developed. Along with these, countless other symbols and abbreviations have developed including, [...] "BRB" [...] ("be right back"), [...] "TTYL" [...] (<b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>later)</b> and specific designs incorporated by apps of a laughing face, sad face, crying face, angry face etc.|$|E
40|$|As text-based {{communication}} {{increases in}} the civilian and military workplace (Finomore, Popik, Castle, & Dallman, 2010), so does the potential to encounter text-speak. It has been proposed that processing text-speak (I wll tlk 2 u l 8 tr, I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>later)</b> comes at a cognitive cost (Head, Helton, Russell, & Neumann, 2012). To the authors’ knowledge, {{there have been no}} studies investigating the potential physiological cost of processing text-speak. In the current study we investigate the cognitive cost of processing text-speak by measuring performance on a dual-task while also measuring cerebral oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex. Sixty-four university students completed a dualtask which included a conscious priming task and a vigilance task. They also completed a text-speak questionnaire (Head, Helton, Russell, Neumann, & Shears, 2011). The behavioral results failed to show any significant difference in performance between text-speak and correctly spelled text. However, the physiological measurements revealed that the right prefrontal cortex has significantly greater activation when text-speak is shown, thus suggesting a RH compensatory effect. A significant correlation between the text-speak questionnaire and right-hemisphere activation suggests that the right-hemisphere contains the cognitive tools for overriding potential difficulties in processing textspeak...|$|E

Remember I told you he had a swollen leg? Well, it seemed as though it was causing him pain. He seemed so miserable, and so I gave him half of a regularstrength Tylenol®. He just doesn’t seem right, ” Michelle blurted out. “I saw a news item a month or so ago that said that Tylenol ® wasn’t very safe—something about it not being good for the liver. I remember they said it was bad for humans in high doses. I don’t think they mentioned anything about animals. But don’t worry, ” Michelle’s mother reassured her. “Cats are very tough—they have nine lives, you know. And besides, you only gave him half a tablet. ” “Thanks, Mom. I better go now. <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>later,</b> ” Michelle hurried off. The conversation with her mother had made Michelle uneasy. Tabby seemed very sad, tired, and out of breath.
