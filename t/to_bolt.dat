5|$|The first {{event at}} the 2009 World Championships in August was the 100m. After two sub-10 clockings in the {{preliminary}} rounds, Gay reached the final, along with Jamaicans Bolt and Powell. He ran a new US record of 9.71seconds in the race, the third-fastest time in history, but even so {{had to settle for}} second place, losing his 100m world title <b>to</b> <b>Bolt,</b> who knocked 0.11seconds off the world record with a run of 9.58seconds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{flying over}} the Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road, the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, Es Salt and Beisan as far as Tubas, reported all quiet at dawn {{on the morning of}} 20 September, RAF Bristol Fighters would later attack a convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus, blocking the road, causing many horses <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> over a precipice {{on one side of the}} road while men scattered into the hills on the other side. The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed, three large fires were burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps, while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan.|$|E
5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E

5|$|Two days later, Bolt ran as {{the third}} leg in the Jamaican 4x100 metres relay team, {{increasing}} his gold medal total to three. Along with teammates Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, and Asafa Powell, Bolt broke another world and Olympic record, their 37.10 s finish breaking the previous record by three-tenths of a second. Powell, who anchored the team to the finishing line, lamented {{the loss of his}} 100 m record <b>to</b> <b>Bolt</b> but showed no animosity towards his Jamaican rival, stating that he was delighted to help him set his third world record. In January 2017 the Jamaican relay team were stripped of their gold medals after a blood sample taken from Nesta Carter - one of Bolt's teammates in the relay - after the race, was tested again nine years later and tested positive for a banned substance. Following his victories, Bolt donated US$50,000 to the children of Sichuan province in China to help those harmed by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.|$|E
5|$|A {{little after}} two {{o'clock in the}} afternoon, Victorio and his Apaches slowly {{approached}} the springs. Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men. With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready <b>to</b> <b>bolt,</b> the soldiers did not wait and opened fire on their own initiative; Victorio's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range. Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a few}} soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains. Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was devastated by {{artillery}} fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the 8th Ohio Infantry regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians—already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire—that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays' division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up {{as many as four}} deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Identification of {{the best}} parents and hybrids for {{resistance}} <b>to</b> <b>Bolting</b> and Cercospora leaf spot in 9 sugar beet O-type lines by using of diallel cross. Study design: 9 sugar beet O-type lines were crossed as a 9 × 9 4 Diallel crossing scheme using Griffing's method II and along with four control treatments were assessed in a triple lattice design with three replicates. Place and Duration of Study: Safiabad Agricultural Research Center, Dezful, Iran during 2008 - 2009 growing season. Methodology: Analysis of combining ability by using Griffing's method II Diallel crossing scheme after elimination of the control treatments. KWS scale from 1 to 9 (1 = healthy plants and 9 = maximum injury) was used to estimate the resistance to Cercospora disease. Results: General combining ability of O-types was significant for potassium, alpha-amino nitrogen and alkalinity at 1 % and for resistance <b>to</b> <b>Bolting</b> and Cercospora, molassed sugar, root yield, sugar yield and white sugar yield at 5 % probability levels. Also, specific combining ability was significant for resistance <b>to</b> <b>Bolting,</b> potassium, root yield and sugar yield at 1 % and for resistance to Cercospora and white sugar yield at 5 % probability levels. Conclusion: Additive and non-additive gene effects control the expression of resistance to Cercospora and white sugar yield. Also, resistance <b>to</b> <b>Bolting</b> was found <b>to</b> be mainly determined by the non-additive gene effects. The best parent and hybrid for resistance to Cercospora were RR 607 and RR 607 × 452, respectively.

25|$|It was {{suggested}} that one method to avoid endangering {{the public would}} be for shooters to stand over setts and shoot badgers near the entrances. However, a report to Defra by The Game Conservancy Trust (2006) indicated that a major problem with shooting near the sett is that wounded badgers are very likely <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> underground, preventing a second shot to ensure the animal is killed. Under these conditions the first shot must cause the badger to collapse on the spot, limiting the choice of target sites to the spine, neck or head.|$|E

25|$|Solid fuel rockets {{can remain}} stored for years, and is {{generally}} {{very difficult to}} ignite without {{an extended period of}} applied flame. This means they can be manhandled safely, and maintained with the rocket motor installed. However, the lower specific impulse of these engines, combined with the requirement for longer range, demanded a much larger weapon to store the required fuel. Hercules, still known officially as Nike B at this point, grew to become a much larger design. This, in turn, required a much larger booster to loft it, but this was solved by strapping together four of the existing Nike boosters to form a cluster known as the XM-42, with the only modification to the original M5 engine design being the addition of new holes <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> them together, creating the M5E.|$|E

25|$|The {{open circuit}} scuba set is usually stored and often transported as {{separate}} major components - harness, cylinder(s) and regulator(s), and usually buoyancy compensator, and assembled shortly before use. The scuba set is {{life support equipment}} and correct assembly and function {{is critical to the}} success of the dive, and in some cases to the survival of the user. The equipment is robust and reliable, is easily tested for correct function, and assembly is simple enough for the user after basic instruction and some practice. Some service providers will assemble scuba sets for their clients, particularly if it is rental equipment, but all certification agencies require the diver to be competent to assemble their own set. Scuba assembly generally entails mounting the cylinder(s) on the harness, connecting the regulator(s) to the cylinder valves, ensuring an uncontaminated and pressure-tight seal, and connecting the low pressure hose to the buoyancy compensator inflation valve. These operations usually require no tools, or at most a wrench, used <b>to</b> <b>bolt</b> twin cylinders to a backplate. Validating the function of the regulator and inflation valve is usually considered part of scuba assembly, but may also be considered part of pre-dive checks, and if there is a significant interval between assembly and use, is commonly done twice.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed <b>to</b> <b>bolt.</b> While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E
40|$|The {{nuts and}} bolts problem is the {{following}} : Given a collection of n nuts of distinct sizes and n bolts of distinct sizes such that for each nut there is exactly one matching bolt, find for each nut its corresponding <b>bolt</b> subject <b>to</b> the restriction that we can only compare nuts <b>to</b> <b>bolts.</b> That is we can neither compare nuts <b>to</b> nuts, nor <b>bolts</b> <b>to</b> <b>bolts.</b> This humble restriction on the comparisons appears to make this problem quite difficult to solve.
