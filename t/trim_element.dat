40|$|A {{new group}} of long {{terminal}} repeats (LTR) retrotransposons, termed terminal-repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIM), are described that are present in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant. TRIM elements have terminal direct repeat sequences between ≈ 100 and 250 bp in length that encompass an internal domain of ≈ 100 – 300 bp. The internal domain contains primer binding site and polypurine tract motifs but lacks the coding domains required for mobility. Thus TRIM elements are not capable of autonomous transposition and probably require the help of mobility-related proteins encoded by other retrotransposons. The structural organization of TRIM elements suggests an evolutionary relationship to either LTR retrotransposons or retroviruses. The past mobility of TRIM elements is indicated {{by the presence of}} flanking 5 -bp direct repeats found typically at LTR retrotransposon insertion sites, the high degree of sequence conservation between elements from different genomic locations, and the identification of related to empty sites (RESites). TRIM elements seem to be involved actively in the restructuring of plant genomes, affecting the promoter, coding region and intron-exon structure of genes. In solanaceous species and maize, TRIM elements provided target sites for further retrotransposon insertions. In Arabidopsis, evidence is provided that the <b>TRIM</b> <b>element</b> also can be involved in the transduction of host genes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Some apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) {{varieties}} have attractive striping patterns, {{a quality}} attribute {{that is important}} for determining apple fruit market acceptance. Most apple cultivars (e. g. 'Royal Gala') produce fruit with a defined fruit pigment pattern, {{but in the case}} of 'Honeycrisp' apple, trees can produce fruits of two different kinds: striped and blushed. The causes of this phenomenon are unknown. Results Here we show that striped areas of 'Honeycrisp' and 'Royal Gala' are due to sectorial increases in anthocyanin concentration. Transcript levels of the major biosynthetic genes and MYB 10, a transcription factor that upregulates apple anthocyanin production, correlated with increased anthocyanin concentration in stripes. However, nucleotide changes in the promoter and coding sequence of MYB 10 do not correlate with skin pattern in 'Honeycrisp' and other cultivars differing in peel pigmentation patterns. A survey of methylation levels throughout the coding region of MYB 10 and a 2. 5 Kb region 5 ' of the ATG translation start site indicated that an area 900 bp long, starting 1400 bp upstream of the translation start site, is highly methylated. Cytosine methylation was present in all three contexts, with higher methylation levels observed for CHH and CHG (where H is A, C or T) than for CG. Comparisons of methylation levels of the MYB 10 promoter in 'Honeycrisp' red and green stripes indicated that they correlate with peel phenotypes, with an enrichment of methylation observed in green stripes. Conclusions Differences in anthocyanin levels between red and green stripes can be explained by differential transcript accumulation of MYB 10. Different levels of MYB 10 transcript in red versus green stripes are inversely associated with methylation levels in the promoter region. Although observed methylation differences are modest, trends are consistent across years and differences are statistically significant. Methylation may be associated with the presence of a TRIM retrotransposon within the promoter region, but the presence of the <b>TRIM</b> <b>element</b> alone cannot explain the phenotypic variability observed in 'Honeycrisp'. We suggest that methylation in the MYB 10 promoter is more variable in 'Honeycrisp' than in 'Royal Gala', leading to more variable color patterns in the peel of this cultivar. </p...|$|E

40|$|With the {{dramatic}} {{increase in the number of}} transistors on a chip and the increasing needs for battery-powered applications, low-voltage circuit design techniques have been widely studied in recent year. However, these low supply voltage research efforts have been focused mainly on digital circuits, especially on high density memory circuits. Reported success in achieved high performance low voltage operation in analog circuits lags far behind. Recent results have been presented on CMOS low-voltage operational amplifiers, where the supply voltage has been reduced to less than 2. 5 V in which the complementary input stages were used to keep the gm constant [SI 95] [HL 85]. Recently, the floating gate MOS transistor has attracted considerable interest as a nonvolatile analog storage device and as a precision analog <b>trim</b> <b>element</b> because it has threshold voltage programming ability [YU 93] [RC 95].;The particular focus of this work is on implementing very low voltage analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit in a standard CMOS process. As a proof-of-concept vehicle, this work concentrates on the design of very low voltage operational amplifiers in standard CMOS processes. By connecting a DC reference voltage source in series with the gate of all MOS transistors, the equivalent threshold voltage of all transistors can be electrically lowered. This technique makes it possible to decrease the power supply voltage. The DC reference voltage sources are realized by using a switched capacitor charged periodically and switched between the actual circuit and a reference precharge circuit. By extracting the reference voltage source directly from the threshold voltage itself, the threshold voltage variations due to the process and temperature variations can be compensated, since large threshold variations are intolerable for very low threshold voltage applications.;In a proof-of-concept two-stage operational amplifier designed to operate with a single 5 OOmV power supply in a standard 2 [Mu] process, the tail current is kept the same as in a 3. 3 V design, thus the key performance parameters are expected to be maintained at reasonable values. The dramatic decrease of the power supply possible with this approach is paralleled with a corresponding reduction in the power dissipation. Simulation results of this 5 OOmV operational amplifier show a 7 OdB DC gain, 7. 8 MHz unity gain bandwidth and a 650 phase margin. Power dissipation is reduced by more than 90 % from that of the corresponding 3. 3 V design. Although the specific implementation is focused on the implementation of an operational amplifier with comparable performance parameters to those with larger supply voltage, the dominant applications of this technique are for designing a variety of analog and mixed-signal systems that operate at very low voltages and with low power dissipation...|$|E

Ill. (some col.) One {{of the most}} important factors determining apple [Malus pumila P. Mill. ] market acceptance is peel color. Most apple cultivars (e. g. `Royal Gala') produce fruit with a defined fruit pigment pattern, {{but in the case of}} `Honeycrisp' apple, trees can produce fruits of two different kinds: striped and blushed. The causes of this phenomenon are unknown. We compared 'Honeycrisp' fruit from trees that were propagated from buds occurring on branches carrying only blushed or only striped fruit and concluded that blushed trees tend to produce a higher percentage of blushed fruit than striped trees, indicating a mechanism conserved through cell division. The percentage of blushed fruit on any given tree changed from year to year. Blushed and striped fruit occurred together on the same branch, and even on the same spur, with fruits located in the outer canopy being more likely to be striped. Higher crop loads were associated with a lower percentage of blushed fruit on the tree. Blushed and striped fruit do not consistently differ in their maximum pigment accumulation before ripening. The comparison of average hue angle for the whole peel at harvest indicates that blushed fruit are redder on average. We have also shown that striped areas of `Honeycrisp' and `Royal Gala' are due to sectorial increases in anthocyanin concentration. Transcript levels of the major biosynthetic genes and MdMYB 10, a transcription factor that upregulates apple anthocyanin production, correlated with increased anthocyanin concentration in stripes. However, changes in the promoter and coding sequence of MdMYB 10 do not correlate with skin pattern in `Honeycrisp' and other cultivars differing in peel pigmentation patterns. A survey of methylation levels throughout the coding region of MdMYB 10 and a 2. 5 kb region 5 ' of the ATG translation start site indicated that an area 900 bp long, starting 1400 bp upstream of the translation start site, is highly methylated. Comparisons of methylation levels of red and green stripes indicated that the degree of methylation of the MdMYB 10 promoter is likely to be associated with the presence of stripes in these cultivars, with red stripes having lower methylation levels. Methylation may be associated with the presence of a TRIM retrotransposon within the promoter region, but the presence of the <b>TRIM</b> <b>element</b> alone cannot explain the phenotypic variability observed in `Honeycrisp'. We suggest that methylation in the MdMYB 10 promoter is more variable in `Honeycrisp' than in `Royal Gala', leading to more variable color patterns in the peel of this cultivar...|$|E
