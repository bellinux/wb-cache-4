40|$|The {{effect of}} cutting tool {{geometry}} {{has long been}} an issue in understanding mechanics of turning. Tool geometry has sig-nificant influence on chip formation, heat generation, tool wear, surface finish and surface integrity during turning. This article presents a survey on variation in tool geometry i. e. <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius, rake <b>angle,</b> groove on the rake face, variable edge geometry, wiper geometry and curvilinear edge tools and their effect on tool wear, surface roughness and surface integrity of the machined surface. Further modeling and simulation approaches on tool geometry including one approach developed in a recent study, on variable micro-geometry tools, is discussed in brief...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the models, analytical equations and results of analysis for determination of major cutting edge, orthogonal and normal clearance and rake angles, and cutting edge inclination angle. The analysis is carried for variable side and back rake angles {{used by the}} tool manufacturers and a corresponding variation of the geometry along the edge line for the case of round tools. The influence of <b>tool</b> <b>nose</b> radius, chamfer/chipbreaker <b>angle</b> and depth-of-cut was considered as well. Significant variation in orthogonal geometry from that stated in catalogues was found in most cases. The developed analytical solutions and algorithms allow the establishment of fundamental geometrical relationships and giving a correct prediction when developing new tools for conventional and rotary turning...|$|R
