5|$|Comedy Central {{has decided}} not to air these two episodes of South Park. It is a {{decision}} we've made with great reluctance. Comedy Central believes strongly in creative freedom of expression; when unique and deeply insightful creative talents like those behind South Park are able to express themselves freely, we all benefit. However, the safety of our employees is our unquestioned numberone priority, and <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> have decided to take these precautionary measures.|$|E
5|$|Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils {{dates from}} this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College {{the first of}} what was to be an immense series of {{cartoons}} for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects.

5|$|The {{discussion}} {{which has}} taken place here, and the consideration which {{has been given to}} the facts alleged, most conclusively show {{that this is not a}} case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary; under these circumstances, however obnoxious I am myself to the trial by battle, it is the mode of trial which we, in our judicial character, are bound to award. We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, and <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E

Those who were condemned to become gladiators for their crimes are to work from now on in the mines. Thus they pay for their crimes without having to pour their blood.|$|E
25|$|Existence of {{necessary}} and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then {{once there was}} nothing and {{there would still be}} nothing. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>we</b> are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{fundamental}} group in general {{depends on the}} choice of base point, it turns out that, up to isomorphism (actually, even up to inner isomorphism), this choice makes no difference {{as long as the}} space X is path-connected.

25|$|As on the Moon and Mars, {{sequences}} of craters and basins of differing relative ages {{provide the best}} means of establishing stratigraphic order on Mercury. Overlap relations among many large mercurian craters and basins are clearer than those on the Moon. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>we</b> can build up many local stratigraphic columns involving both crater or basin materials and nearby plains materials.|$|E
25|$|We AAs {{have never}} called {{alcoholism}} a disease because, technically speaking, {{it is not}} a disease entity. For example, {{there is no such thing}} as heart disease. Instead there are many separate heart ailments or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>we</b> did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Hence, we have always called it an illness or a malady—a far safer term for us to use.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} the mere-exposure effect and {{decision}} making, Zajonc states {{that there has been}} no empirical proof that cognition precedes any form of decision making. While this is a common assumption, Zajonc argues that the opposite is more likely: decisions are made with little to no cognitive process. He equates deciding upon something with liking it, meaning that more often we cognize reasons to rationalize a decision instead of deciding upon it. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>we</b> make judgments first, and then seek to justify those judgments by rationalization.|$|E

25|$|Klaus Wagner proved in 1937 {{that the}} case k=5 is {{actually}} equivalent to the four color theorem and <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> now know it to be true. As Wagner showed, every graph that has no K5 minor can be decomposed via clique-sums into pieces that are either planar or an 8-vertex Möbius ladder, and each of these pieces can be 4-colored independently of each other, so the 4-colorability of a K5-minor-free graph follows from the 4-colorability {{of each of the}} planar pieces.|$|E
25|$|Decisions {{are based}} on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us {{consultation}} is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government {{will not be able to}} implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with Sharia and <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> reject them.|$|E
25|$|In simple terms, he {{believes}} that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and <b>therefore</b> <b>we</b> are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.|$|E

25|$|All {{models are}} {{simplified}} abstractions of the real-life situation. There exists a basic tradeoff between model precision and parameter precision. A fixed {{amount of information}} collected, will, if split amongst the many parameters of an overly precise model, result {{in at least some}} of the parameters being represented by inadequate sample sizes. Because of the often limited quantities and limited precision of data from which to calculate parameters values in non-human behavior studies, such models should generally be kept simple. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>we</b> generally should not expect models for social insect task allocation or task partitioning to be as elaborate as human workflow ones, for example.|$|E
25|$|Mass flow meters: The {{equations}} {{required for}} calculating rates of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production {{assume that the}} flow rates {{into and out of}} the chambers are known exactly. We use mass flow meters which have the advantage of yielding flow rates independent of temperature and air pressure. Therefore, these flow rates can be considered to be corrected to standard conditions (Standard Temperature Pressure). We only measure and control flow at one location—downstream from the chamber. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>we</b> must assume that the inflow and outflow rates are identical. However, during construction of the respirometry system, flow rate must be measured at all steps, across all connections, to verify integrity of flow.|$|E
