During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E

Meechum's death {{is one of the}} tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring, and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery, a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent, though Meechum may have been eligible, in his own right, as {{a former member of the}} US Military who served in Afghanistan. When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum's hand tracing has been painted over, he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire, who says that Meechum was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> truly understood them.|$|E

25|$|The skyrocketing {{inflation}} was a hardship on <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had fixed incomes—but 90 {{percent of the}} people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper. The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages were usually in arrears and declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships of their families.|$|E

25|$|At most times, Toad {{is portrayed}} as a rather cowardly character, {{but the fact that}} he {{actually}} knows about his cowardice makes him one of the more innocent and humbler characters in the series.

The game saw both sides share periods of dominance. Kerry's Maurice Fitzgerald scored nine of his team's points while Mayo scored 1-2 in a two-minute spell. The Connacht champions failed to score in the last twenty minutes as Kerry held on to win by 0-13 to 1-7. The win was all the more significant for Ó Sé as he became one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> captained and managed his county to an All-Ireland title.|$|E

Akira, through a trial date, was chosen by Yukina to be her boyfriend but because Yukina was still confused with her feelings he felt that her love is not that love of a lover but a love like of family so he broke up with her. He is now going out with Mami.|$|E
25|$|GrandPré has {{illustrated}} {{all of the}} American {{editions of}} the Harry Potter novels. She was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were {{able to read the}} Harry Potter books before they were released to the general public. When she received each new book, she read the story through once, highlighting descriptions that she felt would do well as an illustration. She then created various sketches as ideas for the cover and chapter art, before sending her favorites to the editors to decide which should appear in the final publication. GrandPré devises her images after reading the scripts for the books, and does not collaborate with or receive input from J.K. Rowling, although the two have met. Her artwork for the final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, Maria's second son, George, died of {{tuberculosis}} in the Caucasus.

Two years later, according to her daughter, Grand Duchess Olga, she arranged Olga's disastrous marriage to Peter, Duke of Oldenburg. For years Nicholas refused to grant his unhappy sister a divorce, only relenting in 1916 in the midst of the War. When Olga attempted to contract a morganatic marriage with Nikolai Kulikovsky, Maria Feodorovna and the tsar tried to dissuade her, yet, they did not protest too vehemently. Indeed, Maria Feodorovna was one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> attended the wedding in November 1916. In 1912, Maria faced trouble with her youngest son, when he secretly married his mistress, much to the outrage and scandal of both Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas.|$|E

25|$|Grant often {{displayed}} laddish, thrill-seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, {{gambling and}} living {{off of his}} wits. He became restless easily and actively sought the thrill of danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed sociopathic tendencies at times — impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an indifference to the feelings of others, particularly the women in his life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this {{was that he was}} one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness.|$|E
25|$|Walton {{played a}} key role in Kennedy's 1960 presidential {{campaign}}. He volunteered to work on the campaign in the spring of 1960, long before most people believed Kennedy had a chance at the nomination. During the 1960 Democratic presidential primaries, he helped run the Kennedy campaign operation in West Virginia and Wisconsin. In the general election campaign, he had overall control of the Kennedy operation in New York, the most populous state, where the state Democratic Party was in disarray. Robert F. Kennedy sent Walton to New York to stabilize the campaign there. New York City reporter William Haddad had begun writing articles critical of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. that threatened to divide the New York state Democratic Party. Walton neutralized the problem by hiring Haddad as an aide to Robert Kennedy. Walton's organizational skills allowed him to rise quickly within the Kennedy organization, and he was given election assignments in Maine and California. Walton was also one of <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knew that John Kennedy was in poor health during the campaign. Kennedy suffered from back problems, a deteriorating left knee, Addison's disease, and a possible addiction to amphetamines (which led to withdrawal effects). Walton witnessed Kennedy being followed throughout the campaign by an aide with a kit full of medication designed to treat Kennedy's illnesses.|$|E
