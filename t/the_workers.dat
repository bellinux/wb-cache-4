40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel model of promotion within the firm which sheds {{new light on}} the interplay between working hours and the odds of subsequent promotion. The model's key feature is the coexistence of two different sources of asymmetric information: (i) <b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> cost of long working hours: and (ii) <b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> OJT ability (<b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> ability to accumulate valuable human capital on the job through learning by doing). <b>The</b> <b>worker's</b> cost of working long hours is known only to <b>the</b> <b>worker,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> OJT ability is accurately assessed only by the firm observing him/her on the job. Long working hours signal <b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> commitment to <b>the</b> firm, which determines the surplus produced when <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> is promoted. Thus, the firm provides <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> with managerial training only after observing the employee's hours worked, a signal of his/her commitment to the firm or lack thereof. The firm's decision to provide training also depends on its private information about <b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> OJT ability, which affects his/her future productivity if and when <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> gets promoted. Upon completion of training, the firm then promotes <b>the</b> <b>worker.</b> <b>The</b> model illuminates under what conditions, it is efficient for the firm to adopt the information revelation strategy 2 ̆ 013 reveal its private information on <b>the</b> <b>worker's</b> OJT ability to him/her before <b>the</b> <b>worker</b> decides on whether to work long hours and signal his/her commitment. Using the model, we show that under a reasonable set of conditions, the firm may find it optimal to adopt the information revelation strategy for women but not for men, and derive an empirical testable hypothesis that the correlation between working hours and subsequent promotion will be stronger for women than for men. We analyze longitudinal personnel data from a large Japanese manufacturing firm and provide rigorous econometric evidence in support of the hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with <b>the</b> <b>workers.</b> These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes <b>the</b> <b>workers</b> may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E
