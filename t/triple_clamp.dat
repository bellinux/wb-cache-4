25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower unsprung weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower <b>triple</b> <b>clamp.</b> The rear brake caliper {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
50|$|While it {{may have}} an exposed spring near the <b>triple</b> <b>clamp,</b> a {{springer}} fork is distinguishable from a girder fork by its two parallel sets of legs. The rear is firmly fixed to the bottom <b>triple</b> <b>clamp</b> (usually brazed or welded). A short leading link holds the wheel and the forward leg which actuates the springs (usually mounted on the <b>triple</b> <b>clamp).</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{motorcycle}} fork connects a motorcycle's {{front wheel}} and axle to its frame, typically via a pair of <b>triple</b> <b>clamps.</b> It typically incorporates the front suspension and front brake, and allows the front wheel to rotate about the steering axis so that the bike may be steered. Handlebars attach to the top clamp.|$|R
50|$|The {{swingarm}} pivot and wheel spindles {{were made}} larger in diameter, again for more stiffness. Increased offset on the <b>triple</b> <b>clamps</b> reduced the trail {{on the front}} wheel to make the steering more agile. The forks were shortened to save weight, and the rear shock top mount was redesigned to incorporate a ride-height adjuster.|$|R

50|$|Developed by MotoCzysz {{for their}} C1 and awarded United States Patent 7111700 on September 26, 2006.Defined as a {{motorcycle}} or bicycle front end having coaxial {{steering and suspension}} components, and having telescopic forks. Swing weight of the forks is dramatically reduced by removing their suspension components to the central location, coaxially within the steering tube. Ride height can be adjusted without loosening the forks in the <b>triple</b> <b>clamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Enslow, who by {{this time}} was making a living riding bikes, decided to break the world record of 251 ft set by Doug Danger. He started {{practicing}} by jumping ramp jumps over kegs of beer, cars, motorcycle and other big objects at different events. In 1999, he broke Robbie Knievel's (son of Evel Knievel) 226 ft record for most motorcycle jumps. However, Enslow's <b>triple</b> <b>clamps</b> broke, which disconnected his front end from the frame, resulting in Enslow diving head first into the asphalt. But Enslow was soon on his feet and even signing autographs before leaving the venue.|$|R
5000|$|... "Upside-down" [...] (USD) forks, {{also known}} as {{inverted}} forks, are installed inverted compared to conventional telescopic forks. The slider bodies are at the top, fixed in the <b>triple</b> <b>clamps,</b> and the stanchion tubes are at the bottom, fixed to the axle. This USD arrangement has two advantages: (i) it decreases the unsprung weight of the motorcycle; and (ii) it increases torsional stiffness, which can improve handling. Two disadvantages of USD forks are: (i) they are more expensive than conventional telescopic forks; and (ii) they are liable to lose all their damping oil should an oil seal fail. USD forks are typically found on sportbikes, though the Honda Valkyrie featured USD forks.|$|R

5000|$|Clip-ons — popular on sport bikes, {{in which}} two {{separate}} short handles are clamped directly to the fork tubes. These may be fitted above or below the triple tree, and are easily adjustable. These two piece clip-on bars may also {{be attached to the}} top <b>triple</b> tree <b>clamp</b> and non adjustable.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} changed for 1990 and {{used some of}} the {{features}} from the 1989 GSX-R 1100 frame. The rake was now 25.5 degrees and wheelbase 55.7 in. The front suspension now had inverted forks, the <b>triple</b> <b>clamps</b> (yokes) and handlebars were changed to accommodate the new forks. The rear suspension featured a new damper (shock) and swingarm. The rear damper (shock) now had a remote reservoir and damping adjustment. The revised swingarm now featured cast ends for the axle adjustment. The rear wheel was widened to 5.5 in (previously 4.5 in) but the tire size remained the same. A non-adjustable steering damper was added which attached from the left frame rail to a clamp on the left fork (US models did not receive the damper but the frame had the tapped mounting holes). The rear sprocket carrier and sprocket changed to a six-bolt design (previously five). The front brake rotors changed to a slotted design (previously cross drilled holes).|$|R
5000|$|The 2008 KTM 300 EXC is {{the first}} {{electric}} start two-stroke enduro bike to be released by a major manufacturer. For 2010, Husaberg the other KTM owned bike company, offered the TE300, an XC-W with minor modifications to the body and suspension settings. From 2011 on the 300s got 6-speed gearboxes, a new exhaust pipe and silencer, and translucent fuel tanks. The 2012s got improvements to the starter, more frame changes resulting in more wheel travel, and a new air box with a filter that can be replaced {{without the use of}} tools. The 2013s got a diaphragm spring clutch, a stronger starter and lighter battery. In 2013, the Husaberg became the Husqvarna TE300 and was given the linkage rear suspension. The 2014 had a new CDI ignition system. The 2015 model chromoly steel frame is painted orange like the motocross models. All the 2015 models have the new White Power 4CS forks with revised damping, the ability to make adjustments on the fly and a smaller front axle. The <b>triple</b> <b>clamps</b> have 2 mm less offset resulting in more trail and different steering characteristics. The rear shock is longer but the travel is unchanged. The electric starter has different gearing to provide higher initial torque from the electric motor, and the battery is lighter and stronger.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method to}} reduce or {{eliminate}} brake dive in telescopic forks {{is to use a}} reactive link or torque arm to connect the braking components to the motorcycle frame via the <b>triple</b> <b>clamp.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{windscreen}} {{and minimal}} fairing extending around the headlamp {{fixed to the}} <b>triple</b> <b>clamp.</b> Also called a café fairing or bikini fairing, it stops well {{below the level of}} the rider's head, relying primarily on air deflection to protect the rider's head and chest from the slipstream.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} types of motorcycle front suspension, the girder fork consists {{of a pair of}} uprights attached to the <b>triple</b> <b>clamp</b> by linkages with a spring usually between the top and bottom triple clamps. The design reached a peak in the [...] "Girdraulics" [...] used on the Vincent motorcycle. Girdraulic forks featured forged alloy blades for extra strength and hydraulic damping.|$|E
5000|$|Scott {{produced}} a motorcycle with telescopic forks in 1908, and {{would continue to}} use them until 1931. In 1935 BMW became the first manufacturer to produce a motorcycle with hydraulically damped telescopic forks. Most motorcycles today use telescopic forks for the front suspension. The forks can be most easily understood as simply large hydraulic shock absorbers with internal coil springs. They allow the front wheel to react to imperfections in the road while isolating {{the rest of the}} motorcycle from that motion.The top of the forks are connected to the motorcycles frame in a <b>triple</b> tree <b>clamp</b> (known as a [...] "yoke" [...] in the UK), which allows the forks to be turned in order to steer the motorcycle. The bottom of the forks is connected to the front wheels axle.|$|R
40|$|Tufted layer 5 (TL 5) {{pyramidal}} neurons {{are important}} projection neurons from the cerebral cortex to subcortical areas. Recent and ongoing experiments aimed at understanding the computational analysis {{performed by a}} network of synaptically connected TL 5 neurons are reviewed here. The experiments employed dual and <b>triple</b> whole-cell patch <b>clamp</b> recordings from visually identified and preselected neurons in brain slices of somatosensory cortex of young (14 - to 16 -day-old) rats. These studies suggest that a local network of TL 5 neurons within a cortical module of diameter 300 μm consists {{of a few hundred}} neurons that are extensively interconnected with reciprocal feedback from at least first-, second- and third-order target neurons. A statistical analysis of synaptic innervation suggests that this recurrent network is not randomly arranged and hence each neuron could be functionally unique. Synaptic transmission between these neurons is characterized by use-dependent synaptic depression which confers novel properties to this recurrent network of neurons. First, a range of rates of depression for different synaptic connections enable each TL 5 neuron to receive a unique mixture of information about the average firing rates and the temporally correlated action potential (AP) activity in the population of presynaptic TL 5 neurons. Second, each AP generated by any neuron in the network induces a change (defined as an iteration step) in the functional coupling of the neurons in the network (defined as network configuration). It is proposed that the network configuration is iterated during a stimulus to achieve an optimally orchestrated network response. Hebbian, anti-Hebbian and neuromodulatory-induced modifications of neurotransmitter release probability change the rates of synaptic depression and thereby alter the iteration step size. These data may be important to understand the dynamics of electrical activity within the network...|$|R

5000|$|The B1 had {{conventional}} 7/8" [...] handlebars {{as found}} on all earlier Kawasaki [...] "Z" [...] series bikes, the B2 had clip on style handlebars that mounted {{to the top}} of the fork tube above the top <b>triple</b> <b>clamp,</b> this style then featured on the later ZX1100A models. This style was to continue to be the norm for most sports bikes, especially the Kawasaki GPZ900R series released in 1984.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 2000, as a 2001 model. Available {{only in the}} Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog, [...] "silver book". Virtually {{identical}} to the F4 750 S except for a special brass plate with the Neiman Marcus logo stamped on the <b>triple</b> <b>clamp.</b> There were only 10 available through the Christmas Book and with each purchase, Neiman Marcus included VIP tickets to the International Superbike Classic at Laguna Seca Raceway followed by one day of California Superbike School conducted by Keith Code.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Honda {{continued}} subtle refinements in {{the fourth}} generation CBR900RR's chassis. It got a stiffer frame more like the original, offset on the <b>triple</b> <b>clamp</b> reduced by 5 mm. Brakes got larger rotors {{on the front and}} new calipers and ergonomics was revised with raised footpegs. The engine got revised with 80 percent new internals in an effort to reduce friction and weight. Cylinders bore got an aluminum composites treatment and new pistons. It also got a larger radiator and a new exhaust header in stainless steel.|$|E
50|$|A {{limited number}} of the 749 were {{manufactured}} as a race version — the 749R — each with their production number stamped on the <b>triple</b> <b>clamp.</b> This race model was lighter, had a shorter stroke, increased bore and larger valves which allowed it to run more efficiently at higher RPM, and hence, produced more torque and power than the 749/S models. The 749R also came with a larger fuel tank (18.3 L); slipper clutch; Öhlins forks, shock and steering damper; racing cams; titanium valves, valve guides, and connecting rods; magnesium head covers, and carbon fiber belt covers. Its 2004 model had carbon fiber fairings.|$|E
50|$|The first ZX-9R {{could be}} seen as a ZXR750 {{incorporating}} a number of ZZ-R1100 design features. The wheels - three-spoke cast aluminium alloy 3.5-inch x 17-inch front and 5.5-inch x 17-inch rear -, the front forks - fully adjustable 43 mm upside-down KYB - and unbraced fabricated aluminium box-section swingarm with fully adjustable remote-reservoir KYB monoshock were direct carry-overs from the ZXR. The twin-piston rear Tokico caliper no longer mounted via a torque arm, and the clip-on handlebars mounted above the top <b>triple</b> <b>clamp,</b> not below. The four-piston Tokico front calipers and 320 mm front discs were common to the ZZ-R and the ZXR.|$|E
50|$|They will be {{offering}} enduro models only in both two-stroke and four-stroke. This {{is the last}} opportunity to own a pure Husaberg. All models will have new 25th anniversary graphics. The 250 four-strokes will be getting an all new engine, new exhaust system and an all new ECU. All models will be receiving all new suspension settings. The 4CS USD WP Closed Cartridge forks have been extensively revised. The 250/350 4-stroke frames have been improved creating a lighter and more nimble frame. The lower <b>triple</b> <b>clamp</b> has been redesigned to ensure a smoother fork action. And finally all models will receive a new improved Trail Tech speedo.|$|E
5000|$|Developed by Saxon-Motodd in Britain in {{the early}} 1980s, the Telelever fork aims to improve {{handling}} stability during cornering and braking. The Telelever uses conventional telescopic forks, but the stanchions contain only lubricating oil. Springing and damping functions are dealt with by a monoshock attached to a [...] "Telelever" [...] wishbone. The wishbone pivots {{on the front of}} the engine block, and the wishbone's forward end is attached via a rose-joint to a brace connecting the fork sliders. As there is no lower <b>triple</b> <b>clamp,</b> the fork sliders are longer and lighter than on a conventional telescopic fork, and the greater slider/tube overlap reduces both torsional flex and unsprung weight.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} few years after the KTM 950SE had been {{released}} it had limited interest. Dealers frequently had to offer considerable incentives to make initial sales, however since approximately 2015 there has been a marked increase in desirability with prices steadily rising to the point where a good second-hand example now changes hands for a price equal to or above the original manufacturers RRP. The Erzberg Rodeo Editions, a limited number production batch with enhanced graphics and other items such as Akrapovic exhausts, a CNC clutch cover etc fetch proportionally more. In Europe the Erzberg bikes were individually numbered denoted by a triangular badge on the top <b>triple</b> <b>clamp,</b> in the US they were not numbered and hence the total number of Erzbergs produced is unknown although the generally accepted number is in the order of 100.|$|E

50|$|The Kawasaki GPz750 was a sport bike {{introduced}} by Kawasaki in 1982. It {{was more than}} a warmed-over KZ750, as it was improved in many areas, focusing on high-performance. Changes started at the front, with tapered bearings in the steering head instead of the KZ750's ball bearings, and the upper <b>triple</b> <b>clamp</b> was changed also, giving the GPz solid aluminum clip-on handle grips instead of the traditional handlebar. A bikini fairing almost identical to the one on the GPz550 was added too. The GPz750 boasted increased power, with slightly higher compression, and camshafts designed to get the valves to full lift quicker, and fitting Mikuni 34mm carburetors to it for smoother airflow. The cylinder heads were also given a new combustion chamber with a 'squish zone' and porting & polishing from the factory. To maintain reliability oil passages were installed under the pistons for increased cooling, and an oil-cooler was added. The GPz750 was the quickest factory 750, as Cycle World recorded a time of 11.93 seconds at 109.62 mph in the 1/4 mile. The GPz750 underwent some significant changes in 1983. The original was based on the 1981 KZ750-E. Kawasaki retired the KZ750 after 1983. The 1983 KZ750L3 was nearly identical to the '82 GPz750, but for different colors, no bikini fairing, and without the porting & polishing in the cylinder head.|$|E
