2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to know how it is done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E

"Over 131 years, 404 {{men have}} been accorded to the honour of wearing the baggy green cap, arguably the most {{significant}} and recognizable symbol in Australian team sport," [...] wrote Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Glenn Mitchell.

I am glad Ricky can't read my mind right now because he is not going to like it." [...] Ponting later admitted that Border's comment was the one that hurt him the most, despite News Limited reporter Jon Pierik describing his captaincy as a [...] "joke", while Malcolm Conn from The Australian wrote it was his [...] "worst day as national captain". Indian newspapers also continued with the criticism, with some suggesting Ponting put himself before the team. Ponting angrily responded to such comments at the post-Test media conference.|$|E
