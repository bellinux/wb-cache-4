5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

2500|$|Bilbo Baggins {{stumbled}} upon Gollum's lair, having found Gollum's {{ring in the}} network of goblin tunnels leading down to the lake. At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a riddle game with Gollum on the chance of being shown <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. [...] In {{the first edition of}} The Hobbit, Gollum was characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of The Lord of the Rings, [...] Tolkien revised later editions of The Hobbit: the version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf. In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle— [...] "What have I got in my pocket?"— and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, [...] "Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Britain in the 1930s had an exclusionary trading bloc with {{nations of}} the British Empire known as the [...] "Sterling Area". If Britain {{imported}} more than it exported to nations such as South Africa, South African recipients of pounds sterling tended to put them into London banks. [...] This meant that though Britain was running a trade deficit, it had a financial account surplus, and payments balanced. [...] Increasingly, Britain's positive balance of payments required keeping the wealth of Empire nations in British banks. [...] One incentive for, say, South African holders of rand to park their wealth in London {{and to keep the}} money in Sterling, was a strongly valued pound sterling. [...] Unfortunately, as Britain deindustrialized in the 1920s, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trade deficit was to devalue the currency.

2500|$|In {{the town}} centre, {{the car is}} the [...] most popular mode of {{transport}} in Aix-les-Bains, despite the efforts made by the Association Roue Libre {{for the development of}} urban cycling. Traffic at peak hours is particularly difficult, especially in the summer with the influx of tourists. The portion of the D1201 road along the lake, in the direction of Chambéry, is particularly sensitive to this increase in road traffic. The same problem happens with the Rue de Genève, the Boulevard President Wilson and the Rue de Chambéry. To the north, it is similarly so on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town in the direction of Albens and Annecy on the Boulevard Maréchal de Lattre de Tassigny. However, traffic has tended to improve with urban development promoting the emergence of roundabouts {{at the expense of the}} traffic light, allowing a better flow of traffic. In addition, in the town centre, two car parks can accommodate vehicles, although the number of parking spaces remains low in the town centre for shopping.|$|E
2500|$|Mullan then {{explored}} {{the last remaining}} route for a roadway: Following Lewis and Clark's trail over Lolo Pass. Mullan and his party left on September 19, leaving the Bitterroot Valley by cutting westward where Lolo Creek meets the Bitterroot River (near present-day Lolo, Montana). For , the wide Lolo Creek Valley provided easy going. The route over Lolo Pass, however, was steep and blocked by much fallen timber. The party passed Lolo Hot Springs (first identified by Lewis and Clark), and then followed the Lochsa River to the Middle Fork of the Clearwater River (then called the Kooskooskia) and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains. After 11 days of very difficult travel, Mullan's group emerged onto the Weippe Prairie and continued following the Clearwater—intent on following it until it reached the Snake River. From there, the party could easily orient itself and travel to Fort Walla Walla. About [...] from the Clearwater's confluence with the Snake, Mullan's group struck south up the valley of Lapwai Creek. After a few miles, he came upon the farmhouse of noted fur trader and frontiersman William Craig. Craig, his wife, and the local Niimíipu (or Nez Perce) people fed the group fresh vegetables, the first the group had eaten in 21 months. Mullan's party {{spent the night at}} the Craig farm, and then cut overland west to Fort Walla Walla. The party reached Fort Walla Walla on October 9, and then Fort Dalles on October 14. Having surveyed all known routes, Mullan wrote a final report to Stevens advising that the future military road utilize Lookout Pass. He was then discharged from the Stevens survey party, and returned to Army authority.|$|E
