5|$|His {{youthful}} {{love for}} the fairy-tale element in Shakespeare prefigured his later expressions of Catholic liturgy.

5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are {{exemplary}} human {{individuals who}} not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Upanishad in its {{explanation}} of <b>the</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> Shaktism, mentions and praises Shiva {{such as in}} its verse 19. Shiva, along with Vishnu, is a revered god in the Devi Mahatmya, a text of Shaktism considered by the tradition to {{be as important as}} the Bhagavad Gita. The Ardhanarisvara concept co-mingles god Shiva and goddess Shakti by presenting an icon that is half man and half woman, a representation and theme of union found in many Hindu texts and temples.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> Huldrych Zwingli {{was based}} on the Bible, taking scripture as the {{inspired}} word of God and placing its authority higher than what he saw as human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration noting the differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.|$|E
5|$|In 1529 {{the king}} summoned Parliament {{to deal with}} annulment, thus {{bringing}} together those who wanted reform but who disagreed what form it should take; it {{became known as the}} Reformation Parliament. There were Common lawyers who resented the privileges of the clergy to summon laity to their courts; there were those who had been influenced by Lutheran evangelicalism and were hostile to <b>the</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> Rome; Thomas Cromwell was both. Henry's Chancellor, Thomas More, successor to Wolsey, also wanted reform: he wanted new laws against heresy.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly was {{a product}} of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as <b>the</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also {{considered}} themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.|$|E

5|$|After {{his arrival}} in New England, Wheelwright preached {{primarily}} to the Boston settlers who owned land at Mount Wollaston, still considered a part of Boston, but located about ten {{miles south of the}} Boston meetinghouse. Within months, someone had alerted magistrate John Winthrop, a lay person in the Boston church, that Wheelwright was harboring familist and antinomian doctrines. Familism, <b>the</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> the Family of Love, involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom from both sin, and the responsibility for it. Antinomianism, or being freed from moral law under the covenant of grace, was a form of familism. Most of the New England Puritan ministers were adamantly opposed to these theological doctrines, seeing them as the cause of the violent and bloody ravages of the anabaptists in Germany during the Münster Rebellion of the 1530s. When confronted with accusations of familism, Wheelwright denied preaching such a doctrine. While Winthrop and many of the colony's ministers may have viewed Wheelwright as a familist, Cotton saw him as an orthodox minister.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, a philosophy that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. <b>The</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than half}} the pages in the atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not {{supporting}} it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans {{for the rest of}} the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on <b>the</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.|$|E

40|$|This work {{employs a}} {{comparative}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>theologies</b> <b>of</b> Genesis 3 : 14 – 20 and Romans 8 : 18 – 25 {{as it relates}} to the problem of ecological imbalance. It attempts to re-interpret from a Christian theological point of view the primary and the secondary causes of decay from Genesis and the implications of those for the ecosystem, identifies Paul’s eschatological <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> restoration, and then re-reads the import of his eschatological hope in Romans for the restoration of the creation. By inter-acting <b>the</b> curse <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> Genesis 3 with <b>the</b> restorative <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> Romans 8, <b>the</b> work shows the drift of the ‘very good’ world from its initial, harmonious state to its present state of chaos and the challenge to redress the contemporary ecological imbalance...|$|R
5|$|On Elizabeth's {{death in}} 1603 she was succeeded by James I. Strongly {{influenced}} by Scotland's {{separation from the}} Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing much of his curiosity on <b>the</b> <b>theology</b> <b>of</b> witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced {{that he was being}} plotted against by Scottish witches. After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland. In 1597 he wrote a book, Daemonologie, instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. One year after James acceded to the English throne, a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was proven that harm had been caused through the use of magic, or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.|$|E
