40|$|International audienceMost of {{the plate}} {{boundaries}} are activated obliquely {{with respect to the}} direction of far field stresses, as roughly only 8 % {{of the plate}} boundaries total length shows a very low obliquity (ranging from 0 to 10 °, sub-orthogonal to the plate displacement). The obliquity along plate boundaries is controlled by (i) lateral rheological variations within the lithosphere and (ii) consistency with the global plate circuit. Indeed, plate tectonics and magmatism drive rheological changes within the lithosphere and consequently influence strain localization. Geodynamical evolution controls large-scale mantle convection and plate formation, consumption, and re-organization, thus <b>triggering</b> <b>plate</b> kinematics variations, and the adjustment and re-orientation of far field stresses. These geological processes may thus result in plate boundaries that are not perpendicular but oblique to the direction of far field stresses. This paper reviews the global patterns of obliquity along plate boundaries. Using GPlate, we provide a statistical analysis of present-day obliquity along plate boundaries. Within this framework, by comparing natural examples and geological models, we discuss deformation patterns and kinematics recorded along oblique plate boundaries...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT When {{considering}} a migrating subduction hinge, the kinematics of convergent geodynamic settings shows that subduction zone rates can be faster or slower than convergent rates {{as a function}} of whether the subduction hinge migrates away or toward the upper plate. This opposite behaviour occurs in particular along W-directed and E- or NE-directed subduction zones respectively. Along W-directed slabs, the subduction rate is the convergence rate plus the slab retreat rate, which tends to equal the backarc extension rate. Along E- or NE-directed slabs, the subduction rate is decreased by the shortening in the upper plate. Relative to the mantle, the W-directed slab hinges are fixed, whereas they move west or southwest along E- or NE-directed subduction zones. Therefore, subduction zones appear as passive features controlled by the far field plate velocities and their motion relative to the underlying “eastward” mantle flow rather than by the negative buoyancy alone of the downgoing plate. Several observations cast doubts about the efficiency of the slab pull alone in <b>triggering</b> <b>plate</b> motions. For example, kinematically, the slab is moving out of the mantle along some E- or NE-directed subduction zones, i. e., moving in the direction opposite to the one predicted by the pull of the slab. Mantle convection is also inadequate to explain the Earth’s surface kinematics. Plate motions driven by the Earth’s rotation seem to be the simplest explanation for the asymmetry along the subduction zones and the aforementioned incongruence. 1...|$|R

40|$|The 18 S ribosomal DNA {{molecular}} phylogeny and lipid composition of over 120 marine diatoms {{showed that the}} capability to biosynthesize highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkenes is restricted to two specific phylogenetic clusters, which independently evolved in centric and pennate diatoms. The molecular record of C 25 HBI chemical fossils in a large suite of well-dated marine sediments and petroleum revealed that the older cluster, composed of rhizosolenid diatoms, evolved 91. 5 ± 1. 5 million years ago (Upper Turonian), enabling an accurate dating of the pace of diatom evolution that is unprecedented.

40|$|The {{subduction}} of oceanic plateaux, {{which contain}} extraordinarily thick basaltic crust {{and are the}} marine counterparts of continental flood-basalt provinces, {{is an important factor}} in many current models of plate motion 1, 2, 3, 4 and provides a potential mechanism for <b>triggering</b> <b>plate</b> reorganization 5. To evaluate such models, it is essential to decipher the history of the collision between the largest and thickest of the world 2 ̆ 7 s oceanic plateaux, the Ontong Java plateau, and the Australian plate, but this has been hindered by poor constraints for the arrival of the plateau at the Melanesian trench. Here we present 40 Ar– 39 Ar geochronological data on hotspot volcanoes in eastern Australian that reveal a strong link between collision of the Greenland-sized Ontong Java plateau with the Melanesian arc and motion of the Australian plate. The new ages define a short-lived period of reduced northward plate motion between 26 and 23 Myr ago, coincident with an eastward offset in the contemporaneous tracks of seamount chains in the Tasman Sea east of Australia. These features record a brief westward deflection of the Australian plate as the plateau entered and choked the Melanesian trench 26 Myr ago. From 23 Myr ago, Australia returned to a rapid northerly trajectory at roughly the same time that southwest-directed subduction began along the Trobriand trough 6. The timing and brevity of this collisional event correlate well with offsets in hotspot seamount tracks on the Pacific plate, including the archetypal Hawaiian chain 7, and thus provide strong evidence that immense oceanic plateaux, like the Ontong Java, can contribute to initiating rapid change in plate boundaries and motions on a global scale...|$|R

The <b>trigger</b> <b>plate</b> detaches from the lock and allows for a full display and examination of the locking mechanism. The company holds other patents for a hidden screw removable side-lock, and a unique hinge for the forend iron that promotes faster and easier reloading by allowing the action to swing down farther than normal. Other innovations include: a Boss-style over/under with a pinless lock; self-cocking hammer guns; two versions of a four-barreled shotgun; and drop-lock side-by-side long guns.|$|E

5000|$|Queen Anne pistols are {{characterized}} {{by the fact that}} the breech and the <b>trigger</b> <b>plate</b> are forged in one piece with the lock plate, foreshadowing by over 100 years the so-called [...] "action" [...] of a modern weapon. A variant, made for muzzle loading with loose shot, had the barrel integral with the breech but in the typical Queen Anne the barrel unscrews with a barrel key or wrench just ahead of the chamber where the powder and ball are placed when the pistol is loaded. The chamber is long and narrow with a cup at the top shaped to fit the bullet (a round lead ball). The user can quickly fill the chamber with black powder and put a bullet on top; the barrel is then replaced, sealing the bullet between its cup and the breech end of the barrel. The bullet is larger than the barrel, so the breech is tapered to compress the ball as it moves forward at the moment of firing to tightly fit the bore. High gas pressure is developed behind the bullet before it is forced into the barrel, thus achieving considerably higher muzzle velocity and power than with a muzzle loader. The barrel was often rifled, which improves accuracy. The system also avoids the need for wadding or a ramrod during loading. It was not successful as a military weapon because in the heat of battle the separate barrel could be dropped during loading. A swiveled, hinged link was designed to allow the barrel to be unscrewed while still remaining attached, but this was evidently not successful. The greatest popularity of the Queen Anne was among civilians as an effective self-defense weapon. It was often highly decorated to suit the tastes of the wealthy.|$|E
40|$|Because {{many types}} of living cells are {{sensitive}} to applied strain, different in vitro models {{have been designed to}} elucidate the cellular and subcellular processes that respond to mechanical deformation at both the cell and tissue level. Our focus was to improve upon an already established strain system to make it capable of independently monitoring the deflection and applied pressure delivered to specific wells of a commercially available, deformable multiwell culture plate. To accomplish this, we devised a custom frame that was capable of mounting deformable 6 or 24 well plates, a pressurization system that could load wells within the plates, and a camera-based imaging system which was capable of capturing strain responses at a sufficiently high frame rate. The system used a user defined program constructed in Labview® to <b>trigger</b> <b>plate</b> pressurization while simultaneously allowing the deflection of the silicone elastomeric plate bottoms to be imaged in near real time. With this system, up to six wells could be pulsed simultaneously using compressed air or nitrogen. Digital image capture allowed near-real time monitoring of applied strain, strain rate, and the cell loading profiles. Although our ultimate goal is to determine how different strain rates applied to neurons modulates their intrinsic biochemical cascades, the same platform technology could be readily applied to other systems. Combining commercially available, deformable multiwell plates with a simple instrument having the monitoring capabilities described here should permit near real time calculations of stretch-induced membrane strain in multiple wells in real time {{for a wide variety of}} applications, including high throughput drug screening...|$|E
