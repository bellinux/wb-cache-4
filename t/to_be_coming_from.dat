5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Capturing one of {{the alien}} troops and {{conducting}} the interrogation reveals vague information about another type of alien called the Outsiders, artificially-created crystalline beings encountered aboard UFOs, that appear to serve as pilots and navigators. Dr. Vahlen then requests that XCOM capture an Outsider for study. Upon capturing {{one of the}}se, the examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth. XCOM dispatches a team to investigate the signal; it is found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a base that the aliens have secretly established on Earth, where experiments are performed on abducted humans.|$|E

Skye and Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons discover a strange video feed linked to Amador, which they soon discover <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a camera in her eye, the source of her apparent 'powers'. Seeing {{the name of the}} hotel Amador is at through the feed, May tracks her down and confronts her. Amador reveals that her prosthetic eye contains a fail safe, so that her handler, who also relays orders in text-form through the eye, can kill her if she refuses to complete her missions. The two fight until Coulson arrives and stuns Amador. Skye hijacks the feed, and relays it through a pair of glasses that Agent Grant Ward wears, carrying out Amador's mission while Agents Fitz and Simmons remove the prosthetic eye.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

25|$|After {{a series}} of raids, on 20 April, Farran was {{informed}} that Fifth Army had broken through German lines, {{and he took the}} decision to have the battalion assault the city of Reggio Emilia, which straddled Route 12. The howitzer was used to bombard the main square of the town, and Farran later discovered that the local German and Italian Fascist garrison believed the attack <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the vanguard of an American armoured division; as a result, the town was abandoned two hours after the shelling had begun. Then on 22 April, it was discovered that American troops had penetrated near the city of Bologna, causing German forces to retreat down Route 12. Positioning the partisan battalion near the Sassuolo Bridge, Farran used the howitzer, mortars and a machine gun to open fire on the traffic using the bridge, destroying a number of vehicles. The attack attracted the attention of a flight of Supermarine Spitfires, who strafed the area and inflicted more casualties. After fighting all day, Farran withdrew the battalion from the area, and after harassing more German transport columns for a further day, moved the battalion into Modena to help mop up any remaining resistance. Very soon afterwards, orders came for the operation to cease and the British troops to travel to Florence. During its time operating, the battalion had killed an estimated 300 German soldiers and destroyed twenty vehicles, as well as taking 158 prisoners of war, and had suffered 24 casualties in return.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of F minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B3 to the high-note of A5. Aside from Dupri's verses, Carey's longtime background singer Trey Lorenz makes a notable impression on the song, and earned credits for providing background vocals. Lyrically, the song is written in a female perspective, where they ask the man for their number at a club. In an interview with MTV News, Carey jokingly addressed the lyrics, claiming Dupri [...] "really wanted it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the girl, like 'can I get your number' to the guy. But in all honesty that would never be me!" [...] Aside from her signature vocals, Carey adopts a breathy rap for parts of the song, which read [...] "I got a pimp penthouse / With a sick hot tub / We can watch a flat screen / While the bubbles filling up." [...] According to Jozen Cummings from PopMatters, the lyrics and Carey's vocal switch make the song [...] "fun and comedic".|$|E

Israel reported the death toll as 9 Hamas militants and 3 noncombatants with senior IDF officers stating that the death toll published by Hamas was [...] "grossly exaggerated". Israel stated it fired on the school in response to militant gunfire believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> al-Fakhura.

2500|$|String Quartet No. 2 (1968) {{consists}} of five movements. They differ widely {{from each other}} in their types of motion. In the first, the structure is largely broken up, as in Aventures. In the second, everything is reduced to very slow motion, and the music seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a distance, with great lyricism. The pizzicato third movement is another of Ligeti's machine-like studies, hard and mechanical, whereby the parts playing repeated notes creates a [...] "granulated" [...] continuum. In the fourth, which is fast and threatening, everything that happened before is crammed together. Lastly, in strong contrast, the fifth movement spreads itself out. In each movement, the same basic configurations return, but each time their colouring or viewpoint is different, so that the overall form only really emerges when one listens to all five movements in context.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, the United Nations Security Council imposed {{sanctions}} on Eritrea, accusing it of arming and providing {{financial aid to}} militia groups in southern Somalia's conflict zones, including al-Shabaab.

African Union peacekeepers also reportedly capturing some Eritrean soldiers and prisoners of war. In 2010, the UN International Monitoring Group (IMG) published a report charging the Eritrean government of continuing to offer support to rebel groups in southern Somalia, despite the sanctions already in place. The Eritrean administration emphatically denied the accusations, describing them as [...] "concocted, baseless and unfounded" [...] and demanding concrete evidence to be made publicly available, with an independent platform through which it may in turn issue a response. In November 2011 the UN Monitoring Group repeated claims that Eritrea supported al-Shabaab. The report said that Eritrea gave [...] each month to al-Shabaab linked individuals in Nairobi.|$|E
