25|$|Initial {{response}} to the P-47 praised its dive speed and high-altitude performance, while criticizing its turning performance and rate of climb (particularly at low-to-medium altitudes). The <b>turbosupercharger</b> in the P-47 gave the powerplant its maximum power at 27,000ft (8,230m), and in the thin air above 30,000ft (9,144m), the Thunderbolt remained comparatively fast and nimble relative to other aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, Marshall Wainwright {{notes that}} other sources {{indicate}} {{the first eight}} aircraft were to originally have been powered by Allison V-1710-13 engines fitted with GE Type B-6 turbosuperchargers. These aircraft were eventually delivered with improved V-1710-23(D2) engines. Wainwright further states {{that two of the}} YFM-1 airframes were changed on the production line to accept the V-1710-41 without <b>turbosupercharging,</b> becoming YFM-1Bs. This is noted in a contract change dated 19 October 1939 which shows that aircraft 38-489 and 38-490 had their turbos, all associated ducting, and controls removed and V-1710-41(D2A) [...] "Altitude Rated" [...] engines installed instead. The (D2A) was essentially a -23 with higher supercharger gear ratios (8.77:1 versus 6.23:1), which allowed the motor to develop around [...] up to [...] ASL. They used the same ratings and components as the Altitude Rated V-1710-33(C15) Allison fitted to the original Curtiss XP-40. Allison was paid $1,690 to modify each engine.|$|R
25|$|When {{fitted with}} a GE CH-5 <b>turbosupercharger,</b> the XP-47J {{achieved}} {{a top speed of}} 505mph (440kn, 813km/h) in level flight on August 4, 1944 at 34,500 feet over a course in Farmingdale, New York, piloted by Mike Ritchie. Ritchie's achievement was not exceeded until August 21, 1989, when Lyle Shelton piloted Rare Bear, a highly modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, and set a new official FAI record at 523.586mph.|$|E
25|$|One {{conversion}} first flown 25 November 1939. Streamlined XP-39 {{based on}} NACA wind tunnel testing resulting in revised canopy and wheel door shape, oil and radiator intakes moved from right fuselage to wing roots, fuselage increased length (by 1ft 1in, to 29ft 9in) and decreased wingspan (by 1ft 10in, to 34ft). The <b>turbosupercharger</b> was removed, and the single-stage, single speed, supercharged Allison V-1710-37 (E5) engine (1,090hp/813kW) {{was left in}} place. The carburetor air intake was moved behind canopy, just above the carburetor.|$|E
25|$|With {{increases}} in fuel capacity as the type was refined, {{the range of}} escort missions over Europe steadily increased until the P-47 was able to accompany bombers in raids {{all the way into}} Germany. On the way back from the raids, pilots shot up ground targets of opportunity, and also used belly shackles to carry bombs on short-range missions, which led to the realization that the P-47 could perform a dual-function on escort missions as a fighter-bomber. Even with its complicated <b>turbosupercharger</b> system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb a lot of damage and still return home.|$|E
25|$|Essentially {{similar to}} the P-47B, the initial P-47C {{featured}} strengthened all-metal control surfaces, an upgraded GE <b>turbosupercharger</b> regulator, and a short vertical radio mast. After the initial manufacture of a block of 57 P-47Cs, production moved to the P-47C-1, which had an 8in (20cm) fuselage extension forward of the cockpit at the firewall to correct center of gravity problems, ease engine maintenance and allow installation of a new engine mount. There {{were a number of}} other changes, such as revised exhausts for the oil coolers, and fixes to brakes, undercarriage and electrical systems, as well as a redesigned rudder and elevator balance. The 55 P-47C-1s were followed by 128 P-47C-2s which introduced a centerline hardpoint with under-fuselage shackles for either a 500lb (227kg) bomb or a 200U.S. gal (758l, 167Imp gal) fuel tank that conformed to the underside of the fuselage. The main production P-47C sub-variant was the P-47C-5 which introduced a new whip antenna. With the use of pressurized drop tanks, the P-47C was able to extend its range on missions beginning 30 July 1943.|$|E

2500|$|Power {{came from}} a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp two-row 18-cylinder radial engine {{producing}} 2,000hp (1,500kW)—the same engine that would power the prototype Vought XF4U-1 fighter to just over 400mph (644 kph) in October 1940—with the Double Wasp on the XP-47B turning a four-bladed Curtiss Electric constant-speed propeller of 146in (3.7m) in diameter. The loss of the AP-4 prototype to an engine fire ended Kartveli's experiments with tight-fitting cowlings, so the engine {{was placed in a}} broad cowling that opened at the front in a [...] "horse collar"-shaped ellipse. The cowling admitted cooling air for the engine, left and right oil coolers, and the <b>turbosupercharger</b> intercooler system. The engine exhaust gases were routed into a pair of wastegate-equipped pipes that ran along each side of the cockpit to drive the <b>turbosupercharger</b> turbine {{at the bottom of the}} fuselage about halfway between cockpit and tail. At full power, the pipes glowed red at their forward ends and the turbine spun at 21,300rpm. The complicated <b>turbosupercharger</b> system with its ductwork gave the XP-47B a deep fuselage, and the wings had to be mounted in a relatively high position. This was problematic since long-legged main landing gear struts were needed to provide ground clearance for the enormous propeller. To reduce the size and weight of the main landing gear struts and so that wing-mounted machine guns could be fitted, each main gear strut was fitted with a mechanism by which it telescoped out 9in (23cm) when extended.|$|E
2500|$|Bell Model 11, [...] one {{prototype}} 38–326 first flown 6 April 1938. Powered by an Allison V-1710-17 (E2) engine (1,150hp/858kW), {{the aircraft}} was {{fitted with a}} General Electric B-5 <b>turbosupercharger,</b> creating a two stage supercharging system similar to the P-38. Provision was made for two [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns in the forward fuselage and one 25mm (.98in) cannon but aircraft remained unarmed. Later converted to XP-39B.|$|E

Main {{production}} variant used in P-47 series, fed by an improved C-23 <b>turbosupercharger.</b> Differed from -21 in being fitted with A.D.I and a General Electric ignition {{system with a}} simplified, tubular ignition harness developed by the Scinitilla company in partnership with Bendix. Used in P-47C and D, XP-47L. Production = 11,391 (P 592; Ford 10,799).|$|E
2500|$|Republic {{addressed}} the problems by fitting a rearwards-sliding canopy {{that could be}} jettisoned in an emergency, a pressurized ignition system, and new all-metal control surfaces. The deficient maintenance access to the Double Wasp radial on the B-series subtypes {{had to wait until}} the P-47C introduced a new engine mount. While the engineers worked frantically to get their [...] "dinosaur" [...] to fly right, the USAAF ordered 171 P-47Bs. An engineering prototype P-47B was delivered in December 1941, with a production prototype following in March 1942, and the first production model provided in May. Republic continued to improve the design as P-47Bs were produced, and although all P-47Bs had the sliding canopy and the new General Electric <b>turbosupercharger</b> regulator for the R-2800-21 engine, features such as all-metal control surfaces were not standard at first. A modification on the P-47B, also required for the early marks of the U.S. Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat and Grumman F6F Hellcat was the radio mast behind the cockpit that was slanted forward to maintain the originally designed antenna wire length in spite of the new sliding canopy.|$|E
2500|$|Surprisingly, {{the last}} flying {{example of the}} entire P-61 line was a rare F-15A Reporter (RF-61C) (s/n 45-59300), the first {{production}} model Reporter to be built. The aircraft was completed on 15 May 1946, and served with the USAAF and later the U.S. Air Force until 6 February 1948, when it was reassigned to the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory at Moffett Field in California. There it was reconfigured {{to serve as a}} launch vehicle for air dropped scale models of experimental aircraft. It served in this capacity until 1953, when it was replaced by a mammoth wind tunnel used for the same testing. In April, 1955, the F-15 was declared surplus along with a [...] "spare parts" [...] F-61C (s/n 43-8357). The F-15 was sold, along with the parts P-61, to Steward-Davis Incorporated of Gardena, California, and given the civilian registration N5093V. Unable to sell the P-61C, Steward-Davis scrapped it in 1957. Steward-Davis made several modifications to the Reporter to make it suitable for aerial survey work, including switching to a canopy taken from a T-33, and to propellers taken from an older P-61. The plane was sold in September, 1956 to Compania Mexicana Aerofoto S. A. of Mexico City and assigned the Mexican registration XB-FUJ. In Mexico, the Reporter was used for aerial survey work, the very role for which it was originally designed. It was bought by Aero Enterprises Inc. of Willets, California and returned to the USA in January 1964 carrying the civilian registration number N9768Z. The fuselage tank and <b>turbosupercharger</b> intercoolers were removed; and the plane was fitted with a 1,600gal (6,056l) chemical tank for fire-fighting. It was purchased by Cal-Nat of Fresno, California at the end of 1964, which operated it as a firefighting aircraft for the next 3 years. In March 1968, the F-15 was purchased by TBM, Inc., an aerial firefighting company located in Tulare, California (the company's name representing the TBM Avenger, their primary equipment), who performed additional modifications on the aircraft to improve its performance, including experimenting with several types of propellers before deciding on Curtiss Electric type 34 propellers taken from a late model Lockheed Constellation.|$|E

50|$|The Allison V-1710 was {{the only}} {{indigenous}} U.S.-developed V12 liquid-cooled engine to see service during World War II. A sturdy design, it lacked an advanced mechanical supercharger until 1943. Although versions with a <b>turbosupercharger</b> provided excellent performance at high altitude in the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, the <b>turbosupercharger</b> and its ductwork were too bulky to fit into typical single-engine fighters. While a good performer at low altitudes, without adequate supercharging, the Allison's high-altitude performance was lacking.|$|E

50|$|A {{converted}} Bf 109G {{adapted to}} take the DB 628 engine flew in May 1942 and attained an altitude of 15,500 m (50,850 ft). However, the Technische Amt concluded that a DB 603A engine with an exhaust-driven <b>turbosupercharger</b> was more promising. The DB 603A provided 1,201 kW (1,610 hp) for takeoff and 1,081 kW (1,450 hp) at 15,000 m (49,210 ft). This engine change required that the fuselage be elongated in order to house the <b>turbosupercharger</b> aft of the pressure cabin. Exhaust gases were carried to the <b>turbosupercharger</b> via external ducts. Air was drawn in through via a ventral trough aft of the wing. Standard Bf 109G wings were to be fitted outboard of a new, long-span, untapered wing center section. Other parts were scavenged from existing Messerschmitt designs - the vertical tail was from the Me 209, and the horizontal tail and the undercarriage {{were taken from the}} Bf 109G.|$|E
