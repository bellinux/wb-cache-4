5|$|Carless {{makes an}} {{impressive}} speech in Persian {{to convince the}} drivers to continue into Nuristan. They climb an extremely indistinct track to the pass. They descend into Nuristan: it grows hot. Men run to meet them: they are told {{they are the first}} Europeans ever to cross the pass (Newby doesn't believe this). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> ice-cold milk to drink.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum cultivars {{and species}} {{can be grown}} inside in pots or outside in warmer climates (Hardiness 7B-11).

50|$|In an {{experiment}} conducted by Raghubir and Srivastava, university students <b>were</b> <b>given</b> a dollar, either in quarters or {{as a single}} dollar bill. The students <b>were</b> then <b>given</b> the option to either save the money <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given</b> or spend it on candy. Consistent with the theory, the students <b>given</b> the quarters <b>were</b> more likely {{to spend the money}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>given.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team {{has in the past}} been chosen several years beforehand, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries. In Ukraine, for instance, selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by difficulty and schedule. While identifying the winners, only the results of the current selection olympiads are considered.|$|E
5|$|Pet rats {{can also}} develop {{pituitary}} tumors if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> high-calorie diets, and ringtail {{if they are}} placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures. Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside {{on the top of}} the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause ulcerative dermatitis.|$|E

5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance of severe kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and boss to overcome. Afterward, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> access to eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned Robot Masters. At the end of each stage, players must battle a Robot Master. When a Robot Master is destroyed, it will give Mega Man its respective weapon, which can be used against other Robot Masters or enemies but has limited ammunition. If Mega Man defeats the Robot Master using his primary weapon, the Robot Master will be captured and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the Robot Masters.|$|E
5|$|Divided is an American {{television}} {{game show}} broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) {{based on the}} British series of the same name. Each episode consists of four contestants playing as one team who must agree on answers to questions <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given.</b> The longer it takes the team {{to come to an}} agreement, the less money the team earns for each question. The series, hosted by Mike Richards, premiered January 19, 2017, with some critics believing that the show's name and timing were appropriate given the tumultuous preceding presidential election and its premiere date coming the day before the inauguration.|$|E

5|$|Guitar Hero: Aerosmiths {{gameplay}} {{is structured}} similarly to the gameplay {{of the other}} games in the series, in which players use a guitar-shaped peripheral to simulate the playing of rock music, hitting fret buttons and strumming in time to notes as they scroll on the screen. The player's performance is tracked through each song; if the player does well <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> a score and a rating of up to five stars; if the player performs poorly, the song may end prematurely and the player will need to try the song again. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties that changes the number and speed of the notes that must be played.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the criticism that NPC behavior had been too simplistic in Morrowind, Bethesda developed the Radiant A.I. system for Oblivion. NPCs were designed to make choices, rather than complete scripted routines, to achieve predetermined goals. The manner in which goals such as eating, sleeping, reading, and speaking to others are fulfilled is dependent upon the environment, the choices of other NPCs, and programmed personality values. For example, an NPC whose goal is to find food may eventually resort to stealing from others, if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> the opportunity {{and if it is}} in their character. These development mechanics allowed Bethesda to create NPCs who could engage in complex activities.|$|E
5|$|Paid {{additional}} content was released alongside the games, {{in the form}} of extra levels used to improve the units' strength or gather exclusive resources. A series of additional storylines were also released to expand on the main narrative. The first is Before Awakening, in which the Avatar is transported to Ylisse, the setting of Fire Emblem Awakening, and aids its heroes Chrom, Frederick, and Lissa in fighting off the forces of Valla. The second, Hidden Truths, centers around Awakening characters Owain, Inigo, and Severa as they are contacted by a mysterious figure who asks for their help in saving Valla. To this end, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> new powers and names: Odin, Laslow, and Selena. The trio ultimately join with the kingdom of Nohr as retainers.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{total of}} five Monsters {{featured}} in Evolve. Similar to the Hunters, players need to inflict a certain amount of damage before unlocking a new Monster. The five different Monster-types also have different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Players control the Monster from a third-person perspective, and it features gameplay similar to an action game, unlike the Hunters. More abilities are given to a Monster after its evolution. Gameplay mechanics do not change much after the release of Stage 2, but monsters are made more powerful. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> more health, stamina, armor, and skill points to unlock all abilities. Cooldown time abilities also shortened and recharge rate becomes significantly faster.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E
5|$|Alto's Adventure is a side-scrolling endless runner snowboarding game. The player {{character}} moves automatically through procedurally generated landscapes {{towards the}} right side of the screen and the player can only control when to jump. The player taps the screen once to jump and holds the screen while the player character is midair to perform tricks. While the character moves across the landscape, the player can complete some of the game's 180 goals, though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> only three at a time. Goals include such things as traveling a set distance, rescuing runaway llamas, crossing dangerous gaps, grinding across rooftops of villages, and outsmarting the mountain elders. The player receives awards from completing goals, and can also collect coins that can be used to purchase upgrades. Players perform tricks in quick succession, or combos, to earn points towards a competitive high score. The game also tracks distance traveled and trick combos. Later in the game, players can use a wingsuit, which changes some elements of the game. The environments of Alto's Adventure change in lighting as time passes through the cycle of the day, and incorporate various weather effects. Player progress syncs between iPads and iPhones over iCloud, and the game uses Game Center leaderboards.|$|E

5|$|Battles are turn-based, with random {{encounters}} {{taking place}} while exploring dungeons. At {{the end of}} a successful battle, experience points, money, and items are obtained. Experience points are shared by Nakajima and Yumiko; by gaining enough experience points, their levels raise, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> one ability point each, which can be given to one of five character attributes: strength, intelligence, attack, dexterity, and luck. During battles, the player can try to persuade enemy demons to join them, in exchange for magnetite, money, or items. The player can keep seven demons at a time, of which up to four can be summoned at the same time; summoned demons aid the player in battles with physical and magic attacks, but cost money to summon, and consume magnetite as the player walks around. The demons' attitude towards the player is governed by the moon phase, which cycles through eight phases from new to full. Demons do not level up; instead, the player can create stronger demons by visiting a special location and fusing two of their allied demons together into a new one.|$|E
5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can be talked with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, the demon will attack. Once a demon is won over, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> a loyalty meter which {{is influenced by the}} player's actions. If the demon is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, the demon will begin to disobey the protagonist, then leave. Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. Demon fusion is governed by a comparability system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better demon compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after a certain point in the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>given</b> a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E
