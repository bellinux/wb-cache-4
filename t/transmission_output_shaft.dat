25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's counter gear shaft. The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case.

Like the R1200GS Adventure, all liquid-cooled boxer models were given a damper on the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> The selector drum actuator, transmission shafts and transmission shaft bearing were revised.

50|$|The rear pump was an {{unregulated}} {{gear pump}} driven from the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> which meant it {{was capable of}} pressurizing the transmission if the vehicle was in motion. This feature {{made it possible to}} push-start a vehicle with a dead battery if the vehicle could be accelerated to at least 15 - 20 mph. At higher speeds, the rear pump provided all the oil volume that was needed to operate the transmission and the front pump's slide was nearly centered, causing that pump to produce little output.|$|E

The THM350 adapter was cast iron and used a sliding sleeve to couple the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> to the transfer case input shaft with a steel coupler sleeve that was splined to accept both shafts and couple them together. An internal snap ring inside the coupler sleeve controlled the sleeve's position on the shafts, with circular seals in the adapter sealing the transmission from the transfer case.|$|E

50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: the front differential, rear differential, center differential, the transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. The transmission, front differential, center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> feeds power into the front/center differential assembly (the center differential is contained within the front differential). The front differential distributes the power to the front wheels, while the center differential distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to the rear differential. In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|E

30|$|It {{is noted}} that, if the most-desired speed range is {{far away from}} the most-used speed, the {{transmission}} ratio could be relatively large. In such a situation, the output torque at the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> may not match the most-used torque; thus, the proposed design method cannot be applied properly. However, in this case, by using a proper speed that is closer to the most-used speed as a replacement of the most-desired speed, it will make the transmission ratio smaller. In this way, although fuel consumption is slightly higher than the ideal situation, it will still take advantage of the working properties of an IC engine to achieve better fuel efficiency.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of key factors on the powertrain loading dynamic characteristics and fatigue damage. First, the engine and the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> torque of a multi-axle vehicle powertrain system were measured by proving grounds (PG) testing and analyzed with a conclusion that the powertrain loading changes were mainly related to three key factors: the mean engine torque, the harmonic engine torque, and the vibration properties of the system. Subsequently, a dynamic model considering the three factors was built and validated by the test data. Finally, fatigue damage of shaft parts and gear parts were calculated to investigate the influence degrees of the three factors. The results show that, the harmonic engine torque and the vibration properties of the powertrain system have a great influence on the fatigue damage of shaft parts, and the mean engine torque is the main factor causing the fatigue damage of gear parts...|$|E
50|$|The AW4 is {{also used}} behind the 2.5 L (150 CID) AMC Straight-4 engine. It has a {{removable}} bell housing with a mount for the crankshaft position sensor.

Some sources state that the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline change occurred for the 1990 model year. The change most likely occurred during the 1990 model run with early 1990 models receiving 21-spline transmission and later models receiving 23-spline. If swapping transmissions in 1990 model year vehicles either swap the transfer case as well or make sure to check spline count. The input on the transfer case can also be changed to match the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> spline count.

50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an idler wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and <b>output</b> <b>shafts.</b> The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input <b>shaft),</b> therefore the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the idler wheel.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{powershift}} automated manual transmission, i. e. an automated manual transmission with a torque gap filler, which essentially integrates, in a typical manual transmission layout, a torque gap filler assembly {{with the aim of}} reducing the torque gap that occurs during gearshifts. The torque gap filler consists of an additional mechanical link between the engine and the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft,</b> thus enabling the engine power to flow through this parallel path also when the launch clutch is disengaged, with clear benefits in terms of both sportiness and passenger comfort. This paper is the first part of a two-part study which, after a general description of the trans- mission architecture and its working principle, examines a practical implementation of the torque gap filler concept; the additional mechanical components and their integration into a traditional automated manual transmission are presented. Then, kinematic analysis and dynamic analysis of the transmission are proposed. The evolution of the transmission speeds are studied in the whole working range of the vehicle; the equations of motion are derived and used to show the effect of the torque gap filler on the torque transmitted to the wheels and consequently on the vehicle acceleration during gearshifts.

40|$|The {{transmission}} {{is probably the}} drivetrain component with {{the greatest impact on}} driveability of an automatic transmission equipped vehicle. Since the driver only has an indirect influence on the gear shift timing, except for situations like kick-down accelerations, it is desirable to improve shift quality as perceived by the driver. However, improving shift quality is a problem normally diametrically opposed to minimizing transmission clutch energy dissipation. The latter has a great impact on transmission lifetime, and has to be defined and taken into consideration along with the notion of shift quality. The main focus of this thesis is the modeling of a drivetrain of an automatic transmission vehicle, and the implementation in MatLab/Simulink, including the first to second gear upshift. The resulting plant based on the derived equations is validated using data from a test vehicle equipped with a torque sensor located at the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> The shaft torque is more or less proportional to the driveline jerk, and hence of great interest for control purposes. Control strategies are discussed and a PID controller structure is developed to control the first to second gear upshift, as opposed to the traditional open-loop upshift control. Furthermore, the proposed controller structure uses the transmission output torque and the differential speed of the engaging clutch as inputs, to control the clutch pressure and the engine output torque, respectively. The structure is unsophisticated and transparent compared to other approaches, but shows great theoretical results in terms of improved shift quality and decreased clutch wear...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the noncircular {{cylinder}} becomes made {{practical use}} {{of as the}} workpiece of a noncircular gear, the shaft of power <b>transmission,</b> the <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> of a linear motion actuator without rotation and the positive cam for generating a reciprocating motion. 　In this paper, two devices are newly developed for generating noncircular cylinders {{by means of the}} linear edged tool to be turning at high speed. The one is the device for generating the elliptic cylinder to which is applied such a kinematic principle that the straight line perpendicularly fixed on the coupler link of the revolving block slider crank mechanism envelops the ellipse. The other is the device for generating the polygonal cylinder to which is applied such a kinematic principle that the central line of the coupler slider of the reciprocating block double-slider crank mechanism turned round a point envelops the polygonal profile. 　The practical constructions of these device for cutting noncircular cylinders with acceptable accuracy are presented. The characteristics of the displacement and the velocity of the point of generation and those of influence coefficients are clarified. The condition for the driving gear of the elliptic cylinder generating device to make a continuous revolution, the maximum deviation of the angular displacement due to errors of kinematic constants and the condition for the polygonal profile to have cusps are formulated. 　As examples, elliptic cylinders whose lengths, major diameters and eccentricities are 140 mm, 48 mm and 0. 5 respectively and polygonal cylinders having two and three lobes whose lengths, diameters of circumscribed circles and ratios of distortion are 275 mm, 48 mm and 0. 0833 respectively have been cut by using each experimental device.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel methodology {{for evaluation of}} in service loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions. It also {{presents a}} novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals {{as an alternative to}} the cycle counting methods. Current durability testing of automatic transmission output shafts uses 50 000 stall torque cycles from zero to wide open throttle. In the majority of cases, these requirements lead to an over design that can result in an unnecessarily bulky transmission system. As a solution to this problem a novel methodology for evaluation of loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions was developed. The methodology is based on real world loading conditions and therefore leads to a more realistic estimation of the fatigue life of shafts. The methodology can be used as a tool for shaft optimisation in different drive conditions. Using the developed methodology the effects of different road conditions on the fatigue life of a <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> were compared. Four routes having differing driving conditions were investigated and of those routes, the route with most stop-start events resulted in the greatest reduction in fatigue life. A novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals was also developed. The methodology is based on knowledge of the bandwidth and dynamic range of the expected in-service load signal. This novel methodology allows significant reduction of the volume of data to be acquired. It preserves the time sequence of peaks and valleys of the signal, which is vital in the case of fatigue analysis. This is in contrast to current methods based on cycle counting. Cycle counting methods achieve high data reduction but do not preserve the time sequence of the signal. The developed novel methodology has been validated on the newly developed data acquisition system capable of real time data acquisition and compression of shaft torque signal. The performed tests show that the proposed one-channel low cost system equipped with 1 GB compact flash card can store well over 10 000 hrs of load history...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{advanced}} modelling {{and control of}} energy efficient automotive drivetrains with torque-fill capability during gearshifts. The literature discussing automotive transmission technology, in particular manual transmissions, automated manual transmissions (AMTs) and dual clutch transmissions (DCTs), with the respective gearshift control methodologies, is reviewed in detail. To increase the overall drivetrain efficiency and {{address the problem of}} AMT torque interruption during the shift transients, a novel transmission layout, named as ‘ 6 + 2 ’ in the remainder of the thesis, is introduced. The ‘ 6 + 2 ’ is based on the hybridisation of an AMT. In this layout the torque-fill functionality is achieved via an embedded electric motor drive, which is connected to the <b>transmission</b> <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> The gearshift performance of the ‘ 6 + 2 ’ is analysed and compared to that of the DCT of a case study high performance passenger car, through a high-fidelity model-based method and objective gearshift performance indicators. The gearshift simulation models are validated in terms of longitudinal acceleration profiles, with gearshift test data provided by the industrial sponsors of the project, Oerlikon Graziano (Italy) and Vocis Driveline Controls (UK). The analysis shows that with the current ‘ 6 + 2 ’ prototype full torque-fill is supported for gearshifts of up to 40 % of driver torque demand. This thesis proposes a novel optimal gearshift controller for the clutch reengagement phase of the ‘ 6 + 2 ’. The controller is designed with the purpose of simultaneously reducing clutch energy dissipation and providing smooth clutch engagement. The computationally efficient structure of this controller facilitates its real-vehicle implementation. The performance of the controller is evaluated on the gearshift simulator and compared to that of the conventional gearshift controller of the prototype ‘ 6 + 2 ’. Significant reductions (53 % on the average) in clutch dissipation energy are achieved with the proposed control structure. A similar optimal controller and a model predictive controller are designed and successfully assessed for the inertia phase of the case study DCT. The objectives of these advanced formulations are tuneable reductions clutch dissipation losses, smooth clutch engagement, and capability of handling variations in the oncoming clutch torque, determined by the driver input on the accelerator pedal...|$|E

5000|$|While the {{standard}} (Type 1 or T1) Torsen supports a static torque ratio of 50:50; i.e., input torque is supported equally across both <b>output</b> <b>shafts,</b> the T1 has a Torque Bias Ratio (TBR) of 2.7-4:1; i.e., it allows about 3 to 4 times the torque {{to be supplied}} to the most tractive <b>output</b> <b>shaft</b> than that {{is available on the}} least tractive shaft or, a torque split of between 25% to 75%. However, by nature the T1 Torsen is locked under most circumstances (<b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> locked together). Only when the TBR is reached (i.e., there is a greater torque difference across the <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> than can be supported by the TBR) do the <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> turn relative to each other, and the differential unlocks. This characteristic results in a relatively free torque movement between both outputs of the (centre) differential, within the limits of the TBR. Thus the static torque distribution of the T1 Torsen in a centre differential installation, rather than being 50:50, will mirror the weight distribution (both static and dynamic) of the vehicle due to the traction available at either (front:rear) <b>output</b> <b>shaft.</b> In a standard car, this is desirable from the perspective of stability, acceleration and traction, but can be undesirable in terms of handling (understeer). While {{the standard}} quattro Torsen T1 with 2.7:1 TBR is more than sufficient in most conditions, Torsen T1 differentials with higher TBRs (4:1) are available and can further limit understeer by supporting a wider torque split. A better solution, however, is to apportion a torque split directly between both <b>output</b> <b>shafts</b> (front & rear) and for this reason Audi has adopted the Type 3 (T3) Torsen design in the latest generations of quattro.|$|R
