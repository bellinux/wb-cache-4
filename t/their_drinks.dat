5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked <b>their</b> <b>drinks</b> and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{enters a}} country pub and {{unexpectedly}} meets Audrey {{and her daughter}} Gail. Upon seeing them, he pretends he is his own identical twin brother. Neither Audrey or Gail are fooled and Lewis offers to pay for <b>their</b> <b>drinks.</b> He then leaves the pub and heads to Coronation Street. Lewis visits Peter Barlow, apologises for stealing from him and returns the money he took with an extra £1000 as compensation. Lewis then goes to Audrey's salon and he tells her he {{did not mean to}} hurt her. He asks Audrey to drive him to the police station to prove how sorry he is. After he is given bail, Lewis enters the Rovers Return and is punched by Deirdre. Lewis faces hostility from Audrey's grandson, David (Jack P. Shepherd) upon his return to the salon. He begs Audrey for forgiveness but she throws him out. Lewis sends her flowers and Audrey visits his address and finds he is living in a bedsit. David's wife, Kylie (Paula Lane), introduces herself to Lewis and he defends her against Brian Packham's (Peter Gunn) accusations that she is giving her son the wrong food.|$|E

25|$|Rum {{started to}} play an {{important}} role in the political system; candidates attempted to influence the outcome of an election through their generosity with rum. The people would attend the hustings to see which candidate appeared more generous. The candidate was expected to drink with the people to show he was independent and truly a republican. In the 1833 Mississippi state senate election, one candidate, Judge Edward Turner, poured his drinks and socialized with the people. He was more personal and it appeared as if he was going to win. The other candidate, a Methodist parson named Dick Stewart, announced he would not be pouring <b>their</b> <b>drinks</b> and they could have as much as they wanted; Dick Stewart won.|$|E
25|$|Using {{clues to}} retrace their steps, the trio travel to a {{hospital}} where they discover they were drugged with Rohypnol ("roofies"), causing their memory loss, and that {{they came to the}} hospital from a chapel. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a stripper named Jade, despite being in a long-term relationship with his abusive, domineering girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, whose real name is Tyler. They are then arrested by the police for stealing the police cruiser. After being told that the Mercedes has been impounded, the trio is released when they unknowingly volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk. Chow jumps out of the trunk, beats the trio up with a crowbar and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged <b>their</b> <b>drinks</b> to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be ecstasy.|$|E
500|$|The {{local people}} have {{traditionally}} utilized {{material from the}} forest, whether for use in their architecture, to make pirogues (dugout canoes), to provide fiber for weaving, to provide firewood, to gather leaves for traditional medicine, or to flavor <b>their</b> <b>drinks.</b> [...] Most of the residents are subsistence rice farmers who cultivate irrigated paddies in valleys or who plant on hillsides that have been cleared and burned (slash and burn agriculture, known locally as tavy). [...] The swamps which formerly covered vast areas of Andapa Basin have been converted to rice paddies which are intensively cultivated; however the Tsimihety traditionally practice slash and burn techniques on the hillsides in preference to irrigated rice fields. [...] Coffee was an important cash crop before market prices fell in the 1970s, but vanilla remains an important crop for the area. [...] Until the mid-2000s, vanilla prices were high, but they have since fallen off significantly. [...] The crash of vanilla prices, along with a rapidly growing population and steady decrease in cultivatable land, has resulted in widespread and extreme poverty. [...] Between January and April, before the main rice harvest, {{many people in the}} region do not receive enough food to eat. [...] The Sava Region, which includes Marojejy, is the poorest region in Madagascar, and in 2011, continued rises in global food prices—particularly that of imported rice—has made obtaining food more difficult for rural families.|$|E

2500|$|As time passed, {{interest}} in the Tom Collins diminished and its origins became lost. Early on during the 1920s Prohibition in the United States, the American journalist and student of American English H. L. Mencken noted:The origin of the ... Tom-Collins ... remains to be established; the historians of alcoholism, like the philologists, have neglected them. But the essentially American character of [...] is obvious, {{despite the fact that}} a number have gone over into English. The English, in naming <b>their</b> <b>drinks,</b> commonly display a far more limited imagination. Seeking a name, for example, for a mixture of whiskey and soda- water, the best they could achieve was whiskey-and-soda. The Americans, introduced to the same drink, at once gave it the far more original name of high-ball.|$|E
2500|$|Additional club staff {{almost always}} {{includes}} a club manager, as dancer-run clubs are rare. [...] One or more managers {{are responsible for}} day-to-day operations {{on behalf of the}} club owner. Managerial responsibilities include money handling, inventory, and hiring and firing of employee staff and contractors. [...] The manager role can be split between a general manager and one or more floor managers. If a bar is present, one or more dedicated bartenders might be employed to assist customers by preparing <b>their</b> <b>drinks</b> or by storing drinks that customers bring into BYOB clubs. In some localities bartenders are required to have an individual permit to serve alcohol. House moms monitor dancers on behalf of the management. [...] A house mom can be particularly beneficial where staff is otherwise male, given her potential to relate to female dancers in a way that male members of staff may not be able to. Not every club will have a house mom.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "lock-in" [...] {{is when a}} pub owner lets {{drinkers}} stay in the pub {{after the}} legal closing time, {{on the theory that}} once the doors are locked, it becomes a private party rather than a pub. Patrons may put money behind the bar before official closing time, and redeem <b>their</b> <b>drinks</b> during the lock-in so no drinks are technically sold after closing time. The origin of the British lock-in was a reaction to 1915 changes in the licensing laws in England and Wales, which curtailed opening hours to stop factory workers from turning up drunk and harming the war effort. Since 1915, the UK licensing laws had changed very little, with comparatively early closing times. The tradition of the lock-in therefore remained. Since the implementation of Licensing Act 2003, premises in England and Wales may apply to extend their opening hours beyond 11pm, allowing round-the-clock drinking and removing much of the need for lock-ins. Since the smoking ban, some establishments operated a lock-in during which the remaining patrons could smoke without repercussions but, unlike drinking lock-ins, allowing smoking in a pub was still a prosecutable offence.|$|E

5000|$|Another method {{involves}} various {{cups and}} one community cup. A community cup is first {{placed in the}} center of the table. Each player has their own individual cup, and these cups are placed around the community cup, forming a ring around the community cup (much like a flower pattern). Players fill their individual cups with a shot of <b>their</b> <b>drink,</b> and pour a small amount of <b>their</b> <b>drink</b> into the community cup (various drinks can be used to play, so the community cup may house a mixture of different drinks). A shooter begins by bouncing a quarter towards the cups. If the quarter lands in a player's cup, the player must drink his/her shot, refill the cup, and place it back with the rest. If the shooter lands the quarter in to the community cup, every player must reach into the center and <b>drink</b> <b>their</b> shot. The last player to finish <b>their</b> <b>drink</b> must then drink the community cup. If the shooter makes his/her shot on the first attempt, they may shoot again until they miss. If they miss on the first attempt, they must pass the quarter to the next player on their left. This game is commonly called Ponderosa.|$|R
