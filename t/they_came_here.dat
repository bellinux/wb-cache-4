25|$|The middle row {{dating back}} to the 18th century is {{attributed}} to André Gonçalves. It depicts various stages of the Passion of Christ interlaced with allegoric paintings captioned with Biblical passages. These pieces were old processional banners, commissioned in 1761 by the Santa Casa da Misericórdia of Lisbon from Gonçalves; later on they were taken apart and arranged as pictures in the sacristy. In the upper frieze the paintings are of scenes from the life of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. <b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> from the now-defunct Jesuit novitiate at Cotovia and are attributed to Domingos da Cunha, the Cabrinha.|$|E
500|$|India toured South Africa in December 2013 {{for three}} ODIs and two Tests. Kohli {{averaged}} 15.50 in the ODIs, including a duck. In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa and batting at 4 {{for the first}} time, Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, [...] "The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. I think he [...] showed great discipline and responsibility. It reminds me of Sachin Tendulkar when <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in 1996." [...] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match. India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think of myself as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence Brown wrote: [...] "Spielberg's {{decision}} {{to present the}} invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which {{did not exist in}} the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'".|$|E

2500|$|Kosmodemyanskaya {{joined the}} Komsomol in 1938. In October 1941, still {{a high school}} student in Moscow, she volunteered for a {{partisan}} unit. To her mother, who tried to dissuade her, she answered [...] "What can I do when the enemy is so close? If <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> I {{would not be able to}} continue living." [...] Zoya was assigned to the partisan unit 9903 (Staff of the Western Front). Of the one thousand people who joined the unit in October 1941 only half survived the war. At the village of Obukhovo near Naro-Fominsk, Kosmodemyanskaya and other partisans crossed the front line and entered territory occupied by the Germans. They mined roads and cut communication lines. On November 27, 1941 Zoya received an assignment to burn the village of Petrischevo, where a German cavalry regiment was stationed.|$|E
2500|$|When Bryant {{joined the}} Lakers in camp, O'Neal told reporters Bryant should {{look to be}} more of a passer than a scorer until Bryant's knee was fully healed. Bryant responded that he knew how to play the guard position, and O'Neal should worry about the low post. O'Neal responded, [...] "Just ask Karl and Gary why <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>here.</b> One person. Not two. One. Period." [...] O'Neal agreed that Bryant could handle playing guard, but Bryant needed advice on how to play team ball. O'Neal added that he would voice his {{opinions}} as he saw fit because the Lakers were his team. He said that if Bryant, who would be a free agent at the season's end, didn't like what O'Neal had to say, Bryant should just opt out since O'Neal said [...] "I ain't going nowhere." [...] Jackson told the team to not discuss the issue further with reporters.|$|E
