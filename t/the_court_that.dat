5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|After the {{telephone}} calls, Bamber {{made his way}} by car to the farmhouse, as did PS Bews, PC Myall and PC Saxby from Witham Police Station, passing Bamber on Pages Lane. They told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> he was driving much slower than them. Bamber's cousin, Ann Eaton, testified that Bamber was normally a fast driver.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> {{the kind}} of violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did}} not believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
50|$|When {{looking at}} <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>that</b> have {{ruled in favor}} of children’s best {{interests}} there is no clear standard for defining children’s best interests. When looking at <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>that</b> have {{ruled in favor of}} parental free speech rights, the children’s best interests were not considered.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> lowest <b>courts</b> in <b>the</b> {{country are}} all state courts (there is no {{federal court in}} this group). They include (i) <b>the</b> Magistrate <b>Courts</b> <b>that</b> handle English law cases (ii) <b>the</b> Customary <b>Courts</b> <b>that</b> handle Customary law cases and (iii) <b>the</b> Sharia <b>Courts</b> <b>that</b> handle Sharia law cases.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{petitions}} {{filed by}} the appellant, Kevin James Lisle (Lisle), were procedurally barred. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> determined <b>that</b> a petitioner cannot present new evidence of mitigating circumstances {{in order to prove}} actual innocence of the death penalty. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> claims of Lisle did not warrant relief and upheld <b>the</b> district <b>court</b> ruling...|$|R
5|$|Duyệt {{and fellow}} {{southern}} general Le Chat then resigned their positions, but the emperor rejected their offers. Duyệt wanted a {{post in the}} capital, but was not given one, in part of suspicions among <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> the general could launch a palace coup, not unlike many insurrections in Vietnam's past. Duyệt {{was sent back to}} southern Vietnam, far from the royal seat.|$|E
5|$|Franz Ferdinand was an {{advocate}} of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom {{could have been a}} bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{never left}} the box, but instead conferred {{together}} and found Thornton not guilty in six minutes. They were then resworn on the rape allegation. The prosecution informed <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> it had no evidence to offer on that count, and Mr Justice Holroyd directed the jury to find the prisoner not guilty of rape, which they did. Thornton was set free.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>court's</b> {{determination}} was {{not clearly}} erroneous. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> held <b>that</b> there was sufficient {{evidence to support}} a finding that the African-American citizens had been invidiously excluded from the political process by the county's system of elections. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sheer geographic size of the county {{made it difficult for}} the African-American citizens to get to polling places or to campaign for office. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> elections system submerged the will of the African-American citizens and thus denied their access to <b>the</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> requirement that candidates run for specific seats enhanced the African-American citizens' lack of access because it prevented a cohesive political group from concentrating on a single candidate.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> {{determined}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Board did not err in its decision. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> in-service {{diagnosis was}} [...] "pain" [...] {{and that the}} current diagnosis was [...] "pain" [...] as well. Pointing to 38 U.S.C. §1110, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> noted <b>that</b> service connection is awarded for [...] "disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted {{in the line of}} duty." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> noted <b>that</b> pain often warrants separate and even additional consideration when rating an already service connected disability. However, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> stated <b>that</b> for general purposes of service connection that pain alone, without a diagnosed or identifiable underlying malady or condition, does not in and of itself constitute a disability for which service connection can be granted.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> first held <b>that</b> {{copyright}} law did not preempt contract law. Under <b>the</b> 1991 Supreme <b>Court</b> case Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> held <b>that</b> a telephone directory was not protectable through copyright. In this case, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> assumes <b>that</b> {{a database of}} a telephone directory was equally not protectable. However, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> held <b>that</b> a contract could confer among the parties similar rights since those rights are not [...] "equivalent {{to any of the}} exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright".|$|R
5|$|As drive-through {{penalties}} are not admissible for appeal, McLaren's lawyer Mark Phillips QC {{attempted to}} convince <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> since the penalty {{was in the}} form of time added on, the case was valid. They presented the previous case of Vitantonio Liuzzi at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, specifically the FIA's claim that the presiding chief steward at the race, Tony Scott Andrews, had admitted fault in awarding the penalty to Liuzzi. Andrews denied the FIA's allegation. McLaren went on to use the case as a precedent for the Spa incident. The Court stated that this analogy was invalid, since in Liuzzi's case the admissibility of his appeal was not contested.|$|E
5|$|As for the BIA's assurance, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>that</b> {{only meant}} that the {{termination}} act did not terminate the claim, not that {{the statute of limitations}} would not begin to run. Because the Court of Appeals had only held that the statute of limitation did not apply, not that it would not bar the claim if it applied, and the District Court had held the claim barred, the Court remanded to the Court of Appeals to pass on that conclusion of the District Court.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he}} had warned them that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
50|$|It is {{acknowledged}} in <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> separate Eastaugh (1946-1949), Darby (1965) and Chilvers (1958) inventions pre-dated the Schweitzer/Drake patent (1968).|$|R
50|$|The first {{finding of}} <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> law placed content and speaker based {{restrictions}} on speech. Citing Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> noted <b>that</b> these restrictions warranted heightened judicial scrutiny.|$|R
50|$|The {{case was}} then heard by <b>the</b> California <b>Court</b> of Appeals, First District, Division 2. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{debate in the}} {{scientific}} community was on-going over the validity of repressed memory. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> stated <b>that</b> Taus failed to carry her burden as to the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> ruled <b>that</b> Taus had made a valid claim against Loftus and Shapiro for invasion of privacy. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> also noted <b>that</b> Taus failed to show that the publication of the article invaded her privacy, but comments made at seminars or conferences were actionable. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> stated <b>that</b> Taus did not prove the falsity of the statements published, but that some of the defamation claim (as to Loftus) was still supportable. Again, the defendants appealed.|$|R
5|$|Bamber told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that,</b> {{during his}} visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{visited the}} farm {{on the evening}} of Tuesday, 6 August. He told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> his parents {{suggested}} to Sheila that evening that the boys be placed in day-time foster care with a local family. Bamber said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Ferguson, told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.|$|E
5|$|Bridget {{bonds with}} Chris Knight (Luke Mitchell) and she asks {{him to the}} school formal. She joins him in a hotel room, where Chris tries to {{pressure}} her into having sex with him. He turns aggressive and Bridget pushes him away and flees the hotel, not knowing that Chris hit his head. Chris later dies in hospital and Bridget's father confesses to the police that he attacked Chris to protect Bridget. Steve is charged with murder, but Bridget goes to his trial and tells <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> she pushed Chris in self-defense. Throughout the ordeal, Declan is a big support to Bridget and they begin a relationship.|$|E

50|$|Loh Wai Kong v Government of Malaysia (1979) 2 MLJ 33 {{was a case}} {{heard in}} <b>the</b> Federal <b>Court</b> of Malaysia. Loh Wai Kong sought a ruling from <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>that</b> Malaysian {{citizens}} were entitled to travel overseas as a fundamental right under Article 5 of the Constitution. <b>The</b> Federal <b>Court</b> ruled <b>that</b> no such right existed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> ruled <b>that</b> Redbox {{sufficiently}} pleaded Universal violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> stated <b>that</b> Universal {{had convinced}} others to boycott Redbox in distribution of Universal DVDs, which damaged Redbox's {{ability to compete}} in the DVD rental and sales market. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> was convinced <b>that</b> Universal's actions were anti-competitive in nature, and thus violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.|$|R
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> he had taken the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|During {{the penalty}} {{phase of the}} trial, Bundy took {{advantage}} of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, {{in the presence of}} a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified on his behalf during both trials, and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> they were legally married.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{defense counsel}} was partly {{to be blamed}} for the {{document}} destruction because it had failed in its duty to locate and preserve relevant information. In addressing the role of counsel in litigation, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> stated <b>that</b> [...] "counsel must take affirmative steps to monitor compliance so that all sources of discoverable information are identified and searched". Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> concluded <b>that</b> attorneys are obligated to ensure all relevant documents are discovered, retained, and produced. Further, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> suggested <b>that</b> litigators must guarantee that relevant documents are preserved by instituting a litigation hold on key data, and safeguarding archival media.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> held <b>that</b> Zeidenberg did {{accept the}} offer by {{clicking}} through. <b>The</b> <b>court</b> noted <b>that</b> he [...] "had no choice, because the software splashed the license {{on the screen}} and would not let him proceed without indicating acceptance". <b>The</b> <b>court</b> stated <b>that</b> Zeidenberg could have rejected the terms of the contract and returned <b>the</b> software. <b>The</b> <b>court,</b> in addition, noted the ability and [...] "the opportunity to return goods can be important" [...] under the Uniform Commercial Code.|$|R
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that</b> she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|Manning told <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>that,</b> {{during her}} {{interaction}} with WikiLeaks on IRC and Jabber, she developed {{a friendship with}} someone there, believed to be Julian Assange (although neither knew the other's name), which she said made her feel she could be herself. Army investigators found 14 to 15 pages of encrypted chats, in unallocated space on her MacBook's hard drive, between Manning and someone believed to be Assange. She wrote {{in a statement that}} the more she had tried to fit in at work, the more alienated she became from everyone around her. The relationship with WikiLeaks had given her a brief respite from the isolation and anxiety.|$|E
5000|$|Risa Goluboff {{wrote that}} the NAACPs {{intention}} was to show <b>the</b> <b>Courts</b> <b>that</b> African American children were the victims of school segregation and their futures were at risk. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> ruled <b>that</b> both Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), which had established the [...] "separate but equal" [...] standard in general, and Cumming v. Richmond County Board of Education (1899), which had applied that standard to schools, were unconstitutional.|$|R
