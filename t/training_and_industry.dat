50|$|The {{early years}} of the Nicaraguan Revolution were {{strongly}} influenced by Cuba. The Sandinista leaders acknowledged that the FSLN owed a great debt to the communist island. The relationship was made possible because of Cuba's commitment to the strategy of revolutionary guerrilla warfare. Once the Sandinistas assumed power, Cuba gave Nicaragua military advice, as well as aid in education, health care, vocational <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>industry</b> building for the impoverished Nicaraguan economy. In return, Nicaragua provided Cuba with grains and other foodstuffs. Once the Sandinistas assumed power, Cuba began sending aid, and it became an essential component of Nicaraguan development strategy. Cuban aid was more beneficial than most countries' because it {{came in the form of}} grants and unconditional loans. (Roberto Perez, 1987) During the Somoza period, Nicaragua had been nearly 90% dependent on the US for assistance. In 1980, Cuban-Nicaraguan aid relations became formalized with the formation of the Mixed Commission for Scientific, Economic and Technical Cooperation. This commission is represented on the Cuban side by the State of Committee for Economic Cooperation and on the Nicaraguan side by the Ministry of Economic Cooperation. New aid agreements were negotiated every year within the framework of the commission. In this context the commission provides a vehicle for Nicaragua to present its various needs and for Cuba to evaluate which ones they can fulfill. From 1979 to 1987, the commission oversaw approximately 300 million dollars (US) in aid to Nicaragua, which according to Prevost does not include military aid or the cost of schooling Nicaraguans in Cuba.|$|E

50|$|Zwickau’s {{tradition}} {{of higher education}} reaches back to the founding of a Latin school in the late thirteenth century. The origins of the vocational university, however, are more connected to the boom of mining and industrial production in Saxony in the early 1800s. The rise of coal production and processing in the region created a demand for workers {{with a high level}} of technical <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>industry</b> pushed for the development of educational training institutions. A Sunday training school for workers was opened in 1828, followed by the “Bergschule Zwickau,” a school to teach technical skills related to mining, in 1862. By 1949, the Bergschule Zwickau had developed into a full-fledged mining engineering school. Parallel to the development of the mining school, in 1897 the engineers Paul Kirchhoff and Leander Hummel founded an engineering school in cooperation with the local municipal government. In 1965, the mining engineering school and the general engineering school merged, eventually gaining the right to grant doctorates under the name “Ingenieur-Hochschule Zwickau.” In 1989, the institution assimilated a school for economics in Plauen and a plant-engineering and construction school in Glauchau, becoming a full technical university.After the reunification of Germany, there was an attempt to merge this engineering-focused technical university with Zwickau’s teacher training college into one small university. This idea, however, lacked political support in the Saxon government and did not succeed. The teacher training college was assimilated into the Technical University of Chemnitz and the engineering school was changed to a “Fachhochschule” or vocational university, with the right to grant Bachelor’s and master's degrees, but not doctorates. The name of the engineering school was then changed to the current “Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau” or Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - University of Applied Sciences.|$|E

Recognition of prior learning, on the job <b>training</b> <b>and</b> <b>industry</b> partnerships are strong factors supporting the change of delivery. The curriculum content within these programs has also changed. For example within the Business Services programs, the prerequisite and corequisite skill of touch keyboarding to an Australian Standard has moved from a core requirement in the 1990 ’s to an elective requirement in the 2000 ’s. Where a base skill becomes an elective skill, how does this effect the performance and outcomes for the learner, educator, employer and society as a whole? This paper will explore these issues and investigate the current position of standards within the VET curriculum today...|$|E
