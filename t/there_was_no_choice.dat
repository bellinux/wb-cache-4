Meissner decided in 1902 that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to build an extension connecting the new railway to a Mediterranean port nearby. Haifa was chosen for its already developed port, and because surveying, planning and some construction work for a railroad had already been done on the proposed route.|$|E

500|$|Fearing {{he could}} be toppled by the intensifying protests, Khánh met with Buddhist leaders. They asked him to repeal the new constitution, {{reinstate}} civilian rule, and remove Cần Lao Party—a secret Catholic body used by former President Ngô Đình Diệm to infiltrate and control all aspects of society—members from power, and Khánh agreed. General Trần Thiện Khiêm claimed [...] "Khánh felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept since the influence of Trí Quang {{was so great that}} he could not only turn {{the majority of the people}} against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces." [...] Khánh publicly promised to reformulate the Vũng Tàu Charter, allow protests and liberalize the press. This encouraged more demonstrations by activists, and Khánh responded with wider concessions. Under the new arrangements, the new constitution would be repealed, and the MRC would disband. Khánh also promised to create an elected legislature within a year.|$|E

500|$|Brooks {{was born}} James Lawrence Brooks on May 9, 1940 in Brooklyn, New York, United States, {{and raised in}} North Bergen, New Jersey. His parents, Dorothy Helen (née Sheinheit) and Edward M. Brooks, were both {{salespeople}} (his mother sold children's clothes; his father furniture). The Brooks family was Jewish; Edward Brooks changed his surname from Bernstein and claimed to be Irish. Brooks' father abandoned his mother {{when he found out}} she was pregnant with him, and lost contact with his son when Brooks was twelve. During the pregnancy, Brooks' father sent his wife a postcard stating that [...] "If it's a boy, name him Jim." [...] His mother died when he was 22. He has described his early life as [...] "tough" [...] with a [...] "broken home, [...] poor and sort of lonely, that sort of stuff", later adding: [...] "My father was sort of in-and-out and my mother worked long hours, so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but for me to be alone in the apartment a lot." [...] He has an older sister, Diane, who helped look after him as a child and to whom he dedicated As Good As It Gets.|$|E
500|$|Fearing {{he could}} be toppled by the intensifying protests, Khánh made concessions, {{repealing}} the new constitution and police measures, and promising to reinstate civilian rule and remove Cần Lao Partya secret Catholic organization used to infiltrate and spy on society to maintain President Ngô Đình Diệm's regimemembers from power. General Trần Thiện Khiêm later claimed [...] "Khánh felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept since the influence of Trí Quang {{was so great that}} he could not only turn {{the majority of the people}} against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces". Many senior officers, particularly the Catholic Generals Khiêm and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried what they viewed as a handing of power to the Buddhist leaders. They tried to replace Khánh with Minh, but abandoned their coup plans after failing to get an endorsement from the Americans. Khánh blamed the government instability on troublemaking by members and supporters of the Catholic-aligned Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam, usually known simply as the Đại Việt), who he accused of putting partisan plotting ahead of the national interest. Prominent officers associated with the Đại Việt included Thiệu and Khiêm. For his part, Khiêm blamed Khánh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses against the communists.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1964, after Khánh {{decided to}} take more power for himself by declaring a state of {{emergency}} and introducing a new constitution, Buddhists launched protests against the new junta, claiming that there was a plot to revive the Diêm era by predominantly Catholic groups such as Cần Lao veterans and Đại Việt supporters, pinpointing Khiêm and Thiệu, both Catholics who had been favoured by Diêm. Khánh's concessions to the Buddhists sparked opposition from Khiêm and Thiệu, who tried to remove Khánh in favour of Minh, recruiting other officers. Khiêm said [...] "Khánh felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept since the influence of [...] Trí Quang was so great that he could not only turn {{the majority of the people}} against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces". They sought out Taylor and sought a private endorsement for a coup against Khánh, but the U.S. ambassador did not want any more changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the government. This deterred Khiêm's group from toppling Khánh.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1976, he {{auditioned for}} Iron Maiden, {{eager to get}} back into [...] "a more sort of heavy rock-type vibe." [...] at the time, the band already had two guitarists, Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance, who disapproved of Murray's admittance, seeing it as a slight on their ability. The group's founder and bassist Steve Harris did not {{hesitate}} in choosing Murray over Sullivan and Rance, stating, [...] "When the others made it plain that it was either them or Dave Murray, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b> There was no way I was gonna let Dave go. Not only was he a nice bloke, he was just the best guitarist I'd ever worked with. He still is." [...] Unfortunately, after only a few months in the band, Murray was sacked following an argument with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock after a show at the Bridgehouse pub in Canning Town which led him to team up with Adrian Smith again in his band, Urchin. During his short tenure with this group, Murray recorded one single, entitled [...] "She's A Roller", after which he was asked to rejoin Iron Maiden following Dennis Wilcock's departure.|$|E
2500|$|During one {{protest in}} which {{thousands}} of people were chanting [...] "down with military dictatorship", Khánh confronted the crowd and joined the opposition in their shouting, claiming that he was not what they claimed him to be, rather than cracking down on them. Fearing he could be toppled by the momentum of the protests, Khánh asked Quang, Chau and Minh to hold talks with him at Vũng Tàu on 24 August. They refused and Khánh had to go to Saigon to try to get them to stop protesting against him, demonstrating his weakness. They asked him to repeal the new constitution, reinstate civilian rule, and remove Cần Lao members from power. They asked Khánh to announce these measures publicly, else they would organize a widespread movement of passive resistance. U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Taylor recommended that Khánh ignore the demands, as he regarded the Buddhist activists as a minority group, but Khánh thought to dampen religious tensions by agreeing to the Buddhist proposals. Khiêm claimed [...] "Khánh felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to accept, since the influence of Trí Quang was so great that he could not only turn {{the majority of the people}} against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces".|$|E
2500|$|According to Edgar, Bullfrog began merger {{talks with}} Electronic Arts in 1993. To {{get the best}} deal, he {{believed}} Bullfrog should also talk with other companies such as Sony and Virgin. He explained that Electronic Arts was the obvious choice as Bullfrog already had {{a good relationship with}} them. According to Molyneux, people started phoning Bullfrog expressing their interest in purchasing the company. This was not taken seriously until major companies, including Electronic Arts and Philips, made contact, and it was then thought that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to be purchased by one of these companies. Bullfrog was bought by Electronic Arts in early January 1995. At the time interest in acquiring Bullfrog started to grow, there were around 35 employees. By the time of Electronic Arts' acquisition, there were around 60. As a result of the acquisition, this number increased to 150 within months as Electronic Arts wanted the studio to expand and create more games. Molyneux became a Vice President of Electronic Arts and head of their Europe studio, and Edgar became Vice President of its European Studios and Bullfrog's Chairman. He described Bullfrog becoming part of a multinational company as [...] "a very big change", and worked for Electronic Arts to assist with the transition. Although Molyneux had said that Bullfrog's products would not suffer as a result of Electronic Arts' purchase, the number of games in development meant that there was less time to refine them (despite the company's growth rate), affecting their quality.|$|E

2500|$|Pittsburgh {{defensive}} end Hugh Green {{was a surprise}} selection, as the Buccaneers were considered to need help in the secondary, and were expected to pick either USC safety Ronnie Lott or UCLA safety Kenny Easley (who had already been taken by the Seattle Seahawks {{by the time of}} Tampa Bay's selection). Green's Pittsburgh team produced eight NFL starters, believed to be the most by far from any single college team. By contrast, the Georgia team that finished ahead of them in the national championship race produced only two NFL players, neither of them a starter. Personnel director Ken Herock described Green as [...] "dominating...a heavy hitter...an impact player" [...] and said that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to draft him. Scouting services described him as a 220-lb linebacker with the lateral movement of a 180-lb cornerback. It was doubly surprising that, considering their fondness for ex-USC players, the Buccaneers would pass over Lott to select a player at a position at which they already were so deeply stocked with talent. However, the staff did not deliberate long before calling his name, and soon felt him worthy of Rookie of the Year honors. With no premier defensive backs available in the second round, and with running back having been identified by the coaching staff as a problem area of the team, they selected Missouri running back James Wilder. Wilder's selection and subsequent training camp performance made starting fullback Johnny Davis expendable, and he was traded to San Francisco for James Owens. With their middle-round picks traded away, West Texas A cornerback John Holt became the Buccaneers' last selection of {{the first day of the}} draft. When McKay saw cornerbacks Holt and Johnny Ray Smith return punts, he immediately cut original Buccaneer Danny Reece, who had handled nearly every punt return in the team's first five years. Reece, who had set a league record by calling for fair catches only twice in the previous two seasons, had fallen out of favor due to several fumbles during the previous season, and never had the speed expected of a return man. Smith did make the team, but was immediately placed on injured reserve. Eighth-round pick Denver Johnson left camp unexpectedly shortly before the first preseason game, despite strong prospects of making the squad. It was later revealed that he had been accepted to law school, and chose that over a football career.|$|E
