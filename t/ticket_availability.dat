Additionally, ticket presales on the band's website were plagued with issues, as subscribing members encountered technical glitches and limited <b>ticket</b> <b>availability,</b> partially due to scalpers exploiting the system. Commencing in March 2005, the Vertigo Tour consisted of arena shows in North America and stadium shows internationally across five legs. The indoor stage replaced the heart-shaped ramp of the Elevation Tour with an elliptical one and featured retractable video curtains around the stage, while the stadium stage used a massive LED video screen. Setlists on tour varied {{more than in the}} group's past and included songs they had not played in decades. Like its predecessor, the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success, ranking as the top-earning tour of 2005 with US$260million grossed.|$|E

40|$|The spiral-down effect {{occurs when}} {{incorrect}} assumptions about customer behavior cause high-fare ticket sales, protection levels, and revenues to systematically decrease over time. If an airline decides how many seats to protect {{for sale at}} a high fare based on past high-fare sales, while neglecting {{to account for the}} fact that <b>availability</b> of low-fare <b>tickets</b> will reduce high-fare sales, then high-fare sales will decrease, resulting in lower future estimates of high-fare demand. This subsequently yields lower protection levels for high-fare <b>tickets,</b> greater <b>availability</b> of low-fare <b>tickets,</b> and even lower high-fare ticket sales. The pattern continues, resulting in a so-called spiral down. We develop a mathematical framework to analyze the process by which airlines forecast demand and optimize booking controls over a sequence of flights. Within the framework, we give conditions under which spiral down occurs. Subject classifications: Pricing: revenue management. Forecasting: estimation and control. Probability: application...|$|R

These factors are studied when a new ferry was introduced in 2013 for the traffic linkage between Umeå in Sweden and Vaasa in Finland. Statistics over the number of passengers and Finnish guest nights in Umeå was compared over the years 2011 - 2013 and an interview with the local Tourist Agency in Umeå was held. In addition, there was a survey that included passengers’ views on the ferry and the improvements that have been done. Local newspaper were also studied to get the societies’ views upon introducing Wasaline. The result that was given in this thesis indicates that improvements in transportation are highly linked to an increase in the tourism flows.

This is an ambitious reform agenda {{that seeks to}} ensure {{the free flow of}} services, investment, and skilled labor along with the free flow of goods and the freer flow of capital in the ASEAN region. For {{logistics}} services, the target is to be achieved by 2013. Liberalization and deregulation efforts in the Philippine maritime transport industry are already heading into the direction of greater participation in ASEAN economic integration even though the AEC measures have not yet been formally sanctioned by all members. This paper examines the current status of the logistics industry in the Philippines and finds out how the opening of the economy to global markets through trade and service liberalization, and now ASEAN economic integration whose culmination is the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015, impacts on the structure, conduct, and performance of the logistics industry. The industry is responding to the changes in a positive way notwithstanding its characterization as a concentrated industry dominated by a few domestic firms. Firms have become more innovative in offering quality service to consumers such as better passenger accommodation, improved <b>ticketing</b> system, and <b>availability</b> of fast-craft ferries. Freight forwarders, at least those surveyed for this study, equip themselves with information on how to adjust to a more liberalized and integrated environment. They are aware of the changes to be brought about by the AEC measures when they are fully implemented and they also have a good idea of the challenges they will face when they decide to locate in an ASEAN member country, e. g., differences in commercial practices, legal systems, and contracting procedures. The way forward involves continuing the market-oriented reforms especially liberalization of trade in services, while ensuring a healthy balancing of domestic industry interests with the requirements of economic regional integration...|$|R
