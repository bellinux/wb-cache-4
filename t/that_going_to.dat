5|$|Chamberlain's {{reputation}} remains controversial among historians, {{with the}} initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as Guilty Men, published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm. Some recent historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> war with Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready. Nevertheless, Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers.|$|E

25|$|With Zaifeng gone, Yuan Shikai and his Beiyang commanders {{effectively}} dominated Qing politics. He reasoned <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{war would}} be unreasonable and costly, especially when noting that the Qing government had a goal for constitutional monarchy. Similarly, Sun Yat-sen's government wanted a republican constitutional reform, both aiming {{for the benefit of}} China's economy and populace. With permission from Empress Dowager Longyu, Yuan Shikai began negotiating with Sun Yat-sen, who decided that his goal had been achieved in forming a republic, and that therefore he could allow Yuan to step into the position of President of the Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Rockefeller became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} over the mortgaging and sale of Rockefeller Center to Japanese interests. In 1985, the Rockefeller family mortgaged the property for $1.3 billion, with $300 million of <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the family. In 1989, 51 percent of the property, later increased to 80 percent, was sold to Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan. This action was criticized for surrendering a major U.S. landmark to foreign interests. In 2000, Rockefeller presided over the final sale of Rockefeller Center to Tishman Speyer Properties, along with the Crown family of Chicago, which ended the more than 70 years of direct family financial association with Rockefeller Center.|$|E

500|$|When Mark Satin {{was hired}} as {{director}} of the Programme in April 1967, he attempted to change its culture. [...] He also tried to change the attitude of the war resistance movement toward emigration. [...] His efforts continued after SUPA collapsed and he co-founded the Toronto Anti-Draft Programme, with largely the same board of directors, in October 1967. [...] Instead of praising self-sacrifice, he emphasized the importance of self-preservation and self-development to social change. [...] Rather than sympathizing with pacifists' and radicals' strategic concerns, he rebutted them, telling The New York Times that massive emigration of draft-age Americans could help end the war, and telling another reporter <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jail was bad public relations.|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{made himself}} {{available}} to the public every day except Sunday, receiving delegations from the front porch of his home. The railroads subsidized the visitors with low excursion rates—the pro-silver Cleveland Plain Dealer disgustedly stated <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Canton had been made [...] "cheaper than staying at home". Delegations marched through the streets from the railroad station to McKinley's home on North Market Street. Once there, they crowded close to the front porch—from which they surreptitiously whittled souvenirs—as their spokesman addressed McKinley. The candidate then responded, speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation. The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks; even the spokesman's remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative. This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him, as had happened to Blaine in 1884.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{name is a}} play of {{the title}} of the NBC sitcom, I Dream of Jeannie. The scene in which Stewie and Brian destroy the record is nearly {{identical}} to a scene in the movie Office Space in which the characters destroy a printer, including use of the same song. Peter makes Jesus admit that he is the messiah by threatening to urinate over albums of Christian artist Amy Grant. Peter attempts to top Jesus' story about his crucifixion during a dinner conversation with a story about how he and his friends [...] "got wrecked on Southern Comfort" [...] before going to see The Chronicles of Riddick. George W. Bush explains to the American people <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> war was correct because he answers to Jesus Christ, then Peter and Jesus interrupt him to disagree with him, similar to a scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Jesus is invited to the Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno.|$|E

500|$|Lord Somers, {{following}} his dismissal as Lord Chancellor, introduced an Act in 1706 which [...] "became {{the most important}} act of law reform which the 18th century produced". The Act significantly amended the existing law and court procedure, and while {{most of it was}} aimed at the common-law courts, it did affect the Chancery. For equity, the Act provided that a party trying to have his case dismissed could not do so until he had paid the full costs, rather than the nominal costs that were previously required; at the same time, the reforms the Act made to common-law procedure (such as allowing claims to be brought against executors of wills) reduced the need for parties to go to equity for a remedy. Legal historian Wilfrid Prest writes that despite these legislative enactments, the tally of which [...] "begins to look quite impressive", the old problems continued, albeit less frequently; one barrister of the time claimed <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the Court with a case worth anything less than £500 was a waste of time.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} there was {{lobbying}} against gay bathhouses blaming {{them for the}} spread of STIs, in particular HIV, and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States. Sociologist Stephen O. Murray, writes that, [...] "there was never any evidence presented <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bathhouses was a risk-factor for contracting AIDS." [...] In other countries, fears about the spread of STIs have prompted the closing of bathhouses—with their private rooms—in favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity {{takes place in the}} open, and can be observed by monitors {{whose job it is to}} enforce safer sex practices.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell {{set out for}} Spain {{on about}} 23 December 1936, dining with Henry Miller in Paris on the way. The American writer told Orwell <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight in the Civil War out of some sense of {{obligation}} or guilt was 'sheer stupidity,' and that the Englishman's ideas 'about combating Fascism, defending democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney.' A few days later, in Barcelona, Orwell met John McNair of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) Office who quoted him: [...] "I've come to fight against Fascism". Orwell stepped into a complex political situation in Catalonia. The Republican government {{was supported by a}} number of factions with conflicting aims, including the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM– Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista), the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (a wing of the Spanish Communist Party, which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.|$|E

2500|$|Latent {{learning}} {{is a form of}} learning that is not immediately expressed in an overt response; it occurs without any obvious reinforcement of the behaviour or associations that are learned. One example in fish comes from research with male three spot gouramis (Trichopodus trichopterus). [...] This species quickly form dominance hierarchies. To appease dominants, subordinates adopt a typical body posture angled at 15-60º to the horizontal, all fins folded and pale body colors. Individuals trained to associate a light-stimulus with the imminent arrival of food exhibit this associative learning by approaching the surface where the food is normally dropped immediately the light-stimulus is presented. However, if a subordinate is placed in a tank with a dominant individual and the light-stimulus is presented, the subordinate immediately assumes the submissive posture rather than approaching the surface. The subordinate has predicted <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the surface to get food would place it in competition with the dominant, and to avoid potential aggression, it immediately attempts to appease the dominant.|$|E
2500|$|After the match, Alex Ferguson praised Teddy Sheringham for his {{immediate}} impact after being brought on to replace Keane, saying: [...] "Teddy was magnificent. He has proved a point today. He {{was the key}} to victory." [...] He also complimented David Beckham on his performance in central midfield after Keane's withdrawal: [...] "Beckham took over Keane's role and was absolutely magnificent... People say <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Barcelona without Roy Keane will be a major hurdle, but I don't think so now." [...] Ryan Giggs recognised the importance of scoring the first goal early in the game, saying: [...] "It helped getting the early goal then the second. It was hard for Newcastle {{to get back into the}} game with the weather like that. After the quick goal we could relax and hit Newcastle on the break." [...] Meanwhile, Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit was pleased with the effort his players had put in, but bemoaned their mistakes allowing Manchester United an easy victory: [...] "We were punished for our mistakes. The effort was right. The players worked hard and I can't ask for more, but every time we were on top we made a mistake and that cost us two goals. In the end we had to be thankful they did not get three, four or five." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aware {{that child}} stars are often unable to {{successfully}} continue their careers into adulthood, Foster became a full-time student at Yale in fall 1980, and her acting career slowed {{down in the}} following five years. She later stated <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> college was [...] "a wonderful time of self-discovery", and changed her thoughts about acting, which she had previously thought was an unintelligent profession, but now realised that [...] "what I {{really wanted to do}} was to act and there was nothing stupid about it." [...] She continued making films on her summer vacations, and during her college years appeared in O'Hara's Wife (1982), television film Svengali (1983), John Irving adaptation The Hotel New Hampshire (1984), French film The Blood of Others (1984), and period drama Mesmerized (1986), which she also co-produced. None of them were however successful, and Foster struggled to find work after graduating in 1985. The neo-noir Siesta (1987), in which she appeared in a supporting role, was a failure. Five Corners (1987) was a moderate critical success and earned Foster an Independent Spirit Award for her performance as a woman whose sexual assaulter returns to stalk her. In 1988, Foster made her debut as a director with the episode [...] "Do Not Open This Box" [...] for the horror anthology series Tales from the Darkside, and in August appeared in the romantic drama Stealing Home (1988) opposite Mark Harmon. It was a flop, with film critic Roger Ebert even [...] "wondering if any movie could possibly be that bad".|$|E

2500|$|On March 2, 1981, Stern {{began his}} third morning job at WWDC, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was {{determined}} to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He wished for a news person to riff {{with him in the}} studio. Management paired Stern with Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore, who agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a prostitute on the air. Quivers at first [...] "thought I would come in and do the news...but it wasn't that way...he wanted someone to play off of...he wanted a real live person there with him". The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of [...] "Dial-a-Date" [...] in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. [...] "Is <b>that</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a permanent stop?" [...] asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern's contract at WWDC was terminated. He writes that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJ's on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station's ratings during his stay.|$|E
