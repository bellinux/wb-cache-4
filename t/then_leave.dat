5|$|Eric Oey of the University of California, Berkeley, {{writes that}} the novel's mysticism builds into a {{promotion}} of theosophy and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> their materialistic lives to become more spiritual. Ultimately, he writes, the concept of reincarnation is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death. Faruk of Gadjah Mada University also notes the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{cells are}} {{another example of}} {{specialized}} cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide {{an example of the}} role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> the cell.|$|E
5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon and <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is}} to demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E

5|$|In {{a three-part}} series {{published}} between February and May 1994, Brock attempts to save San Francisco {{as it is}} besieged by an army of goblins. Morbius the Living Vampire and the Demogoblin are magically transported from New York; Morbius joins Brock to defeat the goblins, led by criminal-turned-politician Charles Palentine (who wears a magic necklace which controls the goblins). Palentine uses fear of the goblin attacks to seize control {{of the city and}} convince its citizens to burn it down. Demogoblin takes the necklace, and the liberated goblins attack Palentine. Demogoblin then leads the goblins across the Golden Gate Bridge, ordering them to leap to their deaths. Demogoblin and Morbius <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> for New York. Of DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1994, Venom: Enemy Within #2 was number 286; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web {{for several days}} to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> by being carried on the wind. They follow light and {{climb to the top}} of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens high in the air and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or kiting. Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{attempts}} {{to escape from}} Sid's house, but Buzz, finally realizing he is a toy, sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next day, Woody and Sid's mutant toy creations rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys by coming to life in front of him, and he runs into his house while devastated. Woody and Buzz <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> Sid's house just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.|$|E

5|$|After {{the train}} is {{dispatched}} and enters Wonder Mountain, riders {{find themselves in a}} graveyard where zombies are roaming. At the end of the scene, riders who began facing forward see a survivor directing them to the next scene. Riders who were seated backwards do not see this transition. The next scene takes place in a house overrun by the zombies and large spiders. At the end of the scene a truck crashes into the house. Riders <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> the house and pass the survivor; this transition is again absent for backward-seated riders. The train continues to a road with zombies, where three cars with zombies on them join the riders. Two of the cars crash {{at the end of the}} scene. The train then passes through a tunnel with abandoned cars; this scene is absent for riders facing backward. Riders then battle the zombies for the final time before entering the drop track sequence. The names of the highest-scoring riders are displayed on a leader-board for this version of the attraction.|$|E
5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can be talked with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, the demon will attack. Once a demon is won over, they are given a loyalty meter which {{is influenced by the}} player's actions. If the demon is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, the demon will begin to disobey the protagonist, <b>then</b> <b>leave.</b> Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. Demon fusion is governed by a comparability system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better demon compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after a certain point in the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Nite Owl and Rorschach {{continue}} {{to uncover the}} conspiracy surrounding the death of The Comedian and the accusations that drove Manhattan into exile. They discover evidence that Veidt may be behind the plan. Rorschach writes his suspicions about Veidt in his journal, {{in which he has}} been recording his entire investigation, and mails it to New Frontiersman, a local right-wing newspaper. The pair <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> New York and confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Veidt explains his underlying plan is to save humanity from impending nuclear war between the United States and Soviet Union by faking an alien invasion in New York City, which will annihilate half the city's population. He hopes this will unite the nations against a perceived common enemy. He also reveals that he had murdered The Comedian, arranged for Dr. Manhattan's past associates to contract cancer, staged the attempt on his own life in order to place himself above suspicion, and killed Moloch in order to frame Rorschach. This was all done in an attempt to prevent his plan from being exposed. Nite Owl and Rorschach find Veidt's logic callous and abhorrent, but Veidt has already enacted his plan.|$|E

5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Feast or Fired match next. In the Feast or Fired match, four {{briefcases}} are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's contract termination. A wrestler must retrieve the briefcase and <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> the ring {{in order to}} gain official possession of the case. The participants in the bout were Scott Steiner, Senshi, B.G. James, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Lance Hoyt, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Homicide, Hernandez, Kip James, Jimmy Rave, Chris Harris, and Sonjay Dutt. The contest lasted eleven minutes and fifty-five seconds. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave and Hoyt to the ring for the contest. Williams was the first to obtain a case in the match. Kip was the second; however he threw it to his Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner B.G. James who was standing at ringside, thus giving B.G. James possession of the case. A short time later, Senshi retrieved the third case. The final case was collected by Steiner, after he took it from Kip, who had taken it from the retriever Daniels.|$|E
5|$|The good {{preservation}} of the texts in Unas' pyramid shows that they were arranged {{so as to be}} read by the Ba of Unas, as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings. The Ba would <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> the burial chamber, which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat, and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet. Included in the spells written {{on the walls of the}} antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn, which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods. At this point the Ba of Unas would face east, the direction of the sunrise, and beyond the pyramid masonry, the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally, turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will ask if she can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E

25|$|Abu Bakr's {{strategy}} was to give his generals their mission, the geographical area in which that mission would be carried out, and the resources that, could be made available for that purpose. He would <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> it to his generals to accomplish their missions in whatever manner they chose. On the other hand, Caliph Umar {{in the latter part}} of his Caliphate used to direct his generals as to where they would stay and when to move to the next target and who was to be commanding the left and right wing of the army in each particular battle. This made the phase of conquest comparatively slower but provided well-organized campaigns. Caliph Uthman used the same method as Abu Bakr: he would give missions to his generals and <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> it to them how they should accomplish it. Caliph Ali also followed the same method.|$|E
