500|$|Early {{sketches}} show a 13-story {{building with}} Ancient Egyptian ornament {{and a slight}} flaring at the top, divided visually into five sections with a lotus-blossom decorative motif. This design was never approved, as Brooks waited for {{the real estate market}} in the south Loop, still mostly warehouses, to improve. Where Root was known for the detailed ornamentation of his designs (as seen in the Rookery Building), Brooks was known for his stinginess and preference for simplicity. For the Monadnock, Brooks insisted that the architects refrain from elaborate ornamentation and produce instead [...] "the effect of solidity and strength, or a design that will produce that effect, rather than ornament for a notable appearance." [...] In an 1884 letter to Aldis, he wrote: [...] While Root was on vacation, Burnham had a draftsman create a [...] "straight up-and-down, uncompromising, unornamented facade." [...] Objecting at first, Root later threw himself into the design, declaring that the heavy lines of an Egyptian pyramid had captured his imagination and that he would [...] "throw the <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> without a single ornament".|$|E

Unfortunately, hope can only go so far." [...] Meanwhile, Michael Cragg from The Guardians music blog commented that the UK remix featuring Skepta salvages what would otherwise be a boring Diddy track. [...] "Thankfully, UK grime king, Skepta, has rescued the song by pushing Diddy to the periphery – his flow consists of going 'uh', 'Skepta' and spelling out 'D.I.D.D.Y.# – setting off a smorgasbord of sonic explosions, tightening the whole <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> and making it sound a lot darker and more thrilling than a host of US producers could manage.

500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E

However, Natasha then calls Chris {{to help with}} a problem {{and he has to}} leave Aidan, who assumes Chris has set the whole <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> {{to get out of the}} date. Aidan and Chris go out on another date, which marks the beginning of their relationship and Neighbours first ever gay couple. On 9 April 2012, Aidan and Chris shared their first on-screen kiss. The couple, who had not shown any sign of physical affection until that point, shared [...] "a rather passionate embrace" [...] during a house party. Morley told TV Week's Andrew Mercado that Chris and Aidan share the intimate moment as any other couple would do. Morley thought the kiss was just as awkward as any other kiss he had previously performed, but he and Mason spent a lot of time and effort into getting it right for their characters. Chris and Aidan's kiss marked the serial's first male gay kiss in its twenty-seven-year history. Bower had previously promised that it would not be [...] "sensationalist or token" [...] and the low-key scene earned praise from viewers on social networking sites.|$|E
500|$|Presley was {{a central}} figure in the {{development}} of rockabilly, according to music historians. Katherine Charlton even calls him [...] "rockabilly's originator", though Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that [...] " [...] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly." [...] and, according to Michael Campbell, [...] "Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit." [...] "It had been there for quite a while", says Scotty Moore. [...] "Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old." [...] However, [...] "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as [...] "essentially... an Elvis Presley construction": [...] "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [...] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [...] country". In [...] "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, [...] "a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in a McDonald's advert that aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics. Mercer elaborated on the song's in an interview: [...] "That whole thing was just an ad agency that McDonald’s hired to do a “hip commercial,” or whatever. So the kid who offered the whole <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> to us was a Shins fan." [...] Online message boards (many on Pitchfork.com) and fans of the Shins criticized the move as excessively commercialist. The band's hometown alt weekly ran an editorial titled [...] "McShins, New Corporate Suck-ass" [...] in reaction. The ad's aesthetics were criticized for straying from the company's typical upbeat themes, and fans of the band found its inclusion subversive, considering a set of the song's lyrics, which at times refer to [...] "the dirt in your fries." [...] The royalties Mercer earned from the commercial allowed him to purchase a home. In addition, the band used the money to finance a tour and relocate to Portland, Oregon, where they built a basement studio and recorded their second album, Chutes Too Narrow (2003). Mercer nevertheless [...] "recognized the detrimental capacity of linking music with advertising," [...] remarking, [...] "Imagine us playing [...] "New Slang," [...] {{and everyone in the}} audience going, 'That's the song from the McDonald's commercial — I'm loving it.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Fitzwilliam, as a landlord, reduced rents and {{cancelled}} arrears in bad times, {{as well as}} supplying cheap {{food and}} giving to the elderly free coal and blankets. He also performed his obligations in repairing rented properties and his charitable dispensations were generous but discriminating. His chaplain at Wentworth {{said that he was}} [...] "ever giving alms to the poor...the tale of woe was never told to him in vain". Fitzwilliam also supported Friendly Societies and savings banks to encourage the poor to practice thrift and self-reliance. Fitzwilliam enjoyed the life of a country gentleman; hunting, racehorse breeding and a patron of the turf. At the Doncaster races in 1827 the Duke of Devonshire turned up on the first day with a coach and six and twelve outriders, the same as Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam appeared the next day [...] "with two coaches and six, and sixteen outriders, and has kept the <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> ever since".|$|E
2500|$|The filmmakers' {{decision}} to leave Shelob for the third film meant that Faramir had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam. In the book, Faramir (like Aragorn) quickly recognizes the Ring as a danger and a temptation, and does not hesitate long before letting Frodo and Sam go. In the film, Faramir first decides that the Ring shall go to Gondor and his father Denethor, {{as a way to}} prove his worth. In the film, Faramir takes Frodo, Sam and the Ring to the Battle of Osgiliath— they do not go there in the book. Jackson winks to readers with Sam's line, [...] "By all rights we shouldn't even be here, but we are." [...] After seeing how strongly the Ring affects Frodo during the Nazgûl attack, Faramir changes his mind and lets them go. These changes reshape the book's contrast between Faramir and Boromir, who in The Fellowship of the Ring attempted to take the Ring for himself. On the other hand, (which can be seen only in the film's extended version), it is actually their father who wants the Ring and urges Boromir to get it, while Faramir only wants to prove himself to his father. Boyens contends these plot changes were needed to keep the Ring menacing. Wenham commented on the DVD documentaries that he had not read the book prior to reading the script, so the film's version of Faramir was the Faramir he knew. When he later read the book and noticed the major difference, he approached the writers about it, and they explained to him that if he did say [...] "I wouldn't pick that <b>thing</b> <b>up</b> even if it lay by the wayside", it would basically strip the One Ring of all corruptive power.|$|E
