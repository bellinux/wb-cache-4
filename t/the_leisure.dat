5|$|Nunavut Tourism did not, as of 2002, produce {{detailed}} {{statistics about}} tourism numbers, trends and characteristics. However, by 2010, this {{appeared to have}} changed, with Nunavut Tourism providing media outlets with general figures on trends in tourism in Nunavut. Tourism brings approximately CAD $30 million to Nunavut's economy each year according to Nunavut Tourism, with one in five of its tourists arriving on cruise ships. Between June and October 2008, 33,378 people visited Nunavut by air and sea, according to the territory's Department of Economic Development and Transportation. This is an almost 16 percent increase {{on the number of}} people who visited Nunavut by air and sea during the same period in 2006, which was 28,802 people. The average age of people arriving in Nunavut was 46 during the period in 2008 that the Department of Economic Development and Transportation conducted its survey, and the majority of visitors were in the territory for business purposes. 96 percent of all business travellers entering the territory were domestic travellers (Canadian residents). However, among <b>the</b> <b>leisure</b> traveller sub-group, the proportion of domestic travellers declines - Canadians make up only 72 percent of <b>the</b> <b>leisure</b> traveller arrival numbers, with travellers from the United States (20 percent) and other countries (8 percent) making up the difference. September and July account for 46 percent of arrivals, making them the busiest arrival months.|$|E

5|$|Rodis's input in {{developing}} the early character and costume designs was significant. Shatner praised his costume designs as being futuristic but plausible and {{in keeping with the}} continuity established in previous Star Trek films. After being disappointed by the costume designers approached to realize Rodis' ideas, Shatner suggested that Rodis become the costume designer as well. Bennett hired Dodie Shepard as the costume supervisor; Shepard's role was to oversee the costume fabrication and keep track of the clothes during filming. To save on costs, Shepard clothed extras with existing items from Western Costume's warehouses. The constrained budget meant Shatner could not completely redesign the Starfleet uniforms, but Rodis created new brown field uniforms for the film's location scenes as well as <b>the</b> <b>leisure</b> clothes the crew wears during shore leave.|$|E

5|$|Sociology {{of leisure}} {{is the study}} of how humans {{organize}} their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as sport, tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work–leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work–leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. This area of sociology began with Thorstein Veblen's Theory of <b>the</b> <b>Leisure</b> Class.|$|E
5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate <b>the</b> <b>leisure</b> time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E

5|$|A {{railway system}} {{formerly}} known as the North Borneo Railway was established in 1896 by the British North Borneo Company. It was built for the main purpose of transporting commodities from the Interior Division to the port in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu) during the British occupation. The railway line connects Tanjung Aru in Kota Kinabalu to Tenom and several other towns in between, and it is the only railway system operating in East Malaysia. Today, the railway line is known as the Western Line and managed by the Sabah State Railway, providing daily services for commuters, travellers, as well as for cargo transportation. A separate company operates <b>the</b> <b>leisure</b> tour also called the North Borneo Railway, which caters mainly for tourists.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1998, {{it became}} clear that Braathens had {{increased}} capacity by 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several large cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes.

In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. Accumulated cabin load for Color Air was 32%, with 116,176 passengers. In {{the course of the last}} quarter of 1998, Color Air lost NOK91 million, or NOK1 million each day.
