25|$|In its {{depiction}} of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, {{which he did}} by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching on a holstered gun. This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> performances and character reactions, create a feel of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful landscapes. Leone also incorporated music to heighten up the tension and pressure {{before and during the}} film's many gunfights.|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything wrong with that approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E

A writer from USA Today complimented her recital of both songs, writing [...] "Carey certainly earned the right <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> spotlight this year. But the diva made room for Walker's booming baritone in 'Bird', her fluttering homage to Minnie Ripperton." [...] Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the [...] "comeback queen" [...] and wrote [...] "Its what her voice did, soaring into the rafters like only Carey's can." [...] Roger Friedman from Fox News outed the performance as [...] "the number that sent the audience into a frenzy". On April9,2008, reality competition American Idol aired its second annual charity event, titled Idol Gives Back. Backed up by Randy Jackson on the bass, Carey appeared on stage as the last head-lining performer of the evening. Midway through the performance, a large church choir walked on stage in blue garbs, and provided the gospel climax for the song. Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times called the song an [...] "inspirational show-stopper" [...] and felt Carey's vocal's were [...] "patented impossible notes". In regards to the performance, Katie Byrne from MTV News wrote [...] "Carey was at her over-the-top best, with a full gospel choir and the high notes that made her famous." [...] Aside from several televised performances, Carey included [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] on the set-lists of all her tours following its release. During Carey's The Adventures of Mimi Tour (2006) stop at Madison Square Garden, the song was dedicated to Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died in 2004 from an accidental drug overdose. The performance had to be re-done, as Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, missed his cue for the Biblical verses, and was forced to be found backstage and ushered to the spotlight. Four years later, Carey performed the song throughout her Angels Advocate Tour, only dedicating it to Keaton, who died on July3,2009. Editor and journalist Thomas Kintner from the Hartford Courant felt that during her live recital of [...] "Fly Like a Bird", Carey [...] "displayed power and sky-scraping pitch".|$|E

6000|$|The {{pursuit of}} the {{swordfish}} is much more exciting than ordinary fishing, for it resembles the hunting of large animals upon the land and partakes more {{of the nature of}} the chase. There is no slow and careful baiting and patient waiting, and no disappointment caused by the accidental capture of worthless [...] "bait-stealers." [...] The game is seen and followed, and outwitted by wary tactics, and killed by strength of arm and skill. The swordfish is a powerful antagonist sometimes, and sends his pursuers' vessel into harbor leaking, and almost sinking, from injuries he has inflicted. I have known a vessel to be struck by wounded swordfish as many as twenty times in a season. There is even the spice of personal danger <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> <b>the</b> chase, for the men are occasionally wounded by the infuriated fish. One of Captain Ashby's crew was severely wounded by a swordfish which thrust his beak through the oak floor of a boat on which he was standing, and penetrated about two inches in his naked heel. The strange fascination draws men to this pursuit when they have once learned its charms. An old swordfish fisherman, who had followed the pursuit for twenty years, told me that when he was on the cruising-ground, he fished all night in his dreams, and that many a time he has rubbed the skin off his knuckles by striking them against the ceiling of his bunk when he raised his arms to thrust the harpoon into visionary monster swordfishes.|$|E

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Research has identified {{a wide range}} of benefits associated with resilience (i. e., the ability to effectively adapt <b>to</b> adversity) and <b>savoring</b> positive experiences (i. e., the capacity to enhance and actively manage positive emotions). However, research on these constructs particularly among older adults is limited. Smith and Hollinger-Smith (2015) found that resilience moderated <b>the</b> relationship between <b>savoring</b> and <b>the</b> affective constructs of happiness and depression. However, no significant moderation effect on the cognitive construct of satisfaction with life was found possibly due to the type of measure used. Furthermore, other aspects of subjective well-being that reflect social relationships were not examined. The current study investigated whether resilience moderated the relationship between savouring and three variables of subjective well-being, specifically, satisfaction with life, satisfaction with social relationships, and perceived quality of social relationships in older adults. Moreover, exploratory analyses were conducted to identify whether particular facets of resilience and savoring were more strongly related to older adults’ subjective well-being. Community-dwelling adults aged 60 and above (N = 412) completed a survey which included five standardised measures assessing <b>savoring,</b> resilience, and <b>the</b> three variables of subjective well-being. The main finding {{of this study is that}} resilience moderated <b>the</b> relationship between <b>savoring</b> and satisfaction with life, and this relationship was stronger for older adults with lower resilience. This has implications for <b>the</b> implementation of <b>savoring</b> strategies targeted specifically at older adults lower on resilience as developing a greater ability <b>to</b> <b>savor</b> may enhance <b>the</b> psychosocial resources that they lack and thus improve subjective well-being.
