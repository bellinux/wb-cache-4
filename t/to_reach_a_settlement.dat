5|$|Even {{though the}} miners were able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> in early 1990, {{the case of}} the UMWA vs. Pittston Coal Company did not end in 1990. The fines, over $60 million, did not come into {{bargaining}} until 1994 and Pittston agreed to drop most of the charges. However, since the case was now in the court system, many courts wanted the UMWA to be responsible for all of the fines. The UMWA appealed all fines against them and the case remained undecided for many years.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA {{took action}} against Pittston's new plan of {{operation}} and offered <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement.</b> The coal company stayed quiet, {{and when the}} time came to renew the health care and retirement benefit plans for its workers, Pittston refused. The refusal to renew the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. These people were not just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1864, Berro's term {{of office}} ended. The ongoing civil war {{prevented}} elections; therefore Atanasio Aguirre, president of the Uruguayan senate {{and a member of}} the Amapolas (the radical wing of the Blanco Party) replaced Berro, on an interim basis. In April, José Antônio Saraiva was appointed minister plenipotentiary by the Brazilian government and charged with quickly reaching an accord that would settle Brazil's claims and ensure the safety of Brazilian citizens. His focus soon shifted from satisfying Brazil's terms to a more immediate goal of hammering out a deal between the antagonists in the civil war, with the expectation that only a more stable regime would be able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> with Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Reginald {{took part}} in the {{negotiations}} in August and September 1169 that attempted <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> between Henry and Becket. These negotiations included papal nuncios and most of the Norman bishops and prominent abbots, as well as the royal clerks. However, the negotiations came to nothing, and led to Becket's castigation of Reginald. Reginald {{was one of the main}} clerics working for King Henry during the dispute with Becket, along with John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Henry's plans to reward the four with bishoprics in late 1170 probably precipitated the final crisis that led to Becket's murder.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control even if he had wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement,</b> seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} had grown increasingly distressed over Mosaddegh's policies and were especially bitter {{over the loss}} of their control of the Iranian oil industry. Repeated attempts <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> had failed, and, in October 1952, Mosaddegh declared Britain an enemy and cut all diplomatic relations.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the {{duration}} of the Cold War external intervention and mediation in civil conflicts took on a state-centric mechanism in which sovereignty was inviolable. Rarely did the international community intervene in internal conflicts involving a state's government and domestic belligerents that opposed it. Since the end of the Cold War, however, that has changed. Today, mediation by international actors in civil conflict rest on a standardised resolution mechanism that accords broadly equal standing to all factions within a conflict, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> accepted by all.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a Russo-Persian war raged on despite France and Russia's {{efforts to}} try <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> between Russia and Persia. In 1812 Persia {{had to face}} a major defeat against Russia at the Battle of Aslandoz, forcing the Shah to {{negotiate}} the Treaty of Gulistan, on 12 October 1813, which resulted in huge territorial (and eventually irrevocable) integral territorial losses for Iran in its territories in the Caucasus region, comprising modern-day Georgia, Dagestan, {{and most of the}} contemporary Republic of Azerbaijan, per the Treaty of Gulistan of 1813.|$|E
25|$|Bailiffs, {{loyal to}} the old king Christian, were still holding castles in Finland, a part of Sweden at the time. During {{the summer and fall}} of 1523 they all surrendered. The next year, on 24 August 1524, Gustav arrived in Malmö in order <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> with Denmark and its king Frederick. The Treaty of Malmö (in Swedish: Malmö recess) had both {{positive}} and negative sides to it, from king Gustav's perspective. The treaty meant that Denmark-Norway acknowledged the independence of Sweden. The hopes Gustav had carried of winning further provinces (Gotland and Blekinge) were however scuttled.

25|$|When {{the island}} was {{captured}} in 1537 {{along with the rest}} of the Aegean by Hayreddin Barbarossa for the Ottoman Empire, the Orthodox bishop returned and again assumed the Panagia Episkopi as his seat. The Roman Catholics of the island did not accept this, especially due to the valuable estates of the church and the agricultural and other yields of the lands. The dispute escalated, and both parties took to arms, so that the conflict was brought to the attention of both the Patriarch Neophytos II and Sultan Ahmed I. Under pressure from these two leaders, the parties were able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> whereby the church lands were shared, and both confessions were able to hold services in the church.|$|E
25|$|Makan {{tried to}} reclaim his domain with aid from Gilan and Khurasan, but failed. He then sought refuge among the Samanids in Khurasan, where Nasr {{appointed}} him governor of Kirman. Makan defeated the incumbent governor and took {{possession of the}} province, which he governed until 935, when he learned of Mardavij's assassination {{at the hands of}} his own Turkish ghilman. Immediately he left Kirman, secured his appointment as governor of Gurgan (which Mardavij had ceded to the Samanids in exchange for peace in 933) from Nasr, and with the support of Samanid troops tried to recover Tabaristan. Vushmgir, the brother and heir of Mardavij, managed to repel the attack and even conquer Gurgan, but Buyid pressure on his western flank forced him <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement,</b> recognizing Samanid overlordship and ceding Gurgan to Makan.|$|E

However William Marshal was also the Marcher Earl of Pembroke (by marriage to the de Clare heiress Isabel), and insisted on certain restrictions to curb Llywelyn's expansion. Llywelyn was not to retain the direct vassalage of the Dinefwr lords of Ceredigion and of Ystrad Tywi (Cantref Mawr and Cantref Bychen), or of Powys, and Llywelyn could garrison the castles of Carmarthen and Cardigan only until Henry III came of age. Nor was Llywelyn able to restore his ally Morgan ap Hywel to his ancestral seat of Caerleon in Gwent. However, because Powys' new lord Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn was himself in his minority, Llywelyn {{would be able to}} govern Powys and Maeliennydd until Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn came of age.|$|E

25|$|In the Hohenstaufen {{conflict}} with Pope Urban III, Henry {{moved to the}} March of Tuscany, and {{with the aid of}} his liensman Markward von Annweiler devastated the adjacent territory of the Papal States. Back in Germany, he took the reins of the Empire from his father, who had died while on the Third Crusade in 1190. Henry tried to secure his rule in the Low Countries by elevating Count Baldwin V of Hainaut to a margrave of Namur, {{and at the same time}} he tried <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> with rivalling Duke Henry of Brabant. Further difficulties arose when the exiled Welf duke Henry the Lion returned from England and began to subdue large estates in his former Duchy of Saxony. A Hohenstaufen campaign to Saxony had to be abandoned when King Henry received the message of the death of King William II of Sicily on 18 November 1189.

25|$|Public {{awareness}} {{was increased}} by {{the works of}} the eccentric collector Thomas Hawkins, a pre-Adamite believing that ichthyosaurs were monstrous creations by the devil: Memoirs of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri of 1834 and The Book of the Great Sea-Dragons of 1840. The first work was illustrated by mezzotints by John Samuelson Templeton. These publications also contained scientific descriptions and represented the first textbooks of the subject. In the summer of 1834, Hawkins, after a taxation by William Buckland and Gideon Mantell, sold his extensive collection, then the largest {{of its kind in the}} world, to the British Museum. However, curator Koenig quickly discovered that the fossils had been heavily restored with plaster, applied by an Italian artist from Lucca; of the most attractive piece, an Ichthyosaurus specimen, almost the entire tail was fake. It turned out that Professor Buckland had been aware of this beforehand, and the museum was forced <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> with Hawkins, and gave the fake parts a lighter colour to differentiate them from the authentic skeletal elements.|$|E
