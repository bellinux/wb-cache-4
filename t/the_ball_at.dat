5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|In Week 6 of {{his rookie}} season, Meskó set a season-long {{record with a}} 65-yard punt in {{overtime}} that gave the Baltimore Ravens <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their own 19-yard line. The Ravens failed to gain a first down and punted back to the Patriots, who scored {{to win the game}} on the ensuing drive.|$|E
5|$|In week ten, the Bulldogs {{played the}} Pros {{for the second}} time in the season. In the first quarter, a fumbled punt by the Bulldogs gave the Pros <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their 32-yard line. On the ensuing drive, the Pros passed for the game's lone score, a {{touchdown}} from King to Nash. The Bulldogs lost 7–0 in the first professional game played on Thanksgiving Day, which launched a yearly tradition.|$|E

5|$|Tech's Thomas gained six {{yards on}} a {{run up the}} middle, then Druckenmiller ran ahead for a one-yard gain. On third down, Tech {{committed}} a 10-yard penalty, negating {{what would have been}} a first-down run. A long pass on third down fell incomplete, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the quarter. The Longhorns fair caught <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their 30-yard line with 5:25 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Texas got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their 20 {{to start}} the second half. On the first play from scrimmage, Jamaal Charles rushed for threeyards. On second down, Vince Young's pass was intercepted by Nate Salley at the UT37. Two rushes by Antonio Pittman {{resulted}} in a first down at the UT 30. After a short gain on first down and an incomplete pass on second down, Troy Smith recovered his own fumble on third down {{to set up a}} successful 44-yard field goal by Huston. Texas used six plays, including a 63-yard pass to Billy Pittman before being stopped at the Ohio State eightyard-line. David Pino made the 25-yard field goal. On the ensuing kick-off by Richmond McGee, OSU's Ted Ginn, Jr. took <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> the oneyard-line and ran it out to almost mid-field. The drive ended with a successful 26-yard field goal by Huston. The following three possessions (two for Texas and one for Ohio State) resulted in punts. The third quarter expired with Ohio State leading 22 to 16 and with control of the ball near mid-field.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Nevada in {{possession}} of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> the Maryland 20-yard line. The first play of the quarter was a rush attempt by Taua, but he fumbled and recovered the ball for a loss of one yard. On the second play of the quarter, Kaepernick completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Marko Mitchell, tying the score at 28–28.|$|E

On the first play of the quarter, Dwyer gained 10 yards and a first down with a running play to the Clemson eight-yard line. Three plays later, Dwyer completed the Yellow Jackets' scoring drive with a run into the end zone. The touchdown and extra point gave Georgia Tech its first lead of the game, 10–7, with 13:30 remaining.|$|E
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Maryland in {{possession}} of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> its 47-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Turner handed off to Green, who broke free of the Nevada defense for a 53-yard gain and a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Maryland a six-point lead, 20–14, with 14:50 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for the height of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that {{it is easier to}} make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Florida State {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> its 32-yard {{line with}} a 2017 lead and 12:08 remaining in the game. On the first play after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal. The kick ricocheted {{off one of the}} uprights but through the goal posts, extending the Seminoles' lead to 2317 with 10:13 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. The attempt was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. The attempt was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of {{the ball on the}} ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The attempt was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} this strange mechanism, is that <b>the</b> first <b>ball</b> (ideally) makes contact with the fixed frame at exactly three points, <b>the</b> second <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> two, and <b>the</b> third <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> just one. These six points of contact exactly {{constrain}} the {{six degrees of freedom}} for motion of the movable frame. This leads to precise movement of the frame when the micrometers or screws are turned, without unnecessary wobble or friction.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, Tennessee had <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> its 19-yard line, facing a second down and ten. On the first play of the quarter, Tennessee ran an end-around to Kendrick Jones, who ran the ball for 76 yards, giving the Volunteers a first down at the Virginia Tech five-yard line. Three plays later, running back Jay Graham crossed the goal line for the first Tennessee touchdown of the second quarter. The extra point was good, and with 13:23 remaining in the first half, Tennessee took a 210 lead.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall {{got off to a}} good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E
5|$|California {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> its 35-yard {{line following}} the post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} return. The Bears began to run out the clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E

5|$|Following the Florida State kickoff, Virginia Tech {{attempted}} to answer Florida State's kick-return touchdown {{with one of}} its own. Kendrick fielded <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> the Virginia Tech goal line and returned it 63 yards, {{all the way to}} the Florida State 37-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down. Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly to attempt a 51-yard field goal. Instead of kicking the ball, Graham {{attempted to}} run the ball for a first down. Graham fumbled short of the first down, and Florida State took over on offense with 9:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, Clemson {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> its 28-yard line. Simmons ran {{the ball}} straight ahead for an eight-yard gain, gained one yard on a run, then Kelly {{ran for a}} first down at the 40-yard line. On first down, Simmons completed an 18-yard pass to Gardner at the Tech 42-yard line. Simmons then completed a six-yard pass before throwing a shovel pass to Kelly for a first down at the Tech 32-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by six-yard toss and a pass to Watts at the 12-yard line. Simmons ran out of bounds for a two-yard loss, then completed a touchdown pass to Gardner. The extra point kick was good, and Clemson closed Virginia Tech's lead to 3420 with 7:19 remaining.|$|E
