In our study we choosed to look into how the supervisors worked with <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> for <b>the</b> personal assistants. The questions we wanted to found answers for in this study was, which work directions the supervisors for personal assistants have around <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment,</b> which legal provisions there were around <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> for <b>the</b> personal assistants and how the supervisors experienced the work with <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> for <b>the</b> personal assistants. We did a qualitative interview study with supervisors for personal assistants. We realised in our study that there were big differences in how the supervisors for personal assistants worked with <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> for <b>the</b> personal assistants. The result indicated that the differences were because the supervisors didn’t have any guidelines but the legal provisions that handle <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> for personal assistants.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> on <b>the</b> creativity of knowledge workers, compared {{with the effects of}} creative personality and the social-organizational work environment. Based on data from 274 knowledge workers in 27 SMEs, we conclude that creative personality, the social-organizational work <b>environment,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> independently affect creative performance. The relative contribution of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> is smaller than that of the social-organizational work environment, and both contributions are smaller than that of creative personality. The results give support for HR practices that focus on the individual, on the social-organizational work <b>environment,</b> and on <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> work <b>environment</b> in order to enhance knowledge worker creativity...|$|R

5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution can be attributed to <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>environment,</b> he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>environment</b> to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|While {{investments}} in consumer goods were below projections, the expansion in output increased the Soviet people's standard of living. Refrigerators, owned by only 32 {{percent of the}} population in the early 1970s, had reached 86% of households by the late 1980s, and the ownership of color televisions increased from 51% in the early 1970s to 74% in the 1980s. On the other hand, though some areas improved during the Brezhnev era, the majority of civilian services deteriorated, with <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>environment</b> for the common Soviet citizen falling apart rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying health care system, and living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the common Soviet person living in 13.4 square metres. At the same time thousands of Moscow inhabitants were homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways and parked trams. Authorities often conducted sweeps of movie theaters, restaurants, and saunas to locate people slacking off from work, particularly during major events like the 1980 Summer Olympics that attracted large numbers of foreign visitors. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, with rationing of staple food products returning to locales such as Sverdlovsk. Environmental damage and pollution became a growing problem due to the Soviet government's policy of development at all costs, and {{some parts of the country}} such as the Kazakh SSR suffered particularly badly due to being used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons. While Soviet citizens in 1962 had enjoyed higher average life expectancy than the United States, by 1982 it had fallen by nearly five years.|$|E

Several studies {{in the field of}} traditional environmental psychology have focused on explicit processes such as pleasure, arousal, and stress.

Furthermore, embodied cognition and the automaticity of social cognition are the major topics studied in this field.
