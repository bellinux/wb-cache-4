5|$|Wu {{also has}} another YouTube account going by the {{username}} JumbaFund, which donated {{all of its}} earnings <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> that viewers suggested. Wu donated over 5,000 dollars <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> in Kenya, which later built a school after him, {{to build a new}} school in a span of 5 months from all of the profits he made through JumbaFund. He recently cited that he would now donate all earnings from this point on to Kenya in order to help finish and pay off the costs of the new secondary school being built there. Wu mentions this in his video and always records himself donating all the profits to the charity in order to show the viewers that his JumbaFund charity is not used for anything but to donate to the needy.|$|E

5|$|Both Warren and Brown stated {{early in}} the race {{that they would not}} accept {{television}} advertisement assistance from Super PACs and interest groups. On January 23, 2012, both candidates signed the agreement, or People's Pledge. While no outside groups were obligated by the agreement, both candidates agreed to donate a sum equal to 50% of an advertisement run by any groups <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> of the other candidate's choice. The pledge was broken twice, by Brown supporters. In March the American Petroleum Institute and Coalition of Americans for Political Equality launched ads supporting Brown, and as a result, the Brown campaign agreed to make donations of $1,000 and $34,545, respectively, to the charity of Warren's choice: the Autism Consortium.|$|E
5|$|From 2012 to 2015, the {{two teams}} competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game series between the clubs.

The losing team donated game tickets <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> selected by the winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9–7), and Memphis won the 2013 series (7–9). The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 8–8); the Redbirds retained the title in both instances. The teams discontinued the trophy cup, friendly wager, and promotional references to the Series after 2015.|$|E
5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club {{at the suggestion of}} chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E

5|$|The Premier League Golden Boot is {{an annual}} {{association}} football award {{presented to the}} leading goalscorer in the Premier League.

In addition to the trophy, winners of the Golden Boot are usually given £1,000 for every goal they scored throughout the season to donate <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> of their choice, although Robin van Persie was given £30,000 after scoring 26 goals in the 2012–13 season.|$|E
5|$|The George VI Victorian Suite was {{originally}} a wedding present by George VI {{to his daughter}} Elizabeth in 1947. The suite consists of a long necklace of oblong sapphires and diamonds {{and a pair of}} matching square sapphire earrings also bordered with diamonds. The suite {{was originally}} made in 1850. The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter, although this may have been a coincidence on George's part. Elizabeth had the necklace shortened by removing the biggest sapphire in 1952, and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone. In 1963, a new sapphire and diamond tiara and bracelet were made to match the original pieces. The tiara is made out of a necklace that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium, daughter of Leopold II. In 1969, the Queen wore the complete parure <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> concert.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} also {{time and again}} shown to have {{a soft spot for}} clubs in {{financial}} disarray. Repeatedly the club has supported its local rival 1860 Munich with gratuitous friendlies, transfers at favourable rates, and direct money transfers. Also when St. Pauli threatened to lose its license for professional football due to financial problems, Bayern met the club for a friendly game free of any charge, giving all revenues to St. Pauli. More recently when Mark van Bommel's home club Fortuna Sittard was in financial distress Bayern came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>charity</b> game at the Dutch club. Another well known example was the transfer of Alexander Zickler in 1993 from Dynamo Dresden. When Bayern picked up Zickler for 2.3 Million DM many considered the sum to be a subvention for the financially threatened Dresdeners. In 2003, Bayern provided a 2 Million Euro loan without collateral to the nearly bankrupt Borussia Dortmund which has since been repaid. On 14 July 2013, Bayern played a charity game against financially threatened third division Hansa Rostock. The game raised about €1 million, securing Hansa's licence.|$|E
