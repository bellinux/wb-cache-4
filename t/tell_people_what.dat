The wall behind the statue is inscribed with: “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>what</b> {{they do not want to}} hear”, words from his proposed preface to Animal Farm and a rallying cry for the idea of free speech in an open society.|$|E
25|$|Trieste on the Yugoslav border – the year, 1941 — The Rolls is in {{a repair}} shop. The car {{exterior}} is filthy with OCCASIONE (Bargain, Special Offer) {{painted on the}} windscreen. It is bought by Gerda Millett (Ingrid Bergman), a powerful and wealthy American widow touring Europe. Just before the Invasion of Yugoslavia by the Nazi Germans, she encounters anti-fascist Davich (Omar Sharif) who commandeers her automobile to sneak into Yugoslavia, hiding in the boot before the border crossing. Along the way, these two seemingly different people fall in love. At their Ljubljana hotel, they survive a German aerial attack, then she insists on driving him to a partisan camp {{in the mountains and}} makes several trips to pick up more villagers and deliver them to the camp. She wants to stay and help repel the invaders, but Davich will not permit it, saying it is not her fight. He tells her to go back to America and <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>what</b> she has witnessed. The car is seen being unloaded from a cargo ship in New York. During the end credits, it is seen driving along an expressway, passing beneath a road sign reading I-95, George Washington Bridge, Bronx – Next Right.|$|E

Anthony and instead traveled to Europe for two years. While there she met with women who shared her views, and she gathered critical observations about the place of woman in the Bible. In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>what</b> they are not prepared to hear..." ...|$|E

500|$|Jackson was a {{national}} co-chairman of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. As such, he is involved in garnering support from the superdelegates. During the campaign, he provided the voice for some advertisements such as one South Carolina radio ad in which he said: [...] "Once, South Carolina voted for my father, and sent a strong message to the nation,...Next year, you can send more than a message. You can launch a president.'" [...] When describing Obama he stated that [...] "Barack Obama is not speaking {{as a friend of}} the community; he's part of the community...He doesn't always <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>what</b> they want to hear. He tells them what they need to hear.'" [...] During the campaign, he described Obama as the first [...] "successor" [...] of Martin Luther King Jr. to use the thoughtful and careful approach to language to frame social debate {{in a way that is}} unlikely to alienate whites and noted his ability to get various factions to agree with him and his political positions.|$|E
500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because I feel that the more Islam that we get in our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>what</b> they don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E

Yon was reluctant to say about whether he supported the decision to go to war. He eventually said he had been a supporter because to his concerns about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction, which he had given the Bush Administration {{the benefit of the doubt}} over.|$|E

He has stated that religion does not play a role in how he perceives other bands and musicians.|$|E

2500|$|Daniels and Schur {{wrote the}} script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The {{original}} script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft, and they were changed to be more appealing in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. For example, while an early draft of the pilot script had Mark saying he didn't care about Leslie or the pit but would support her plan because he liked Ann Perkins and wanted an excuse {{to spend more time}} with her, the finished pilot had Mark backing Leslie because he admired her passion and drive. Schur said the writing staff strove to avoid the type of cynical humor prevalent in most television comedies at the time, and wanted the characters to have genuine appreciation for each other. Schur said of this, [...] "I've never liked mean-spirited comedy. The characters on our show make fun of each other, but not in a biting, angry way. And there's no shortage of conflict in the world of government." [...] The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season as if it were a single television pilot. Daniels felt due to pre-expectations from viewers familiar with The Office, the first-season episodes were [...] "just about trying to <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> <b>what</b> we weren't", and that the writers had a better understanding of the characters by season two and could better write to their strengths.|$|E

60|$|The {{third class}} {{is by far}} the most important.
