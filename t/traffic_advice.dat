Fuzzy logic is combined with neural networks to capture the variability of drivers' appraisal of the different route attributes as well as the variability in their perceptions of the various attribute levels. The accuracy of the models, in terms of predicting the categories of drivers likely to comply with <b>traffic</b> <b>advice,</b> was found to exceed 90 %.

Such information is instrumental to transport management as bus and taxi operators can reschedule their fleets in response to prevailing traffic conditions to minimise the effects of traffic congestion on their services. The information can also be used by the traffic management control centres of transport and highway authorities to streamline the timing control of traffic signals and the broadcast of <b>traffic</b> <b>advice</b> via variable message signs. Real-time traffic information is gathered from point-based traffic surveillance and monitoring detectors, and the piecemeal data fitted to interpolate or model road conditions over a transport network. The process of gathering and transforming point-based traffic data to display an area view is computationally intensive and often fails to meet the instant requirements of a real-time traffic information system. The authors propose a real-time traffic multimedia Internet geographic information system that is capable of transmitting video images and modelling road conditions in real time. The prototype system is capable of calibrating data from traffic closed-circuit television images that are modelled over the entire road network for broadcasting to road users on the world-wide web with a time lapse of 3 - 4 minutes. The authors also suggest potential applications of the prototype system. ...|$|E
40|$|This article evaluates dynamic driver {{behaviour}} models {{that can be}} used, {{in the context of}} intelligent transport systems (ITS), to predict drivers 2 ̆ 7 compliance with traffic information. The inputs to this type of models comprise drivers 2 ̆ 7 individual socio-economic characteristics and other variables that may influence their compliance behaviour. The output is a binary integer representing whether drivers comply with travel advice or not. Two approaches are available for formulating this category of classification problems: discrete choice models and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The literature on this topic clearly points to the limitations of the discrete choice approach which suffers from assumptions of perfect information about travel conditions, infinite information processing capabilities of drivers and inability to model the uncertainty in driver decision making or the vagueness in information received from ITS devices. ANNs, on the other hand, are able to deal with complex non-linear relationships, are fault tolerant in producing acceptable results under imperfect inputs and are suitable for modelling reactive behaviour which is often described using rules, linking a perceived situation with appropriate action. This study aims to evaluate the performance of these two categories of models based on a common data set of {{driver behaviour}}, collected from a field behavioural survey on a congested commuting corridor in Brisbane, Australia. This article proposes the combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks as a viable approach for overcoming the limitations of existing algorithms by modelling drivers as heterogeneous individuals. The results showed superior performance for a neuro-fuzzy model over binary choice models in terms of classifying or predicting the categories of drivers most likely to comply (or not comply) with <b>traffic</b> <b>advice.</b> The accuracy of the proposed model, in terms of classification rate, ranged between 95 and 97...|$|E

A headway time of two seconds is sufficient for the majority of drivers to prevent a rear-end collision with the vehicle in front. This is mainly the case on motorways, where the traffic situation is not very complex. It gives the driver sufficient time to commence emergency braking if necessary. However, many people maintain a shorter headway time, which increases the risk of rear-end collisions and multiple collisions.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, an {{on-going}} trend of growing mobility {{throughout the world}} is visible. Although this growing mobility {{has a lot of}} benefits, it also creates a number of negative externalities, such as traffic congestion, accidents, and pollution. Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) is often mentioned as a tool to reduce these negative side effects of mobility. In the broadest sense, ITS can be described as a transport system which makes use of information and communication technology (Nijkamp et al., 1996). In this research, {{the focus is on the}} European road transport system. To be able to fully benefit from ITS technologies, cooperative ITS systems are needed (Piao & McDonald, 2008) with cooperation between different stakeholders. Important stakeholders in the development of these cooperative ITS systems are the road authorities and the automotive industry. However, the knowledge gap between in-vehicle intelligence (developed by the vehicle manufacturers) and roadway intelligence (the responsibility of road authorities) is currently increasing (Piao & McDonald, 2008). The aim of this research is to get a good overview of future ITS developments in the European Automotive sector in the coming twenty years, and based on these outcomes analyse how this may affect the road authorities throughout Europe and their present tasks. By doing this, the knowledge gap between the different road authorities in Europe and the European automotive industry is aimed to be reduced. A scenario approach was chosen to develop possible futures of ITS development in the European automotive industry, in a structured way. Based on a literature review on ITS developments in the automotive industry, interviews were held with ITS experts from the automotive industry, consultancy and research institutes, drivers associations, traffic policy makers, and road authorities. The experts were asked about their opinions and uncertainties on future ITS developments. The data derived from the interviews was used to build future scenarios. Based on the two most important critical factors (Costs and Business Cases for ITS Technologies and Role of the Government) four different future scenarios were developed:  Scenario 1 : United Industry  Scenario 2 : Mutual Benefits  Scenario 3 : Individual Profits  Scenario 4 : Public goals, Private Profits In scenario 1 there is a united automotive industry with shared ITS business cases, but a government who is not really involved in ITS. Scenario 2 is based on a high rate of governmental involvement and an automotive industry with shared ITS business cases. In scenario 3 the government is not really involved but there are some individual parties who see possible ITS business cases. The government is highly involved in scenario 4, but there are no real shared business cases in the automotive industry. There is not one scenario that will become the real future, but it will probably be a combination of the four scenarios presented. Nevertheless, there are some developments that will continue to evolve in all four scenarios:  More ‘connected vehicles’ become available (either connected to the internet, to the infrastructure, and/or to each other).  Increased use of nomadic devices and their traffic related services in a vehicle.  Private parties are able to give individual trip and <b>traffic</b> <b>advice,</b> and by doing this they can influence traffic flows and traffic management.  More traffic related data becomes available.  More in-vehicle (safety related) ADAS systems.  Public acceptance of ITS technology remains uncertain, however, it can be stimulated by the government but not controlled. Most of these developments will have an effect on the current main tasks of the road authorities namely traffic management and designing, building, and maintaining roads and roadside installations. The road authorities can influence the technological development of ITS technologies by installing or not installing intelligent infrastructure. When installing intelligent infrastructure to improve traffic safety, the automotive industry will be interested in developing safety features for their vehicles that are able to communicate with the intelligent infrastructure. This creates extra tasks for the road authorities in maintaining and operating the intelligent infrastructure. Furthermore, when looking at traffic management, it is less beneficial for road authorities to invest in intelligent infrastructure. The automotive industry is willing to develop vehicles that are able to communicate with the infrastructure of the road authorities, however, individual <b>traffic</b> <b>advice</b> can also be supplied by private parties such as the nomadic devices industry and their traffic related services and platforms. These private parties are able to take over some of the traffic management tasks of the road authorities. Nevertheless, the road authorities will remain responsible for everything that is happening on their roads. The monitoring of the data and advice given by the private parties will become a new responsibility of the road authorities to assure everything remains within the societal boundaries set by the governments and road authorities. There are certain issues the (national) road authorities should keep in mind when dealing with ITS developments. These are, among others, creating societal boundaries, approaching ITS as a technology which focusses on traffic safety and traffic flows, staying up-to-date with the latest ITS developments, and keeping local and regional authorities informed about these developments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new generation of dynamic behaviour models that can be used to describe drivers route choice decisions under the influence of traffic information. The new models can be incorporated in traffic simulation tools to help improve their accuracy in evaluating Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) applications that aim to influence driver behaviour through the use of traffic information and advice. The motivation for this research stemmed from a recognition of the limitations of existing route choice models which were found to lack the necessary features to allow for modelling the impacts of ITS and in particular modelling the behaviour of heterogeneous drivers and dealing with the vagueness inherent in driver decision making and the information received from ITS devices and the road environment. Existing models of drivers route choice assume that commuters have full knowledge about traffic and road conditions. However, commuters in the real world are highly heterogeneous and have imperfect or incomplete knowledge about traffic information. This research aims to address these limitations by using a relatively new software paradigm (based on agent technologies) which can be used to model drivers as heterogeneous individuals using artificial intelligence techniques based on neural networks and fuzzy logic. The models will be described using individual characteristics, preferences on route choice and attributes based on field surveys. The thesis first explores the potential for using binary choice and artificial neural network (ANN) models for describing driver route choice and compliance with traffic information. The performance evaluation results showed superior performance for the ANN models over the binary choice models in terms of classifying or predicting the categories of drivers most likely to comply (or not comply) with <b>traffic</b> <b>advice.</b> The accuracy of the ANN models was about 96 percent compared to 61 percent for the discrete choice models. Therefore, the ANN modelling approach was adopted and the resulting model was referred to interchangeably as the Neural or Neural Agent or Neugent Driver Behaviour Model. One of the main limitations of the Neugent model, however, was its inability to interpret the ANN results and derive behavioural rules. This was addressed in this thesis by developing a fuzzy-neural approach where the fuzzy logic provided a mechanism for representing precise and imprecise knowledge while the neural networks provided the learning capability by using examples of real-life behaviour. Given a set of training data, the neural network determines all the fuzzy rules relating input and output patterns. The fuzzy-neural method was shown to be a suitable approach for modelling route choice behaviour and resulted in the development of models that can be interpreted in terms of ifthen rules. The main contribution of this thesis was the development of the resulting models which were referred to interchangeably as Fuzzy-Neural or Fuzzy-Neural Agent or Fuzzy-Neugent driver behaviour models. The Fuzzy-Neugent models comprised a series of three components or separate models: a drivers compliance with traffic information model (to determine if a driver complies with or ignores the travel advice); a drivers delay tolerance threshold model (to determine how each driver responds to delays of different durations) and a driver route utility model (to determine how a driver selects between the alternative routes based on the drivers preferences, familiarity with road conditions etc). The route choice behaviour covered four categories: route attributes (e. g. travel time, travel distance, presence of tolls etc), personal characteristic (e. g. age, gender, education, familiarity with road conditions, income, work-related flexibility), trip characteristics (e. g. work or leisure trip), and road environment conditions (e. g. travel during peak hours under normal and incident conditions). To enable the development of the three constituent models, it was necessary to design a new survey instrument to collect additional information from driver behaviour surveys. The thesis {{presents the}} development of a web-based driver behaviour survey which produced a response rate of about 40 percent. Analysis of the reliability and validity of the survey showed a Cronbach alpha value in the range 0. 7 to 0. 74, indicating that the survey was reliable. The main advantage of the work reported in this thesis is that the survey sample size for a particular region does not need to be very large. This is due to the fuzzy logic formulations which basically allow for a much larger database to be generated from the sample collected in the field through the use of different membership function shapes which were developed in this thesis. This allows for generating data sets that reflect changes in driver characteristics and the environment without the need for collecting large amounts of new survey data. This guarantees that a large number of representative data sets are available for training the Fuzzy-Neugent models. The development of the Fuzzy-Neugent models involved testing a number of model architectures to predict route choice decisions including their calibration, refinement and validation based on a comparison between the models outputs and the web survey data. Classification rate (CR), which is a measure of the models ability to correctly classify field observations, was used as the performance measure (a perfect classifier has a CR of 100 percent). The best performing models produced a CR in the range 88 to 93 percent for the drivers compliance models; a CR of 82 percent for the drivers delay tolerance threshold models; and a CR of 98 percent for the drivers route utility models. Model validation was undertaken using 72 different survey templates which described different route attributes between two alternative routes. Each respondent was randomly assigned a template and asked to indicate their most favourable route for the trip. The respondents socioeconomic and route attribute preferences (which they provided in the survey) were then used to estimate the route utility by using the Fuzzy-Neugent models. The actual real-life decisions were then compared against the predicted choices from the models. The models aggregated results were excellent and showed a classification rate of 94 - 95 percent. The validation of the models was also aimed at learning how individuals think and make route choice decisions. A classification rate of 75 - 76 percent was achieved for the disaggregate model validation. These results indicate a very good degree of accuracy given the complexity of driver behaviour at the individual level. Finally, the thesis presented an application of the Fuzzy-Neugent driver behaviour models. The models were interfaced to the traffic simulator AIMSUN NG and used to evaluate the impacts of an ITS application on incident management. A large number of incidents were simulated with varying durations and severity. Drivers were simulated to receive traffic information advice about the incidents and the Fuzzy-Neugent models were implemented to describe the behaviour of drivers under the influence of the <b>traffic</b> <b>advice.</b> At the aggregate level, the Fuzzy-Neugent models were found to provide a 3 percent improvement in network speeds, 2 - 6 percent reduction in environmental emissions and more than 1 percent improvement in network travel time. Although some of these benefits appear small on the surface, their impacts in financial terms were found to be substantial. At the disaggregate level, the results showed that drivers who accepted the traffic information gained substantial benefits which included savings of 19  34 percent in travel time, 43 percent saving in fuel consumption and around 58 percent reduction in environmental emissions. Furthermore, it was found that around 17  25 percent of drivers accepted the recommended information; and 12  17 percent complied because the delays exceeded their delay tolerance thresholds. These results clearly demonstrate the benefits of the Fuzzy-Neugent driver behaviour models in providing additional information about the impacts of ITS applications. This information would not have been readily available from current or existing models. The results also show that these new models have a very substantial practical role to play. Any road authority wishing to implement the models for a new region would simply complete a basic survey of driver behaviour (e. g. a web-based survey) and then use the model formulations presented in this thesis to generate the large databases required for training the Fuzzy-Neugent models. The simplicity and feasibility of this approach have been successfully demonstrated in this thesis and shown to produce substantial benefits...|$|E
40|$|For a {{recently}} developed in-car speed, headway and lane use advisory system, this paper investigates empirically advice validity (advice given in correct <b>traffic</b> circumstances), credibility (<b>advice</b> logical to drivers) and frequency. The {{system has been}} developed to optimize traffic flow by giving advice on a tactical scale. This scale allows traffic flow improvement and fills a gap as most ITS which aim to optimize traffic flow operate on the operational or strategic scale. Using log files of the actual system {{for a period of}} two weeks, the validity, credibility and frequency of advices is determined. Validity is not guaranteed as the advices are determined based on a predicted traffic state due to data delay and as the advices are based on the predicted traffic state 1 minute in the future. Given that the advisory system is a first in its kind, a new methodology was developed to assess the system, based on the use of virtual trajectories and defining indicators to assess, validity, credibility and frequency. The analysis shows that many advices are indeed valid and credible, but some are not, allowing room for improvement. Advice frequency is found to be reasonable. The analysis also shows that in-car filtering of advices, i. e. merging equal advices, is important to lower the frequency. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Using mobile technology, the vehicles can transmit their speed and location to a central system, allowing the fastest path of each vehicle from its current location to its destination to be maintained in real-time. Gathering the speed and location of each vehicle in real-time over a continuous flow will allow more novel applications, such as incident identification and traffic prediction, to be developed.; I present an analysis of the bandwidth that would be required compared to the bandwidth that is currently available over cellular networks, from which I conclude that the bandwidth currently available is sufficient to run this application. To gather the speed and location of each vehicle and then generate fastest paths for each in an efficient manner, I build on the work of static shortest path algorithms and dynamic shortest path algorithms to produce a new class of algorithms called the Dynamic All-Pairs All-Paths (APAP) algorithms. I analyze the algorithmic running time of these algorithms, and show that the Dynamic APAP class of algorithms runs faster theoretically and the Dynamic APAP [...] Constant Update algorithm runs faster practically than existing algorithms.; I have created FreeSim ([URL] which is a freeway traffic simulator for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), that allows individual vehicles to communicate autonomously with the roadway (V 2 R) or other vehicles (V 2 V).
