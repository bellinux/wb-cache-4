5|$|Over {{the next}} 150years, other expeditions, explorers, and {{scientists}} would piece together what happened next. Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on Beechey Island, where three crew members died and were buried. Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note dated 25 April 1848, and {{left on the}} island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the crew had wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining crew had planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 toward the Back River on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>most</b> {{on the island and}} another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds of miles from the nearest outpost of Western civilization.|$|E
5|$|Progression through Shadow of the Colossus {{occurs in}} cycles. Beginning at a central point in an {{expansive}} landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is {{then returned to}} the central point to repeat the process. To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter. The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>Most</b> colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.|$|E
5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to authenticate a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>most</b> painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E

25|$|The principal, {{anterior}} median, {{eyes have}} high resolution (11 min visual angle), but {{the field of}} vision is narrow, from 2 to 5°. The central region of the retina, where acuity is highest, {{is no more than}} six or seven receptor rows wide. However, the eye can scan objects off the direct axis of vision. As the lens is attached to the carapace, the eye's scanning movements are restricted to its retina through a complicated pattern of translations and rotations. This dynamic adjustment is a means of compensation for the narrowness of the static field of vision. It is analogous to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>most</b> primates move their eyes to focus images of interest onto the fovea centralis. Such movements within the jumping spider's eyes are visible from outside when the attention of the spider is directed to various targets.|$|E

500|$|In Game 5 of the series, Pittsburgh faced {{elimination}} in Detroit, {{where they}} had not yet won in the series. Down 3–2 with 35seconds remaining in regulation, Talbot scored for the Penguins, who had removed goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury to gain an extra skater. The goal tied the game at three, forcing it into sudden-death overtime. In the third overtime period, Sykora scored at the 109:21 mark of the game to give the Penguins the victory and force Game 6. Sykora's goal was assisted by Malkin, who had struggled in the series, and Gonchar, who was returning for his first shift in 50 minutes due to an injury. In the fifth-longest Stanley Cup game in history, goaltender Fleury stopped 55 shots, with 24 in overtime. Ryan Malone played in Game 6, despite being hit {{in the face with}} the puck in Game 5. Dave Molinari of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the team [...] "seemed almost in awe of the way Malone reacted to a significant facial injury <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>most</b> people would a paper cut." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, [...] "Those cues also hold out {{the promise that}} the coming season will once again pivot {{the story on the}} workplace. It’s where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race is just what the series needs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Goldman felt that it start of the season on a strong note, writing, [...] "It's a clever beat to start out with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0." [...] Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent. In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson. Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: [...] " [...] the person who's changed most notably over the last year. She drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he’s gone too far. And she’s not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>Most</b> significantly, she’s standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fiancé but hears about it later. And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy." [...] Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that [...] "she has come a long way." ...|$|E
