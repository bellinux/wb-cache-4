5|$|A Chera coin with <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> king {{wearing a}} Roman helmet was {{discovered}} from Karur. The obverse {{side of the}} silver coin has <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> king, facing left, wearing a Roman-type bristled-crown helmet. This coin maybelong to the 1st century BC and may be earlier to Makkotai and Kuttuvan Kotai coins. With a flat nose and protruding lips, he has a wide and thick ear lobe but wears no ear-ring. The person depicted appears to be elderly. Unlike other Chera silver portrait coins, the king's portrait on this coin faces left. The coin points to Romans having had trade contacts with the Chera kings and establishes that the Roman soldiers had landed in the Chera country to give protection to the Roman traders who had come there to buy materials.|$|E
5|$|In 751 Ruler Z {{erected a}} stela {{that was never}} finished, paired with another with <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> queen. A hieroglyphic {{stairway}} mentions someone called B'olon K'awiil {{at about the same}} time. B'olon K'awiil was king by 771 when he raised two stelae and he was mentioned at Toniná in 789. Sites to the north of Calakmul showed a reduction in its influence at this time, with new architectural styles influenced by sites further north in the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Hershey co-starred with Joe Pesci as {{a nightclub}} owner {{in the film}} drama The Public Eye (1992) and as the estranged wife of homicidal Michael Douglas in the thriller Falling Down (1993). Among the other feature films in which she {{appeared}} during the 1990s was Jane Campion's adaptation of the Henry James novel <b>The</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lady (1996).

25|$|Important {{literary}} precursors {{of modernism}} were Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821–81), {{who wrote the}} novels Crime and Punishment (1866) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880); Walt Whitman (1819–92), who published the poetry collection Leaves of Grass (1855–91); and August Strindberg (1849–1912), especially his later plays, including the trilogy To Damascus 1898–1901, A Dream Play (1902) and The Ghost Sonata (1907). Henry James has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as <b>The</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Lady (1881).|$|E

25|$|In 1938 the Rosenwald Fund {{provided}} {{money for}} Alston {{to travel to}} the South, which was his first return there since leaving as a child. His travel with Giles Hubert, an inspector for the Farm Security Administration, gave him access to certain situations and he photographed many aspects of rural life. These photographs serves as the basis for a series of genre portraits depicting southern black life. In 1940 he completed Tobacco Farmer, <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young black farmer in white overalls and a blue shirt with a youthful yet serious look upon his face, {{sitting in front of the}} landscape and buildings he works on and in. That same year he received a second round of funding from the Rosenwald Fund to travel South, and he spent extended time at Atlanta University.|$|E
25|$|The imagery on coins took an {{important}} step when Julius Caesar issued coins bearing his own portrait. While moneyers had earlier issued coins with portraits of ancestors, Caesar's was the first Roman coinage to feature <b>the</b> <b>portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> living individual. The tradition continued following Caesar's assassination, although the imperators {{from time to time}} also produced coins featuring the traditional deities and personifications found on earlier coins. The image of the Roman emperor took on a special importance in the centuries that followed, because during the empire, the emperor embodied the state and its policies. The names of moneyers continued to appear on the coins until the middle of Augustus' reign. Although the duty of moneyers during the Empire is not known, since the position was not abolished, it is believed that they still had some influence over the imagery of the coins.|$|E
500|$|The Nativity {{was one of}} 13 works hung at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1994 exhibition, [...] "Petrus Christus: Renaissance Master of Bruges". It {{underwent}} significant restoration in preparation. Technicians removed over-paint probably {{dating to}} its Spanish provenance. The addition included the gold paten on Mary's robe, pigment under the Christ child, and the halos above Mary and Jesus. As early as 1916, Friedländer questioned the presence of halos in Christus's work, rarely seen in mid-15th century Netherlandish painting. When the halos were carefully examined they {{were found to be}} later additions; before the exhibition they were removed from several paintings, including <b>the</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Carthusian.|$|E

500|$|The early cubist {{explorations of}} Picasso were to uncover other aspects {{in the work}} of El Greco: {{structural}} analysis of his compositions, multi-faced refraction of form, interweaving of form and space, and special effects of highlights. Several traits of cubism, such as distortions and the materialistic rendering of time, have their analogies in El Greco's work. According to Picasso, El Greco's structure is cubist. On 22 February 1950, Picasso began his series of [...] "paraphrases" [...] of other painters' works with <b>The</b> <b>Portrait</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Painter after El Greco. Foundoulaki asserts that Picasso [...] "completed ... the process for the activation of the painterly values of El Greco which had been started by Manet and carried on by Cézanne".|$|E
500|$|Barrett, {{along with}} Pink Floyd's managers, Peter Jenner and King, wanted {{to release the}} song as a single in the new year, before being vetoed by both the band and Norman Smith.

500|$|Among the Chera coins, the [...] "Makkotai series" [...] bears {{a unique}} pattern {{not found in}} other Tamil coins of its age.

These coins exhibit {{similarities}} with the Roman coins of emperors Augustus and Tiberius; like the Roman coins, the portraits on the Makkotai series do not show any jewellery on the king. They are thought to be made of two separate pieces joined by lead, a practice prevalent elsewhere in India at that time. Official seals of the bearing the name [...] "Makkotai" [...] have also been recovered from the river bed; these seals contain the portrait facing left and the legend [...] "Makkotai" [...] written backwards (right-to-left). The reverse of the seals is blank. The Makkotai coins and the seals have been assigned a date range of 100 BC to end of 100 AD.|$|E
