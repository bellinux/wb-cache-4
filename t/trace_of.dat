Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> it remaining.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Zagier {{showed that}} the <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> {{singular}} values of the modular j-invariant are Fourier coefficients of a weakly holomorphic modular form of weight 3 / 2 and Bruinier and Funke generalized this result by defining modular <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary weakly holomorphic modular functions {{so that they are}} Fourier coefficients of the holomorphic part of a harmonic weak Maass form. In this work, we present Galois <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> class invariants which are singular values of the modular functions that generate Hilbert class fields of imaginary quadratic fields and show that they coincide with modular <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> the singular values. As a result, we can show that there is a divisibility property on the Galois <b>traces</b> <b>of</b> the class invariants. 1...|$|R

5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no <b>trace</b> <b>of</b> it has been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified {{against the}} threat from the Vikings, and shortly {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians.
