Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls.|$|E

5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must spend most of <b>their</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> moist or humid environments.|$|E

Their hind feet are semi-webbed, although in swimming, their tails are their main means of propulsion.|$|E
