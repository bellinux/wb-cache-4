5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} questions: {{what are the}} main {{organizing}} concepts of <b>the</b> older <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> of Smith and Marx; {{and how do they}} differ from those typical of more recent work in <b>political</b> <b>economy?</b> Special emphasis is placed on the importance of an idea of development in <b>the</b> older <b>political</b> <b>economy,</b> and on how that idea has been replaced in <b>the</b> newer <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> by notions of power and interest. The paper considers how the absence of a concept of development in the newer versions of <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> limits <b>the</b> scope and depth of these versions. Recent criticism of the idea of development is also considered. In light of this criticism, the paper considers weaknesses in the concept of development in <b>the</b> older <b>political</b> <b>economy.</b> However, rather than fully accepting the critique of the idea of development, the paper suggests that weaknesses in the classical construction can be corrected by paying closer attention to how we understand the ends of the development process. ...|$|R

40|$|My thesis traces and {{assesses the}} {{engagement}} of Africa in <b>the</b> international <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> through examining Mauritian activism and co-operation in the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiating and decision-making process. Using the illustrative {{case study of}} Mauritius I investigate the increased engagement of Africa in <b>the</b> international <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> beyond <b>the</b> <b>political</b> elite interests and client-patronage relationships. This is done by establishing that those Mauritian elites involved in trade policy-making and activism and co-operation in the WTO are constrained {{by the process of}} deliberation and negotiation with other societal actors, ensuring that they act in accordance (to an extent) with the wider societal aspirations/interests (whether intended or otherwise) and act to advance the development of Mauritius’ <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> within international <b>political</b> <b>economy.</b> Using <b>the</b> Strategic Relational Approach (SRA) I explain the centrality of human actors in exercising agency in relationship with both the domestic and international contexts in which they find themselves – contexts which are uneven and which also constrain their activities. This allows me to interrogate the marginalisation and engagement approaches in their explanation of Africa’s position in <b>the</b> international <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> as I highlight their interrelated structural and agential dimensions and in the process provide an alternative lens to explain Mauritius’ domestic policy-making processes and engagement in <b>the</b> international <b>political</b> <b>economy.</b> My adopted alternative approach allows the thesis to develop a more complex understanding of the engagement of African countries in <b>the</b> international <b>political</b> <b>economy</b> than is currently provided by pre-existing literature...|$|R
