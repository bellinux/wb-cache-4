Williams argued that it is meaningless <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> external reasons; reason alone does not move people to action.|$|E

"ven if {{the policy}} and {{rationale}} were clear and unambiguous, there is a deeper problem with motions of this sort that prevents them from attracting a broad base of support: they rely on the false (or limited) analogy implied by the word 'apartheid'.
