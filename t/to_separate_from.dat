5|$|If {{not treated}} carefully, {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes {{down to the}} bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
5|$|By the evening, the 2nd Battalion {{was ordered}} <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the main {{axis of the}} {{offensive}} and protect the right flank of the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Brigadeperforming the task originally assigned to the 10th Brigade of the Croatian TO. At the same time, the 10th Brigade commanding officer was relieved of duty for failure to advance. Regardless, the unit remained inactive. The HV units that managed to cross the river on 12 December surprised the JNA and reported inflicting considerable casualties.|$|E
50|$|According to Australian {{authorities}}, {{people who}} were not full-blooded aboriginals were <b>to</b> be <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> aboriginals. This meant that Bessie should be <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> her family. She found, therefore, that the authorities were trying <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> her <b>from</b> her children. The secretary of the board in charge of that decision, as it happened, was Friedrich Hagenauer himself.|$|R

5|$|In 2008, {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of linezolid {{bound to the}} 50S subunit of a ribosome from the archaean Haloarcula marismortui was elucidated {{by a team of}} scientists from Yale University and deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S subunit of Deinococcus radiodurans. The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the A site of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a conformational change that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the ribosome.|$|E
5|$|Laika {{died within}} hours from overheating, {{possibly}} {{caused by a}} failure of the central R-7 sustainer <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the payload. The true cause and time of her death were not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six or, as the Soviet government initially claimed, she was euthanised prior to oxygen depletion.|$|E
5|$|Spanish Americans in royalist areas {{who were}} {{committed}} to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements. However, Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of {{the control of the}} crown on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810, and even moderates there, who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown, now saw the need <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} commonly faced in reproductive studies of teleosts is to cost effectively and safely <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> {{one another and}} from surrounding ovarian tissue. This challenge is exacerbated when ovarian tissue has been chemically preserved. Using Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus, a platycephalid species found within oceanic waters along {{the east coast of}} Australia, as an example species, within this study we describe and assess the utility of an ultrasonic cleaning device <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> preserved ovarian tissue. The ultrasonic cleaning device was observed <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> the surrounding ovarian tissue within less than 80. min of treatment and had no deleterious effects on the number of oocytes present. Treatment within the ultrasonic cleaning device reduced oocyte diameters at a constant rate of 3. 9 μm per hour among the samples tested. As the ultrasonic cleaning device was able <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> connective tissue within 80. min, this observed rate of reduction in oocyte diameters is unlikely to be detected at the resolution at which oocytes are traditionally measured and is less than that reported to occur using alternate chemically derived methods <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> preserved connective tissue. Following the assessment of using an ultrasonic cleaning device <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> ovarian tissue for P. caeruleopunctatus, this technique has been successfully employed <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> preserved ovarian tissue for a variety of other teleost species including Macquaria colonorum, Platycephalus longispinis and Ratabulus diversidens. The use of an ultrasonic cleaning device <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> oocytes <b>from</b> preserved ovarian tissue will increase the efficiency of future investigations into teleost reproductive biology and potentially in other fields of research where particle separation and analysis are required. 5 page(s...|$|R
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It is more difficult <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in worship was a divisive topic within the Stone-Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on scriptural grounds, while {{others may have}} relied on a cappella simply because they lacked access to musical instruments. Alexander Campbell opposed the use of instruments in worship. As early as 1855, some Restoration Movement churches were using organs or pianos, ultimately leading the Churches of Christ <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the groups that condoned instrumental music.|$|E
5|$|This made reactor {{plutonium}} {{unsuitable for}} use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a predetonation that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a fizzle). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.|$|E
30|$|The microalgae need <b>to</b> be <b>separated</b> <b>from</b> water <b>to</b> recover their biomass for {{downstream}} processing. There {{are several}} methods for microalgae harvest: (1) bulk harvesting- <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> microalgae <b>from</b> suspension such as natural gravity sedimentation, flocculation, and floatation, and (2) thickening to concentrate the microalgae slurry after bulk harvesting such as centrifugation and filtration [169].|$|R

5|$|Three Himalayan {{subspecies}} of Eurasian treecreeper are now sometimes given full species {{status as}} Hodgson's treecreeper, for example by BirdLife International, {{but if they}} are retained as subspecies of Eurasian, they have to be distinguished from three other South Asian treecreepers. The plain tail of Eurasian treecreeper differentiates it from bar-tailed treecreeper, which has a distinctive barred tail pattern, and its white throat is an obvious difference from brown-throated treecreeper. Rusty-flanked treecreeper is more difficult <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> Eurasian, but has more contrasting cinnamon, rather than buff, flanks.|$|E
5|$|A French frigate {{squadron}} sent to on {{a cruise}} in the Northern Bay of Biscay in the early autumn of 1793 was commanded by Captain Zacharie Allemand and consisted of the frigates Carmagnole, Résolue, Sémillante and Uranie with the brig-corvette Espiègle. On 22 October, the squadron sighted the 16-gun Spanish brig Alcoudia and Allemand ordered Uranie under Captain Jean-François Tartu <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the squadron and pursue the Spaniard. Uranie was easily able to capture Alcoudia, taking the prisoners on board the frigate and establishing a prize crew on the brig. Two days later, Uranie was sailing southwards in company with the prize with the wind at the southwest, when a sail appeared to the north at 09:30.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening {{throughout the}} day on August6, Felicia leveled out with winds of 135mph (215km/h) and a 23mi (37km) wide eye as the storm developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, which would allow Felicia to maintain a high intensity over marginally warm waters. Early the next day, {{the structure of the}} hurricane quickly deteriorated as convection became asymmetric and cloud tops warmed significantly. This marked a quick drop in intensity of the storm to a minimal Category 3 hurricane. Several hours later, the mid-level circulation began <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the low-level circulation and the overall size of the storm decreased. By this time, the storm began to take a long-anticipated westward turn towards Hawaii. After briefly re-intensifying on August7, Felicia weakened to a Category 1 hurricane early on August8. Around 11:00am HST (2100UTC), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) took over responsibility of issuing advisories as Felicia crossed longitude 140°W.|$|E

5|$|An upper-level tropospheric trough {{persisted in}} the eastern Atlantic Ocean, {{developing}} a circulation by October 26 which quickly organized. On October 27, it developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen about 860miles (1380kilometers) south-southwest of the western Azores. Moving westward, the depression was forecast to attain winds of at least 60mph (95km/h), although it failed to reach that intensity. Banding features developed over the storm, and on October 30 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Lorenzo. By early on October 31, convection had begun <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the circulation, {{and later in the}} day Lorenzo became extratropical; shortly thereafter, its remnants merged with a frontal system about 690mi (1,110km) west of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} other AJ-2 was {{purchased}} and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance {{before it could be}} flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several loose rivets on the spar and further examination showed that the skin was starting <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> the spar. This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation. The AJ-2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida on 9 May 1984.|$|E
5|$|Found {{with almost}} all other rare-earth metals but never by itself, {{lutetium}} {{is very difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> other elements. The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite: (Ce, La, etc.)PO4 which contains 0.0001% of the element. The abundance of lutetium in the Earth crust is only about 0.5mg/kg. The main mining areas are China, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia. The world production of lutetium (in the form of oxide) is about 10 tonnes per year. Pure lutetium metal {{is very difficult to}} prepare. It is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US$10,000 per kilogram, or about one-fourth that of gold.|$|E

The freeway crossed into rural southern St. Clair County south of Richmond and continued northeastward to Marysville, where it turned northward, crossing Gratiot Avenue. A business loop, Business US25 (Bus. US25) ran northeasterly from the freeway along Gratiot Avenue to run parallel to the St. Clair River. From Marysville, the freeway skirted the western side of the Port Huron area, intersecting the M-21 freeway immediately east of the city before turning eastward to curve around the north side of town. After the freeway crossed the Black River, US25 turned northward <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> I-94.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{tests on}} the first sample of {{plutonium}} that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor-bred plutonium contained five times more plutonium-240 than that hitherto produced in a cyclotrons. This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly. It now became apparent that only implosion would work for practical plutonium bombs; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft, and plutonium-240 was even more difficult <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> plutonium-239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving {{the rest of the}} Manhattan Project such difficulties. Plutonium was unusable unless implosion worked, but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs. Thus, the implosion technique now suddenly stood as the key to production of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|La tragedia del silencio {{does not}} address political, social, or {{economic}} topics, nor different cultural aspects such as the lifestyle of the Colombian population. Acevedo did not intend for the film to create controversy, so it does not mention the situation in Colombia, {{the plot of the}} film instead focusing narrowly on one man's struggle between life and death. Although leprosy is the main theme of the film, there are other storylines that follow different protagonists and their motivations, such as the husband learning he must face his destiny when he learns about his disease, which requires him <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>from</b> his family. After learning he does not have leprosy, he most confront a rival (the student) to regain the love of his wife.|$|E
