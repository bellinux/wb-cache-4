5|$|The {{structure}} of NATO evolved throughout <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>and</b> its aftermath. An integrated military structure for NATO was first established in 1950 {{as it became}} clear that NATO would need to enhance its defences for the longer term against a potential Soviet attack. In April 1951, Allied Command Europe and its headquarters (SHAPE) were established; later, four subordinate headquarters were added in Northern and Central Europe, the Southern Region, and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> {{particularly}} in the late 1950s, the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China adopted a strategy of destabilisation of Western powers by disruption of their hold on African colonies. Nikita Khrushchev, in particular, viewed the 'underdeveloped third of mankind' {{as a means to}} weaken the West. For the Soviets, Africa represented a chance to create a rift between western powers and their colonial assets, and create pro-communist states in Africa with which to foster future relations.|$|E

5|$|The Philippines {{has been}} an ally of the United States since World War II. A mutual defense treaty between the two {{countries}} was signed in 1951. The Philippines supported American policies during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>and</b> participated in the Korean and Vietnam wars. It {{was a member of the}} now dissolved SEATO, a group that was intended to serve a role similar to NATO and that included Australia, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. After the start of the War on Terror, the Philippines was part of the coalition that gave support to the United States in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Philippines values its {{relations}} with the United States. It supported the United States during <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>and</b> the War on Terror and is a major non-NATO ally. Despite this history of goodwill, controversies related to the presence of the now former U.S. military bases in Subic Bay and Clark and the current Visiting Forces Agreement have flared up from time to time. Japan, the biggest contributor of official development assistance to the country, is thought of as a friend. Although historical tensions still exist on issues such as the plight of comfort women, much of the animosity inspired by memories of World War II has faded.|$|E
5|$|The end of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>and</b> {{the signing}} of the CFE Treaty gave rise to a {{requirement}} for Germany {{to reduce the size of}} its armed forces, including the number of combat aircraft. To meet this need, one of the Marinefliegers Tornado wings was disbanded on 1 January 1994; its aircraft replaced the Phantoms of a Luftwaffe reconnaissance wing. The second wing was enlarged and continued in the anti-shipping, reconnaissance and anti-radar roles until it was disbanded in 2005 with its aircraft and duties passed on to the Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|The poor {{state of}} {{discipline}} of the Congolese forces became apparent again in 1990. Foreign military assistance to Zaire ceased {{following the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> <b>and</b> Mobutu deliberately allowed the military's condition to deteriorate so that it did not threaten his hold on power. Protesting low wages and lack of pay, paratroopers began looting Kinshasa in September 1991 and were only stopped after intervention by French ('Operation Baumier') and Belgian ('Operation Blue Beam') forces.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts.

Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War,</b> <b>and</b> presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
