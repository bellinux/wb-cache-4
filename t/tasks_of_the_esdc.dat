30|$|To sum up, the {{proposed}} piecewise linear model-based method is {{more suitable for}} <b>the</b> compression <b>of</b> oscillations in storage than <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> method. Specifically, <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> computation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> method is much less than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method, whereas <b>the</b> distortion rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method is lower than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> method. <b>The</b> compression ratios <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two techniques are close to each other. <b>The</b> <b>ESDC</b> method was proposed for real-time applications, thus requiring {{a small amount of}} computation. By contrast, {{the proposed}} method is used for storage, and thus can afford a heavy computational burden. Therefore, <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method is better than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> method in applications of data storage owing to the low distortion rate. Moreover, <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> method are set based on experience. By contrast, the wavelet and scale can be directly selected based on the oscillation frequency in the proposed method.|$|R
40|$|Since the European {{sovereign}} debt crisis (<b>ESDC),</b> <b>the</b> euro has been weakening, leading currency users {{to believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> has impacted <b>the</b> major currency markets. To examine <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perceptions <b>of</b> currency market participants, we developed a regression model using {{the relationship between the}} currency price in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro and its denominated sovereign bond price. The Australian dollar (AUD), Canadian dollar (CAD), British pound (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), Swiss franc (CHF) and US dollar (USD) were the sample currencies used in this study. Interestingly, our findings reveal that European sovereign bond investors have three distinct views about the major currency markets: (1) JPY and USD are safe-haven currency and their denominated government bonds are better alternatives in which to invest; (2) AUD- and CAD-denominated government bonds are not trustworthy investments; and (3) GBP- and CHF-denominated bonds are not appropriate investments in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ESDC.</b> This study provides an important lesson for currency users and sovereign bond investors by indicating that <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> affected a limited number of currency markets rather than all major currency markets...|$|R
5000|$|On February 14, 2006, New York State Supreme Court Justice Carol Edmead {{ruled in}} favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{dismissal}} <b>of</b> attorney David Paget as <b>the</b> <b>ESDC's</b> outside counsel. Paget, who has been advising <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> in its environmental review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Yards project, had previously also worked for FCR companies until October 2005. Justice Edmead concluded that <b>the</b> appointment <b>of</b> Paget to <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> represented a conflict of interest, calling it [...] "a severe, crippling appearance of impropriety." [...] Furthermore, Justice Edmead gave <b>the</b> <b>ESDC</b> 45 days {{to find a new}} attorney to meet <b>the</b> standard <b>of</b> [...] "objective public interest." [...] On May 30, 2006, the Appellate Division, First Department, reversed Justice Edmead's the decision. [...] "The motion court misapprehended material facts and misapplied the applicable law in granting the petition to <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> disqualifying Paget and his law firm from representing ESDC," [...] Justice Milton Williams wrote for a unanimous panel.|$|R
40|$|This article applies two {{measures}} to assess spillovers across markets: the Diebold and Yilmaz’s (2012) spillover index and the Hafner and Herwartz’s (2006) analysis of multivariate GARCH models using volatility impulse response analysis. We use {{two sets of}} data, daily realized volatility (RV) estimates taken from the Oxford-Man RV library, for the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 and the FTSE, plus 10 years of daily returns series for the New York Stock Exchange Index and the FTSE 100 index. Both data sets capture both the global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the subsequent European Sovereign Debt Crisis (<b>ESDC).</b> <b>The</b> spillover index captures <b>the</b> transmission <b>of</b> volatility to and from markets, plus net spillovers. The Volatility Impulse Responses (VIRF) have to be calibrated to conditional volatility estimated at a particular point in time. We explore <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> three different shocks, <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GFC, <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GFC, and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ESDC.</b> Our modelling includes leverage and asymmetric effects applying a multivariate GARCH model, and further analysis using both BEKK and diagonal BEKK (DBEKK) models. We find <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> negative shocks is larger, but shorter in duration, {{in this case a}} difference between 3 and 6 months...|$|R
