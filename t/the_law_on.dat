5|$|In March 2017 it was {{announced}} by the MCC that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> handled the ball would be completely removed and subsumed into <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> obstructing the field. This means {{that the act of}} handling the ball will still result in the batsman's dismissal, but will now always be recorded as obstructing the field. The new law is due to come into effect on 1 October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was a firm {{supporter}} of women's rights and in 1932 became vice-chairman of the Marie Stopes Society which provided birth control education. He also campaigned against job {{discrimination against women}} and unequal pay. He was an outspoken campaigner for reform of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{partisan}} disagreement in Congress prevented {{adjustments to}} the Act's provisions. However, at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, has received bipartisan support. Some Congressional Republicans argued against improvements to <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> the National Flag {{mentions}} five possible sizes {{that could}} be made for the national flag: According to Article 4 of <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>On</b> the National Flag, people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government are directed to authorize companies to make any copy of the national flag. Besides five official sizes for flying on flagpoles, there are another four smaller sizes for other purpose, such as decoration on cars or display in the meeting room.|$|E

5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> towns, complemented this system.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2012 Supreme Court ruling {{upholding}} ACA as constitutional, Republicans held another vote {{to repeal}} <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> July 11; the House of Representatives voted with all 244 Republicans and 5 Democrats {{in favor of}} repeal, which marked the 33rd, partial or whole, repeal attempt. On February 3, 2015, the House of Representatives added its 67th repeal vote to the record (239 to 186). This attempt also failed.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E
5|$|Ryzhkov and Gorbachev {{continued}} {{their work on}} economic reform and in 1987 began drafting <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> the State Enterprise, which restricted the authority of central planners.

5|$|Sultan Iskandar and {{his family}} members were not prosecuted for their past {{violations}} of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when the incidences occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted {{to take steps to}} rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have toned down somewhat on his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.|$|E
5|$|The {{law also}} restricts {{the use of}} the emblem in other contexts—e.g. cities, towns or oblasts may not adopt a coat of arms or emblem using the {{national}} emblem either completely or in part. Furthermore, organizations not listed in <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission. The emblem can be used by both foreigners and citizens of Belarus, as long as the symbol is displayed with respect, although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of insolvency, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> compulsory purchase. In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E

5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E
5|$|Handled {{the ball}} was {{formerly}} one of the methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket, but was integrated into <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> <b>on</b> obstructing the field when the Laws of Cricket were rewritten in 2017. It dictated that either batsman can be given out if they intentionally touch the ball with a hand that is not holding their bat. An exception was given if the batsman handled the ball to avoid injury. It was governed by Law 33 of the 2000 Edition of the Laws, and was a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: {{in the history of}} cricket, there have been 61 instances in first-class matches and 5 occasions in List A games. In most cases this occurred when a batsman thought that {{the ball was}} going to hit their wicket, and knocked it away from the stumps with their hand.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Vojvodina's Ministry of Agriculture {{complained to}} Serbia's Ministry of Forestry that the {{authorities}} in Vukovar refused to hand over four river islands, and then to Croatia's Ministry of Forestry regarding the same matter, asking for assistance. After Croatia refused the request, the Serbian authorities turned to the federal government. The federal authorities advised resolving the matter through mutual agreement and said that Vojvodina's interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>on</b> its borders—that the border runs along thalweg of the Danube valley, i.e. along the river's midpoint—is erroneous because {{the law does not}} apply such wording. In a letter dated 18 April 1947, Yugoslav authorities said that the disputed river islands were the territory of Vukovar district and that the territory could not be transferred to Vojvodina before the border was defined otherwise.|$|E
