40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{reliability}} of capillary-barriers ’ modelling is studied making use of <b>tipping</b> <b>trough</b> measurements. In its fi rst part, the article describes laboratory mea surements of saturated hydraulic conductivities and retention curves of four materials of two different capillary barriers. Both the main branches of the retention curves were measured, and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities and capacity functions were determined. The {{second part of the}} article describes numerical modelling of two <b>tipping</b> <b>trough</b> experiments. The obtained results are compared with the measured data. The comparison shows a good agreement that is presented and discussed. It is concluded that, in the case of capillary barrier materials, the laboratory measurements made on samples and the subsequent math-ematical modelling can substitute for the <b>tipping</b> <b>trough</b> experiments...|$|E
50|$|Where the oppositely angled teeth meet in {{the middle}} of a {{herringbone}} gear, the alignment may be such that tooth tip meets tooth tip, or the alignment may be staggered, so that tooth <b>tip</b> meets tooth <b>trough.</b> The latter alignment is the unique defining characteristic of a Wuest type herringbone gear, named after its inventor.|$|R
50|$|Another popular Zamloch {{trick was}} the “Enchanted Horse Trough”. In this routine, buckets of water were poured into a trough on stage. Zamloch would then fish with rod and line and catch live and wet carp from the trough. His {{assistant}} would also {{fish from the}} trough and pull out, dripping wet, a rubber boot, a dead cat and finally a live devil, which was pushed back into the trough with much splashing. Then, Zamloch would <b>tip</b> over the <b>trough</b> and reveal it to be empty and dry. Zamloch later recalled that the enchanted trough was a big hit in Chicago, Omaha, and Kansas City.|$|R
40|$|We examine X-rays from radiatively cooled shocks, {{focusing}} on how their thin-shell instability reduces X-ray emission. For 2 D simulations of collision between equal expanding winds, {{we carry out}} a parameter study of such instability {{as a function of}} the ratio of radiative vs. adiabatic-expansion cooling lengths. In the adiabatic regime, the extended cooling layer suppresses instability, leading to planar shock compression with X-ray luminosity that follows closely the expected (Lx ~ M^ 2) quadratic scaling with mass-loss rate M. In the strongly radiative limit, the X-ray emission now follows an expected linear scaling with mass loss (Lx ~ M), but the instability deforms the shock compression into extended shear layers with oblique shocks along fingers of cooled, dense material. The spatial dispersion of shock thermalization limits strong X-ray emission to the <b>tips</b> and <b>troughs</b> of the fingers, and so reduces the X-ray emission (here by about a factor 1 / 50) below what is expected from analytic radiative-shock models without unstable structure. Between these two limits, X-ray emission can switch between a high-state associated with extended shock compression, and a low-state characterized by extensive shear. Further study is needed to clarify the origin of this "shear mixing reduction factor" in X-ray emission, and its dependence on parameters like the shock Mach number...|$|R
40|$|When {{predicting}} the behaviour {{of a proposed}} capillary barrier, {{it is possible to}} utilize either the experimental measurements or the numerical modelling. Results of <b>tipping</b> <b>trough</b> modelling of a capillary barrier are used to study the reliability of numerical modelling. The required hydromechanical parameters of the capillary barrier layers are determined and used for the numerical repeating of the <b>tipping</b> <b>trough</b> experiments. The results are presented and discussed. Subsequently, the paper studies the problem of capillary barriers efficiency. A criterion is introduced that makes use of soil-moisture retention data in order to predict the efficiency of a capillary barrier. Hysteresis of retention curves of the applied materials is studied and its effect on the efficiency is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} are the {{following}} two: (1) To show that in Langmuir monolayers (LM) at low supersaturation, domains grow forming fractal structures without an apparent orientational order <b>trough</b> <b>tip</b> splitting dynamics, where doublons are the building blocks producing domains with a seaweed shape. When supersaturation is larger, there is a morphology transition from tip splitting to side branching. Here, structures grow with a pronounced orientational order forming dendrites, which are also fractal. We observed this behavior in different Langmuir monolayers formed by nervonic acid, dioctadecylamine, ethyl stearate, and ethyl palmitate, using Brewster angle microscopy. (2) To present experimental evidence showing an important Marangoni flow during domain growth, where the hydrodynamic transport of amphipiles overwhelms diffusion. We were able to show that the equation that governs the pattern formation in LM is a Laplacian equation in the chemical potential with the appropriate boundary conditions. However, the underlying physics involved in Langmuir monolayers is different from the underlying physics in the Mullins-Sekerka instability; diffusional processes are not involved. We found a new kind of instability that leads to pattern formation, where Marangoni flow is the key factor. We also found that the equations governing pattern formation in LM can be reduced to those used in the theory of morphology diagrams for two-dimensional diffusional growth. Our experiments agree with this diagram. 1...|$|R
