The images raised concern from Instagram who felt that Gaga needed help and decided to reach out to her. They mailed the singer with the following message: [...] "Hi, Members of the Instagram community have raised concern for your well-being after seeing posts you’ve shared.

[...] Gaga mockingly responded to the letter and was dismissive of their concern; she posted on her Twitter account about the mail from the social media.

In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night I hugged my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time.

The revisions include editorial changes and clarification responding to public, Advisory Committee and Department comment.

40|$|We {{are pleased}} to present <b>you</b> <b>with</b> the Interagency Council on Black and Minority Health’s 2007 report. The report {{outlines}} key data findings of the council as well as three critical health focus areas to be addressed. These focus areas for improving minority health will act as a launching pad for action within Indiana on every level - residents, public health providers, community organizations, policymakers, and other stakeholders - to address health inequities and improve the health and environment of all Indiana residents. The three focus areas are: a. Heart disease {{is the leading cause}} of death in both Indiana and the U. S and is a major cause of disability. The broad term “heart disease” includes several more specific heart conditions including, but not limited to, coronary heart disease, heart attack, and heart failure. In the U. S., nearly 650, 000 Americans die of heart disease annually (CDC). b. Obesity: Overweight and obesity result from an energy imbalance, which is caused by consuming too many calories and not getting enough physical activity. In addition to poor diet and physical inactivity, other factors that contribute to obesity include heredity, metabolism, behavior, environment, culture, and socioeconomic status. c. Addictions: Two common addictions include tobacco use and substance abuse. Tobacco use, particularly smoking, remains the number one cause of preventable disease and death in the U. S. For example, the risk of dying from lung cancer is more than 22 times higher among men who smoke cigarettes and about 12 times higher among women who smoke cigarettes compared with non-smokers. The intent of these recommendations and focus areas is to help increase access to healthcare services and reduce health status disparities among minority communities and individuals. We look forward <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> a report in November 2008 outlining our success in implementing this plan...|$|R
