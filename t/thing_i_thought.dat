500|$|Chestnut, {{who plays}} Phillips, {{a police officer}} and Turner's boyfriend, {{prepared}} by riding along with Los Angeles police officers to observe {{what it is like}} to be an officer in a squad car and Berry prepared for the role by visiting a call center and observing the operators at work. She told a Miami Herald interviewer, [...] "You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. They would just be as cool as can be doing their <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'I could never do this job.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Murray {{likens the}} song to [...] "the R {{equivalent}} of punk rock" [...] or superficially simple {{enough not to}} intimidate beginners. [...] It interested the eleven-year-old Bo Diddley: [...] "I think the first record I paid attention to was John Lee Hooker's 'Boogie Chillen,'... When I found John Lee Hooker on the radio, I said, 'If that guy can play, I know I can.' [...] I mean John Lee's got {{a hell of a}} style". [...] In an interview, Buddy Guy described learning to play [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] at age thirteen: [...] "that was the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I learned how to play that I knew sounded right when someone would listen." [...] Guy later recorded a version with Junior Wells for their 1981 album Alone & Acoustic. [...] Albert Collins also recalled that it was the first song he learned to play.|$|E
500|$|The {{short film}} was {{produced}} by Emma Ludbrook, Allan Wachs and Jared Leto, who also directed. Although it is billed as a [...] "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" [...] (Leto's [...] longtime pseudonym), [...] "City of Angels" [...] is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, but it was just such a personal <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was appropriate to put my name on that piece." [...] Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from Kanye West, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, Juliette Lewis, Heather Levinger, Haywood, Lindsay Lohan, Olivia Wilde, Steve Nash, Ashley Olsen, Lily Collins, James Franco, Selena Gomez, Alan Cumming, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, Shaun White, Corey Feldman, and Yosh. [...] "City of Angels" [...] marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West, as they first worked together on the track [...] "Hurricane" [...] (2010).|$|E
5000|$|The {{first time}} I {{was asked to}} lead a team, I asked them {{to do a little}} bit of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> were sensible, like testing and reviews. The second time there was a lot more on the line. <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> [...] "Damn the torpedoes, at least this will make a good article," [...] and asked the team to crank up all the knobs to 10 on the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> were {{essential}} and leave out everything else.|$|R

500|$|... "Trust No 1" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter along with {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz; it was directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode features former leading star David Duchovny via the use of previously shot footage. According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode includes themes [...] "about Orwellian surveillance." [...] "Trust No 1" [...] was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in [...] "This is Not Happening"/"DeadAlive". Despite this, series director Kim Manners was critical of this take on Mulder, noting, [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we didn't do right during seasons eight and nine was {{that a lot of}} the shows were about Mulder, and I thought it was a mistake to make a series about a man that wasn't standing in front of the camera." [...] The email addresses that Mulder and Scully use to communicate with each other were real addresses, created and maintained by Ten Thirteen Productions. The tagline for the episode is [...] "They're Watching", changed from the usual [...] "The Truth is Out There".|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's why I {{came up with the idea}} of the glove. Obviously an enema is not really a glove type of <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it was a good visual." [...] Lindemulder is also featured in the music videos for [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] and [...] "Man Overboard".|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, a {{year before}} his death, Salinger {{successfully}} sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man. The novel's author, Fredrik Colting, commented: [...] "call me an ignorant Swede, but the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> possible in the U.S. was that you banned books". The issue {{is complicated by the}} nature of Colting's book, 60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye, which has been compared to fan fiction. Although commonly not authorized by writers, no legal action is usually taken against fan fiction, since it is rarely published commercially and thus involves no profit. Colting, however, has published his book commercially, therefore interfering with copyright law and is not protected.|$|E

60|$|Poor little <b>things!</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{them very}} stiff and formal, and pitied them when I saw them; but I {{believed}} they were really full of fun and folic among their companions.|$|R

2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> when I finished the screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do this, this is a tough role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. Are you able to do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film. [...] "Showing this movie, I feel like I'm really showing a part of my growth as a person as well. So I'm really excited for people to see it." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Raymond Padulla {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 3 out of 5. He praised the {{differentiation}} {{in the fighting}} style of the playable characters, writing, [...] "the additional variety in Dark Alliance II {{is one of the}} few cases where more translates to better." [...] However, he felt that when compared with the original game, [...] "while it is superior in a few ways, it's inferior in others." [...] He was critical of the graphics, writing [...] "there are a smattering of areas and effects that are cooler than the original, but for the most part the visuals look dated and uncreative [...] That isn't to say that the graphics are offensive, but compared to the original -- whose graphics were a strong point -- it's definitely a step down." [...] He concluded [...] "I was convinced that more of a great thing would be an even greater <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> Black Isle would do as fine a job with the series as Snowblind did. I was wrong on both counts. While Dark Alliance II is a good game, it has barely progressed the series." [...] Writing later in 2004, Allen Raucsh said much the same; [...] "Black Isle Studios took over the development chores on this edition, and essentially delivered the same game again. Unfortunately, gamers had moved on [...] In short, while Dark Alliance II was by no means a bad game, it badly needed updating before it could become relevant again.".|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{hard for}} me to realize that people can care for such <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps you'd begin with {{something}} else," [...] she suggested, hanging up her sack and hat in the closet.|$|R
60|$|All my {{later work}} in {{aeronautics}} is associated {{in my memory}} {{with the quality of}} Beatrice, with her incidental presence, with things she said and did and <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of that had reference to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't learn {{any more}} than you learned how to jump," [...] replied Jerry. [...] "It just came to him naturally. His father sang, and his grandfather, and his great grandfather, way back to the {{beginning}} of <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> everybody knew about that." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, {{just the}} other side," [...] Colonel Tempe said. [...] "As my wife is still at home, and our place is not many hundred yards from yours, {{that was the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When ye hung up them <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> ye {{might be}} havin' suthing to swap or sell. That is,"--with tactful politeness,--"mother was wantin' a new skillet, {{and it would}} have been handy if you'd had one. But"--with an apologetic glance at his equipments--"if it ain't your business, it's all right, and no offense." ...|$|R
50|$|Renee’s {{attendance}} at the United Women’s Convention in Wellington in 1975 was an important experience. The convention enabled her to recognise that “...a lot of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> and felt resentful about were things other women thought and felt too.” A feminist perspective became {{an important part of}} her theatre work and writing from that point onwards.|$|R
5000|$|Fletcher is a Christian. Fletcher {{spoke about}} his {{conversion}} to Christianity saying, [...] "I spent years chasing <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> would bring me everlasting joy and happiness: chasing Super Bowl rings or a multi-million dollar contract; {{or a new}} house, cars and jewelry. None of those things did for me what Christ did in an instant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose not, your Grace. But as I and Silverbridge are {{together}} in this matter I thought I'd just let your Grace know {{that we ought to}} have had a very good <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that perhaps your Grace might like to know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The old man {{was like}} that," [...] {{admitted}} Julius. [...] "But I guess the new generation's sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business. First <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about, soon as the war was over, was {{to come along and}} hunt you up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] Mary exclaimed. [...] "And I was due at the {{ambulance}} at eight. I {{must have been}} asleep hours and hours, madame. I lay awake for a time--two hours, perhaps, and the last <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was that I should never get to sleep, and then I have slept all this dreadful time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queer <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> of Hagon," [...] Francis remarked. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, I never {{see him in the}} Temple, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that he had left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I remembered {{you very}} distinctly, and some <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about you, but not {{where it had}} happened. Then in the night I got it. It is a puzzle, isn't it? You see, I was wearing a black gown, and I {{had been out of}} the {{sunlight}} for some months--and my eye, I remember it acutely, was bandaged. I'm usually bandaged somewhere.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} Enrique explained the reason behind titling {{his new album}} as Sex and Love. He said: [...] "It's {{one of the first}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about when <b>I</b> listened to the whole body of work. I think it's something we can all relate to no matter what religion no matter what personality, no matter what colour we can all relate to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} of my clothes," [...] said Mrs. Gribble, clenching her hands together under the table. [...] "When I found I had come in for that money, the first <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was that I {{should be able to}} have a decent dress. My old ones are quite worn out, and as for my hat and jacket--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, seeing it’s {{the first}} {{complaint}} under the law, and knowing the judge set his heart on the <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it best that {{the authority to}} search should come from himself. Besides, as I’m much in the woods, among the timber, I don’t altogether like making {{an enemy of the}} Leather Stocking. Now, the Judge has a weight in the county that puts him above fear.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He told me {{then that}} two of our men had been taken bad with fever in the night. One of them was burning {{and the other was}} shivering, but he thought that it was pretty much the same <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> so, too. I felt shocked by the news. [...] "One burning, the other shivering, you say? No. We haven't left the {{sickness}} behind. Do they look very ill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, dear! {{how many}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> of! Mamma said I was too young! These coals. Can {{you tell me}} {{anything}} about them?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, I love you. You {{must have}} known it or you couldn't have said these <b>things.</b> And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to die}} without knowing what love was." ...|$|R
6000|$|He made {{no effort}} to shake off her grip. He looked at the dark cloud of her hair that had ruled him so magically, and the memory of old delights made him grip a great handful almost {{inadvertently}} as he spoke. [...] "Dear Leopard," [...] he said, [...] "we humans are the most streaky of conceivable <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> hated you. I do. I hate you like poison. And also I do not hate you at all." ...|$|R
