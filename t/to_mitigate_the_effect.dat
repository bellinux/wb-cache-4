5|$|Soon after Apollo {{returns to}} Atlantis, the Asurans retaliate by {{launching}} a Stargate satellite that fires an energy beam, disabling the Apollo before {{zeroing in on}} Atlantis. The beam will deplete the city's shield in just under 30 hours, and with the satellite and its active Stargate over the city, the Expedition cannot evacuate using their own Stargate. McKay (David Hewlett) and Zelenka (David Nykl) submerge the city <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the beam, but this only buys them nine more hours before the city is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the change}} in American foreign policy in {{response}} to the crisis-like atmosphere of early 1948 was more symbolic than real. American willingness to consult on new security arrangements for Europe was the product of neither a changed estimate of Soviet intentions nor a readiness to take on a larger share of the burden of defending Western Europe. Rather, it was a tactical maneuver intended <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the coup in Czechoslovakia and the brief but intense war scare that followed.|$|E

25|$|After {{the end of}} the war {{the treaty}} of Versailles forced Chemische Werke Kalk to end the {{production}} of explosives and close the research laboratory. In the 1920s demand for fertilizers slowly increased, but was accompanied by an increase in prices for raw materials. <b>To</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the price increases the company began to produce a fertilizer based on ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate, two by-products of the production of other fertilizers. In 1930 Scheibler’s Kampdünger (Kamp standing for Kalk-Ammon-Phospor, i.e. lime-ammonium-phosphorus and Dünger being the German word for fertilizer) was introduced, a two-component fertilizer that was readily accepted by the market. The company management at this time considered moving the factory from Kalk to Godorf in Rodenkirchen as the high population density made expansion of the factory difficult. Ultimately this plan was not implemented.|$|E
25|$|In the {{run up to}} {{accession}} to the European Union, Croatia aligned its visa policy {{with that of the}} European Union. As a result of the new visa regime, some third-country nationals (such as Russian and Turkish nationals) who were previously temporarily exempt from having to obtain a visa to visit Croatia were now subject to a visa requirement. However, <b>to</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of the re-imposition of a visa regime on tourist numbers, the Croatian government has introduced a 'facilitated entry of aliens' procedure, exempting travellers who have a Schengen visa or residence permit from having to obtain an additional Croatian visa to visit Croatia until 31 December 2013. In addition, the Croatian government has extended the working hours and capacity of its foreign missions in countries such as Russia and Ukraine to ensure that applications for Croatian visas are processed more efficiently.|$|E
25|$|In many areas, regular {{avalanche}} tracks can {{be identified}} and precautions {{can be taken to}} minimise damage, such as the prevention of development in these areas. <b>To</b> <b>mitigate</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of avalanches the construction of artificial barriers can be very effective in reducing avalanche damage. There are several types: One kind of barrier (snow net) uses a net strung between poles that are anchored by guy wires in addition to their foundations. These barriers are similar to those used for rockslides. Another type of barrier is a rigid fence-like structure (snow fence) and may be constructed of steel, wood or pre-stressed concrete. They usually have gaps between the beams and are built perpendicular to the slope, with reinforcing beams on the downhill side. Rigid barriers are often considered unsightly, especially when many rows must be built. They are also expensive and vulnerable to damage from falling rocks in the warmer months. In addition to industrially manufactured barriers, landscaped barriers, called avalanche dams stop or deflect avalanches with their weight and strength. These barriers are made out of concrete, rocks or earth. They are usually placed right above the structure, road or railway that they are trying to protect, although they {{can also be used to}} channel avalanches into other barriers. Occasionally, earth mounds are placed in the avalanche's path to slow it down. Finally, along transportation corridors, large shelters, called snow sheds, can be built directly in the slide path of an avalanche to protect traffic from avalanches.|$|E
