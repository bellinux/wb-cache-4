5|$|The {{consequences}} of continued control of Alberta's resources {{by the federal}} government extended beyond <b>the</b> <b>merely</b> financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid, Calgary Power made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper Bow River. Not wanting these rights to fall into private hands, Brownlee made an application of his own on behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by Charles Stewart, federal Minister of the Interior and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial was}} held at the Assizes in the small rural market town of Buckingham. More used to the trials of local poachers and sheep thieves, Buckingham had never before seen such a spectacle. The town was {{inundated}} with journalists and <b>the</b> <b>merely</b> curious. Byrne was charged with manslaughter. Tom Cribb, Reuben Martin, Thomas Reynolds, and George Cooper were charged with aiding and abetting manslaughter. With such illustrious names as Cribb's, Jackson's and Spring's involved, the trial had the potential to turn into a huge establishment scandal. People of all classes had bet hundreds of pounds on the outcome of the boxing match. Despite being banned, prize fighting enjoyed huge public support and patronage from levels up to the younger male members of the Royal family, some of whom Jackson had taught to box. The support received by Byrne at his trial is testimony to the wealth of his backers. The establishment rallied to his support; Byrne was represented by three barristers and five solicitors, and twelve witnesses journeyed from London to give evidence on his behalf.|$|E

Along with the presiding deity of Padmanabha, this temple has temples inside it, dedicated to Lord Krishna, Lord Narasimha, Lord Ganesha, and Lord Ayyappa. The temple was built by King Marthanda Varma of the Travancore royal family when, in 1745, he shifted the Travancore capital from Padmanabhapuram, which is now in neighbouring Kanyakumari District in Tamil Nadu. King Marthanda Varma started reigning as 'Sree Padmanabhadasa', the Slave of Sree Padmanabha.

25|$|Kenneth Callahan (1905–1986) was an American {{painter and}} muralist {{who served as}} a {{catalyst}} for Northwest artists in the mid-20th century through his own painting, his work as assistant director and curator at the Seattle Art Museum, and his writings about contemporary art. Born in Eastern Washington and largely self-taught as an artist, Callahan was committed to an art that went beyond <b>the</b> <b>merely</b> illustrative. He enrolled at the University of Washington in 1924 but did not stay long. He traveled widely, absorbing influences from the different countries and cultures he experienced. His talent was recognized early; his work was included in the first Whitney Biennial exhibition in 1933 and he went on to a distinguished painting career. Callahan is identified as one of the Northwest Mystics – along with Guy Anderson, Morris Graves, and Mark Tobey, who shared a muted palette and strong interest in Asian aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|The textual problem can, however, become rather complicated. Modern {{scholarship}} {{now believes}} Shakespeare to have modified his plays through the years, sometimes leading to two existing versions of one play. To provide a modern text in such cases, editors must face {{the choice between}} the original first version and the later, revised, usually more theatrical version. In the past editors have resolved this problem by conflating the texts to provide what {{they believe to be}} a superior Ur-text, but critics now argue that to provide a conflated text would run contrary to Shakespeare's intentions. In King Lear for example, two independent versions, each with their own textual integrity, exist in the Quarto and the Folio versions. Shakespeare's changes here extend from <b>the</b> <b>merely</b> local to the structural. Hence the Oxford Shakespeare, published in 1986 (second edition 2005), provides two different versions of the play, each with respectable authority. The problem exists with at least four other Shakespearian plays (Henry IV, part 1, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and Othello).|$|E

500|$|Hare's {{philosophy}} of two-level utilitarianism {{has been a}} focus of Varner's since the early 2000s, and {{was the subject of}} his Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition. In the book, Varner breaks with his previous biocentrism, instead endorsing sentientism (the idea that sentience is necessary and sufficient for moral considerability), prescriptivism, and two-level utilitarianism. The book is split into three parts: [...] "Hare's Two-Level Utilitarianism", [...] "Persons, Near-Persons, and <b>the</b> <b>Merely</b> Sentient", and [...] "Formulating ILS [...] Rules for Persons, Near-Persons, and <b>the</b> <b>Merely</b> Sentient". The first part offers a reconstruction and analysis of Hare's philosophy, while the latter two offer an original position on animal ethics and personhood.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was praised}} for his {{versatility}} {{and ability to}} fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: [...] "his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies", writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of The Guardian remarked that the actor's particular talent was to [...] "take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it". [...] "The more pathetic or deluded the character," [...] writes Gilbey, [...] "the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of <b>the</b> <b>merely</b> monstrous." [...] When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, [...] "I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking {{for people who have}} a struggle and a fight to tackle.

500|$|Themes from Old English literature, and {{specifically}} from Beowulf, shape {{the ancient world}} Bilbo stepped into. Tolkien, a scholar of Beowulf, counted the epic among his [...] "most valued sources" [...] for The Hobbit. Tolkien {{was one of the}} first critics to treat Beowulf as a literary work with value beyond <b>the</b> <b>merely</b> historical, and his 1936 lecture [...] is still required in some Old English courses. Tolkien borrowed several elements from Beowulf, including a monstrous, intelligent dragon. [...] Certain descriptions in The Hobbit seem to have been lifted straight out of Beowulf with some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders. Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those in Beowulf. Other specific plot elements and features in The Hobbit that show similarities to Beowulf include the title thief, as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaug's personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town. Tolkien refines parts of Beowulf plot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.|$|E

He concluded, [...] "For an album that wasn't meant to be an album, it's quite an album." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it [...] "captured the anxious, even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour" [...] so much so that [...] "it stands as the first tour album that doesn't include any of the songs from the tour" [...] and yet sounds like a [...] "souvenir" [...] of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe called the album a [...] "creative stretch", noting that the band experiments more yet retains their recognizable sound. He commented that the group's [...] "yearning anthemic reach" [...] and [...] "obvious, slinky pop charm" [...] are replaced with [...] "darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness". Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a [...] "freewheeling feel of going with the flow" [...] throughout the album and calling it [...] "rootless and loose, restless and unsettled".

[...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance."

[...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money".
