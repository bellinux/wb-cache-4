5|$|Another {{legacy of}} Sahure is his pyramid complex: its layout became the <b>template</b> <b>for</b> all {{subsequent}} pyramid complexes of the Old Kingdom {{and some of}} its architectural elements, such as its palmiform columns, became hallmarks of Egyptian architecture.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is RNA {{that has}} a coding region {{that acts as a}} <b>template</b> <b>for</b> protein {{synthesis}} (translation). The rest of the mRNA, the untranslated regions, tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the untranslated regions, many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.|$|E

5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses {{replicate}} their genomes by reverse transcribing DNA copies {{from their}} RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA. Retrotransposons also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another, and telomerase contains an RNA {{that is used}} as <b>template</b> <b>for</b> building the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} a number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their <b>template</b> <b>for</b> {{synthesis}} of a new strand of RNA. For instance, a number of RNA viruses (such as poliovirus) use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material. Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase {{is part of the}} RNA interference pathway in many organisms.|$|E
5|$|With {{its many}} {{architectural}} innovations, {{such as the}} use of palmiform columns, the overall layout of Sahure's complex would serve as the <b>template</b> <b>for</b> all mortuary complexes constructed from Sahure's reign until the end of the Old Kingdom, some 300 years later.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong is {{considered}} to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen. The eponymous Donkey Kong character is the game's de facto villain. The hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release, later named Jumpman and then Mario. The ape kidnaps Mario's girlfriend, originally known as Lady, but later renamed Pauline. The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her. This is the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that would provide the <b>template</b> <b>for</b> countless video games to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Karanj {{was badly}} damaged after a {{collision}} with the destroyer Ranjit when she surfaced directly below the ship. As no drawings of the damaged portions of the boat were available with the Bombay Dockyard or the Indian Navy, {{it was decided to}} use Kursura, which was already docked at Bombay, as the design <b>template</b> <b>for</b> the metal work, and Karanj was repaired within months, in time to join the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.|$|E
5|$|QED {{has served}} as the model and <b>template</b> <b>for</b> all {{subsequent}} quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is quantum chromodynamics, which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s work by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on the pioneering work of Schwinger, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.|$|E

5|$|The biopolymers that {{comprise}} DNA, RNA and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (i.e.: each monomer {{is connected to}} at most two other monomers). The sequence of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information described by the central dogma ideally are faithful, deterministic transfers, wherein one biopolymer's sequence {{is used as a}} <b>template</b> <b>for</b> the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{question is}} {{which of the}} areas developed first and created a <b>template</b> <b>for</b> subsequent development. Haas rejects suggestions that maritime development at sites immediately adjacent to the coast was initial, pointing to contemporaneous development based on his dating. Moseley remains convinced that coastal Aspero is the oldest site, and that its maritime subsistence served {{as a basis for}} the civilization.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} English from {{the latter half}} of the 20th century has been helped in part by the {{cultural}} and economic influence of the United States, itself originally formed from British colonies.

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate <b>template</b> <b>for</b> a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest was commercially {{successful}} in Japan, {{with more than}} 2 million copies sold. Its release as Dragon Warrior in North America, and other Western countries, was less favorably received. Later, Western critics noted the game's shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. Its original pseudo-Elizabethan English script has been praised {{in many of these}} reviews. Fan-made ROM hacks were released with substantial changes to the game. The game's sound effects have also been orchestrated, and its music has been performed at numerous concerts. As a whole, Dragon Warrior has been credited with establishing the basic <b>template</b> <b>for</b> the Japanese console RPGs that followed.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Warriors release {{has been}} noted as a notable turning point in video game history. The game has been listed as a genre builder for RPGs. Its {{popularity}} in Japan is synonymous with RPGs. While the game's elements had been present in previous RPG titles, Dragon Warrior set the <b>template</b> <b>for</b> others; almost all of its elements became the foundation for nearly every later game of the genre, from gameplay to narrative, replacing D as the model to follow. According to Shigeru Miyamoto, the success of Dragon Warrior {{changed the nature of}} video game development by making scenario writers far more important.|$|E

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} <b>template</b> <b>for</b> repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA replication) or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} <b>template</b> <b>for</b> all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|Paid in Full is {{credited}} as a benchmark album of golden age hip hop. Rakim's rapping, which pioneered {{the use of}} internal rhymes in hip hop, set {{a higher standard of}} lyricism in the genre and served as a <b>template</b> <b>for</b> future rappers. The album's heavy sampling by Eric B. became influential in hip hop production. The record has sold over a million copies and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it platinum in 1995. In 2003, the album was ranked number 228 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.|$|E
