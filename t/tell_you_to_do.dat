2500|$|The {{clash between}} order and chaos, {{and the people}} caught in between, plays an {{important}} role in Babylon 5. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the Vorlons and the Shadows, is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs. The Vorlons represent an authoritarian philosophy: you will do what we tell you to, because we <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. The Vorlon question, [...] "Who are you?" [...] focuses on identity as a catalyst for shaping personal goals; the intention is not to solicit a correct answer, but to [...] "tear down the artifices we construct around ourselves until we're left facing ourselves, not our roles." [...] The Shadows represent another authoritarian philosophy cloaked in a disguise of evolution through fire (as shown in the episode in which Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum and when he refuses to cooperate, Justin tells him: [...] "But we do what we're told... and so will you!"), of sowing the seeds of conflict in order to engender progress. The question the Shadows ask is [...] "What do you want?" [...] In contrast to the Vorlons, they place personal desire and ambition first, using it to shape identity, encouraging conflict between groups who choose to serve their own glory or profit. The representation of order and chaos was informed by the Babylonian myth that the universe was born in the conflict between both. The climax of this conflict comes with the younger races' exposing of the Vorlons' and the Shadows' [...] "true faces" [...] and the rejection of both philosophies, heralding the dawn of a new age without their interference.|$|E

This, however, I think may be said to you, without any doubt as to the wisdom of the counsel given, that if it be necessary for you to live by your work, do not begin by trusting to literature. Take the stool in the office as recommended to you by the hard man; and then, in such leisure hours as may belong to you, let the praise which has come from the lips of that soft man induce you to persevere in your literary attempts. Should you fail, then your failure will not be fatal,--and what better could you have done with the leisure hours had you not so failed? Such double toil, you will say, is severe. Yes, but if you want this thing, you must submit to severe toil.|$|E

5000|$|The general {{limitation}} of the hypothetical imperative is its potential ambiguity in its means, and its susceptibility to be misused for corrupted ends instead. Hypothetical imperatives also can only be enacted upon {{if there is a}} personal investment in the action done and the ends produced. If one does not find personal benefit or incentive to conduct an action off a certain mean, then they are not obligated to do so. In other words, hypothetical imperatives invoke commands though [...] "ought to do's", and their emphasis is more on individual personal desires. The only non-hypothetical imperatives are ones which <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something no matter who you are or what you want, because the thing is good in itself. These types of imperatives belong to the category of Categorical imperative.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to stage}} hypnotists' showmanship, {{many people believe}} that {{hypnosis}} is a form of mind control. However, the effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of relatively ordinary social psychological factors such as peer pressure, social compliance, participant selection, ordinary suggestibility, and some amount of physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery. The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own inner fear suppressors and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to [...] "play along". Books written by stage hypnotists sometimes explicitly describe the use of deception in their acts. For example, Ormond McGill's New Encyclopedia of Stage Hypnosis describes an entire [...] "fake hypnosis" [...] act which depends upon the use of private whispers throughout:hypnotist whispers off-microphone: [...] "We are going to have some good laughs on the audience and fool them ... so when I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some funny things, do exactly as I secretly tell you. Okay? Swell." [...] (Then deliberately wink at the spectator in a friendly fashion.) ...|$|E
