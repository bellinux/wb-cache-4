5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project. Dahlgren {{is a doctor}} who promotes the Purification Rundown {{as a method of}} detoxification. The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. <b>They</b> <b>questioned</b> the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration of toxins was no greater than normal.|$|E

During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where <b>they</b> <b>questioned</b> his arming the Asháninka, because of {{the view that the}} Catholic Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded that the Church had resorted to the use of violence in the past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. <b>They</b> <b>questioned</b> Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use of psychological theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E

40|$|The principal-agent model {{assumes a}} {{functional}} division of labour. Principals delegate functions to agents, as they anticipate that the agents will implement those functions {{in a more}} credible and/or efficient manner. This chapter shows that there are also instances of non-exclusive delegation in the EU. That is, member states have delegated foreign policy functions to the European External Action Service, but individual member states continue to also carry out this function themselves. Cases of non-exclusive delegation present {{a challenge to the}} principal-agent model. First, <b>they</b> <b>question</b> the functional rationale behind the delegation process. Second, <b>they</b> <b>question</b> whether the hierarchical relationship between the principal and agent still holds. Third, <b>they</b> <b>question</b> the existence and relevance of an information asymmetry...|$|R

5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, <b>they</b> <b>questioned</b> its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. <b>They</b> <b>questioned</b> whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. <b>They</b> <b>questioned</b> the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E

5|$|However, in 2003 Michael Woodburne {{and colleagues}} revised the phylogenetic {{analysis}} published by Luo and colleagues, making several {{changes to the}} data, particularly in the monotremes. Their results (Figure 3, bottom) challenged the division between Australosphenida and Boreosphenida, as proposed by Luo et al. Instead, they excluded monotremes from Australosphenida and placed the remaining australosphenidans close to Eutheria, with Ambondro most closely related to Asfaltomylos. In 2007, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues described another australosphenidan, Henosferus, from the Jurassic of Argentina; they argued against a relationship between Eutheria and Australosphenida (Figure 3, top), but were ambivalent about the placement of monotremes within Australosphenida. Based in part on Martin and Rauhut's earlier work on wear facets in australosphenidans, <b>they</b> <b>questioned</b> {{the presence of a}} true functional protocone on the upper molars of non-monotreme australosphenidans—none of which are known from upper teeth—and consequently suggested that australosphenidans may not, after all, have had truly tribosphenic teeth.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The expedition was now perilously short of fresh water, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull {{close to the}} shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the Spanish spotted the Maya city of Campeche. A large contingent put ashore to fill their water casks. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; <b>they</b> <b>questioned</b> the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. Once inside the city, the Maya leaders {{made it clear that}} the Spanish would be killed if they did not withdraw immediately. The Spanish party retreated in defensive formation to the safety of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Unidentified police sources {{alleged that}} Condit had {{admitted}} to {{an affair with}} Levy during an interview with law enforcement officers on July 7, 2001. Condit described her to police as a vegetarian who avoided drinking and smoking. He thought that Levy was going to return to Washington, D.C. after her graduation {{and was surprised to}} find out that the lease on her apartment had ended. Investigators searched Condit's apartment on July 10. <b>They</b> <b>questioned</b> flight attendant Anne Marie Smith, who claimed that Condit told her she did not need to speak to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his personal life. Federal officials began investigating Condit for possible obstruction of justice, as Smith was also involved in an affair with him. (She was not acquainted with Levy.) Upset by leaks to the media, Condit refused to submit to a polygraph test by the D.C. police; his attorney asserted that Condit passed a test administered by a privately hired examiner on July 13. He avoided answering direct questions during a televised interview on August 23, with news anchor Connie Chung on the ABC News program Primetime Thursday. Intensive coverage continued until news of the September 11 attacks superseded the media's coverage of the Levy case.|$|E

5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, <b>they</b> <b>questioned</b> whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the {{aircraft}} with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet slowly {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; {{the hunt for}} more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; <b>they</b> <b>questioned</b> the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, {{where many of the}} city's inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the reeds and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.|$|E
