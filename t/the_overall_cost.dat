5|$|In December 2000, the IMF stopped aid {{disbursements}} due {{to corruption}} concerns, and many individual donors followed suit, {{resulting in an}} almost 80% drop in Malawi's development budget. However, in 2005, Malawi was the recipient of over US$575million in aid. The Malawian government faces challenges in developing a market economy, improving environmental protection, dealing with the rapidly growing HIV/AIDS problem, improving the education system, and satisfying its foreign donors that it is working to become financially independent. Improved financial discipline had been seen since 2005 {{under the leadership of}} President Mutharika and Financial Minister Gondwe. This discipline has since evaporated as shown by the purchase in 2009 of a private presidential jet followed almost immediately by a nationwide fuel shortage which was officially blamed on logistical problems, but was more likely due to the hard currency shortage caused by the jet purchase. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>cost</b> to the economy (and healthcare system) is unknown.|$|E

Operations at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyard's buildings and cranes, {{and at least two}} other shipyards in the state {{were affected by}} the hurricane. Additionally, the storm forced the temporary closure of the Chevron USA refinery at Pascagoula. Facilities at Horn Island in the Gulf Islands National Seashore, Buccaneer State Park, and the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge required repairs following the storm; at the latter, damages included the cost of healing a Florida sandhill crane's injured leg. Thirty seafood processing plants were damaged, and one was destroyed. The Red Cross estimated that 200 single-family houses in the state were destroyed, and some 13,200 were damaged, 1,200 of them heavily. Additionally, the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2,290. <b>The</b> <b>overall</b> <b>cost</b> of damage in Mississippi alone approached $1 billion.|$|E

40|$|Terminal users face {{a variety}} of costs {{associated}} with the container terminal and those that are harder to quantify should not be ignored for they might represent a larger component of <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>costs</b> associated with using a particular terminal. Similarly, the competitive advantage of a container terminal operator goes beyond the elements that can be quantified. The paper uses and modifies Cournot’s simultaneous quantity-setting model as a means to derive <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>costs</b> of using <b>the</b> terminal. The application of this model to the perspective of competition between container terminal operators in Singapore, Port Klang and Tanjung Pelepas finds that the increasingly cost competitive operators in Port Klang and Tanjung Pelepas were able to close the gap with PSA Corporation in Singapore in <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> <b>costs</b> of using their terminal facilities between 1998 and 2002 although PSAC continued to enjoy a dominant share of the container-handling market in the region. The paper also highlights the tremendous amount of opportunities available to these terminal operators to advance and capitalise on their competitive advantages beyond aggressive price competition.
