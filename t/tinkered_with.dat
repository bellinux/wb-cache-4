5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard quit to form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E

The Italians redesigned it and produced the mandolino or Baroque mandolin, a small catgut-strung mandola, strung in 4, 5 or 6 courses tuned in fourths: e′–a′–d″–g″, b–e′–a′–d″–g″ or g–b–e′–a′–d″–g″, and played finger-style.|$|E

25|$|The major {{innovation}} {{was that}} the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations. The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It {{would have been the}} first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> until his death in 1871.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter {{attended}} an engineering college in New Jersey, where he completed his studies. (It {{may have been}} Rutgers University, but {{this has not been}} confirmed.) While finishing school, he met Theodora Anna Silvera (Siloena), born about September 2, 1846, in New Jersey. Her father Joseph was from Portugal and her mother Anna was born in England. Carpenter married Theodora in West Hoboken, New Jersey, on December 17, 1867. They lived for several years in Paterson, New Jersey, where their daughter Serena (January 12, 1868– October 30, 1870) and their first son Walter (September 2, 1870– January 13, 1895) were born. Carpenter became a block engineer and <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> metallurgy.|$|E

He thus was out of action during Bloody April, the most intense air fighting of the war, when the Luftstreitkräfte and its aces inflicted heavy losses on the Royal Flying Corps. Richthofen, who had scored 11 victories before Voss began his own tally, achieved 13 victories during his absence. Referring to his [...] "dear friend", Richthofen stated: [...] "He was... my most redoubtable competitor." ...|$|E

500|$|Camp {{was central}} to several more {{significant}} rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53 yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for kicks after touchdowns, two points for safeties, and five for field goals. [...] Camp's innovations {{in the area of}} point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890. [...] In 1887, game time was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials—a referee and an umpire—were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.|$|E
500|$|Albert Ball {{was born}} on 14 August 1896 at a house on Lenton Boulevard in Lenton, Nottingham. After a series of moves {{throughout}} the area, his family settled at Sedgley in Lenton Road. His parents were Albert Ball, a successful businessman who rose from employment as a plumber to become Lord Mayor of Nottingham, and who was later knighted, and Harriett Mary Page. Young Albert had two siblings, a brother and a sister. [...] His parents were considered loving and indulgent. In his youth, Ball had a small hut behind the family house where he <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> engines and electrical equipment. He was raised with a knowledge of firearms, and conducted target practice in Sedgleys gardens. Possessed of keen vision, he soon became a crack shot. He was also deeply religious. This did not curb his daring in such boyhood pursuits as steeplejacking; on his 16th birthday, he accompanied a local workman {{to the top of}} a tall factory chimney and strolled about unconcerned by the height.|$|E
500|$|Rutigliano was a gambler: he <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> offenses, took chances on trick {{plays and}} was not afraid to break with the play-calling {{conventions}} of his time. The coach, who earned the nickname [...] "Riverboat Sam" [...] for his risk-taking approach, once said that security was [...] "for cowards". [...] "I believe in gambling", he said. [...] "No successful man ever got anywhere without gambling." [...] This seat-of-your-pants philosophy began to manifest itself on the field in 1979. The campaign started with a nail-biter against the New York Jets that the Browns won in overtime on a Cockroft field goal as time expired. [...] "If we continue to play 'em that way all year, I'll be gone before the 10th game because my heart just won't take it", Rutigliano said after the game. In the second week, Cleveland beat the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 on a Sipe touchdown to Rucker with 52 seconds left. The third game was an equally improbable 13–10 win against the Baltimore Colts. Cleveland Plain Dealer sports editor Hal Lebovitz wrote after the game that these [...] "Kardiac Kids" [...] were lucky to have pulled off the win after Colts kicker Toni Linhart missed three field goals.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor Ike Armstrong, Curtice focused his attention on offense and continually <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> his split-T offense. His teams are {{perhaps best known for}} popularizing the Utah Pass, which is an overhand forward shovel pass of the ball. The play is commonly used today by teams which use a spread offense. Quarterback Lee Grosscup caught the attention of the east coast press when he and the Utes had a close 33–39 loss to top ten program Army at West Point, New York. Grosscup threw for 316 yards against a tough Army defense in an era where most teams seldom passed the ball. Despite losing, Curtice referred to the game as [...] "The time we beat Army." ...|$|E
2500|$|Internally, studio heads {{expressed}} serious {{reservations about}} them, {{as did the}} censors at the Breen Office. Sturges managed to get The Miracle of Morgan's Creek released with only minor changes, but The Great Moment and Hail the Conquering Hero were taken {{out of his control}} and <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> by DeSylva. When the revamped Hail the Conquering Hero had a disastrous preview, Paramount allowed Sturges – who by that time had left the studio – to come back and fix the film. [...] Sturges did some rewriting, shot some new scenes, and re-edited the film back to his original vision, all without pay. He was unable to similarly rescue The Great Moment, however. The historical biography about the dentist who discovered the use of ether for anesthesia ended up being Sturges' only flop during this period. More significantly, it marked the onset of a downturn from which Sturges did not fully recover.|$|E
