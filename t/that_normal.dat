He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E

Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so <b>that</b> <b>normal</b> computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E

Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of genocide in countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide.

5|$|The García {{family is}} an example of this phenomenon. In How the García Girls Lost Their Accents, Alvarez succeeds in {{altering}} the events of her own life to create fiction. The family is displaced to the United States after living an established, upper-class life in the Dominican Republic, and is forced to face the challenges which come along with being an immigrant family in a foreign land. Julia Alvarez herself was not born in the Dominican Republic, but in the United States. After her parents' failed attempt at a life in America, she returned to the Dominican Republic at the age of three months as her parents preferred the dictatorship of Trujillo to the US. Clearly in the novel, this is not the case, however throughout, the reader witnesses the Garcia family assimilate into American society. Although their Hispanic roots are reflected in their personalities, it is evident that the stories which focus on the four daughters depict many problems <b>that</b> <b>normal</b> North American girls do.|$|E

A {{numerical}} study {{based on}} VOF {{model has been}} carried out to investigate the dynamics of water droplet impact on solid surface in microgravity in comparison with <b>that</b> in <b>normal</b> gravity to discuss the differences of the extinguishing mechanism of water mist in different gravity level. Water droplets with different initial diameters and impact velocities were considered. The simulated results show that the deformation process in microgravity lags behind <b>that</b> in <b>normal</b> gravity. And it was also found that Dmax and spread velocities are smaller in microgravity as the potential energy decreases and the time taken for a liquid droplet to reach its maximum spread has no obvious regularity. Hence, the effect of cooling the fuel surface and diluting fuel vapour with water mist in microgravity may be not as good as <b>that</b> in <b>normal</b> gravity. The critical impact Weber number for water droplet breaking up in microgravity is lower than <b>that</b> in <b>normal</b> gravity as the reduction of the value of Bond number, which may result in diluting fuel vapour with water mist in microgravity being more effective than <b>that</b> in <b>normal</b> gravity in some case...|$|R

25|$|That {{imprinting}} {{might be}} a feature of mammalian development was suggested in breeding experiments in mice carrying reciprocal chromosomal translocations. Nucleus transplantation experiments in mouse zygotes in the early 1980s confirmed <b>that</b> <b>normal</b> development requires the contribution of both the maternal and paternal genomes. The vast majority of mouse embryos derived from parthenogenesis (called parthenogenones, with two maternal or egg genomes) and androgenesis (called androgenones, with two paternal or sperm genomes) die at or before the blastocyst/implantation stage. In the rare instances that they develop to postimplantation stages, gynogenetic embryos show better embryonic development relative to placental development, while for androgenones, the reverse is true. Nevertheless, for the latter, only a few have been described (in a 1984 paper).|$|E
