5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective <b>tariff.</b> While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the <b>tariff</b> was that of most Democrats: that the <b>tariff</b> ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high <b>tariff</b> to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the <b>tariff</b> brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the <b>tariff</b> was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The <b>tariff</b> issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate <b>tariff</b> reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a <b>tariff</b> for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the <b>tariff</b> from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the <b>tariff</b> persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import <b>tariff,</b> enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal <b>tariff,</b> the <b>Tariff</b> of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the import <b>tariff.</b> However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the <b>tariff</b> would bring in about 25 million dollars in revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{sets up a}} {{microeconomics}} {{model to}} analyze the market outcomes of two-part <b>tariffs</b> and three-part <b>tariffs.</b> Specifically, this paper compare the market outcomes of a single two-part <b>tariffs</b> to a single three-part <b>tariffs</b> under the assumptions that the market structure is monopolistic, there is no demand uncertainty, and demand curve is a linear straight line. The results show that a single two-part <b>tariffs</b> and a single three-part <b>tariffs</b> bring forth the same market outcomes except lump-sum fees. The lump-sum fees of the three-part <b>tariffs</b> are the lump-sum fees of the two-part <b>tariffs</b> plus the revenue loss caused by an allowance (free volume provided to customers). Therefore, according to this result, the monopolist {{has no reason to}} prefer three-part <b>tariffs</b> to two-part <b>tariffs.</b> However, if customers do not use up all allowance or there is demand uncertainty, three-part <b>tariffs</b> can generate more profits to the monopolist than two-part <b>tariffs.</b> Moreover, three-part <b>tariffs</b> can be used by the monopolist to raise lump-sum fees without losing customers and profits...|$|R

5|$|Representative William McKinley and Senator Nelson W.

At Secretary of State James Blaine's urging, Harrison attempted to make the <b>tariff</b> more acceptable by urging Congress to add reciprocity provisions, which would allow the President to reduce rates when other countries reduced their rates on American exports. The <b>tariff</b> was removed from imported raw sugar, and sugar growers in the United States were given a two cent per pound subsidy on their production. Even with the reductions and reciprocity, the McKinley <b>Tariff</b> enacted the highest average rate in American history, and the spending associated with it contributed to {{the reputation of the}} Billion-Dollar Congress.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Taft's presidency, {{protectionism}} {{through the use of}} tariffs was a fundamental position of the Republican Party. The Dingley <b>Tariff</b> had been enacted to protect American industry from foreign competition.

Taft called a special session of Congress to convene on March 15, 1909 to deal with the <b>tariff</b> question.|$|E

Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing <b>tariff</b> reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the <b>tariff</b> bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's <b>tariff</b> were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E

5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and <b>tariff</b> debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a <b>tariff</b> for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley <b>Tariff</b> of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's <b>tariff</b> proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E
5|$|The Colombian <b>tariff</b> {{system is}} defined in the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The <b>tariff</b> system aims at {{reconciling}} the achievement of cost recovery with {{the protection of the}} poor. The basic <b>tariff</b> is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.|$|E
5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley <b>tariff</b> proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average <b>tariff</b> rate decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory <b>tariff</b> rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential <b>tariff</b> rates. The clause effectively generalized <b>tariff</b> reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide <b>tariff</b> rates.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} why industrialized {{countries}} have moved from <b>tariffs</b> to NTBs is the fact that developed countries have sources of income other than <b>tariffs.</b> Historically, in the formation of nation-states, governments had to get funding. They received it through the introduction of <b>tariffs.</b> This explains the fact that most developing countries still rely on <b>tariffs</b> as a way to finance their spending. Developed countries can afford not to depend on <b>tariffs,</b> at the same time developing NTBs as a possible way of international trade regulation. The second reason for the transition to NTBs is that these <b>tariffs</b> can be used to support weak industries or compensation of industries, which have been affected negatively by the reduction of <b>tariffs.</b> The third reason for the popularity of NTBs is the ability of interest groups to influence the process in the absence of opportunities to obtain government support for the <b>tariffs.</b>|$|R
