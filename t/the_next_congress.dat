The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 Not Guilty/45 Guilty on the perjury charge and 50 Not Guilty/50 Guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the Constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.|$|E
5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>congress,</b> Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E

25|$|Kamaraj and Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee President K. Madhava Menon {{supported}} C. N. Muthuranga Mudaliar for {{the post}} of chief minister and were opposed to Prakasam's candidacy. Rajaji and the Reform Group observed neutrality because of a prior agreement from 1937, which stipulated that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>Congress</b> government would be headed by a member from Andhra. This led to the election of T. Prakasam by 82 votes to 69. Difference of opinion arose between Prakasam and Kamaraj over several issues including the inclusion of Madhava Menon in the cabinet. Kamaraj supported his inclusion and Prakasam supported Raghava Menon who belonged to the pro-Rajaji group. Dissatisfaction with Prakasam's textile mill policies and his slow implementation of prohibition, lead to his fall. Prakasam was voted out of power and submitted his resignation on 14 March 1947.

25|$|The first International Eucharistic Congress owed its {{inspiration}} to Bishop Gaston de Ségur, and {{was held at}} Lille, France, on June 21, 1881. The initial inspiration behind the idea came from a laywoman, Emilie-Marie Tamisier (1834-1910) Marie-Marthe-Baptistine Tamisier who spent a decade lobbying clergy. The sixth congress met in Paris in 1888, and the great memorial Church of the Sacred Heart on Montmartre {{was the center of}} the proceedings. Antwerp hosted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>congress,</b> from in 1890, at which an immense altar of repose was erected in the Place de Meir, and an estimated 150,000 persons gathered around it when Cardinal Goossens, Archbishop of Mechelen, gave the solemn Benediction. Bishop Doutreloux of Liège was then president of the Permanent Committee for the Organization of Eucharistic Congresses, the body which has charge of the details of these meetings. Of special importance also was the eighth congress, held in Jerusalem in 1893, as it was the first congress held outside Europe.|$|E
25|$|At the {{founding}} {{congress of the}} Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (the predecessor of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) Vladimir Lenin was able to gain enough support {{for the establishment of}} an all-powerful central organ at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>congress.</b> This central organ was to become the Central Committee, and it had the rights to decide all party issues, with the exception of local ones. The group which supported the establishment of a Central Committee at the 2nd Congress called themselves the Bolsheviks, and the losers (the minority) were given the name Mensheviks by their own leader, Julius Martov. The Central Committee would contain three-members, and would supervise the editorial board of Iskra, the party newspaper. The first members of the Central Committee were Gleb Krzhizhanovsky, Friedrich Lengnik and Vladimir Noskov. Throughout its history, the party and the Central Committee were riven by factional infighting and repression by government authorities. Lenin was able to persuade the Central Committee, after a long and heated discussion, to initiate the October Revolution. The majority of the members had been skeptical of initiating the revolution so early, and it was Lenin who was able to persuade them. The motion to carry out a revolution in October 1917 was passed with 10 in favour, and two against by the Central Committee.|$|E
25|$|On July 25, 1875, Attorney General Pierrepont {{ruled on}} what was denounced as a fraud known as the Chorpenning claim. Chorpenning had petitioned the post office in 1857 for payment of mail {{delivery}} in San Pedro and Carson's Valley. Chorpenning was paid $109,072.95 by Postmaster General Aaron V. Brown in 1857 for his postal services, however Chorpening, under protest, believed he deserved more compensation. On July 15, 1870, Congress authorized the Postmaster General to adjust the Chorpenning claim. On December 23, 1870, Grant's Postmaster General John A. J. Creswell ruled that Chorpenning was owed a $443,010.60 adjustment. On January 12, 1871 a House committee suspended payment to Chorpenning. On February 9, 1871 Congress repealed the July 15, 1870 law that allowed the Postmaster General to adjust the Chorpenning claim. On March 3, 1871 Congress forbid that any appropriations go to pay the Chorpenning claim. On May 8, 1872 Congress again forbid any appropriations {{to pay for the}} Chorpening claim. Pierrepont ruled that Postmaster General Creswell was not an arbitrator between Chorpenning and Congress. Chorpenning's legal counsel argued that Congress was bound to pay any contracts between Congress and a private citizen. Pierrepont argued citing Gordon v United States that the Postmaster served as in a ministerial position rather than judicial, and therefore Creswell's adjustment was not binding. Pierrepont referred the Chorpening claim to the Court of Collections and allowed <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>Congress</b> to decide the fate of the Chorpening claim, unless the statute of limitations stopped the claim.|$|E

[...] Admiral David Dixon Porter said the model [...] "of Miss Vinnie Ream is the only likeness in the lot." [...] General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was reportedly infatuated with Ream, also became a strong advocate for her model. [...] He wrote to the committee that [...] "the plaster model of Vinnie Ream struck me decidedly as the best likeness, and recalled {{the memory of the}} Admiral's face and figure more perfectly than any other model there on exhibition." [...] The decision by the committee ultimately ended in a three-way tie between Ream, Stone, and MacDonald. [...] The project stalled until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>Congress</b> convened in 1874. [...] A commission to select the winning model was created and consisted of Virginia, Sherman, and Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson. [...] Virginia and Sherman voted to approve Ream's design, though Robeson refused to accept the result and tried in vain to convince Virginia to change her mind. [...] Two months after the vote, Robeson relented and Ream's model was officially selected.|$|E
500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>Congress,</b> {{among the}} first bills to pass the house was the Public Credit Act of 1869, which would require the {{government}} to pay bondholders in gold, not greenbacks. The 1868 election campaign had seen the Democrats proposing to repay the bondholders (mostly supporters of the Union war effort) in paper; Republicans favored gold, as the bonds had been purchased with gold. Sherman agreed with his fellow Republicans and voted with them to pass the bill 42-13. Sherman continued to favor wider circulation of the greenback when he voted for the Currency Act of 1870, which authorized an additional $54 million in United States Notes. Sherman was also involved in debate over the Funding Act of 1870. The Funding Act, which Sherman called [...] "he most important financial measure of that Congress," [...] refunded the national debt. The bill as Sherman wrote it authorized $1.2 billion of low-interest rate bonds {{to be used to}} purchase the high-rate bonds issued during the war, {{to take advantage of the}} lower borrowing costs brought about by the peace and security that followed the Union victory. The Act was the subject of considerable debate over the exact rates and amounts, but once the differences were ironed out, it passed by large majorities in both houses. While Sherman was unhappy with the compromises (especially the extension of the bonds' term to 30 years, which he believed too long), he saw the bill as an improvement over the existing conditions and urged its passage.|$|E
