5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he is tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy {{was chosen as the}} next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

However, this general doctrine {{does not apply}} where a tribe held treaty rights to the bed prior to statehood. Additionally, tribes can gain title to dry lands formerly covered by rivers after a river changes course. The United States can sue on behalf of tribes to gain title to those lands.|$|E

The score is determined by a deduction which is the sum of all the landing zone deductions subtracted from 10. The displacement is measured electronically where the equipment is available, or else by two judges observing the landing zones.|$|E

500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking. You know what I thought was my favorite bit, and I said it to David and Dan, it was at that moment when the reveal comes and you kind of go, 'Oh my God,' it puts things into context with Melisandre. It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity.

500|$|Acoustic guitar, {{violin and}} drums {{accompany}} Eminem's verses. The lyrics transition from discussing {{positive aspects of}} love to describing violent events. Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls you both, so they say it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, [...] "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> set this house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.|$|E

The policemen then enter the house, and one of them confirms that the couple escaped. The video ends with Spears and the criminal escaping on the motorcycle as the credits roll. One of them reads [...] "No vanilla candles were harmed in the making of this music video." [...] The video also includes intercut scenes of Spears performing dance moves similar to voguing.|$|E

Sportswriter Joe Falls {{remained}} close to Batchelor in his later years. After Batchelor died, Falls described a visit to Batchelor at the nursing home:"Batch couldn't have weighed more than 60 pounds at the end, but his mind was nimble. He'd drift between fantasy and fact. ... But before you could feel pangs of sadness at his deterioration, he'd pull you close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> whisper: 'I think it's great the Lions got Munson from the Rams. They couldn't win with Plum and Munson has the poise to be a good quarterback. Pour me a drink' Batch went out the way he would have wanted, with his lifelong friend and companion, Jack Daniels, at his side. He couldn't eat at the end, and water repulsed him, so they let him sip his favorite liquid." ...|$|E

[...] He asked if perhaps Pyror put cocaine on his penis to sustain his erection, to which she replied, [...] "It's not like he has a pile of cocaine next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> he dips his penis in it before we have sex."

40|$|The most {{effective}} way to control common scab is by irrigating a potato crop at tuber initiation. With the introduction of legislation such as the Water Framework Directive this will become increasingly diffi cult. In this fi eld experiment, we assessed the potential of a number of non-water measures for controlling this disease. Common scab on daughter tubers at harvest was reduced by applying rapeseed meal at 1 t ha- 1 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>and</b> then incorporating it into the soil, and adding a mixture of Trichoderma viride isolates into the furrow at planting. None of these treatments was as effective as using water...|$|R
