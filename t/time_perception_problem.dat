For instance, consumer decisions on which shipping option to choose {{and how long}} to wait for service, whether and when to save for future, decisions to keep on waiting on hold when calling customer service or renege from queue, all involve time decisions. While oftentimes the end behavioral variable stud-ied varies, e. g. line chosen, time delivery option, renege or stay; most of them deal with first making a time estimate that is often biased that then leads them to display a downstream behavior.

40|$|Generating natural-looking {{motion for}} virtual {{characters}} is a challenging research topic. It becomes even harder when adapting synthesized motion {{to interact with}} the environment. Current methods are tedious to use, computationally expensive and fail to capture natural looking features. These difficulties seem to suggest that artificial control techniques are inferior to their natural counterparts. Recent advances in biology research point to a new motor control principle: utilizing the natural dynamics. The interaction of body and environment forms some patterns, which work as primary elements for the motion repertoire: Motion Primitives. These elements serve as templates, tweaked by the neural system to satisfy environmental constraints or motion purposes. Complex motions are synthesized by connecting motion primitives together, just like connecting alphabets to form sentences. Based on such ideas, this thesis proposes a new dynamic motion synthesis method. A key contribution is the insight into dynamic reason behind motion primitives: template motions are stable and energy efficient. When synthesizing motions from templates, valuable properties like stability and efficiency should be perfectly preserved. The mathematical formalization of this idea is the Motor Invariant Theory and the preserved properties are motor invariant In the process of conceptualization, newmathematical tools are introduced to the research topic. The Invariant Theory, especially mathematical concepts of equivalence and symmetry, plays a crucial role. Motion adaptation is mathematically modelled as topological conjugacy: a transformation which maintains the topology and results in an analogous system. The Neural Oscillator and Symmetry Preserving Transformations are proposed for their computational efficiency. Even without reference motion data, this approach produces natural looking motion in real-time. Also the new motor invariant theory might shed light on the long <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> <b>problem</b> in biological research...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} important considerations in the measurement of health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in paediatric populations. Considerations specific to the evaluation of HR-QOL in children include children's understanding of the questions being asked, their understanding of their own disease, using parents as proxies, <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> <b>problems</b> and simply the fact that children are continually changing. We provide a review of the currently available literature regarding paediatric HR-QOL assessments to examine the different instruments and approaches taken to assess HR-QOL in paediatrics. Asthma-specific measures are discussed as examples of condition-specific HR-QOL instruments because of the considerable amount of methodological and developmental work that has been conducted in this disease. Our search strategy revealed 15 main generic and 5 main asthma-specific instruments that met our criteria for inclusion. The main points highlighted for each instrument are the description of domains, respondent (i. e. the child, parent or clinician), age group, number of items, format of instrument (usually self-administered or by interview), original country and language, and the existence of translations. For the various studies in which the different instruments are used, the issues of patient population tested, sample size, reliability and validity are addressed. Although this paper does not attempt to be an exhaustive study of paediatric HR-QOL instruments, we provide an overview of the main generic and asthma-specific instruments, as well as an examination of the different methods used in assessing paediatric HR-QOL. Many challenges exist in the measurement of HR-QOL in paediatric patients. With increased attention to the considerations highlighted, the field will continue to grow, and the usefulness and application of HR-QOL measures in paediatric patients is likely to improve.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Children {{with early}} {{symptomatic}} psychiatric {{disorders such as}} Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) {{have been found to}} have high rates of motor and/or perception difficulties. However, there have been few large-scale studies reporting on the association between Conduct Disorder (CD) and motor/perception functions. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate how motor function and perception relate to measures of ADHD, ASD, and CD. 	 	 	 METHODS: Parents of 16, 994 Swedish twins (ages nine and twelve years) were interviewed using the Autism-Tics, ADHD and other Comorbidities inventory (A-TAC), which has been validated as a screening instrument for early onset child psychiatric disorders and symptoms. Associations between categorical variables of scoring above previously validated cut-off values for diagnosing ADHD, ASD, and CD on the one hand and motor and/or <b>perception</b> <b>problems</b> on the other hand were analysed using cross-tabulations, and the Fisher exact test. Associations between the continuous scores for ADHD, ASD, CD, and the subdomains Concentration/Attention, Impulsiveness/Activity, Flexibility, Social Interaction and Language, and the categorical factors age and gender, on the one hand, and the dependent dichotomic variables Motor control and <b>Perception</b> <b>problems,</b> on the other hand, were analysed using binary logistic regression in general estimated equation models. 	 	 	 RESULTS: Male gender was associated with increased risk of Motor control and/or <b>Perception</b> <b>problems.</b> Children scoring above the cut-off for ADHD, ASD, and/or CD, but not those who were 'CD positive' but 'ADHD/ASD negative', had more Motor control and/or <b>Perception</b> <b>problems,</b> compared with children who were screen-negative for all three diagnoses. In the multivariable model, CD and Impulsiveness/Activity had no positive associations with Motor control and/or <b>Perception</b> <b>problems.</b> 	 	 	 CONCLUSIONS: CD symptoms or problems with Impulsiveness/Activity were associated with Motor control or <b>Perception</b> <b>problems</b> only in the presence of ASD symptoms and/or symptoms of inattention. Our results indicate that children with CD but without ASD or inattention do not show a deviant development of motor and perceptual functions. Therefore, all children with CD should be examined concerning motor control and <b>perception.</b> If <b>problems</b> are present, a suspicion of ADHD and/or ASD should be raised.

Despite the increasing amount of research efforts addressing cognitive phenomena, the issue of <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> {{and how it is}} linked to other cognitive processes remains largely unexplored. In the current paper, we make a first attempt for studying artificial <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> by means of simulated robotic experiments. Specifically, we investigate a behavioral rule switching task consisting of repeating trials with dynamic temporal duration. An evolutionary process is used to search for neuronal mechanisms accomplishing the rule switching task taking also into account its particular temporal characteristics. Our repeated simulation experiments showed that (i) <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> and ordinary cognitive processes may co-exist in the system sharing the same neural resources, and (ii) <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> dynamics bias the functionality of neural mechanisms with other cognitive responsibilities.

40|$|Immersion is a {{commonly}} used term by players, designers and reviewers of digital games {{to describe their}} experience of playing digital games. It represents the cognitive sense of "being in the games". One of its consequences is players are losing track of time. However, little {{has been done to}} further investigate the effect of immersion on players' <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> whilst playing digital games. This thesis describes a series of experimental investigations to discover the relationship between immersion on players' <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> during a gaming session. The first five experimental studies are focused on manipulating immersion to test its effect on players' <b>time</b> <b>perception.</b> The next six experiments are focused on manipulating players' <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> to test its effect on immersion whilst gaming. The results from these experiments are rather inconsistent. ​Immersion in some experiments was​ successfully manipulated it but there were no significant effects on players' <b>time</b> <b>perception.</b> Similarly, ​in the other experiments​ players' <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> ​was manipulated​ but there were no significant effects on their immersion experience. To further consolidate these findings​, a meta-analysis ​was​ conducted to produce the single estimate effect on players' <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> during the experimental investigations. The result suggests that participants either overestimate or underestimate time whilst playing. ​​Further, ​there is substantial heterogeneity across experiments suggesting that the experimental manipulations affect players' <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> differently depending on the experiments. Together, the evidence suggests both immersion and players' <b>time</b> <b>perception</b> are rather sensitive. The manipulation of ​either one​ of them could also affect​ the other but not in a consistent manner. ​​ ​Moreover, there are clear challenges in studying this phenomenon in the lab context. Furthermore, considering the literature on time in digital games environment, the final qualitative study is conducted using grounded theory to understand how players perceive time whilst playing digital games. The theory suggests that players are aware of time but they give themselves a "self-consent" to ignore it during the gaming session. However, when they evaluate about their playing time they realise that they {{have spent a lot of}} time and they use statement​s​ such as losing track of time to justify why they have been playing for so long.
