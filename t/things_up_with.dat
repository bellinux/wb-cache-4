25|$|The season {{starts with}} a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool at Wembley, which is widely {{anticipated}} as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds's captain Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and {{are in danger of}} relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being 'cold-hearted' and 'fundamentally dishonest', both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as 'inflexible and egocentric'. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, and they are reconciled.|$|E
25|$|Ian Redpath and Wally Edwards saw {{off the new}} {{ball and}} were 1/0 at stumps on the first day. The next day Bob Willis (2/91) hit Edwards with a bouncer and appealed for Redpath caught behind off his gloves, which was {{declined}} by the umpire. They took the score to 64 runs {{in less than an}} hour when Edwards hit Tony Greig to David Lloyd at cover-point. The usually static Redpath was stumped when he danced down the wicket to Fred Titmus (2/84) and Ian Chappell edged Geoff Arnold (2/129) to Alan Knott while trying to leg glance, leaving Australia 113/3. Greg Chappell made 62, his fifth successive 50 against the tourists and added 79 runs with Ross Edwards by tea, though Titmus conceded only 20 runs in nine 8-ball overs. Chappell was out at 192/4 when he cut Willis into the gully where Colin Cowdrey knocked the ball up to be caught by Greig. After tea Doug Walters came out and took command of the game as Denness declined to use Willis to attack his well-known weakness around the off stump. Instead Greig sent up his slow off-cutters and gave away 69 runs off nine overs. Walters reached his 50 in 44 minutes, followed by that of Edwards in 174 minutes. The English fielding became ragged as they added 158 runs after tea. Walters reached his century off the last ball of the day by pulling Willis for six and was engulfed by fans as he left the field, as well they might as he was the first batsman since Bradman to score a hundred runs in a session in an Ashes Test. Australia were 352/4 and well ahead in the game, but the Australian team played a trick on Walters when he returned, hiding in the showers before coming out to congratulate him. He was out first thing the next day, caught by Fletcher in the gully off Willis waving his bat outside off-stump for 103, but Edwards stayed in to make 115, having been 79 overnight and became the first Western Australian to make a hundred at the WACA. He was bowled by Arnold, but Rod Marsh hit 41 and the tail added 65 runs before Chris Old cleared <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> 3/85. Australia made 481, a lead of 273 in the first innings and few thought England could avoid an innings defeat.|$|E

25|$|The 1958-59 Ashes {{series was}} {{the end of an era}} in English cricket; after losing 4–0 in Australia Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Frank Tyson and Barrington's Surrey {{teammates}} Jim Laker and Peter Loader all retired from Test cricket. The team needed to be rebuilt and a solid batsman was needed to shore up the top order. Peter May took leave to get married and Arthur McIntyre took over as wicketkeeper-captain of Surrey. An earlier attempt to turn Barrington into an opener had failed, but McIntyre promoted him to number 3 in the order to stop him getting nervous while pacing around the dressing room waiting to bat. He made 97 against Cambridge University soon followed by 186 and 118 not out against Warwickshire at Edgbaston; 85 and 59 not out against the Indians at the Oval and 113 not out against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. This earned him a recall to the England cricket team against a weak Indian side, perfect for playing a batsman into a Test career. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he joined his Surrey and England captain Peter May at 63/3 and was told not to worry about scoring as long as he fought it out. Barrington took 20 minutes to get off the mark, but hit two sixes off Chandu Borde to bring up his 50 and was out for 56 in a stand of 175 as England won by an innings. In the Second Test at Lord's England were 100/7 when Barrington top-scored with 80, adding 126 for the last three wickets to set up another big win. The Third Test at Headingley saw him making 80 again, this time adding 193 runs with Colin Cowdrey in an 8 wicket victory. The Fourth Test at Old Trafford gave him 87 as his missed out on another century, but captain Colin Cowdrey gave him the ball and he took 3/36 with his leg-spin. In the second innings he was told to go for quick runs and hit 46 in 36 minutes with 6 fours and a six, then wrapped <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> 2/75 and a catch as England won by 171 runs. Back home at the Oval for the Fifth Test Barrington was out for 8, but England completed the 5–0 whitewash with an innings victory. Barrington made 357 runs (59.50) in the series – more than anybody else – and had had his most prolific summer with 2,499 first-class runs (54.32), but Surrey failed to win the County Championship for the first time in 8 years, coming third. His consistent run-making won him the honour of being named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year and he was an automatic choice for the forthcoming tour of the West Indies in 1959–60.|$|E

Meredith was hesitant to sit and talk with her mother about the last five years but finally she decides this could be her only chance." [...] Comparing Ellis' previous appearances in the series with the version presented in the episode, West stated she is [...] "far worse" [...] as a lucid person, noting how frustration and confusion are her main characteristics.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors.

(She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice <b>things</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E

Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described the reality series as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Kim Kardashian described the beginning of filming the show, [...] "When we first started , we came together as a family and said, 'If we're going to do this reality show, we're going to be 100 percent who we really are.'". She further commented on the show's authenticity by saying that the network [...] "has never once put anything out there that we haven't approved of or accepted". The series was renewed for a second season one month after its premiere due to high ratings. Seacrest described the show's success: [...] "At the heart of the seriesdespite the catfights and endless sarcasmis a family that truly loves and supports one another [...] The familiar dynamics of this family make them one Hollywood bunch that is sure to entertain." ...|$|E
