I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of <b>that.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
25|$|The {{critics of}} the current {{approaches}} to trafficking say <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violence and exploitation faced by illegal migrants derives precisely {{from the fact that}} their migration and their work are illegal and not primarily because of trafficking. Tara McCormack, a lecturer in international relations at Brunel University, has opined in that trafficking discourse can be detrimental to the interests of migrants as it denies them agency and as it depoliticizes debates on migration.|$|E

25|$|By the 1990s, {{some of the}} {{previous}} research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory {{from the field of}} photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included image-based rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters and indeed the town are based on Pemberton's home town of Chorley, with Royston Vasey based on Adlington, a village within Chorley Borough. The character of Herr Lipp {{is believed to be}} based on a hospital chaplain Steve Pemberton encountered after suffering a heart attack in Germany and Pauline is primarily based on a restart officer of Reece Shearsmith's. Similarly, Ollie Plimsolls is based on a community theatre actor that Shearsmith had worked with. In the DVD commentary on the second series, Pemberton and Shearsmith state that Papa Lazarou's speech patterns are based on their former landlord, who would phone their flat and insist on speaking only to Steve. Gatiss has said in interview that the local shop was inspired by a shop in the village of Rottingdean and that he was influenced growing up around the former Winterton Hospital asylum near Sedgefield.|$|E

25|$|Because the Chinese rarely {{executed}} prisoners, the Chinese {{consider themselves}} to be more lenient and humane than the North Koreans. However, the Chinese were unprepared for the large influx of POWs after their entry into the war, {{and a large number}} of prisoners were crowded into temporary camps for processing. Mass starvation and diseases soon swept through those camps during the winter of 1950–51, while numerous death marches were conducted by the Chinese to move the prisoners into permanent locations. Although the situation started to improve after permanent camps were established by January 1951, death by starvation still continued until April 1951. About 43 percent of all US POWs died from November 1950 to April 1951. In comparison, only 34 percent of all US prisoners died under Japanese captivity during World War II. The Chinese have defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were also suffering mass starvation and diseases {{due to the lack of}} a competent logistics system. The UN POWs, however, pointed out <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese camps were located near the Sino-Korean border, and claimed that the starvation was used to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrinations programs. The starvation and the POW deaths finally stopped by the summer of 1951 after the armistice talk started.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for help by a physician, Dr Charles Oldfield, who has a {{practice}} in Market Loughborough, a small village in Berkshire. His wife died {{just over a year}} ago and the malicious talk in the village is that he poisoned her. People are avoiding him and several poison pen letters have been sent to him but he can do nothing to stem this tide of ill-intentioned gossip – like the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, when one source of the gossip is cut off, another grows in its place. So, his ultimate aim was to cut the main source of the gossip, just like the hydra had been slain by cutting its vulnerable head. Mrs Oldfield was a difficult invalid whose death was put down to a gastric ulcer, whose symptoms are similar to that of arsenic poisoning. She left her husband a not-inconsiderable sum of money and, under pressure, Oldfield admits <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talk revolves around Jean Moncrieffe, his young dispenser, who he wants to marry but dare not because of the talk. Poirot travels to Market Loughborough and meets Jean. She is frank about her relationship with Oldfield and her dislike of his wife but opposes Poirot's idea of an exhumation and autopsy on the body. Poirot makes the rounds of the village, insinuating that he is connected with the Home Office and thereby generating much hypocritical murmurs of sympathy for the doctor and, more importantly, names of who said what and when. From this he learns of the present whereabouts of two servants of the Oldfields who left their employ after Mrs Oldfield died; Nurse Harrison, who tended to the patient, and Beatrice, the family maid. Nurse Harrison tells a story of overhearing Jean and the Doctor talking about the imminent death of his wife in which it was clear that this was an event that both of them were impatiently waiting for. The nurse is certain that Beatrice must have overheard the talk as well. Poirot tells her of the supposed plans of exhumation and the nurse considers this news and then tells him she agrees that such a thing should be done. While being interviewed, Beatrice slyly denies overhearing any conversation but tells him of several suspicious stories of Jean making medicines or pots of tea for Mrs Oldfield which the nurse poured away or changed before the patient could take them.|$|E

500|$|The episode's plot {{originated}} from one which Lan O'Kun submitted entitled [...] "Love Beyond Time and Space", although at one point, the episode was called [...] "Eye of the Beholder".

Tormé later described it as a [...] "no-lose" [...] situation as he felt that O'Kun's script was so bad anything would be an improvement. Tormé changed the script from O'Kun's serious outline to something more comedic, although he felt <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comedy elements were later removed before filming. He didn't like the overall result, saying [...] "I didn't particularly like the episode when it first aired. It's still one of my least favourite shows that I've been involved with".

500|$|GameTrailers noted that, {{despite its}} many {{strengths}} {{such as a}} believable relationship between Link and Zelda, Skyward Sword represented the series' [...] "first gray hairs" [...] due to some of its mechanics feeling dated in the modern gaming landscape. IGN's Richard George felt that the game returned The Legend of Zelda to being a revolutionary series in the gaming industry, praising {{almost every aspect of}} the game {{with the exception of the}} soundtrack, which he felt did not live up to series standards despite its quality. Joystiq writer Griffin McElroy noted <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game's content seemed unnecessary and extravagant, but said that beneath this surface lay [...] "the best Zelda game of all time". Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine shared many points of praise with other positive journalist reviews, calling it the greatest game in the series to date. VideoGamer.com's Chris Schilling called it one of the best Zelda games, praising its motion controls, narrative and treatment of series tradition.|$|E
500|$|As the band's primary lyricist, McIlrath is {{wary of the}} {{political}} label. [...] "In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that’s where we get the tag 'protest music' or 'political punk rock'". He also noted how the band's lyrics discuss social topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: [...] "I think <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problems we deal with today {{in the world are}} the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There's a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they're listening to [...] 10 years from now." [...] Principe noted the band does not try to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.|$|E
500|$|Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd {{assembled}} for {{an upcoming}} tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album, although their priority {{at that time was}} the creation of new material. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that [...] "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: [...] "I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific." ...|$|E

He added that [...] "Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of No Code, he was so burnt, it was so much work for him." [...] The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that [...] "everybody was on their best musical behavior around him." [...] McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him [...] "a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective." [...] Commenting upon the sessions as a whole, O'Brien said, [...] "It was really a transitional record.

[...] "Trust No 1" [...] was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in [...] "This is Not Happening"/"DeadAlive". Despite this, series director Kim Manners was critical of this take on Mulder, noting, [...] "The only thing I thought we didn't do right during seasons eight and nine was <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shows were about Mulder, and I {{thought it was a}} mistake to make a series about a man that wasn't standing in front of the camera."

Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs.
