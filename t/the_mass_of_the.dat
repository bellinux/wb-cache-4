5|$|A {{variety of}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} {{take place in}} the cores of stars, that depend upon their mass and composition. When nuclei fuse, <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fused product is less than <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original parts.

5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|Altair is a type-A main {{sequence}} star with approximately 1.8 times <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun and 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; {{it has a}} rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires {{a little more than}} 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E

5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% of <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius.

5|$|Astronomers {{hoped to}} {{implement}} a survey called the N2K Consortium, a collaboration which uses Doppler spectroscopy to find radial velocity measurements of stars that hadn't been previously surveyed.

5|$|Because the {{magnitude}} {{of many of the}} units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately defined by the mass of a -year-old, golf-ball-sized piece of metal, the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IPK have likely diverged another µg since the third periodic verification years ago. Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E

5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
