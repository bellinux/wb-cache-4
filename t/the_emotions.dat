5|$|The Stoics {{sought to}} be free of the unruly emotions, which they {{regarded}} as being contrary to nature. The passions or emotions (pathe) are the disturbing element in right judgment. Chrysippus wrote a whole book concerning the therapy of <b>the</b> <b>emotions.</b> The passions are like diseases which depress and crush the soul, thus he sought to eradicate them (apatheia). Wrong judgements turn into passions when they gather an impetus of their own, just as, when one has started running, it is difficult to stop. One cannot hope to eradicate <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> when one is in the heat of love or anger: this can only be done when one is calm. Therefore, one should prepare in advance, and deal with <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> in the mind as if they were present. By applying reason to emotions such as greed, pride, or lust, one can understand the harm which they cause.|$|E

40|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} psychological approaches to <b>the</b> meaning of <b>emotion</b> terms are presented, namely <b>the</b> dimensional, basic <b>emotion,</b> and componential emotion approaches. According to the dimensional approaches <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain can be represented by {{a small number of}} continuous dimensions. <b>The</b> basic <b>emotion</b> approach assumes that <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain is organized into categorically different affect programs. This approach has inspired psycholinguistic research that represents <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain by hierarchical structures. <b>The</b> componential <b>emotion</b> approach represents emotion terms by profiles of activity in each of <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> components. Although these three approaches are in many respects incompatible when it comes to <b>the</b> presumed underlying <b>emotion</b> processes, they are compatible with respect to <b>the</b> meaning of <b>emotion</b> terms. <b>The</b> chapter ends by discussing how the GRID paradigm, which is based on <b>the</b> componential <b>emotion</b> approach, can also be fruitfully applied to study categorical and dimensional representations of <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> domain...|$|R

5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating <b>the</b> <b>emotions,</b> while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
30|$|Strictly speaking, {{variation}} in judgment may exist {{both in the}} understanding of <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> word (e.g., what emotion is referred to by the word upset) and in the categorization of <b>the</b> encoded <b>emotion</b> (e.g., what emotion type and intensity level <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> upset belongs to). In this paper, we do not make the distinction between an <b>emotion</b> word and <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> it refers to (i.e., the word upset vs. <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> upset), but see Nabi (2002) and Russell (1991) for a discussion on possible differences between the two.|$|R

Analysing the individual word position, <b>the</b> person <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> is referred to, and <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>emotion</b> occurred, identification of emotional words, as well as using of a set of grammatical rules allow the engine to perform satisfactorily.

5|$|Ethology is {{the study}} of animal {{behavior}} (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin, whose book, The Expression of <b>the</b> <b>Emotions</b> in Man and Animals, influenced many ethologists to come.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the series, Jackson {{had thought}} of her singing as merely a private hobby.

This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which {{is believed to be the}} sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} using a coarse-to-fine analysis strategy for sentence-level emotion classification which takes into consideration of similarities to sentences in training set as well as adjacent sentences in the context.

5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms.

Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> and behaviours of his characters.|$|E

5|$|One {{does not}} only feel a social or {{external}} pressure to fulfill roles {{and expectations of}} being a good parent, sibling, or child, however. There is a distinctly emotional and internal pressure to be ‘good’ due to psychological attachments in spousal, sibling and/or parent-children relationships. Psychological persuasion in advertisements appeals to one's motives, attitudes and personalities. The family symbol is psychologically persuasive in that it appeals to the emotional attachments between spouses, siblings, or parent-child relationships. To continue the above example, the mother not only wants to purchase a product that purportedly limits irritation or harm for her child due to her social role and expectations, but also because she feels an emotional attachment to her child. The attempt to activate <b>the</b> <b>emotions</b> of audiences and to psychologically persuade is popular among advertisements.

5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} distribution of wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.

He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature.
