60|$|In the {{preparation}} of the umbrella, the first difficulty that met them was how they were to conceal their private work when the turnkey came in the evenings to take away their materials for sack-making. After some examination they discovered a plank in the floor, in the corner where they were wont to sleep, which was loose and easily forced up with one of Bill's unfinished paper-knives, which he made very strong for this special purpose! Beneath there was sufficient room to stow away the cloth with which they fashioned the additional breadth to the umbrella. To have cabbaged at one time all the sail-cloth that was required would have risked discovery; they therefore appropriated small scraps each day, and sewed these neatly together until they had enough. Soon they had a ring of canvas formed, into the centre of which the umbrella fitted exactly, and this ring was so cut and sewn in gores that it formed a continuation of the umbrella, which was thus made to spread out and cover a space of about nine or ten feet in diameter. All round the extremity or margin of the ring, cords of <b>twisted</b> <b>twine</b> were fixed, at intervals of about six inches. There were about sixty of these cords or stays, all of which met and were fastened {{at the end of the}} handle. A stout line, made of four-ply twine, was fastened at the top of the umbrella, and passing through a small hole in it was tied round the whalebones inside, and twisted down the stick to the handle, to which it was firmly secured. By this means the whole machine was, as it were, bound together.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} second-quantized {{version of the}} <b>twisted</b> <b>twining</b> genera of {{generalized}} Mathieu moonshine, and prove that they give rise to Siegel modular forms with infinite product representations. Most of these forms {{are expected to have}} an interpretation as twisted partition functions counting 1 / 4 BPS dyons in type II superstring theory on K 3 x T- 2 or in heterotic CHL-models. We show that all these Siegel modular forms, independently of their possible physical interpretation, satisfy an "S-duality" transformation and a "wall-crossing formula". The latter reproduces all the eta-products of an older version of generalized Mathieu moonshine proposed by Mason in the 1990 s. Surprisingly, some of the Siegel modular forms we find coincide with the multiplicative (Borcherds) lifts of Jacobi forms in umbral moonshine...|$|R

From the elevation, however, to which Rollo had now attained, the whole of this vast region was in view.

One, 2, and 3 lines were stretched 8 cm in front and 12 cm above (1 line), 8 and 18 cm above (2 lines), and 5, 12, and 18 cm above (3 lines) the ledges. The proportion of successful landings to attempted landings was reduced from 0. 99 (0 lines) to 0. 23 (1 line), 0. 13 (2 lines), and 0. 10 (3 lines). The number of pretreatment landings per ledge per hour X = 24. 1) was reduced {{to an average of}} 11. 7, 7. 7, and 5. 6 landings per hour with 1, 2, and 3 lines, respectively. The proportion of doves that successfully landed increased from weekends 1 through 4 and from days 1 through 4 within weekends indicating that some rock doves learned to circumvent the lines. Rock doves likely had a greater incentive to land on ledges on our study site compared to most other sites because large roosting and nesting areas were found behind 3 of the ledges. With a lower incentive to land, nylon lines may be even more effective for deterring landings by rock doves at other sites...|$|R

They are arranged alternately on the stem of the plant. The slender petioles are usually at least 3 centimeters long and have a slight adaxial groove.

60|$|As you may easily imagine, the Old Man of the Sea {{awoke in}} a fright. But his astonishment {{could hardly have}} been greater than was that of Hercules, the next moment.

Immediately afterwards, there was an ugly three-headed dog, which growled and barked at Hercules, and snapped fiercely at the hands by which he held him! But Hercules would not let him go.

The coat was fastened by other twine strings tied through the buttonholes and other holes rudely pierced in the opposite side. There was never such a weird garment so fantastically bedecked and of so many mottled hues. The lone button was the size of a half-dollar, made of yellow horn and sewed on with coarse twine.|$|R

The soldier and the Huguenot rushed swiftly up the first flight of stairs, and were about to ascend the second one, {{from the head of}} which the uproar seemed to proceed, when a great eight-day clock came hurtling down, springing four steps at a time, and ending with a leap across the landing and a crash against the wall, which left it a shattered heap of metal wheels and wooden splinters. An instant afterwards four men, so locked together that they formed but one rolling bundle, came thudding down amid a debris of splintered stair-rails, and writhed and struggled upon the landing, staggering up, falling down, and all breathing together like the wind in a chimney. So <b>twisted</b> and <b>twined</b> were they that it was hard to pick one from the other, save that the innermost was clad in black Flemish cloth, while the three who clung to him were soldiers of the king. Yet so strong and vigorous was the man whom they tried to hold that as often as he could find his feet he dragged them after him from end to end of the passage, as a boar might pull the curs which had fastened on to his haunches. An officer, who had rushed down at the heels of the brawlers, thrust his hands in to catch the civilian by the throat, but he whipped them back again with an oath as the man's strong white teeth met in his left thumb. Clapping the wound to his mouth, he flashed out his sword and was about to drive it through the body of his unarmed opponent, when De Catinat sprang forward and caught him by the wrist.|$|R
40|$|In my work I am {{concerned}} with the general concepts of movement and change and specifically with the profoundness {{of the idea that}} we are touched by fiber from the moment of birth until the moment of death. This accessibility of textiles combined with the vast historical foundation of textiles allows for abundant exploration as an artist. In her book, On Weaving, Anni Albers (1965) defines weaving as 2 ̆ 2 the making of a pliable plane 2 ̆ 2 (19). She further describes six structures used to create this pliable plane. They are interlacing (which we normally think of as weaving), plaiting or braiding, looping, knotting, <b>twisting</b> or <b>twining,</b> and matting or felting (Albers, 1965, p. 19). I embrace this definition of weaving because it describes the physicality of the textile itself, the process of making the textile, and the broad focus of weaving. DESCRIPTION OF WORKSUsing structures found in old dishtowels, a series of works titled 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 explores everyday events {{in the life of a}} dishtowel. Because dishtowels are used in many ways other than drying dishes, torn edges, stained areas, and twisted fibers communicate these possibilities. 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Fragment 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Towel 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness waffle weave structures; 2 ̆ 2 Twill Towel 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Twill Fragment 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness twill structures, all common structures found in dishtowels. Linen fibers painted with inks before interlacing work to create an integration of surface and structure to enhance the meanings of these humble textiles. 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 (Figure 1) illustrates these techniques. The series 2 ̆ 2 Deadhead 2 ̆ 7 s Straight Wardrobe 2 ̆ 2 uses the paper making process. This process mats cotton linter fibers and bonds them together with pressure. The paper doll image is used as a vehicle to explore the ordinary man 2 ̆ 7 s shirt and comment on how quickly a personal image can be changed and how superficial that change can be. The paper doll image works as a visual vehicle to facilitate these quick-change possibilities. The male shirt was chosen because it is less commonly thought of as an image maker. Questions are raised and visual comments on gender issues are made. The surface image is literal in that the color and mixed media are visually on the surface of the handmade paper; although structurally, they are part of the paper making process. The matting/felting process is used; cotton linter, dyes, pigments, and mixed media are used to create these works...|$|R

60|$|The {{battle was}} now entirely terminated, with the {{exception}} of the protracted struggle between Le Renard Subtil and Le Gros Serpent. Well did these barbarous warriors prove that they deserved those significant names which had been bestowed for deeds in former wars. When they engaged, some little time was lost in eluding the quick and vigorous thrusts which had been aimed at their lives. Suddenly darting on each other, they closed, and came to the earth, <b>twisted</b> together like <b>twining</b> serpents, in pliant and subtle folds. At the moment when the victors found themselves unoccupied, the spot where these experienced and desperate combatants lay, could only be distinguished by a cloud of dust and leaves which moved from the centre of the little plain towards its boundary, as if raised by the passage of a whirlwind. Urged by the different motives of filial affection, friendship, and gratitude, Heyward and his companions rushed with one accord to the place, encircling the little canopy of dust which hung above the warriors. In vain did Uncas dart around the cloud, with a wish to strike his knife into the heart of his father's foe; the threatening rifle of Hawkeye was raised and suspended in vain, while Duncan endeavored to seize the limbs of the Huron with hands that appeared to have lost their power. Covered, as they were, with dust and blood, the swift evolutions of the combatants seemed to incorporate their bodies into one. The death-like looking figure of the Mohican, and the dark form of the Huron, gleamed before their eyes in such quick and confused succession, that the friends of the former knew not where nor when to plant the succoring blow. It is true there were short and fleeting moments, when the fiery eyes of Magua were seen glittering, like the fabled organs of the basilisk, through the dusty wreath by which he was enveloped, and he read by those short and deadly glances the fate of the combat in the presence of his enemies; ere, however, any hostile hand could descend on his devoted head, its place was filled by the scowling visage of Chingachgook. In this manner the scene of the combat was removed from the centre of the little plain to its verge. The Mohican now found an opportunity to make a powerful thrust with his knife; Magua suddenly relinquished his grasp, and fell backward without motion, and seemingly without life. His adversary leaped on his feet, making the arches of the forest ring with the sounds of triumph.|$|R
