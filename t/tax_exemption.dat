The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than , and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions to sites owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the <b>tax</b> <b>exemption,</b> Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the <b>tax</b> <b>exemption,</b> it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E

5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including <b>tax</b> <b>exemption,</b> assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E

5|$|Lollapalooza, {{an annual}} summer music festival in Grant Park, was exempt from taxation. Emanuel's brother Ari is the co-CEO of William Morris Endeavor, which co-owns the event. In 2011 Rahm Emanuel asked the City Council to appoint an {{independent}} third party negotiator, {{to avoid having}} the negotiation seen as biased. Although the deal was reached before Emanuel took office, tax breaks must be negotiated every year. It was later revealed that the festival received its <b>tax</b> <b>exemption</b> for 2011 {{in the final days}} of the Daley administration. In 2012, Lollapalooza paid taxes for the first time in seven years and extended its contract to host in Grant Park through 2021.|$|E

The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet {{under the command of}} his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a <b>tax</b> <b>exemption</b> for Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the future economic and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home heating fuel, which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll <b>tax</b> <b>exemption</b> from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the surplus for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E
5|$|The Wall Street Crash of 1929 {{occurred}} {{only weeks}} after the building was completed. At that time more than 80% of the apartments were rented and some 300 students had signed up to take classes at the Institute. However, both rentals and student fees were soon depleted, and the nonprofit corporation that ran the building was unable to meet its payments. On April 6, 1932, this organization was sued for nonpayment of taxes and sinking fund payments due on the mortgage bonds. At {{that time it was}} alleged that the building was being mismanaged, the principal evidence offered being the provision of free living quarters to the Roeriches and their followers. Horch successfully contested the suit partly on a technicality and partly by explaining that the 20 rooms occupied rent-free were used by management as partial compensation to employees of the corporation. Representatives of the bond holders had argued that the parts of the building that did not produce rental income—that is the museum, institute, and other cultural spaces—should be converted to apartments but Horch successfully countered that the museum et al. were an asset that generated a substantial <b>tax</b> <b>exemption</b> and that, in normal times, they led to higher rental rates from the existing apartments than would comparable apartments. He also pointed out that the demanded conversion would be expensive (about $100,000). In June 1932, the foreclosure case ended with Horch being named one of two receivers tasked with clearing the building's debts.|$|E
