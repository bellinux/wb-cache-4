25|$|The {{fifth day}} {{did not hold}} much enthusiasm as the {{scorecards}} might suggest, as India took off from where they started, from 362/6. India's tail wagged as they put on 47 runs {{for the loss of}} 4 wickets. Ajit Agarkar was the first man <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning to Andy Bichel, and then he was followed by Parthiv Patel, whose ill-fated, top-edged hook was caught by a diving Bichel off Gillespie. The two batsmen departed without India adding any run to their score. At 362/8, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh had a fine outing with the bat. Zaheer swatted a six and three boundaries in his 27 and Harbhajan hit 19 in his own inimitable fashion, as India pushed along to 409. They had obtained a lead of 86– a rarity in Australia against Australia itself. Moreover, this achievement was significant because India were written off before the match even began.|$|E
500|$|Anderson was by {{no means}} alone in her late {{emergence}} onto the literary stage: Geordie Williamson notes that several of Anderson's Australian female contemporaries including Elizabeth Jolley, Olga Masters, and Amy Witting did not begin publishing until they had reached retirement age. He suggests that each of these women was constrained largely by material circumstances, including [...] "the demands of family and work, lack of financial independence, an indifferent publishing environment." [...] When discussing her career, Anderson was quite clear about where her duties lay: [...] "When I was married, and writing at home (writing was my second job; my first was the house) ... I never craved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace." [...] He suggests that, as well as adverse material circumstances, Anderson's career was delayed, and her success mitigated by modesty and a certain [...] "diffidence regarding her gifts." [...] In her own essay entitled [...] "Starting Too Late," [...] Anderson complains that [...] "they are unwilling servants, those skills we learn too late." [...] She would perhaps have described success as such a skill. When asked about how winning awards had affected her life, she replied that: ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{they are}} going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hills {{stealing}} our property, we will put measures of defense. And they have always asked us, [...] "What will you do, what will you do?" [...] and our stance has always been we will do whatever it takes. Open-ended. And because of that, that's why they are scared, because they don't know to what level {{we will go to}} protect, but we will protect.|$|E

2500|$|After {{completing}} 'Basic Training' the recruit is now {{attached to}} a Field Intelligence Bureau (FIB). His/her training here lasts for 1–2 years. He/she is given firsthand experience {{of what it was}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figurative cold, conducting clandestine operations. During night exercises under realistic conditions, he/she is taught infiltration and exfiltration. He/she is instructed to avoid capture and if caught, how to face interrogation. He/she learns the art of reconnoitre, making contacts, and, the numerous skills of operating an intelligence mission. At the end of the field training, the new recruit is brought back to the school for final polishing. Before his deployment in the field, he/she is given exhaustive training in the art of self-defence mainly Krav Maga, and the use of technical espionage devices. He/she is also drilled in various administrative disciplines so that he could take his place in the foreign missions without arousing suspicion. He/she is now ready to operate under the cover of an Embassy to gather information, set up his own network of informers, moles or operatives as the task may require. Field training is provided in the Indian Military Academy Headquarters at Dehradun. The training model has been criticised as being 'archaic and too police-centric' and not [...] incorporating 'modern technological advances in methods of communication' etc.|$|E
2500|$|These {{boats are}} usually made of rigid {{materials}} - such as glass reinforced resin, plywood or aluminium. Day boats are generally relatively large: typically, between [...] in length, as they must provide some comfort for the passengers for several hours. Many day boats {{are used for}} scuba-divers and also for other marine tourism activities such as fishing and whale-watching. In general, divers or passengers will spend only the daylight hours on a day boat, and do not sleep in them overnight. Dive boats which provide sleeping accommodation are generally referred to as [...] "live-aboard" [...] boats. Generally a professional crew operate the boat. The boat provides shelter from the weather {{and is likely to}} have various facilities such as a toilet (called the [...] "head") and a small kitchen (called a [...] "galley"), to cater for the guests and crew. Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a shaded area, for divers wishing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them.|$|E

2500|$|No LBW - As many {{backyard}} cricket {{games are}} without umpires, or self-umpired, or played with juniors, teams may agree to {{not use the}} relatively difficult LBW rule. Another alternative is [...] "Auto-LBW", by which the batsman <b>is</b> always deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> almost any possible LBW scenario; {{it also has the}} effects of discouraging purely defensive batting, and typically increases the rotation of batsmen.|$|R
