25|$|Consumers' {{choices in}} music {{have been studied}} as <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Big Five {{personality}} traits: openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness. In general, the plasticity traits (openness to experience and extraversion) affect music preference more than the stability traits (agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness). Gender {{has been shown to}} influence preference, with men choosing music for primarily cognitive reasons and women for emotional reasons. Relationships with music preference have also been found with mood and nostalgic association.|$|E

25|$|Over {{five hundred}} Kathakali plays (Aattakatha) exist, {{most of which}} were written before the 20th century. Of these, about four dozen are most {{actively}} performed. These plays are sophisticated literary works, states Zarrilli, and only five authors have written more than two plays. The late 17th century Unnayi Variyar, in his short life, produced four plays which are traditionally considered the most expressive of the Kathakali playwrights. Typically, his four plays are performed on four nights, and <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mythical Hindu love story of Nala and Damayanti. The Nala-Damanyanti story has roots in the texts of 1st millennium BCE, and is found in the Mahabharata, but the Kathakali play version develops the characters, their inner states, the emotions and their circumstances far more than the older texts.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, the Fish and Wildlife Service {{created a}} new program, Ocean Research, and made Sette its director. Again, Sette took charge of a new {{laboratory}} and, from a headquarters {{on the campus of}} Stanford University, pioneered yet another new aspect of fisheries science, namely, an examination of all available data concerning the oceans and development of an understanding of how <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abundance and distribution of fish. He again created a team of biologists, oceanographers, and meteorologists, and they analyzed a mass of data on sea surface temperatures, weather observations, and all known data on the abundance of fish over time. By 1961, Sette had published analysis that demonstrated that abundance in a fishery depended not only fish population size itself, but also on the availability of the fish population to exploitation by fishing vessels, with oceanographic and meteorological factors playing a role in the latter as currents and weather differed from year to year. One of the team′s innovative achievements was the publication of an atlas of 168 monthly mean sea surface temperature charts for the Pacific Ocean north of latitude 20° North covering the years 1949 through 1962.|$|E

500|$|The case In re Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation {{was filed}} {{as a class}} action in 2005 {{claiming}} Apple violated the U.S. antitrust statutes in operating a music-downloading monopoly that it created by changing its software design to the proprietary FairPlay encoding in 2004, resulting in other vendors' music files being incompatible with and thus inoperable on the iPod. The suit initially alleged that five days after RealNetworks released in 2004 its [...] technology making its music playable on iPods, Apple changed its software such that the RealNetworks music would no longer play on iPods. The claims of Apple's changes to its encoding and its refusal to license FairPlay technology to other companies were dismissed by the court 2009, but the allegation of Apple's monopoly on the iPod's music download capabilities between 2004 and 2009 remained as of July 2012. In March 2011, Bloomberg reported that, after a related 3-year inquiry by the Competition Commission, Apple agreed in 2008 to lower its prices on iTunes tracks sold in the United Kingdom and that Steve Jobs had been directed by the court in March 2011 to make himself available to be deposed on Apple's FairPlay changes as <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plaintiffs' monopolization claim.|$|E
500|$|For Simmel, culture {{referred}} to [...] "the cultivation of individuals through {{the agency of}} external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". While early theorists such as Durkheim and Mauss were influential in cultural anthropology, sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for modern (rather than primitive or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the hermeneutic analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with critical theory in the vein of Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, {{and other members of the}} Frankfurt School. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of cultural studies. Birmingham School theorists such as Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall questioned the division between [...] "producers" [...] and [...] "consumers" [...] evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a subculture (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dominant class. The [...] "cultural turn" [...] of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.|$|E

2500|$|The first natural problem {{proven to}} be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem. As noted above, this is the Cook–Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete {{contains}} technical details about Turing machines as <b>they</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that if you could solve Sudoku in polynomial time, you could use this to complete Latin squares in polynomial time. [...] This in turn gives {{a solution to the}} problem of partitioning tri-partitite graphs into triangles, which could then be used to find solutions for 3-sat, which then provides a solution for general boolean satisfiability. [...] So a polynomial time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other NP-complete problem in polynomial time. [...] Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense [...] "the same problem".|$|E
