5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from <b>the</b> <b>dictionary.</b> However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell.

After American was completely backed out, West Gate began rapidly settling and was ordered abandoned. A total of seven men from West Gate died in the accident—two when their lifeboat capsized, and a further five that probably died in the initial impact. West Gates commanding officer, Lt. Cdr. R. B. Vandervoort, and six men he had personally escorted to a life raft were picked up by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water. <b>The</b> <b>Dictionary</b> of American Naval Fighting Ships does not report any casualties on American from the collision.|$|E

According to Turner and Round, the younger Hugh's mother was Isabel, who may have been a member of the Twist family from Lincolnshire. The younger Hugh acquired land at Waddington, Lincolnshire as a tenant of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, sometime in the middle 1140s.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} a {{comparison}} of the most common German and Czech valency lexicons, focusing on <b>the</b> <b>dictionaries</b> E-VALBU and VALLEX in particular.
