40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The U. S. Army {{is beginning to}} field the first of six Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs) and equip the organic Anti-Tank (AT) Company of the Brigade with the LAV III Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) Platform and the Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided 2 <b>B</b> (<b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B)</b> missile system. A developmental effort is currently underway to replace the aging <b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B</b> and Hellfire missile systems with a common missile that meets both ground and air requirements. With increased range, lethality, and target acquisition capability, the Common Missile (CM) is being designed as the primary weapon system for the Army's Comanche helicopter and {{is a candidate for}} the lethality system of the Future Combat System (FCS) within the Army's Objective Force. Additionally, the CM is designed to be "backwards compatible" with existing <b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B</b> and Hellfire launch platforms. The objective of this research effort is to determine the increase in operational effectiveness through the employment of the CM in the AT company of the SBCT in three different scenarios, using the high-resolution Janus Combat Model. Operational effectiveness will be assessed and statistically analyzed using lethality, survivability, and engagement range for three measures of effectiveness (MOEs) Major, United States Arm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper will}} present the results from four series of Fragment Impact (FI) tests on the <b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B</b> warhead {{utilizing}} multiple Particle Impact Mitigation Sleeve (PIMS) configurations. Previously it has been demonstrated that {{the addition of a}} plastic, typically ULTEM® 1000, PIMS reduces the sensitivity of a munition to the FI threat. The mechanism by which the sensitivity is reduced is the reflection of the shockwave at the interface between the PIMS and the munition case material. The munitions to which this protection scheme has been applied previously use PBXN- 9 as the main fill explosive and are therefore easier to protect using a single component PIMS than <b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B,</b> which uses LX- 14 as the main fill. LX- 14 is a more sensitive explosive than PBXN- 9, and requires additional material in the shotline to reduce the shock pressure in the explosive via reduction of velocity, breakup of the incoming fragment, and shock reflection at the interface between the case and the PIMS. The test results demonstrate that <b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B</b> can be protected using a plastic PIMS in combination with a second layer of hard material spaced from the munition to break the fragment and slow it down prior to impact with the PIMS...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The US Army is currently {{developing a new}} close combat missile system, Common Missile, to replace the aging Tubelaunched, Optically-tracked, Wire-guided (<b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B)</b> and HELLFIRE missile systems. The Common Missile will have a greater range and improved target acquisition capability over the current missile systems. The purpose of this thesis is to compare {{the performance of the}} Common Missile and the <b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B</b> missile in a simulated ground battle situation in three varying terrain conditions. This thesis used the Janus high resolution combat model to simulate the missile systems in a Desert, European and Mediterranean environment. Each of the scenarios used a force-on-force battle to measure effectiveness. Data were gathered from the Janus created postprocessor files of the three scenarios. The analysis compared three measures of effectiveness (MOEs) in the areas of lethality, survivability and engagement range. The goal of the analysis was to determine performance differences between the missile systems by comparing the mean of the simulation results. Civilian, United States Arm...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{method for}} {{determining}} the response of a munition to the Fragment Impact (FI) stimulus based on hydrocode modeling and statistical analysis is presented. A {{modified version of the}} Hugh James Criterion is coupled to a logistic regression technique to obtain a normalized distance from initiation threshold as determined experimentally through FI tests. The method has been shown to correlate well with observations at multiple impact velocities with various configurations of FI mitigation schemes. A total of 65 FI shots have been completed to date on the <b>TOW</b> 2 <b>B</b> warhead through two different shotlines, and the data will be presented here. The two shotlines are through the cylindrical section and the boattail section of the warhead. When fit to the overall data set, 51 out of 65 observations are correctly categorized...|$|R

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{two very}} different types of two-dimensional fluid flows. For {{these two types of}} flows, experiments performed at APL have confirmed the validity of a common, chaos-based approach that connects fundamental dynamical quantities to the static geometry of a flow visualization at an instant in time. We first discuss closed surface flows. These can exhibit a type of time-varying strange attractor, whose geometric properties can be predicted in terms of dynamical quantities. We then discuss an open flow, where the chaotic behavior is unstable and transient, but which nevertheless leaves characteristic traces that can be Figure 1.

Bus trailers B 40 has been widely used on routes of Czechoslovak state automobile transport in industrial areas that were drying off for buses in peak working days. Trailers are also applied in urban transport, although in smaller quantities. In some cities (Ostrava, Pardubice, Plzeň and Zlín) were even on the busiest routes coupled with trolleybuses. In normal operation, trailers B 40 maintained until the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|Tow, {{which is}} the oldest {{community}} in the county, began with the arrival in 1852 of David and Gideon Cowan and their mother, Ruth, originally from Tennessee. The Cowans were directed by local Indians to a salt bed near the Colorado River, which they developed into a successful saltworks. Significant {{not only in the}} local economy, the Bluffton-Tow Salt Works was also known as the Confederate States of America Salt Works for its contribution to the Confederate cause. The operation was destroyed by the [...] "salt works cyclone" [...] in 1871. John F. Morgan arrived in the area with his family in 1853 and soon established a hat business, using beaver and other fur trapped locally. When the Tow brothers, William and Wilson, arrived with their families in 1853, they named the nearby area in which they settled Tow Valley. A post office was established there in 1886 as <b>Tow</b> with Mathew <b>B.</b> Clendenen as postmaster. Tow grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s with the addition of retirement and recreation to its economic base. From a population of fifty before 1950, the lakeside town had grown to 305 by 1974, when it had a post office and numerous businesses. In 2000 the population was still 305; thirty-one businesses were reported.http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hlt26 ...|$|R
40|$|Flow boiling is {{important}} in energy conversion and thermal management due to its potential for very high heat fluxes. By improving understanding of the conditions leading to bubble departure, surfaces can be designed that increase heat transfer coefficients in flow boiling. Bubbles were visualized during subcooled nucleate flow boiling of water on a surface of variable wettability. Images obtained from the videos were analyzed to find parameters influencing bubble size at departure. A model was developed relating {{the dimensions of the}} bubble at departure to its upstream and downstream contact angles based on a rigid-body force balance between momentum and surface tension and assuming a skewed truncated spherical bubble shape. Both experimental and theoretical results predict that bubble width and height decrease with increasing flow speed and that the width increases with the equilibrium contact angle. The model also predicts that the width and height increase with the amount of contact angle hysteresis and that the height increases with equilibrium contact angle, though neither of these trends were clearly demonstrated by the data. Several directions for future research are proposed, including modifications to the model to account for deviations of the bubbles from the assumed geometry and research into the parameters controlling contact angle hysteresis of bubbles in a flow. Additionally, observations support that surfaces with periodically-varying contact angle may prevent film formation and increase the heat transfer coefficients in both film and pool boiling. by Emily W. <b>Tow.</b> Thesis (S. <b>B.)</b> [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2012.
