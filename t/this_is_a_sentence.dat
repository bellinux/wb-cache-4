50|$|For example, in the {{sentence}} The old woman eats the falafel, the c-structure analysis is that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> {{which is made}} up of two pieces, a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP). The VP is itself made up of two pieces, a verb (V) and another NP. The NPs are also analyzed into their parts. Finally, the bottom of the structure is composed of the words out of which {{the sentence}} is constructed. The f-structure analysis, on the other hand, treats the sentence as being composed of attributes, which include features such as number and tense or functional units such as subject, predicate, or object.|$|E

5000|$|Critics cite {{weaknesses}} of Sankoff and Poplack's model. The free-morpheme and equivalence constraints are insufficiently restrictive, meaning {{there are numerous}} exceptions that occur. For example, the free morpheme constraint {{does not account for}} why switching is impossible between certain free morphemes. The sentence: [...] "The students had visto la película italiana" [...] ("The students had seen the Italian movie") does not occur in Spanish-English code-switching, yet the free-morpheme constraint would seem to posit that it can. The equivalence constraint would also rule out switches that occur commonly in languages, as when Hindi postpositional phrases are switched with English prepositional phrases like in the sentence: [...] "John gave a book ek larakii ko" [...] ("John gave a book to a girl"). The phrase ek larakii ko is literally translated as a girl to, making it ungrammatical in English, and yet <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> that occurs in English-Hindi code-switching despite the requirements of the equivalence constraint. The Sankoff and Poplack model only identifies points at which switching is blocked, as opposed to explaining which constituents can be switched and why.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will discuss a rather recondite {{phenomenon}} {{in the area of}} sequence of tense (SOT), exhibited by sentences like (1) : (1) John said that Mary is pregnant. According to traditional grammar, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> where sequence of tense has failed to apply (i. e., concord has been broken) : standard sequence of tense rules would dictate use of a past tense when embedding an event contemporaneous to the embedding verb under a past tense verb, giving the sentence John said that Mary was pregnant. For some verbs breaking concord is impossible (*Mary said that John builds a house) or can only have a present-as-future interpretation (John said that the last spaceship to Mars leaves tomorrow), but with stative verbs, as Enç (1987) and others have observed, this failure of sequence of tense to apply is associated with a rather special meaning, which we will try to elucidate below. For the moment, let us merely observe that the use of present tense seems to cause such sentences to end up saying something about a larger interval including both the time of utterance and the time of the event described in the main clause. For this reason Enç calls them “double access sentences”, but that seems a rather dubious name as the interpretation seems to rely on evaluation at a large interval, not just at two points...|$|E

With a chapter devoted to each, these three terms allow me to interrogate {{the work of the}} sentence, to think through the performativity of prose, to claim that the sentence moves on the page and that those moves constitute a rhetorical delivery that brings discourse to its readers. This project intervenes in two bodies of scholarship. To work in stylistics calling Composition back to the <b>sentence,</b> I offer <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> re-theorized in light of its rhetorical delivery, <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> necessarily bound up in the social, the political, and the rhetorical by way of how its grammar holds ideas in relation one to another. To current scholarship in delivery, I offer the <b>sentence</b> as <b>a</b> mediated and embodied technology delivering discourse. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> performative <b>sentence,</b> one that asks teachers and students to read and write the sentence differently, looking not to error or argumentation as benchmarks of good writing but instead toward the performative drama unfolding as the sentence moves across the page. But, given that the sentence is the foundation of both a writer’s work and a writer’s education, this dissertation reaches beyond Composition to anywhere the teaching of writing takes place, the methods of engaging the sentence I demonstrate here applicable in a variety of rhetorical and pedagogical settings. A note on method: I rely solely on student writing for my corpus of sentences. I do so because most books on the sentence look to the prose of famous writers (Presidents, Martin Luther King, Jr., Didion, Wolfe, Updike, and the like), and student sentences, if they do appear at all, serve as examples of error. The argument is subtle but clear: students cannot write good sentences. I disagree, and this project teaches other ways we might read student work. ...|$|R

To find the {{relevant}} sentences, we combine sentence salience features that are inherited from text summarization domain with other heuristic features based on topic statements. We propose a novel method to extract the new sentences based on the graph-based ranking of the similarity relation between the sentences. 1. Overview The University of Michigan participated in all four tasks of the TREC 2004 Novelty track. To find the relevant sentences in Tasks 1 and 3, we experimented with more than ten features. The system was trained with all possible subsets of these features on the Novelty 2003 data using different learning algorithms to be explained below. All of the features were integrated into the MEAD 1 text summarization system (Radev, Blair-Goldensohn, & Zhang, 2001). The following <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{brief description of the}} features we used in the actual submissions, which gave us the best results on the training data: • Centroid: The centroid score that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> measure of how close is the sentence to the centroid pseudosentence of the entire cluster. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> measure of <b>sentence</b> salience which is proven to be successful in multi-document summarization domain (Radev, Jing, & Budzikowska, 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|Developing a {{coherent}} evidence based methodology for determining sanctions in cartel cases {{is vitally important}} for robust cartel enforcement in Ireland. This methodology should take into account aggravating/mitigating factors for individuals as well as culpability indicators for firms, {{while at the same}} time taking cognisance of the economic damage caused by cartels to consumers. Irish Courts, despite presiding over 33 convictions on indictment for cartel offences stretching back over six years have, as yet, to develop such a methodology. While the Duffy judgment, the only reported judgment on <b>sentencing</b> of <b>a</b> cartel member, the Court provides some guidance on sentencing. It states, for example, that cartels are bad and pernicious and that jail sentences are to be expected in future cartel cases. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> coherent <b>sentencing</b> methodology. The Sentencing Guidelines, developed by the US Sentencing Commission, provide such a methodology, while at the same allowing for judicial discretion. Applying that methodology to the facts of the Citroen cartel case in Ireland, in which 14 individuals and firms were convicted on indictment, suggests that the current approach to sentencing in Ireland by the Courts results in fines and jail sentences that <b>are</b> too low. <b>This</b> encourages rather than discourages cartel activity which raises prices for consumers and thus damages consumer welfare...|$|R
