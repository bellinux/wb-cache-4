5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from <b>the</b> <b>curricula</b> of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{teaching}} style differed from conventional music instruction {{at the time}} in that she required instrumental students to study voice. Piano, organ and violin instruction was offered by 1907. Organ was under the instruction of Gertrude Madeira Smith, Eleanor's sister, and violin was taught by Charles Moerenhout of the Chicago Orchestra. Five assistants also helped the teachers. Smith felt that adding vocal training gave a level of experience that was neglected by singular focus on memorization of scales and structural drills usually prevalent for those learning instruments. She also incorporated songs from the students' homelands as a way to intermingle their old cultures with their new lives and made effort to involve the parents in the development of <b>the</b> <b>curricula.</b> As a progressive reformer, Smith advocated that inclusive diversity was a means of building a cosmopolitan citizenry united by pursuit of music excellence. She also encouraged students to compose music from their earliest instruction and to recover songs from their cultural backgrounds.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{analyzes}} {{the influence that}} <b>the</b> new <b>curricula</b> have on <b>the</b> age of finalization of the studies {{of students enrolled in}} the University of Valencia.
