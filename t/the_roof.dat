5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E

30|$|With the {{development}} of LTCC technology, the comprehensive mechanical model for LTCC mining face has been greatly improved. Liu Changyou, et al. used site observation, finite element numerical calculation, and the analogous material modelling method to investigate the comprehensive mechanical properties of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> and their effect {{on the relationship between}} support and surrounding rock. By considering <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> as a variable body, the characteristics of deformation and fracture of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> and <b>the</b> structural mechanical and stiffness properties of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> were studied. They proposed that the load of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> is regionalized, and provided a calculation method for the stiffness of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof.</b> In addition, based on the stiffness characteristics of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> with a rectangle shape face, <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> is divided into three categories as stiffness similar, zero stiffness and medium stiffness. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> stiffness is zero, the support is in the status of a “given load” or a “limited load”. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> is in a stiffness similar status, the support is in a “given deformation” status. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> is in a medium stiffness status, the “P–△L” curve shows a typical double curve relationship. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> is in a zero stiffness status, the rational resistance force of support is mainly determined by its effect on the stability of the face ends.|$|R
