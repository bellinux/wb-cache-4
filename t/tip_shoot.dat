In California the pathogen is causal agent of sudden oak death whereas in Europe as twig bight of ericaceous plants, rotting of Vibumum species and at least 30 others species including beech and red oak. In Poland P. ramorum was detected from Rhododendron, Calluna, Pieris and Photinia. Additionally P. citricola was isolatedfrom diseased Rhododendron stem parts and leaves whereas P. cactorum was found on rotted leaf blades of Photinia.

40|$|Five-a-side soccer”, {{also known}} as Futsal, {{originated}} in Uruguay in 1930. In South America it is known as futbol de salon, that is, indoor soccer. The official international denomination is Futsal which is coined from two words: futbol (soccer) and salon (a hall or covered place). In the Futsal, {{one of the most}} important variables to execute an effective action, it is the time needed by the athlete to complete his own movement (Nicoletti et al., 2007). Futsal is beneficial in developing motor skills unique to the technical characteristics of the game, such as the rules and the field of play for which the time to analyze, evaluate, elaborate, and execute is limited when compared to other team sports (Schmidt et al., 2000). Futsal is particularly adapted for children, ages 8 - 10 years, (Winter, in: Meinel et al., 1984) who are learning the specific techniques of play. For this reason, the Italian Soccer Federation (F. I. G. C.) has instituted futsal schools and has mandated Soccer 5 in its own basic programs. Furthermore, quality motor skills may be learned (Sanders et al., 2004 and Bandura, 1997) if they are included in the weekly instructional program. The purpose of the pilot study is to verify whether members of a sample are better at learning specific techniques (Menichelli, 2010), as compared to a control group, when the sample players watch and review videotaped actions or skills taken of the video recorded while they practice or video or a motor skills module. In the study protocol, 20 players practice twice a week for one year. But only 10 players view training videos before each practice. The two groups have the same technical characteristics (homogeneous). Each group is tested at the beginning, during, and at the end of the study on three techniques of the game, selected from fundamentals of play: 1. Control of the ball: oriented ball control with the bottom foot (called "stop by sole” or “sole control"); 2. Driving the ball: moving the ball with the sole; 3. Shooting: <b>tip</b> <b>shoot.</b> Two experts and the highly skilled sample player evaluate the videotape together. Statistical evaluation is done using multiple regression analysis of the curves of the two groups. Significant increases in the execution of the techniques of play should be found in the videotaped sample group and should lead to an in-depth study with a larger study sample. Eventually, positive findings of the hypothesis, would suggest video analysis to be included in training programs as an educational and evaluation tool...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of vitrification and droplet vitrification for the cryopreservation of Hancornia speciosa <b>shoot</b> <b>tips.</b> The <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> were subjected to four different periods of exposure (15, 30, 45 and 60 min.) to plant vitrification solution 2 (PVS 2) before plunging into liquid nitrogen.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{initiated}} to develop a protocol for the effective propagation of Artemisia scoparia. <b>Shoot</b> <b>tip,</b> leaf and petiole explants were used for callus production and <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> were used for direct organogenesis. Murashige and skoog medium supplemented with different concentrations and combinations were used through entire study. MS medium supplemented with 2, 4 -D and NAA in combination at different concentrations proved best for callus induction from all types of explants. Multiple <b>shoots</b> from <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> explants were produced at NAA in combination with BA or Kin. Best root initiation was observed at NAA supplemented in MS medium...|$|R
50|$|The sting {{nematode}} Belonolaimus gracilis and the awl nematode, Dolichodorus spp. {{are both}} ectoparasites that can injure collard. Root symptoms include, stubby or coarse roots that are dark at the <b>tips.</b> <b>Shoot</b> symptoms include, stunted growth, premature wilting and chlorosis (Nguyen and Smart, 1975). Another {{species of the}} sting worm: Belonolaimus longicaudatus is a pest of collards in Georgia and North Carolina (Robbins and Barker, 1973). B. longicaudatus is devastating to seedlings and transplants. As few as three nematodes per 100g of soil when transplanting can cause significant yield losses on susceptible plants. They are most common in sandy soils (Noling, 2012).|$|R
30|$|The inflorescences, embryos {{and seeds}} of the bamboos are good {{resources}} for explants, but they are difficult to obtain because bamboos rarely blossom and bear fruit. However, <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> are available {{at any time and}} easy to obtain. Thus, <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> can be used as explants to create regenerated plantlets through callus induction and regeneration.|$|R
40|$|Trehalose, an {alpha},{alpha}-diglucoside, induced a rapid {{blackening}} {{and death}} of <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> of Cuscuta reflexa (dodder) cultured in vitro. The onset of toxic symptom was delayed {{if any of the}} several sugars which support the in vitro growth of Cuscuta was supplied with trehalose. The rate of trehalose uptake or its accumulation in the tissue was not affected by sugar cofeeding. The levels of total and reducing sugars declined appreciably in the trehalose-fed <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> explants compared to control tissue cultured in absence of a carbon source. This was not due to an increased rate of respiration of the trehalose-treated tissue. In <b>shoot</b> <b>tips</b> cultured in presence of both trehalose and sucrose, the decline in total and reducing sugars was curtailed. There was a marked fall in the level of sucrose; and invertase activity was higher in trehalose-fed <b>shoot</b> <b>tips.</b> The incorporation of label from [14 C]glucose into sucrose in the <b>shoot</b> <b>tip</b> explant was reduced as early as 12 h of trehalose feeding. The results suggest that increased utilization of sucrose as well as an inhibition of its synthesis contribute to the drastic fall in the sucrose content upon trehalose feedin...|$|R
