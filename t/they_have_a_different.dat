25|$|The Irish Mark 3 {{coaches were}} similar, but not identical, to their British counterparts. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> {{electrical}} system (220/380V, 50Hz) {{and were the}} first Mark 3's to be fitted with automatic swing-plug doors. There were also some different internal layouts more specifically suited to Irish traffic.|$|R
25|$|In 1922–23 {{a further}} three {{locomotives}} were delivered, becoming Nos.6 to 8. Although {{similar to the}} first engines in terms of size and power, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> design. Again all were built by Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works of Winterthur.|$|E
25|$|Since {{conditions}} {{from city}} to city differ, every district heating system is unique. In addition, nations have different access to primary energy carriers and so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> approach on how to address heating markets within their borders.|$|E
25|$|Toric or sphero-cylindrical lenses have {{surfaces}} {{with two}} different radii of curvature in two orthogonal planes. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> focal power in different meridians.

60|$|There {{was no real}} {{cause for}} any {{disagreement}} between these two nations. Their hostility to each other was mere rivalry and spontaneous hate.

25|$|The {{instrumentation}} differs between congas santiagueras and congas habaneras. Congas santiagueras {{include the}} corneta china (Chinese cornet), {{which is an}} adaptation of the Cantonese suona introduced in Oriente in 1915, and its percussion section comprises bocúes (similar to African ashiko drums), the quinto (highest pitched conga drum), galletas and the pilón, as well as brakes which are struck with metal sticks. Congas habaneras lack the corneta china but include trumpets, trombones and saxophones, and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> set of percussion instruments: redoblantes (side drums), bombos (bass drums), quinto, tumbadora (the lowest pitched conga drum), and metallic idiophones such as cowbells, spoons, frying pans and rims.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} Nirukta {{can be traced}} to the last centuries of the 2nd-millennium BCE Brahmanas layer of the Vedic texts. However, the most ancient {{complete}} surviving text of this field is a commentary on Nighantu by , who probably lived about the 5th century BCE. His text is also referred simply as Nirukta. The study of Nirukta has been closely related to the ancillary Vedic science of Vyakarana, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> focus. Vyakarana deals with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, while Nirukta focuses on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words, given the context they are used in. Yaska asserts that the prerequisite to the study of Nirukta is the study of Vyakarana.|$|E
50|$|These {{cars had}} many similar {{features}} to the later-built cars, including the one-piece moulded {{glass reinforced plastic}} end in royal blue & grey livery (earning them the Blue Goose nickname), semi-automatic doors, electronically controlled brakes and double-glazed windows. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> style of headlight and interior lighting to subsequent builds.|$|R

"Performers {{should not}} be able to commandeer a police force (as Bill Cosby's representatives {{appeared}} to do) in order to exclude individuals from the performance because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> viewpoint than the performer has", Allred said.

2500|$|<b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{different}}</b> {{face for}} different occasions. In conversations with each other, they often undergo a subtle change. I have seen men {{who appeared to}} be normal suddenly smile roguishly, soften their voices, and simper as they greeted homosexual friends... Many times I saw these changes occur after I had gained a homosexual's confidence and he could safely risk my disapproval. Once as I watched a luncheon companion become an effeminate caricature of himself, he apologised, [...] "It is hard to always remember that one is a man." ...|$|E
50|$|The Urban Taskforce {{was founded}} in 1999 when a number of {{property}} developers and equity property financiers decided that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> view of the planning system than dedicated fund managers,asset managers and many property consultants. The founding director of the Urban Taskforce was David Tanevski from KWC Capital Partners who continues {{in the role of}} Hon. Secretary Treasurer.|$|R
50|$|The Zulus Motorcycle Club {{were founded}} in 1969. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> purpose {{to many other}} clubs of the time, in {{that they wanted to}} be based around black men, where almost all other clubs had been made up of only white men, even if unintentionally.

[...] Some trans people in New Zealand have reported both physical and sexual abuse from their parents.|$|R
2500|$|The wetland habitat at Sound Heath is very diverse, {{ranging from}} small ponds and damp hollows to Sound Pond (...) , which is nearly 60metres in length. Water bodies are found {{both in the}} sunny open heath areas and within the woodland. As the pools result from the {{extraction}} of sand, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> ecology from the more common marl-pits, {{as well as from}} the glacial kettle holes and salt-subsidence flashes of the Cheshire Plain. Most have reached the late succession (mature) stage. Although the encroachment of trees on the common has led to some ponds becoming infilled with leaf debris, reducing the number of permanent pools, the resultant seasonal wet areas support several rare plant species.|$|E
2500|$|Personal pronouns {{exist in}} Tsez {{only for the}} first and second person; for the third person the demonstratives že ({{singular}}) and žedi (plural) are used. As the singular personal pronouns have the same form in absolutive and ergative, a sentence like Di mi okʼsi is ambiguous, because it can both mean [...] "I hit you" [...] and [...] "You hit me", due to the rather free word order. However, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> form for the oblique cases and an irregular form in the genitive 1 case, the same as the plural pronouns. The singular pronouns also have the same forms for all four noun classes, while the plurals make this distinction, as shown in the chart below.|$|E

60|$|Dr. Nevius {{was ready}} to admit this latter {{doctrine}} in cases of idiocy, insanity, epilepsy, and hysteria; but then, said he, these are not what I call possession. The Chinese have names for all these maladies, 'which they ascribe to physical causes,' but for possession <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> name. He expected Dr. Hammond {{to account for the}} abnormal conditions in so-called possession, but 'he has hardly even attempted to do this.' Dr. Nevius next perused the works of Dr. Griesinger, Dr. Baelz, Professor William James, M. Ribot, and, generally, the literature of 'alternating personality.' He found Mr. James professing his conviction that the 'alternating personality' (in popular phrase, the demon, or familiar spirit) of Mrs. Piper knew a great deal about things which Mrs. Piper, in her normal state, did not, and could not know. Thus, after consulting many physicians, Dr. Nevius was none the better, and came back to his faith in Diabolical Possession. He was therefore informed that he had written 'one of the most extraordinarily perverted books of the present day' on the evidence of 'transparent ghost stories'--which do not occur in his book.|$|E

50|$|The Regia Aeronautica {{commissioned}} {{the production of}} 1,800 G.55s, later raising that number to 2,400. A pre-production series of 34 examples was ordered: these aircraft were mostly based on the prototype, with minor changes to improve its flying characteristics. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> weapon layout, as stated above, with the two lower cowling machine guns moved into the wings. Only 19 of the 34 commissioned aircraft were built, and six of them were converted to the Serie I standard at the factory.|$|R
