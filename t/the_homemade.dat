He built them locally in about forty-eight hours and ran them off of one of Amos Shinkles' tugboats, the Champion No.1. <b>The</b> <b>homemade</b> pumps displaced forty gallons of mud and clay in each cycle.|$|E

Brabham has since said that it was [...] "terrific driver training. You had to have quick reflexes: in effect you lived—or possibly died—on them." [...] Due to the time required to prepare the car, the sport also became his living. Brabham won the 1948 Australian Speedcar Championship, the 1949 Australian and South Australian Speedcar championships, and the 1950–1951 Australian championship with the car.|$|E
