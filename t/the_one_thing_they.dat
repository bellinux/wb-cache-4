500|$|After the {{successful}} breach of APEC security, the comedians expressed their bewilderment at the incompetence {{of the security}} forces. Morrow and Reucassel went on radio to augment the initial reactions they had aired on the 12 September episode of The Chaser's War on Everything. Morrow pointed out that while they did extensive planning for the stunt, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> [...] "didn't plan for was success"; the participants were confused by the unexpected permission to enter the area, and unsure how to proceed; they clearly sensed danger, but the atmosphere was actually very quiet and subdued.|$|E
500|$|David Gautreaux {{was cast}} as Xon on September 26, after {{approaching}} the casting director himself, having no agent. He {{had heard about}} the part, as he was dating the employee of an agent at the time. The final audition for the role had eight actors, including Gautreaux, of various ages and sizes. Gautreaux later said that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> all had in common was a slightly alien appearance. He was hired to a $15,000 fee for the pilot, a guaranteed payment for the 13 episodes {{whether or not they were}} filmed, and a six-year option on his contract. Despite this, he was required to return for a further audition within a couple of weeks. Majel Barrett was due to return as Christine Chapel, this time as a doctor, and the actress was concerned that the romantic chemistry she shared with Nimoy might not work with a younger actor. She instead wanted an older British actor to play the role. Gautreaux, now with an agent, secured a further $2,500 fee to return and audition again, since it would cause him to miss out on a guest appearance for the same fee on the television series Fantasy Island. He retained the part, saying that the other actor was [...] "absolutely abominable". It was only after this further audition that he was told what few others knew at the time: that Phase II had already been cancelled, and they were instead going to make a feature film.|$|E
500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're going to survive it themselves. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single. A 12" [...] remix of the song was made available on iTunes when the [...] " [...] was released digitally {{for the first time in}} 2007.|$|E

Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of black lung disease. He admitted that he had lived [...] "a very difficult life" [...] with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something which was mainly attributed to [...] "their vastly different views on politics and life," [...] with the music being <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> shared closely, saying, [...] "it's almost like we could read each other's minds when we sang." [...] However, Don also stated he had not gotten over Phil's death, saying, [...] "I always thought about him every day, even when we were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he's gone." [...] Don added that he always firmly believed he would die before his brother, because he was older than Phil. In a 2016 interview Don said he was still coping with the loss of Phil and that he had kept some of his brother's ashes in his home. He added that he would pick up the ashes every morning and say [...] "good morning," [...] while admitting that it was a peculiar ritual.|$|E

60|$|One hears this {{argument}} most frequently from {{the representatives of}} the well-to-do middle class; and, coming from them, it strikes me as peculiarly inconsistent, as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> admire, strive after, and advise their own children to do, is to get on in the world, and, if possible, rise out of the class in which they were born into that above them. Society needs grocers and merchants as much as it needs coalheavers; but if a merchant accumulates wealth and works his way to a baronetcy, or if the son of a greengrocer becomes a lord chancellor, or an archbishop, or, as a successful soldier, wins a peerage, all the world admires them; and looks with pride upon the social system which renders such achievements possible. Nobody suggests that there is anything wrong in their being discontented with their station; or that, in their cases society suffers by men of ability reaching the positions for which nature has fitted them.|$|E

They had no inkling of such a patience. They were stiff and in pain; their muscles ached, their bones ached, their very hearts ached; and because of this they became sharp of speech, and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night.|$|E

50|$|Paleodictyon nodosum is a {{creature}} thought {{to produce a}} certain form of Paleodictyon burrow found around mid-ocean ridge systems in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although scientists have collected many of the burrows of Paleodictyon nodosum, they {{have never seen a}} live one. What a live specimen would look like is widely debated, with the debate being split into two main sides.Adolf Seilacher who discovered the original fossils of Paleodictyon nodosum hypothesizes that the creature is a worm-like species that burrows into the sediment around hydrothermal vents and deflects water flow through the burrows to catch food or farm its own food. Peter A. Rona, discoverer of the modern burrows, suggests that Paleodictyon nodosum may actually be a large protist. There are other known examples of protists reaching the sizes that Paleodictyon reaches, and they are known to be infaunal.Scientists ran various tests on the burrows of Paleodictyon and were unable to reach a single conclusion as to the form of Paleodictyon. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>they</b> can agree upon is that there are many markers that suggest that these forms are caused by {{a creature}}, and not by geological forces.|$|R
