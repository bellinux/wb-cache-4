[...] She nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, {{the most of any}} Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to The New York Times, [...] "that it was possible to run against <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>banks</b> without Wall Street money and still win".|$|E

60|$|The {{three dollars}} he {{received}} for the triolets {{he used to}} eke out a precarious existence against {{the arrival of the}} White Mouse check. He cashed the first check with the suspicious Portuguese grocer, paying a dollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the baker and the fruit store. Martin was not yet rich enough to afford meat, and he was on slim allowance when the White Mouse check arrived. He was divided on the cashing of it. He had never been in a bank in his life, much less been in one on business, and he had a naive and childlike desire to walk into one of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>banks</b> down in Oakland and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars. On the other hand, practical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and thereby make an impression that would later result in an increase of credit. Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer, paying his bill with him in full, and receiving in change a pocketful of jingling coin. Also, he paid the other tradesmen in full, redeemed his suit and his bicycle, paid one month's rent on the type-writer, and paid Maria the overdue month for his room and a month in advance. This left him in his pocket, for emergencies, a balance of nearly three dollars.|$|E
