5|$|Designed without {{expansion}} joints, Time {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of outdoor sculptures made of reinforced pebble/concrete aggregate, few of which have been created since the 1930s. In 1936, Times weather-related cracks were repaired; further work occurred in 1955. The sculpture's subsequent repairs were followed by a rededication celebration in 1966. Although the sculpture received regular maintenance, early repair crews often did more harm <b>than</b> <b>good,</b> by using techniques such as sandblasting and patching cracks with rigid materials.|$|E
5|$|On March 27 {{the eight}} soldiers, Captain Preston, and four civilians {{who were in}} the Customs House and were alleged to have fired shots, were all indicted for murder. Bostonians {{continued}} to be hostile to the troops and their dependents. General Gage, convinced the troops were doing more harm <b>than</b> <b>good,</b> ordered the 29th Regiment out of the province in May. Governor Hutchinson took advantage of the ongoing high tensions to orchestrate delays of the trials until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Frontier {{physician}} Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., DO, {{founded the}} American School of Osteopathy (now the A.T. Still University-Kirksville (Mo.) College of Osteopathic Medicine) in Kirksville, MO, in 1892 as a radical {{protest against the}} turn-of-the-century medical system. A. T. Still believed that the conventional medical system lacked credible efficacy, was morally corrupt, and treated effects rather than causes of disease. He founded osteopathic medicine in rural Missouri {{at a time when}} medications, surgery, and other traditional therapeutic regimens often caused more harm <b>than</b> <b>good.</b> Some of the medicines commonly given to patients during this time were arsenic, castor oil, whiskey, and opium. In addition, unsanitary surgical practices often resulted in more deaths than cures.|$|E

5|$|In late 2013 {{multiple}} copyright strikes {{were issued}} by Youtube against Dunne's videos {{for use of}} his own music, as well as against other users who had used his music in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore {{was trying to help}} artists, their efforts did more damage <b>than</b> <b>good</b> and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularize his music by word of mouth.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and do more harm <b>than</b> <b>good.</b> Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck {{may result in a}} deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm <b>than</b> <b>good,</b> instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E
50|$|From 1929, the State ran {{commercial}} {{stores that}} functioned outside the rationing system. Goods were sold for higher prices {{than in the}} closed distribution stores, two to four times as much.

25|$|Tooth powders for {{use with}} {{toothbrushes}} came into general use in the 19th century in Britain. Most were homemade, with chalk, pulverized brick, or salt as ingredients.

25|$|Prevention of candidiasis, {{the most}} common type of vaginitis, {{includes}} using loose cotton underwear. The vaginal area should be washed with water. Perfumed soaps, shower gels, and vaginal deodorants should be avoided. Douching is not recommended.

40|$|This article {{examines}} how the electronic {{word of mouth}} (eWOM) information direction (positive vs. negative) and a website's reputation (established vs. unestablished) contribute to the eWOM effect. The article describes a study focusing on the moderating role of the product type (search vs. experience). The results of the experiment show that the eWOM effect is greater for negative eWOM than for positive eWOM, greater for established websites than for unestablished websites, and greater for experience <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for search <b>goods.</b> The results support the moderating effects of product type on the eWOM information direction-website reputation-eWOM effect relationship. The impact of negative eWOM on the eWOM effect is greater for experience <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for search <b>goods.</b> Similarly, the impact of website reputation on the eWOM effect is greater for experience <b>goods</b> <b>than</b> for search <b>goods.</b> The findings provide managerial implications for an Internet marketing strategy.

25|$|In {{the film}} Citizen Kane (1941), the title character's second wife—an untalented singer whom {{he tries to}} promote—was widely assumed {{to be based on}} Davies. But many commentators, {{including}} Citizen Kane writer/director Orson Welles himself, have defended Davies' record as a gifted actress, to whom Hearst's patronage did more harm <b>than</b> <b>good.</b> She retired from the screen in 1937, choosing to devote herself to Hearst and charitable work.|$|E

In favour of the former, Andrew Wareham has suggested that in naming his third and most 'throneworthy' son (b. after c. 964) Æthelred, after his great-great-uncle and thus after Ælfgifu's and Æthelweard's ancestor (see genealogy ↑), Edgar may have intended to make a sympathetic gesture by which he stressed their kinship.|$|E
25|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) {{the fact that}} Wonder Woman {{had fallen in love}} with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop any suggestion that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more <b>than</b> <b>good</b> friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it quite clear that she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E
25|$|Since Android {{devices are}} usually battery-powered, Android is {{designed}} to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources. Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with {{those that have been}} inactive for longest.

25|$|World War II {{constituted}} New York's {{last great}} industrial era.
