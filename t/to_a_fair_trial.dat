5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial,</b> and under what circumstances indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{families}} of those executed continued to seek the overturning of the sentences and compensation, based on the irregularity of the processes used to convict their relatives. In 2004, they appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain, which rejected their application {{on the grounds that}} it did not have the power to deal with cases prior to December 1978, when the Constitution came into effect. In September 2005, the European Court of Human Rights rejected their petition on similar grounds: that Spain had not been a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights in 1975. In November 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used to convict Txiki and Otaegui had violated their right <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> and awarded €135,000 in compensation to their families. Flor Baena, the sister of José Humberto Baena, continued to campaign for her brother, stating that she wanted to clear his name, not financial compensation.|$|E

25|$|According to Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, {{individuals}} {{have the right}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> Therefore, {{in the name of}} fairness of judicial proceedings, it is an established linguistic right of an individual to an interpreter when he or she does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation.

25|$|Habeas corpus {{has certain}} limitations. Though a writ of right, {{it is not}} a writ of course. It is {{technically}} only a procedural remedy; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then habeas corpus may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or state of emergency.|$|E

However, when he descends into the arena, he may not necessarily have taken sides before the hearing. The difference may lie in how actively the judge pursues this position and how he comes to be persuaded.|$|E
