5|$|Ziggler became {{involved}} in an on-screen love affair with Lana, the former manager of Rusev, when she kissed him at Raw on May 25, with Lana serving as Ziggler's valet during his matches. During this time, Ziggler started incorporating elements of 80's glam rock fashion into his entrance and ring attire; typical of 80's bands like Mötley Crüe and Poison. In June, after Ziggler and Lana confirmed their storyline relationship, Summer Rae allied with Rusev to even the odds. After an attack by Rusev, Ziggler suffered a bruised trachea in storyline, which was <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> time off to film a new WWE Studios movie, titled 6:42. Ziggler returned on the August 17 episode of Raw, aiding Lana during a confrontation against Rusev and Summer Rae. This altercation prompted a match between Ziggler and Rusev at SummerSlam, which ended in a double countout due to interference from Lana and Rae. In a rematch on September 20 at Night of Champions, Ziggler emerged victorious. On October 11, when TMZ reported the real–life engagement of Rusev and Lana, this officially ended their feud. The following night on Raw, Ziggler unsuccessfully challenged John Cena for the United States Championship.|$|E
25|$|Ma Chao {{constantly}} asked Zhang Lu <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> {{troops to}} attack Liang Province.

25|$|Ito soon {{met with}} other members of HEADGEAR to create some ideas {{that can be used for}} the movie, based on the theory that Patlabor 2 will be their last work on the Patlabor franchise. Soon after realizing that he couldn't take most of their suggestions, Ito had told them that he would end his {{consultation}} with them and announced that he would brainstorm the movie's script alone and isolated himself from the rest of HEADGEAR <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> space to work on the movie's script with Oshii working on the storyboard.|$|E

500|$|On April 27, 1958, Richard and Pat Nixon {{embarked}} on a goodwill tour of South America. In Montevideo, Uruguay, Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus, where he fielded questions from students on U.S. foreign policy. The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached Lima, Peru, where he was met with student demonstrations. Nixon went to the campus, {{got out of his}} car to confront the students, and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects. At his hotel, Nixon faced another mob, and one demonstrator spat on him. In Caracas, Venezuela, Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti-American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe-wielding mob. According to Ambrose, Nixon's courageous conduct [...] "caused even some of his bitterest enemies <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> grudging respect".|$|E
500|$|The opening episode [...] "Deep Down" [...] {{picks up}} {{three months after}} last season. Angel returns, and Holtz' {{deception}} is revealed. Relations are shaky as Angel kicks Connor {{out of the house}} in punishment for sinking him, but secretly keeps a protective eye on him from afar. Stricken by the betrayal of his adoptive father and the apparent abandonment by his real one, Connor seeks solace in Cordelia's arms. When an all-powerful demon lord The Beast rises from the ground at the place he was born, Connor feels responsible. As The Beast causes fire to rain from the sky in an apparent apocalypse, Cordelia sleeps with Connor <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> happiness before the end. While an apocalypse does not occur, Angel (also in love with Cordelia) doesn't take kindly to the development, causing another rift between him and Connor. Unbeknownst to all, Cordelia is possessed to be with Connor by a cosmic entity, Jasmine, looking to give herself birth in this world through their union. As Cordelia becomes pregnant and manipulates Connor into helping her sacrifice an innocent girl for their child, his inhuman actions begin conflicting with his inner good, accelerating his already deteriorating mental health.|$|E

5000|$|While Charlie {{loves his}} nephew Jake and, at the {{beginning}} of the show, used him to get dates, he often makes jokes revolving around Jake's apparent lack of intellectual ability, and often states that he is destined to be a doorstop or a fry cook, and states that he is not a kid, but a [...] "gassy dwarf". Nevertheless, it is often shown that unconditionally Charlie loves Jake, and sometimes acts like a father <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> advice, that Alan is unable <b>to</b> <b>give.</b>|$|R

This passage tells that Esau, returning famished from the fields, begged Jacob <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> of the stew that Jacob had just made.

2500|$|According to the Talmud, {{immediately}} after Abraham died, Jacob prepared a lentil stew {{as a traditional}} mourner's meal for his father, Isaac.

2500|$|Jarrett {{played his}} first {{international}} for Wales on 15 April 1967 against England, aged eighteen years. [...] He {{had been selected}} at full back {{even though he had}} never played senior rugby in that position. [...] Newport were asked to play him at full back against Newbridge on the weekend before the international <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>some</b> experience. [...] He {{did not seem to be}} much of a success in his new position and at half time, his captain David Watkins, switched him to centre. The following week Jarrett played in his first international and scored a breathtaking try. [...] England won a line-out in their own 25 (as it was then). [...] The ball was passed down the line to English centre, Colin McFadyean, who kicked towards the halfway line. [...] The ball bounced once and was seemingly going in to touch. [...] Instead, Jarret sprinted onto the ball, taking it without breaking stride. He sprinted down the touchline, outflanking the whole of the astonished England defence, to score in the left corner. [...] He converted his own try from just inside the touchline. Besides scoring a try, he kicked two penalty goals and five conversions for a total of 19 points. [...] His performance on the field was so impressive that the match has been known ever since as the Keith Jarrett match and he made the cover of Rugby World magazine two months later. The try has been voted seventh in a poll of the top ten Welsh tries and he is listed on the Welsh Rugby Union Official Website as the scorer of the [...] "Greatest Ever Welsh try".|$|E

She had learnt while living with Lady Jane that night air is not so dangerous as some people fancy; and it was an infinite relief to Alfred when the lattice was thrown back, and the cool breeze came softly in, with the freshness of the dew, and the delicious scent of the hay-field.|$|R

60|$|The squire did {{not look}} very well. He was worn and sorrowful, and rather pale.
