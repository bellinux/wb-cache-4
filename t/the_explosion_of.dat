5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} {{deep inside the}} Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s {{in order to take}} advantage of the shielding from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of solid rock surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported the detection of a neutrino event, believed to have originated from <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the SN 1987A supernova.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the Citadel reactor {{from which}} Gordon was {{extracted}} by the G-Man and where Alyx Vance was left behind, time suddenly freezes. Several Vortigaunts appear and rescue Alyx from the blast. After she is rescued, the Vortigaunts {{appear before the}} G-Man and stand between him and Gordon. They teleport Gordon away from the scene, much to the G-Man's displeasure.|$|E

50|$|The effects <b>of</b> an {{underwater}} <b>explosion</b> depend on several things, including distance from <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> <b>the</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>explosion,</b> and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> the water.|$|R

5|$|By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was {{reported}} that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E
5|$|ILM's {{computer}} graphics division {{was responsible for}} creating three sequences, including <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> Praxis. Meyer's idea for the effect was influenced by The Poseidon Adventure; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the Poseidon to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a lens flare simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail texture mapped to the surface.|$|E

5|$|Jojo the Klownzilla, {{the colossal}} clown who {{appears at the}} end of the film, was {{originally}} intended to be created using stop-motion animation, but was instead portrayed by Charles Chiodo in a rubber suit.

5|$|Mining {{disasters}} in Leigh included <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> firedamp which caused {{the deaths of}} 38miners at Bedford Colliery on 13 August 1886.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{experiments to}} examine <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> characteristics <b>of</b> different sizes of micro-sized and nano-sized magnesium dust. These explosion characteristics, such as <b>the</b> maximum <b>explosion</b> pressure and maximum rate of pressure rise, {{depend on the}} dust concentration. Changes in the particle sizes do not cause clear differences in <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> characteristics <b>of</b> nano-sized mag-nesium dust. However, <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> characteristic values <b>of</b> micro-sized magnesium dust decrease with increasing particle size. Furthermore, nano-sized magnesium dust showed greater explosion characteristics than micro-sized magnesium dust. The cal-culated flame propagation velocity showed the same trend as <b>the</b> maximum <b>explosion</b> pressure and maximum rate of the pressure rise.

5|$|The breech {{refers to}} the mass of solid metal behind {{the bottom of the}} bore {{extending}} {{to the base of the}} breech and including the base ring; it also generally {{refers to the}} end of the cannon opposite the muzzle, i.e., the location where <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the gunpowder begins as opposed to the opening through which the pressurized gas escapes.|$|E
5|$|The initial attack hit {{the forward}} {{operating}} base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted TOW missile launcher inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. The mortars and TOW launcher which were {{to provide the}} heaviest and most accurate firepower had been quickly taken out by the attackers. <b>The</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the mortar shells hurled the anti-tank missiles into the command post.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns were}} {{air-cooled}} {{and used a}} gas blowback recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil, the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired. This weapon lacked a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil was checked by <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the next round of ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Cassidy Sharp (voiced by Jennifer Hale): The game's {{first female}} protagonist. Cassidy is the agent who {{attempts}} to stop Jericho {{on the train}} in the game's opening sequence. After <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> Lazarus' prison, she joins Jericho but is soon murdered by Lazarus. Cassidy returns as a good ghost and befriends Jericho, aiding him in his mission to stop Lazarus (a role similar to this of Cortana in the Halo series). As a little girl, Cassidy was orphaned in a vampire attack and then raised as a ward of the Darkwatch. Eventually, she became the most serious and dangerous agent in the organisation, yet really she is also deeply insecure about herself. If fought as the final boss, she turns into an angel.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{one year}} after <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman. On route, Kimberly has a premonition of logs falling off a semi, causing a massive car {{accident}} that kills everyone involved. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis; widow Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim; businesswoman Kat Jennings; stoner Rory Peters; pregnant Isabella Hudson; high school teacher Eugene Dix; and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs. Shaina, Dano and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck, but Kimberly is saved by Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Universe was a U.S. {{science fiction}} {{magazine}} which began publishing in the 1950s. It ran for 69 issues, from June 1953 to March 1960, under two different publishers. It {{was part of}} <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> science fiction magazine publishing in the 1950s in the United States, and was moderately successful, outlasting almost all of its competitors. The main editors were Leo Margulies (1954–1956) and Hans Stefan Santesson (1956–1960); under Santesson's tenure the quality declined somewhat, and the magazine became known for printing much UFO-related material. A collection of stories from the magazine, edited by Santesson, appeared in 1960 from Prentice-Hall, titled The Fantastic Universe Omnibus.|$|E

Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E
5|$|Gulf {{also participated}} in a {{partnership}} with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by <b>the</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> a Total tanker, the Betelgeuse, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island Disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic oil reserve there.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
