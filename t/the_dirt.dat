5|$|After {{losing the}} tag team title, Morrison and The Miz entered a feud with ECW {{newcomers}} Evan Bourne and Ricky Ortiz, who {{they had previously}} mocked (and continued to do so) on <b>the</b> <b>Dirt</b> Sheet. They also had an Internet-centered feud with Raws Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG) based on which WWE.com online show was better: <b>the</b> <b>Dirt</b> Sheet or Cryme Tyme's Word Up. Morrison and The Miz won a match between the two teams at Cyber Sunday, which was voted for by fans over a World Tag Team Championship match.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, USAC split its National Championship into {{dirt and}} {{pavement}} championships. Andretti had one {{win on the}} pavement and finished fifth in the season points, and finished second in <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> championship. He competed in USAC's dirt track division in 1974, and won <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> track championship while competing in both series. Andretti also competed in the North American Formula 5000 series in 1973 and 1974, and {{finished second in the}} championship in both seasons.|$|E
5|$|The paved version did {{not exactly}} follow the unpaved roads. <b>The</b> <b>dirt</b> route {{passed through the}} {{numerous}} mountain ranges of the great basin with the most difficult being Marjum Canyon. The route was relocated to follow {{the north shore of}} Sevier Lake, which reduced the number of mountain ranges crossed. Although US-50 was moved to yet another alignment, this route remains US-6 today.|$|E

5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|McElhenny was {{a first-round}} {{pick of the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1952 NFL Draft, ninth overall, and made an {{immediate}} impression as a rookie. His first play as a professional was a 40-yard touchdown run which had been drawn in <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> because {{he had not yet}} learned the team's playbook. He recorded the season's longest run from scrimmage (89 yards), the longest punt return (94 yards), and the top rushing average (7.0 yards per carry). He was unanimously recognized as the season's top rookie.|$|E

The two horses {{separated}} {{themselves from the}} rest of the field by five lengths with Shackleford on the inside. Just inside the sixteenth pole, he edged away and beat Amazombie under jockey Mike Smith by a length. Gantry was another five and a half lengths back in the third. The time was 1:21 on a fast track.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers who cared little for the {{buildings}}. For a brief time, the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold.|$|E
5|$|Though rivals, Morrison and The Miz {{faced the}} {{dysfunctional}} tag team of Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter on the November 16 episode of SmackDown! for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a winning effort, marking Morrison's fourth WWE Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, Morrison and The Miz were both defeated by CM Punk in a triple threat {{match for the}} ECW Championship. After the defeat, the rivalry aspect of Miz and Morrison's relationship faded, as they were now portrayed as trusting friends. In February 2008, Morrison and The Miz were given a streaming segment on WWE.com named <b>The</b> <b>Dirt</b> Sheet in which they mocked other wrestlers and facets of pop culture. Morrison and The Miz co-wrote each episode of <b>The</b> <b>Dirt</b> Sheet each week, and he credits his time in college studying film with contributing {{to the success of}} the show. On July 4 episode of Smackdown, Morrison lost to Jeff Hardy who re-debuted on Smackdown after the 2008 WWE Draft. The team had many successful title defenses over the next few months, before dropping the titles to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder at The Great American Bash in a fatal four-way match which also featured Jesse and Festus and Finlay and Hornswoggle. Neither The Miz nor Morrison were pinned, as Hawkins pinned Jesse to win the titles.|$|E

5|$|Adding to Sparrow's woes, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has a {{personal}} score to settle with Sparrow. Beckett wants the chest and forces Will Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow and his crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> that he takes land with him.|$|E
5|$|On Memorial Day, May 28, 2012, Shackleford raced in what analysts {{called the}} deepest {{field of the}} year {{featuring}} favorites To Honor and Serve, Caleb's Posse, Jackson Bend and Caixa Eletronica in the $750,000 Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap (known by most as the Met Mile run at one mile on <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> at Belmont Park). Shackleford had just enough left to withstand the furious late rush of Caleb's Posse, stopping the clock in 1:33 1/5 over the fast track to win by a nose. Favorite To Honor and Serve was another three and half lengths back in third. With this win, Shackleford turned the tables on old rival Caleb's Posse, who beat him in the 2011 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. The horses met each other four times, with each winning two races. However, Caleb's Posse retired soon after the Met Mile.|$|E

The duo then engaged themselves in a feud with The Colóns (Carlito and Primo). They later defended their titles against the Colóns but lost in a match for The Colón's Tag Team Championships. In dark match at WrestleMania XXV, Morrison and the Miz lost the World Tag Team title to The Colóns (Carlito and Primo) in a Lumberjack match to unify the World Tag Team and the WWE Tag Team Championships.|$|E

5|$|They {{first began}} teaming {{together}} in 2007. Originally rivals, John Morrison and The Miz became partners {{as a result}} of winning the WWE Tag Team Championship and making the title exclusive to the ECW brand, for a brief time. They eventually dropped the title in July 2008. During their title reign, Morrison and The Miz developed a gimmick that resulted in the duo being given their own webshow, <b>The</b> <b>Dirt</b> Sheet, and their own in-ring interview segment of the same name on ECW. In December 2008 they won the Slammy Award in the category for Tag Team of the Year and won the World Tag Team Championship. The team split in April 2009, after the Miz was drafted to the Raw brand and Morrison was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 WWE draft.|$|E

With fresh credibility, even with young fans {{who had been}} introduced to him through the Anthology project, it debuted at number 2 in the UK in May, giving McCartney his best new entry since Flowers in <b>the</b> <b>Dirt</b> eight years before. It was kept off the top spot by the Spice Girls' album Spice. Flaming Pie was also received positively in the United States, where it became McCartney's first top 10 album since Tug of War. Flaming Pie debuted at number 2, with 121,000 copies sold in its first week, behind Spice, which sold just 16,500 more copies that week.|$|E
5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt he was capable of competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of <b>the</b> <b>dirt</b> track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E

It {{turns out to be}} a prostitute, Mhaegan, the mother of a baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children. Littlefinger reveals Jon Arryn had been searching for Robert's bastards for an unknown reason. When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims {{responsibility}} for Tyrion's arrest, which leads to a brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with a dagger. Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own. Jaime knocks out the guard who interrupted the fight and decides to let Ned live but warns that he wants his brother back. Jaime storms away, leaving Ned bleeding in <b>the</b> <b>dirt,</b> where he quickly faints.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they formed}} a partnership, John Morrison and The Miz were opponents, {{competing}} for the ECW Championship in October 2007. On the November 16, 2007, episode of SmackDown!, then-rivals Morrison and The Miz were paired together to face Matt Hardy and MVP in a match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, which they subsequently won after MVP turned on Hardy. After winning the title, Morrison and The Miz brought the title to the ECW brand. Soon after winning the WWE Tag Team Championship, the two were no longer portrayed as enemies, but rather as trusting friends. They would defend the title on numerous occasions on both ECW and SmackDown as well as multiple pay-per-views against opponents like Shannon Moore and Jimmy Wang Yang, Jesse and Festus, and Tommy Dreamer and Colin Delaney. The team's gimmick was further expanded upon when {{they were given a}} show on WWE.com called <b>The</b> <b>Dirt</b> Sheet. During the sixth annual WWE Draft on June 23, 2008, on Monday Night Raw, the duo defeated the Hardys (Matt and Jeff) which earned ECW its only draft pick, {{which turned out to be}} Matt Hardy. At the Great American Bash in July, Morrison and The Miz lost the title in a four team tag match to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder; however, neither The Miz nor Morrison were pinned during the match.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, WWE premiered a new {{pay-per-view}} {{event based}} around inter-brand matches. At the time, The Miz was the second-tier champion on Raw {{after winning the}} United States Champion and was subsequently booked against SmackDowns Intercontinental Champion, John Morrison. In the build up to their first match since splitting, the two hosted a one-off edition of <b>The</b> <b>Dirt</b> Sheet on the October 16 episode of SmackDown where the two compared themselves to '80s tag team The Rockers, debating over which is more comparable to the successful Shawn Michaels and which was the less successful Marty Jannetty. At Bragging Rights, Miz pinned Morrison to become {{the only member of}} the Raw roster to win an interpromotional match. The following month at Survivor Series, Miz captained a team of five wrestlers against Team Morrison in a five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and once again bested his former partner. At the Tribute to the Troops in December, Miz rolled up Morrison for the win in a singles match. The two had another match the following March, when John Morrison and his new partner R-Truth challenged for the Unified Tag Team Championships held by The Miz and the Big Show. Morrison was finally able to defeat The Miz in a singles match, however Morrison could not pick up the victory for the titles at WrestleMania XXVI.|$|E
