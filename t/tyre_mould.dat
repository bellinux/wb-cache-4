40|$|Quality of a tvre {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on the tyre moulds that {{are being used to}} produce tyrcs. It has been found that in most of the situations. tyres are rejected due to defects and other problems arising from the existing poor quality moulds. The present <b>tyre</b> <b>mould</b> production process (dry sand casting method) has inherent drawbacks and difficulties in both casting and finishing processes. Dimensional accuracy and the geometry of moulds are hard to achieve. Moulds crack during use due to internal blowholes introduced In casting process {{and it is difficult to}} eliminate these defects in the present method...|$|E
25|$|Goodyear {{opened a}} large factory on Stafford Road, Fordhouses, in 1927. However, {{it was decided}} in December 2003 that tyre {{production}} at the plant would be discontinued {{with the loss of}} more than 400 jobs. This came after some 2,000 job losses at the plant since 1997. The end of production came in 2004 but the factory remains open for <b>tyre</b> <b>moulding</b> and tractor <b>tyre</b> production.|$|R
50|$|AEC Routemaster buses {{were built}} at the AEC factory in Windmill Lane {{and much of the}} fuel {{injection}} equipment and electrical systems were manufactured by CAV Ltd who had a factory in Acton Vale. The large Routemaster <b>tyres</b> were <b>moulded</b> and cured, just to the south on the Great West Road in Brentford by the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company whose factory was opened there in 1928.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a modelling methodology that predicts a contour of a pneumatic tyre in the curing <b>mould.</b> <b>Tyre</b> contour {{is designed to}} be in the equilibrium shape. Such shape is described by a system of complex mathematical equations that has to be solved numerically. In this new approach a standard FEM software is employed to gain the shape without the need of dealing with these equations manually. The quality of the proposal of FEM approach was assessed by comparing the meridian to a verified solution for several tyre constructions and sizes. Selected results are presented to show the accuracy of the FE modelling procedure. Nowadays, most of the produced tyres are of a radial construction. Therefore, this paper deals only with radial tyres. © 2017...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{significant}} changes in tyre geometry especially for truck tyres withcomplex patterns and high thickness at tread area, the effect of heat transfer incircumferential direction on temperature field development during tyre curing {{should be taken into}} account. This work is based on the development of a three dimen-sional nonlinear finite element model for simulating of tyre curing process of in mould. The heat conduction equation was solved by the use of a standard Galerkin technique in a Cartesian coordinate system. Transient temperature field was modelled using the implicit-θ method. The Kamal and Sourour empirical cure reaction kinetic equation was also used to calculate the state and rate of cure as a functions of time. Based on the developed model, an interactive computer program was written in Visual Basic. This pro-gram was used to simulate the curing process of a 12 - 24 truck <b>tyre</b> in <b>mould.</b> Results of our simulations showed that distributions of both temperature and state of cure in circum ferential direction cannot be ignored. The applicability of the model was also verified by comparison between the temperature profiles at two points inside the tyre with experi-mental data. It has been shown that there is a very good agreement between the model predictions and actual data. finite element method...|$|R
50|$|Deliberate {{shaping of}} <b>moulded</b> <b>tyre</b> tread design, {{rather than merely}} concentrating on a rubber surface that didn't fail rapidly, began {{at the start of}} the 1920s. There was little {{theoretical}} background to this though until the mid-1920s. The 1922 London Motor Show displayed a range of tread patterns that were reported on by The Autocar. Some of these, from Miller and the French firm of , display what would now be recognised as the classic bar grip pattern of sharp-edged transverse bars with a wide central rib. However these were supplied for narrow high-pressure tyres, for use on roads and at relatively high speeds. Their design was based on simple notions of transverse bars giving fore-and-aft traction, without any developed theory of tread design or experimental measurements of their performance. In practice, such square-edged tread blocks wore badly and unevenly, the initially flat blocks tending to wear with a sloping top surface. This wear pattern was one reason for the practicing of rotating tyres between wheels, so that they spent equal periods wearing in each direction.|$|R
