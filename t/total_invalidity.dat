40|$|The case under {{discussion}} {{is that of}} a 44 years old woman, who started suffering from worsening emithoracic pain since 2002. Pain is both nociceptive and neuropathic: it started spontaneously without evidence of trauma, then worsening after an intervention of costal resection, and has spreaded towards the whole right emisoma. The illness has proved resistant to all the therapeutic treatments she has undergone. Pain reduction has been obtained, with autonomy after a period of <b>total</b> <b>invalidity,</b> since she started a therapy with intrathecal administration of ziconotide. This drug is a neuron specific N-type calcium channel antagonist, and acts on the sensitive afferent branch to the dorsal columns of the spinal medulla, and doesnâ€™t react with the opiates receptors. This patient is the first to be treated with this new drug in Italy (apart from the planned studies) ...|$|E
40|$|A 33 -year-old {{woman with}} a 2 -year history of {{swelling}} and pain in tier buttock and left thigh fluctuating with her menstrual cycle who was becoming progressively disabled was referred {{to the department of}} orthopedics. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected it left buttock lesion of 3 X 2 cm that was initially diagnosed as muscular-fiber laceration with associated hematoma. The worsening of her symptomatology required in ultrasound-guided biopsy of the lesion that revealed endometriosis. Laparoscopy showed the pelvis to be free of gross disease. Hormonal suppression by means of gonadotropin-releasing, hormone analog therapy proved adequate in temporarily alleviating symptoms. A year later the patient underwent surgical excision of the buttock lesion, which was effective in alleviating her symptoms {{for a short period of}} 10 months. A 1 -year follow-up MRI revealed several small endometriotic foci, located among piriformis and obturator internus muscle fibers, which were considered not suitable for surgical removal. The patient is currently on a drug regime for pain management. However, she has experienced permanent muscular damage on her left buttock including significant omolateral gluteus strength reduction. functional impairment (inability to rotate laterally or bend her left leg), and the assumption of an antalgic gait while walking.

40|$|Recently, {{with the}} {{amendments}} {{brought to the}} Labor Code by the Law no. 40 / 2011, the written form of the individual labor contract became a condition of validity (ad validitatem). The actual and imperative dispositions of art. 16 of the Labor Code establishes the written form of the individual labor contract {{as a condition of}} validity in the Romanian labor right. This form is imposed for any type of individual labor contract in as far as the text pointed does not operate any distinction. The non-observance of written form when concluding the individual labor contract is sanctioned with absolute invalidity of the convention, sanction that can be covered by the parties by the subsequent fulfillment of this condition. The parties have the possibility to determine the invalidity occurred, but to also establish its effect according to the law. In case the parties do not agree upon the invalidity of the contract, this invalidity can be determined by the decision of the competent court. The fact of determining, respectively the declaration of invalidity produces effect to the future only. Whereas the non-observance of written form affects the entire contract means a <b>total</b> <b>invalidity,</b> which determines the termination by law of the contract according to art. 56 paragraph 1 letter e of the Labor Code if not validated by the parties. Art. 57 paragraph 5 of the Labor Code does not regulate in detail the effects of invalidity, it points only that "the person who worked pursuant to an invalid individual labor contract has the right for remuneration according to the method of fulfilling the labor tasks", thus it does not operate retroactively. The regulation of the individual labor contract in this manner attenuates the impact of this imperative requirement...|$|E
