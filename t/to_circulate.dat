5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars failed <b>to</b> <b>circulate</b> to any degree, {{except in}} and around Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress {{authorized}} the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but that piece also failed <b>to</b> <b>circulate.</b> Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E
5|$|Controversy rapidly {{surrounded}} Edward's death. With Mortimer's {{execution in}} 1330, rumours began <b>to</b> <b>circulate</b> that Edward {{had been murdered}} at Berkeley Castle. Accounts {{that he had been}} killed by the insertion of a red-hot iron or poker into his anus slowly began <b>to</b> <b>circulate,</b> possibly as a result of deliberate propaganda; chroniclers in the mid-1330s and 1340s spread this account further, supported in later years by Geoffrey le Baker's colourful account of the killing. It became incorporated into most later histories of Edward, typically being linked to his possible homosexuality. Most historians now dismiss this account of Edward's death, querying the logic in Edward's captors murdering him in such an easily detectable fashion.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the pledge}} of silence, rumours of the {{incident}} began <b>to</b> <b>circulate</b> and were brought to Gordon-Cumming's attention. In an attempt to scotch the rumours, he demanded a retraction from five of the house party; when that was not forthcoming, with no withdrawal forthcoming, on 6 February 1891, Gordon-Cumming issued writs for slander against the five, claiming £5,000 against each of them.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and blood is pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood <b>to</b> <b>circulate</b> to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began <b>to</b> <b>circulate</b> in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
40|$|Zonulin is {{the only}} {{physiological}} mediator known to regulate intestinal permeability reversibly by modulating intercellular tight junctions. To investigate the relationship between intestinal permeability and obesity-associated metabolic disturbances in humans, we aimed <b>to</b> study <b>circulating</b> zonulin according <b>to</b> obesity and insulin resistance. Circulating zonulin (ELISA) was measured in 123 caucasian men in association with inflammatory and metabolic parameters (including minimal model-measured insulin sensitivity). Circulating zonulin increased with body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fasting insulin, fasting triglycerides, uric acid and IL- 6, and negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol and insulin sensitivity. In multiple regression analysis, insulin sensitivity (p = 0. 002) contributed independently <b>to</b> <b>circulating</b> zonulin variance, after controlling {{for the effects of}} BMI, fasting triglycerides and age. When circulating IL- 6 was added to this model, only BMI (p = 0. 01) contributed independently <b>to</b> <b>circulating</b> zonulin variance. In conclusion, the relationship between insulin sensitivity and circulating zonulin might be mediated through the obesity-related circulating IL- 6 increase...|$|R
50|$|Mature {{dendritic}} {{cells and}} macrophages use the mannose receptor for antigen presentation {{in a different}} way. The cleaved, soluble receptor binds <b>to</b> <b>circulating</b> antigens and directs them to effector cells in lymphoid organs via its cysteine-rich domain, thus activating the adaptive immune system.|$|R

Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the county seat, proposals {{to move the}} county seat began <b>to</b> <b>circulate.</b> Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, and, ultimately, the new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began <b>to</b> <b>circulate</b> among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{constituent}} cell {{types of}} the ovary of the porcupine {{were similar to}} those of New World hystricomorph rodents and accessory corpora lutea and luteal bodies were formed through the luteinization of the membrana granulosa or theca interna of antral follicles. All luteal bodies were histologically similar. The total volume of luteal tissue per female was not affected by fetal age and was unrelated <b>to</b> <b>circulating</b> con centrations of maternal plasma progesterone. Maternal plasma progesterone con centrations were correlated with fetal age. Follicular activity occurred throughout pregnancy but was not affected by fetal age or related <b>to</b> <b>circulating</b> values of oestradiol- 17 ~.

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food <b>to</b> <b>circulate</b> inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E

The landless Flemish nobleman William of Ypres had joined Stephen's household in 1133.|$|E

5|$|Angus Maddison {{estimates}} that the country's gross domestic product was equivalent to $450 per head in 1990 United States dollars—a sum that was above subsistence level, and which did not significantly change {{until the beginning of}} the Song dynasty in the late 10th century. Sinologist Joseph Needham has disputed this and claimed that China's GDP per capita exceeded Europe by substantial margins from the 5th century BCE onwards, holding that Han China was much wealthier than the contemporary Roman Empire. The widespread circulation of coin cash enriched many merchants, who invested their money in land and became wealthy landowners.
