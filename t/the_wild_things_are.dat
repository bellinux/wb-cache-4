25|$|The band {{soon after}} began a {{longtime}} association with Blackout Records, who released {{some of their}} songs on the label's compilation Where <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are,</b> in 1989, along with a 7 inch Live At CBGB release. The following year, the band recorded their debut full length Just Can't Hate Enough. The record was engineered by Tommy Victor of Prong. As Victor also worked at CBGB, {{he was able to}} allow the band to record live at the famous bar in the morning and afternoon hours before shows were held. The record was released in Germany on Starving Missile Records, and later released stateside under the Blackout name. Just Can't Hate Enough quickly became one of the records that defined the new, heavier sound of hardcore that was emerging at the time, played by bands such as Biohazard and Killing Time, among others. The guitar tone and riffs, in particular, display a large heavy metal influence, especially from Swiss speed metallers Celtic Frost, who were allegedly one of Alan Blake's favorite bands. The band also became known for Bearer's no-nonsense stage personality, with some finding him offensive, and others enjoying his often blunt and obscenity filled humor.|$|E
500|$|The band also headlined the Young Wild Things Tour, an {{international}} arena tour featuring Gym Class Heroes, Plain White T's and Cute Is What We Aim For. Of the thirty one dates, twenty nine {{were in the}} US with two in Canada. The tour was inspired by Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book Where <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are,</b> and included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi containing images from the book. Commenting on the decision to incorporate elements from the book, Wentz explained [...] "Where <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are</b> is a great narrative. It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written: You know, tantrums and monster islands and all." ...|$|E
500|$|The novel explores {{themes of}} {{violence}} and the abuse of power, {{as well as of}} coming of age. The protagonists have a recurring struggle to make choices they are comfortable with. Their moral development takes place within the harshness of the Upland culture, contrasted with examples of kindness and altruism. It has been described as sharing themes of dreamworlds and choices with a number of other works by Le Guin, such as the Earthsea cycle, The Beginning Place, and [...] "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas". It also shares similarities with Maurice Sendak's book Where <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are,</b> while Orrec's transformation in the novel has been compared to the biblical story of Jonah.|$|E

The Canyon album was recorded over four river-rafting and recording trips through the Grand Canyon. The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, where Winter is artist-in-residence, shares a similar seven-second reverberation. Crestone and Prayer for <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>were</b> recorded in remote natural places with resonant acoustics; Miho: Journey to the Mountain was recorded in the acoustics of the Miho Museum designed by I.M.

That tough female spirit is something that I want to project. It's meant to be, 'This is my shield, this is my weapon, this is my inner sense of fame, this is my monster.' Gaga also said that the video shows [...] "how the entertainment industry can, in a metaphorical way, simulate human trafficking - products being sold, the woman perceived as a commodity."

500|$|After losing out on {{the role}} of Lois Lane in two {{previous}} films about Superman, Adams secured the part in Zack Snyder's 2013 reboot, Man of Steel, starring Henry Cavill as the titular superhero. She played Lane with a mixture of toughness and vulnerability, but Peter Bradshaw thought that the character was [...] "sketchily conceived" [...] and criticized her lack of chemistry with Cavill. Even so, the film earned over $660 million to become one of her biggest box-office hits. Adams next featured in Her, a drama from the writer-director Spike Jonze about a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with an operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson); Adams played his close friend. She had unsuccessfully auditioned for Jonze's 2009 film Where <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are</b> and was hired for Her after Jonze looked back at those tapes. Adams was drawn to the idea of portraying a platonic male-female friendship, which she believed was rare in film.|$|E

However, Walt Disney Records withdrew the song from consideration because {{the song was}} not [...] "written specifically for a motion picture, television or other visual media", as the Grammy eligibility rules dictated. According to Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "The Climb" [...] was submitted for consideration by mistake. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the presenters of the Grammy Awards, released a statement stating, [...] "Walt Disney Records was proactive and forthcoming to our awards department and verified that the song was not written specifically for the film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Based on this information, the Academy has complied with the label's request." [...] NARAS replaced the nomination with the song with the next highest initial vote count, [...] "All is Love", which was written by Karen O and Nick Zinner for the film Where <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are.</b> Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a D+. His review consisted solely of two motivational posters: one reading [...] "Life: Its not about the destination, but the journey" [...] to describe the song's content, and a mock poster reading [...] "Success: Everything is easy when you're cute" [...] for his actual review. He later expanded his review, calling it [...] "a soulless rephrasing of an extremely famous philosophical message (so famous it borders on cliche) that doesn’t provide an emotionally coherent context or justification". Milliken gave the song a higher grade because [...] "she’s a pretty good singer for someone her age".|$|E

The gift that his family {{possesses}} {{is the ability to}} [...] "unmake" [...] things, but his gift seems to manifest very late, and he is unable to control it. Later he seems to strike down his pet dog, and then destroy an entire hillside with his power. He decides the death was his fault, and horrified by the thought of his power out of control, demands that he be blindfolded. Orrec's battles with his power and its potential to destroy have been described {{as an example of a}} person's confrontation with their own shadow, a common theme in Le Guin's writing. The blindfold initially brings him some peace. Unable to see the real world, he lives within the stories that Melle has told him, Eventually he begins to retell the stories to his mother, and to add to them himself. When Melle asks to see his face without the blindfold one last time, he realizes he couldn't have hurt her, and feels the [...] "dry fury of impotent regret." [...] After his mother's death he descends into grief and rage, which he eventually emerges from with Gry's assistance. At Gry's suggestion he begins to remove his blindfold to read the books his mother writes for him. Orrec comes to realizes that his father has unintentionally tricked him into believing in his wild gift, so as to protect his domain. He confronts his father [...] Orrec eventually realizes that he prefers [...] "making" [...] to unmaking. Gry and he get married, and leave the Uplands. Scholar Sandra Lindow has pointed out that Orrec's name is similar to [...] "auric", meaning [...] "related to hearing", and that it brings to mind the word [...] "oracle", describing his discovery of his power to create and perform.

2500|$|The initial {{idea for}} Wild Things, and the Creatures, came about during the {{recording}} sessions for the Siouxsie and the Banshees album Juju. While bassist Steven Severin and guitarist John McGeoch took a break, Siouxsie and drummer Budgie created the song [...] "But Not Them." [...] Deciding {{that it was}} complete as a drum-and-voice piece, they left it alone, and quickly recorded four more minimal tracks to accompany it. The result was the Wild Things EP (so named by Severin, who upon hearing it, said it sounded like something the creatures in the book Where <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Are</b> would have danced to on their island). The only cover version of the ep was The Troggs' [...] "Wild Thing": Siouxsie included extra angry lyrics to the original: [...] "Wild thing, I think I hate you/but I wanna know for sure/so come on, hit me hard/I hate you". [...] "So Unreal" [...] drew inspiration from the novel The Stepford Wives by Ira Levin and [...] "Mad Eyed Screamer" [...] from local characters met in Hyde Park, London.
