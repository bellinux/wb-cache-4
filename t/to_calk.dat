60|$|However, in {{the mean}} time it had transpired that the men {{employed}} <b>to</b> <b>calk</b> the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all, but only a crack between the logs--a crack that belonged there, and was not dangerous, but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered imagination of the mate. Therefore we went aboard again with a good degree of confidence, and presently got to sea without accident. As we swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores, we fell to swapping notes about manners and customs in Germany and elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|Light as {{the task}} {{would have been}} for a strong man to lower the small boat to the ground, it took Daylight hours. And many hours more, day by day, he dragged himself around it, lying on his side <b>to</b> <b>calk</b> the gaping seams with moss. Yet, when this was done, the river still held. Its ice had risen many feet, but would not start down-stream. And one more task waited, the {{launching}} of the boat when the river ran water to receive it. Vainly Daylight staggered and stumbled and fell and crept through the snow that was wet with thaw, or across it when the night's frost still crusted it beyond the weight of a man, searching for one more squirrel, striving to achieve one more transmutation of furry leap and scolding chatter into the lifts and tugs of a man's body that would hoist the boat over the rim of shore-ice and slide it down into the stream.|$|E
60|$|At this {{critical}} juncture, Mr. Stuart, {{who had heard}} the war-whoop, hastened {{to the scene of}} action with Ben Jones, and seven others of the men. When he arrived, Reed was weltering in his blood, and an Indian standing over him and about to despatch him with a tomahawk. Stuart gave the word, when Ben Jones leveled his rifle, and shot the miscreant on the spot. The men then gave a cheer, and charged upon {{the main body of the}} savages, who took to instant flight. Reed was now raised from the ground, and borne senseless and bleeding to the upper end of the portage. Preparations were made to launch the canoes and embark in all haste, when it was found that they were too leaky to be put in the water, and that the oars had been left at the foot of the falls. A scene of confusion now ensued. The Indians were whooping and yelling, and running about like fiends. A panic seized upon the men, at being thus suddenly checked, the hearts of some of the Canadians died within them, and two young men actually fainted away. The moment they recovered their senses, Mr. Stuart ordered that they should be deprived of their arms, their under garments taken off, and that a piece of cloth should be tied round their waists, in imitation of a squaw; an Indian punishment for cowardice. Thus equipped, they were stowed away among the goods in one of the canoes. This ludicrous affair excited the mirth of the bolder spirits, even in the midst of their perils, and roused the pride of the wavering. The Indians having crossed back again to the north side, order was restored, some of the hands were sent back for the oars, others set to work <b>to</b> <b>calk</b> and launch the canoes, and in a little while all were embarked and were continuing their voyage along the southern shore.|$|E
60|$|It {{proved that}} not only the seams had <b>to</b> be <b>calked</b> but that the cog Thomas was out of fresh water. The ships moored {{therefore}} near the Isle of Brechou, where springs were to be found. There were no people upon this little patch, but over on the farther island many figures could be seen watching them, and the twinkle of steel from among them showed that they were armed men. One boat had ventured forth and taken {{a good look at}} them, but had hurried back with the warning that they were too strong to be touched.|$|R
50|$|The Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company of Duluth, Minnesota, USA {{was founded}} in 1908 by {{blacksmith}} Otto Swanstrom. Initially manufacturing horseshoes with a special type of <b>calk</b> <b>to</b> improve the animals' foothold on slippery surfaces, the company successfully adapted {{to the development of}} motorised transport for the masses and produced a range of adjustable wrenches and pliers from the 1920s. The family-owned company was sold to the Triangle Corporation in 1981; Triangle itself was eventually sold to Cooper Tools.|$|R
60|$|This was {{as well as}} our mate could expect; and the gunner {{had either}} so much {{authority}} among them, or the men were so forward to shift their station in the world, that the gunner came again to our mate in less than two hours, with an order, signed by about sixteen of their officers, empowering him to sell us the ship which the gunner was on board of, and to allot so many guns, and such a proportion of ammunition to her, as was sufficient, and to give the work of all their carpenters for so many days as were necessary <b>to</b> repair her, <b>calk,</b> and grave her, and put her in condition to go to sea.|$|R
60|$|Having each some {{shingles}} {{of thought}} well dried, we sat and whittled them, trying our knives, and admiring the clear yellowish {{grain of the}} pumpkin pine. We waded so gently and reverently, or we pulled together so smoothly, that the fishes of thought were not scared from the stream, nor feared any angler on the bank, but came and went grandly, like the clouds which float through the western sky, and the mother-o'-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there. There we worked, revising mythology, rounding a fable here and there, and building castles {{in the air for}} which earth offered no worthy foundation. Great Looker! Great Expecter! to converse with whom was a New England Night's Entertainment. Ah! such discourse we had, hermit and philosopher, and the old settler I have spoken of--we three--it expanded and racked my little house; I should not dare to say how many pounds' weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every circular inch; it opened its seams so that they had <b>to</b> be <b>calked</b> with much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak;--but I had enough of that kind of oakum already picked.|$|R
40|$|El Misti volcano, a {{large and}} {{hazardous}} edifice of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of southern Peru, consists of four main growth stages. Misti 1 (> 112 ka) is an old stratovolcano partly concealed by two younger stratocones (Misti 2, 112 - 40 ka; Misti 3, 38 - 11 ka), capped in turn by a recent summit cone (Misti 4, < 11 ka). In order to gain insights into magma composition controls on eruptive behaviour through time at El Misti, we have conducted a petrological and geochemical study of selected rock samples from the main growth stages of the volcano. Whole rock compositions range from andesite to rhyolite and belong to a medium <b>to</b> high-K <b>calk</b> alkaline magmatic suite. El Misti samples are characterised by high large-ion lithophile elements, but low concentrations of high field strength elements, and heavy rare earth elements, consistent with a subduction zone setting. The Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 (0. 70715 - 0. 70882) and Nd- 143 /Nd- 144 (0. 511983 - 0. 512277) isotope ratios suggest that magma composition is significantly affected by contamination and/or assimilation processes during their evolution, likely due {{to the presence of}} thick (65 - 70 km) continental crust beneath the CVZ in southern Peru. Geochemical evidence indicates that magmatic evolution is mostly controlled by Assimilation-Fractional Crystallisation (AFC) mechanisms. Modelling reveals a mass-assimilated/mass-fractionated ratio (p) <= 2. 2, which suggests an assimilated crust fraction below 14 wt. % on average. Our isotopic data clearly identify the Proterozoic "Charcani gneiss" basement as the main contaminant. Both contamination and assimilation processes peaked at similar to 30 wt. %, during the Misti 3 stage when rhyolites were generated. We ascribe the general depletion in HREE and Y and elevated La/Yb and Sr/Y ratios in El Misti samples to the enrichment of the mantle wedge source of the parental magmas by a felsic melt of adakitic composition and hydrous fluids. Our work highlights that El Misti's magmatic system has remained relatively homogeneous since at least 0. 12 Ma, with a marked influence of the contaminating crust in the Late Pleistocene Misti 3 stage, which resulted in highly explosive eruptions. Andesitic-dacitic compositions are dominant in the Holocene and historical Misti 4 stage, and are expected for future volcanic events at El Misti...|$|R
60|$|The houses {{built by}} our {{ancestors}} were better ventilated in certain respects than modern ones, {{with all their}} improvements. The great central chimney, with its open fireplaces in the different rooms, created a constant current which carried off foul and vitiated air. In these days, how common is it to provide rooms with only a flue for a stove! This flue is kept shut in summer, and in winter opened only to admit a close stove, which burns away the vital portion of the air quite {{as fast as the}} occupants breathe it away. The sealing up of fireplaces and introduction of air-tight stoves may, doubtless, be a saving of fuel; it saves, too, more than that,--in thousands and thousands of cases it has saved people from all further human wants, and put an end forever to any needs short of the six feet of narrow earth which are man's only inalienable property. In other words, since the invention of air-tight stoves, thousands have died of slow poison. It is a terrible thing to reflect upon, that our Northern winters last from November to May, six long months, in which many families confine themselves to one room, of which every window-crack has been carefully <b>calked</b> <b>to</b> make it air-tight, where an air-tight stove keeps the atmosphere at a temperature between eighty and ninety, and the inmates sitting there, with all their winter clothes on, become enervated both by the heat and by the poisoned air, {{for which there is no}} escape but the occasional opening of a door.|$|R
