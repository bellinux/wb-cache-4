5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the sympathetic trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> Sympathetic nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> and nerves from the sympathetic trunk act to increase <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E

5|$|Exercise {{and fitness}} levels, age, body temperature, basal {{metabolic}} rate, {{and even a}} person's emotional state can all affect <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> High levels of the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones can increase <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> The levels of electrolytes including calcium, potassium, and sodium can also influence the speed and regularity of the heart rate; low blood oxygen, low blood pressure and dehydration may increase it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For a {{long-haul}} flight passenger, if he/she is an adult, his/her normal <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{should be}} 60 - 100 beats per minute. However, {{the combination of}} long flight duration, dehydration and reduced oxygen availability etc. flying factors may cause his/her heart beating out of the normal range {{for a long time}} which endangers his/her heart health. In this paper, we present a new bio-feedback based music system to promote <b>the</b> passenger’s <b>heart</b> health with his/her preferred music. If <b>the</b> passenger’s <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is higher than <b>the</b> normal <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>the</b> system recommends his/her preferred calm music to the passenger to transfer his/her <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> back to normal; If <b>the</b> passenger’s <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is lower than <b>the</b> normal <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>the</b> system recommends his/her preferred upbeat music to uplift his/her <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> back to normal; if <b>the</b> passenger’s <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is normal, <b>the</b> system recommends the passenger preferred music to keep his/her <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> at normal.

5|$|Potassium {{levels can}} {{fluctuate}} severely during {{the treatment of}} DKA, because insulin decreases potassium levels in the blood by redistributing it into cells via increased sodium-potassium pump activity. A {{large part of the}} shifted extracellular potassium would have been lost in urine because of osmotic diuresis. Hypokalemia (low blood potassium concentration) often follows treatment. This increases the risk of dangerous irregularities in <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate.</b> Therefore, continuous observation of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is recommended, as well as repeated measurement of the potassium levels and addition of potassium to the intravenous fluids once levels fall below 5.3mmol/l. If potassium levels fall below 3.3mmol/l, insulin administration may need to be interrupted to allow correction of the hypokalemia.|$|E

5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring attacks of muscle weakness {{in the presence of}} hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland).

30|$|Both {{preoperative}} {{and postoperative}} monitoring of <b>the</b> foetal <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> is highly recommended [6]. We performed an ultrasound assessment of <b>the</b> foetal <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> immediately {{before and the}} day after the procedure.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{decreased}} <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{can cause}} a decreased cardiac output resulting in symptoms such as lightheadedness, dizziness, hypotension, vertigo, and syncope. <b>The</b> slow <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> may also lead to atrial, junctional, or ventricular ectopic rhythms.|$|R
5|$|Octopuses mainly {{move about}} by {{relatively}} slow crawling, with some {{swimming in a}} head-first position. Jet propulsion, or backwards swimming, is their fastest means of locomotion, followed by swimming and crawling. When in no hurry, they usually crawl on either solid or soft surfaces. Several arms are extended forwards, some of the suckers adhere to the substrate and the animal hauls itself forwards with its powerful arm muscles, while other arms may push rather than pull. As progress is made, other arms move ahead to repeat these actions and the original suckers detach. During crawling, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> nearly doubles, and the animal requires ten or fifteen minutes to recover from relatively minor exercise.|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> or rhythm, {{a number of}} different antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest tightness, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
40|$|This paper compares {{two methods}} to {{estimate}} <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> variability spectra i. e., {{the spectrum of}} counts and <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> spectrum. Contrary to Fourier techniques based on equidistant sampling of the interbeat intervals, the spectrum of counts of <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> spectrum are based on non-equidistant sampling: the values are determined at R-wave moments. A consequence of the non-equidistant occurrence of the R-peaks in a <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> signal is <b>the</b> appearance of the sidebands of the harmonic components of <b>the</b> mean <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> in <b>the</b> spectra. These sidebands contaminate the signal components in the spectrum. The sideband distortion in <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> spectrum {{was found to be}} smaller than in the spectrum of counts. Simulations using the IPFM-model were mead to quantify this difference. On the basis of these simulations, sideband distortion appeared to be dependent on <b>the</b> mean <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>the</b> modulation depth and the modulation frequency...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the intensities of university rugby union games using <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> and graded maximal test values. Twenty-one rugby players performed a standard incremental maximal oxygen uptake (V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 max) test to the point of exhaustion in the weeks between 3 rugby matches. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> that corresponded to the first and second ventilatory thresholds were used to classify <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> into low-, moderate-, and high-intensity zones. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> recorded through <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> telemetry during <b>the</b> matches were then categorized into the different zones. <b>The</b> average <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> for <b>the</b> different intensity zones as well the percentages of <b>the</b> maximum <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> (HRmax) were as follows: low, 141 – 152 b·min− 1 (76. 2 – 82. 0 % HRmax); moderate, 153 – 169 b·min− 1 (82. 7 – 91. 4 % HRmax); and high, 170 – 182 b·min− 1 (91. 9 – 100 % HRmax). The percentages of time players spent in the different intensity zones were as follows: 22. 8 % for the low-intensity, 33. 6 % for the moderate-intensity, and 43. 6 % for the high-intensity zones. The dependant t-test revealed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between the low- and high-intensity zones for the second halves, between the low- and moderate- as well as between the low- and high-intensity zones for the matches overall. To conclude, the results of the study showed that the above-mentioned method can be used to determine the intensities of university rugby union games. It also revealed that university rugby games are categorized by significantly more high-intensity activities than was previously reported by other rugby match analyzing–related studies. Thus, sport scientists and conditioning coaches should concentrate more on high-intensity activities for longer periods during training sessions. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>rate</b> {{variations}} {{of a population}} of the limpet Patella vutgata were monitored in the natural environment (Lough Hyne, southern Ireland) by non-invasive, optoelectronic recording. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of 145 limpets of different sizes, living on vertical and horizontal substrata, were measured both in air and water at different environmental temperatures, while the animals were inactive on their home scars. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of emersed, inactive limpets were positively related to air temperature and negatively related to limpet size. These relationships were similar for limpets on vertical and horizontal substrates. In contrast, no significant relationship between <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and temperature was found in submerged limpets, {{probably due to the}} narrow thermal range of the water during the study period During submersion, a significant negative relationship between <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> and size was evident for limpets on vertical surfaces but not for limpets on horizontal surfaces. In general, submerged limpets had a higher <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> 1. 16 times that of limpets exposed to air. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>rates</b> of nine animals were recorded while they were moving and while inactive on their home scars. Active limpets had a faster <b>heart</b> <b>rate,</b> 1. 6 times that of limpets resting on their home scars. <b>The</b> dependence of <b>heart</b> <b>rate</b> on environmental temperature, size, respiratory medium and activity, as observed in limpets on the shore, agrees well with laboratory data and with previous findings of the correlation of oxygen consumption with the same factors.
