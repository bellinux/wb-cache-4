40|$|Background: Description of <b>the</b> {{anatomical}} <b>severity</b> {{of injuries}} in trauma patients is important. While <b>the</b> Injury <b>Severity</b> Score has {{been regarded as}} the “gold standard” since its creation, several {{studies have indicated that}} <b>the</b> New Injury <b>Severity</b> Score is better. Therefore, we aimed to systematically evaluate and compare the accuracy of <b>the</b> Injury <b>Severity</b> Score and <b>the</b> New Injury <b>Severity</b> Score in predicting mortality. Methods: Two researchers independently searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases and included studies from which the exact number of true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative results could be extracted. Quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist criteria. The meta-analysis was performed using Meta-DiSc. Meta-regression, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the source(s) of heterogeneity and factor(s) affecting the accuracy of <b>the</b> New Injury <b>Severity</b> Score and <b>the</b> Injury <b>Severity</b> Score in predicting mortality. Results: The heterogeneity of the 11 relevant studies (total n = 11, 866) was high (I 2 > 80 %). The meta-analysis using a random-effects model resulted in sensitivity of 0. 64, specificity of 0. 93, positive likelihood ratio of 5. 11, negative likelihood ratio of 0. 27, diagnostic odds ratio of 27. 75, and area under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve of 0. 9009 for <b>the</b> Injury <b>Severity</b> Score; and sensitivity of 0. 71, specificity of 0. 87, positive likelihood ratio of 5. 22, negative likelihood ratio of 0. 20, diagnostic odds ratio of 24. 74, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 9095 for <b>the</b> New Injury <b>Severity</b> Score. Conclusion: <b>The</b> New Injury <b>Severity</b> Score and <b>the</b> Injury <b>Severity</b> Score have similar abilities in predicting mortality.

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>severities</b> of an {{original}} fire and a subsequent fire were examined {{by looking at}} the agreement for each of <b>the</b> five <b>severity</b> classes: high, moderate-high, moderate-low, low, and unburned. In this context, agreement indicates what percentage of the twice-burned area showed <b>the</b> same <b>severity</b> on both first and second entry. The similarity in subsequent severities can be attributed to a combination of chance, the proportions of area in each <b>severity</b> class, and <b>the</b> spatial allocation of the areas that burned with <b>the</b> same <b>severity.</b> <b>The</b> difference in subsequent severities {{can be attributed to the}} difference in area in each severity class on first and second entry, and to the different spatial arrangement of these severity classes. Because all severity re-burn data for the study period were used, the matrix is unbiased (Pontius and Millones 2011).|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{examine whether}} <b>the</b> {{clinical}} <b>severity</b> of cervical dystonia (CD) significantly correlates with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) findings {{as well as}} to determine the threshold of <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> of CD for positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT study findings. Methods Forty-seven subjects with torticollis as one of the symptoms of CD were included. <b>The</b> clinical <b>severity</b> of CD was evaluated with the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) at the time of 18 F-FDG PET/CT. The correlation between <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> of CD and the highest SUVmax was examined. The threshold of <b>the</b> clinical <b>severity</b> of CD necessary for positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings was determined using receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. Results Thirty-three of the 47 subjects (70. 21 %) showed positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings. The ipsilateral splenius capitis/cervicis, oblique capitis inferior, and longus colli/capitis were the rotators most frequently involved. The highest SUVmax of 18 F-FDG PET/CT was significant correlated with the TWSTRS. Subjects with a total TWSTRS exceeding 39 showed positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings, with those having a total TWSTRS ≤ 22 showing negative 18 F-FDG PET/CT results. The cutoff value of the total TWSTRS for positive 18 F-FDG PET/CT findings was set at 27. 5 with 90. 9 % sensitivity and 64. 3 % specificity.
