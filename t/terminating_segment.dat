40|$|Nowadays, {{incumbent}} {{operators are}} deploying GPON FTTH access network over {{substantial part of}} the countries in Europe, in a Point-to-Multipoint architecture (P 2 MP). This architecture is characterized by a shared fiber from the Central Office (C. O.) to a certain location where, by means of splitters, individual fibers carry the signal to/from every user. It is preferable for an open market situation, where the competition in prices and services is desirable and also enforced by local governments and administrations, to have different entry options to the market for the many alternative operators (entrants) which may come up and compete with the incumbent. For that reason, this study aims at considering different unbundling options for the Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) in order to provide multioperator access and consider the economical impact for the entrants to deploy such alternatives. The scope of this study primarily covers remedies to be imposed upon operators designated with Significant Market Power (SMP) {{on the basis of a}} market analysis procedure carried out under Article 16 of Directive 2002 / 21 /EC [EUC 02 a]. However, where it is justified on the grounds that duplication of infrastructure is economically inefficient or physically impracticable, the regulator may also impose obligations of reciprocal sharing of facilities on undertakings operating an electronic communications network in accordance with Article 12 of that Directive which would be appropriate to overcome bottlenecks in the civil engineering infrastructure and terminating segments. This work deals with the following issues: • Alternatives for LLU: although there are several methods, the next three have been considered as they are the most feasible in terms of cost, scalability and upgradeability, in the number of clients and operators. [ALC 10 a] [FCE 11 c] [ISD 09 a] [MAS 09 a] [ITU 08 a] [WKC 10 a] o Move the Splitters Back. o Replicate the Access Network. o Upgrading to WDM technologies. • Results / Comparison: both absolute and incremental costs, starting from a P 2 MP deployment for the different unbundling strategies. Alternative operators, some of whom have already deployed their own networks to connect to the unbundled copper loop of the SMP operator, need to be provided with appropriate access products in order to continue to compete in an NGA context. For FTTH these may consist of access to civil engineering infrastructure, to the <b>terminating</b> <b>segment,</b> to the unbundled fiber loop (including dark fiber) or of wholesale broadband access, as the case may be. This work, although aiming to be general, takes the relevant data from the Spanish FTTH case. Where remedies imposed on Market 4 lead to effective competition in the corresponding downstream market, in the whole market or in certain geographic areas, other remedies could be withdrawn in the market or areas concerned. Such withdrawal would be indicated, for instance, if the successful imposition of physical access remedies were to render additional bitstream remedies redundant. Moreover, in exceptional circumstances, the regulator could refrain from imposing unbundled access to the fiber loop in geographic areas where the presence of several alternative infrastructures, such as FTTH networks, in combination with competitive access offers on the basis of unbundling, is likely to result in effective competition on the downstream level.

In the presence of adsorbed fluid both parts of the curve of the solvation force may develop oscillatory behavior dependent on the density of pillars, the number of segments and adsorption conditions.

40|$|Two ice-dynamic {{transitions}} of the Antarctic {{ice sheet}} - {{the boundary of}} grounded ice features and the freely-floating boundary - are mapped at 15 -m resolution by participants of the International Polar Year project ASAID using customized software combining Landsat- 7 imagery and ICESat/GLAS laser altimetry. The grounded ice boundary is 53 610 km long; 74 % abuts to floating ice shelves or outlet glaciers, 19 % is adjacent to open or sea-ice covered ocean, and 7 % of the boundary ice terminates on land. The freely-floating boundary, called here the hydrostatic line, is the most landward position on ice shelves that expresses the full amplitude of oscillating ocean tides. It extends 27 521 km and is discontinuous. Positional (one-sigma) accuracies of the grounded ice boundary vary {{an order of magnitude}} ranging from +/- 52 m for the land and open-ocean <b>terminating</b> <b>segments</b> to +/- 502 m for the outlet glaciers. The hydrostatic line is less well positioned with errors over 2 km. Elevations along each line are selected from 6 candidate digital elevation models based on their agreement with ICESat elevation values and surface shape inferred from the Landsat imagery. Elevations along the hydrostatic line are converted to ice thicknesses by applying a firn-correction factor and a flotation criterion. BEDMAP-compiled data and other airborne data are compared to the ASAID elevations and ice thicknesses to arrive at quantitative (one-sigma) uncertainties of surface elevations of +/- 3. 6, +/- 9. 6, +/- 11. 4, +/- 30 and +/- 100 m for five ASAID-assigned confidence levels. Over one-half of the surface elevations along the grounded ice boundary and over one-third of the hydrostatic line elevations are ranked in the highest two confidence categories. A comparison between ASAID-calculated ice shelf thicknesses and BEDMAP-compiled data indicate a thin-ice bias of 41. 2 +/- 71. 3 m for the ASAID ice thicknesses.

Curves of very large radius had to be drawn; and, finding a beam-compassof adequate length difficult to manage, I bethought me of an instrumental application of the geometrical truth that angles in the same segment of a circle are equal to one another.

This change in conformation increases the stability towards denaturation of the cleaved serpin relative to the native uncleaved form. Mutant serpins with single amino acid changes in the s 4 A strand have been identified, and in most cases these are proteinase substrates but not inhibitors. We have measured the stability to denaturation of one of these non-inhibitor substrate mutants, antithrombin-Hamilton, which has an Ala → Thr change at position P 12 in strand s 4 A. We find that it undergoes the transformation to the more stable form which is observed for inhibitor serpins, from which we conclude that the Ala → Thr change in antithrombin-Hamilton does not prevent insertion of s 4 A into β-sheet A in the cleaved form...|$|R

As soft segments, copolymers of 50 / 50 L-lactide/epsilon-caprolactone have been used. After <b>terminating</b> the soft <b>segment</b> with diisocyanates, chain extension was performed with adipic acid and water. Reaction between the isocyanate groups and adipic acid or water provides carbon dioxide and results in a porous polymer. Extra hydroxyl-terminated prepolymer was added in order to regulate {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide formed in the foaming reaction. Furthermore, salt crystals ranging in size from 150 to 355 mu m were added in order to induce macroporosity, The pore size was regulated by addition of surfactant and by the use of ultrasonic waves. The resulting porous polymer scaffolds exhibit good mechanical properties like a high-compression modulus of 150 kPa. Chain extension with adipic acid results in better mechanical properties due to better defined hard segments. This results from the lower nucleophilicity of carboxylic acids compared to water and alcohols. By adjusting the reaction conditions, materials in which macropores are interconnected by micropores can be obtained. On degradation only non-toxic products will be released; importantly, the materials were obtained by a simple, reproducible and solvent-free procedure.

One {{of them is the}} widespread use of the Internet, which has brought a sharp increase in traffic, forcing suppliers to continuously expand the capacity of networks. In the near future, Internet will be composed of long-range highspeed optical networks; a number of wireless networks at the edge; and, in between, several access technologies. Today one of the main problems of the Internet is the bottleneck in the access segment. To address this issue the Passive Optical Networks (PONs) are very likely to succeed, due to their simplicity, low-cost, and increased bandwidth. A PON is made up of fiber optic cabling and passive splitters and couplers that distribute an optical signal to connectors that <b>terminate</b> each fiber <b>segment.</b> Among the different PON technologies, the Ethernet-PON (EPON) is a great alternative to satisfy operator and user needs, due to its cost, flexibility and interoperability with other technologies. One of the most interesting challenges in such technologies relates to the scheduling and allocation of resources in the upstream (shared) channel, i. e., the resource management. The aim of this thesis is to study and evaluate current contributions and propose new efficient solutions to address the resource management issues mainly in EPON. Key issues in this context are future end-user needs, quality of service (QoS) support, energy-saving and optimized service provisioning for real-time and elastic flows.

We consider the case when successively scheduled events can be represented as {{the elements of a}} finite subset C of a finite dimensional affine space, and C is the set of vertices of a convex polytope P. In digital printing, P would most often be an interval for greyscale image printing, and a 3 -cube for color printing, but other polytopes arise. In scheduling, one most often use standard simplices, other polytopes arises as well, specially those polytopes whose corners are corner of some unit cube. In general, considering digital printing on a line as an instance of scheduling, a schedule for us is a sequence of vertices (outputs), i. e., points in the set of corners, that responds to a sequence of inputs (or demands) which are points of the polytope. We judge the quality of a schedule by the closeness in some distance of all the initial <b>segments</b> (<b>terminating</b> at all times) of the cumulated outputs and inputs sequences. The difference of the two cumulated sequences form a sequence of error vectors.

40|$|A {{compilation}} of several aeromagnetic surveys across North Greenland and the Fram Strait area is presented. Across North Greenland {{the data are}} related to the known onshore geology. The correlation between the geological structure and large-scale magnetic anomalies is excellent. Along the North Greenland coast the data indicate that the Late Mesozoic Kap Washington volcanics might have a larger areal extent than known from onshore geological mapping. The submarine Morris Jesup Rise is characterized by strong positive magnetic anomalies, and the anomalies across the plateau indicate the presence of distinct volcanic centres. This massive magmatism have occurred latest in conjunction with the Oligocene initial stages of plate divergence between Svalbard and North Greenland that {{led to the development of}} Fram Strait. Both plateaux, the Morris Jesup Rise and the Yermak Plateau, are interpreted to be of continental origin and, in the initial rift stage of the Eurasia Basin around 56 Ma, to have been contiguous with the Lomonosov Ridge. More towards the east in the Fram Strait interpretations of seismic and bathymetric data indicate the presence of an active segment of mid-ocean ridge, the Lena Trough. This approximately 280 km long <b>segment</b> <b>terminates</b> in the south at the NW-SE striking Spitsbergen Fracture Zone, while in the north it bends to connect with the Gakkel Ridge. A shallow water pathway along the line of the trough might have existed between those times and ~ 21 Ma, above the propagating rift system in the north and, further south, over extending and subsiding continental crust of the Svalbard and North East Greenland margins. Magnetic anomaly identifications indicate that the Lena Trough has remained an ultraslow spreading system or possibly even all, of the magnetic lineations may be signals of serpentinized exhumed mantle rocks rather than of basaltic crust...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{computer}} model has been developed for the prediction of flow and pressure along segments of arteries. The model can account for important factors such as vessel taper, branching, nonlinear area pressure relationships for the vessel, and single and multiple stenoses. One-dimensional continuity and momentum equations for flow in flexible tubes are {{used to describe the}} main arterial flow, and a quadratic form of area variation with pressure is used for the vessel equation of state. A seepage term is included in the continuity equation to allow for flow through small branches. Large branches are modeled as arterial <b>segments</b> <b>terminating</b> as modified Windkessel lumped impedances. Arterial stenoses are modeled with a nonlinear equation relating flow and pressure drop. The method of finite-elements with semi-discrete shape functions is used to solve for pressure and flow variations along the arterial segment. The sensitivity of the model is specific values of lumped impedance parameters has been investigated in detail. Some validation studies were carried out based on pressure and flow measurements obtained from the hindlimbs of dogs. Reasonable agreement between observed and predicted flow waveforms were obtained;The suitability of the finite-element method for the study of arterial flow dynamics, and the importance of using the correct form of lumped impedance, has been demonstrated by simulating flow in two different arterial segments: (1) the human leg arteries containing stenoses, and (2) the bovine uterine artery;The predicted waveforms for the human femoral artery compared well with those published in past studies. In this study the effects of (1) multiple stenoses, and (2) compensation of peripheral beds to accommodate for stenosis induced loss of pressure were considered. The human leg artery model was also used to study the effects of approximating wall shear in the momentum equation;The bovine uterine artery is unique since flow and mechanical properties associated with the artery undergo marked changes during the estrous cycle. With proper selection of the lumped impedances and main arterial parameters, good agreement between predicted and measured flow waveforms was achieved...|$|R
40|$|Most {{eukaryotic}} membrane proteins are cotranslationally {{integrated into}} the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by the Sec 61 translocation complex. They are targeted to the translocon by hydrophobic signal sequences which induce the translocation of either their N- or C-terminal sequence. Signal sequence orientation is largely determined by charged residues flanking the apolar sequence (the positive-inside rule), folding properties of the N-terminal segment, and the hydrophobicity of the signal. Recent in vivo experiments suggest that N-terminal signals initially insert into the translocon head-on to yield a translocated Nterminus. Driven by a local electrical potential, the signal may invert its orientation and translocate the C-terminal sequence. Increased hydrophobicity slows down inversion by stabilizing the initial bound state. In vitro crosslinking studies indicate that signals rapidly contact lipids upon entering the translocon. Together with the recent crystal structure of the homologous SecYEβ translocation complex of Methanococcus jannaschii, which did not reveal an obvious hydrophobic binding site for signals within the pore, a model emerges in which the translocon allows the lateral partitioning of hydrophobic segments between the aqueous pore and the lipid membrane. Signals may return into the pore for reorientation until translation is <b>terminated.</b> Subsequent transmembrane <b>segments</b> in multispanning proteins behave similarly {{and contribute to the}} overall topology of the protein. This thesis was aimed at investigating the integration of single- and doublespanning membrane proteins in mammalian cells. The first part consisted of probing the environment of the signal while its orientation is determined by inserting different hydrophobic residues at various positions throughout a uniform oligo-leucine signal sequence. The resulting topologies revealed a strikingly symmetric position dependence specifically for bulky aromatic amino acids, reflecting the structure of a lipid bilayer. The results support the model that during topogenesis in vivo the signal sequence is exposed to the lipid membrane. The second part consisted of the determination of the kinetics of double-spanning protein topogenesis. The results confirmed that major reorientation of the polypeptide my occur when a second topogenic sequence, conflicting with a first one, enters the translocon. They also showed that the time window for protein reorientation differs for different types of substrate...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 A 5 km swath-width SeaMARC I sidescan sonar survey, {{conducted}} over {{the zone of}} overlap between the southern rift zone of Axial Volcano and {{the northern tip of}} the Vance spreading segment on the Juan de Fuca Ridge (between 45 ° 24 'N and 45 ° 50 'N latitude), was analyzed to locate the present position of the Juan de Fuca spreading axis, and to determine the tectonic and volcanic structure of the seafloor. Sidescan data were processed in concert with the ship's Loran-C navigation to construct navigated, orthorectified mosaics of the sidescan imagery. In order to navigate the sidescan swaths, a simple numerical model was developed to describe the tracking behavior of the towed sidescan vehicle. Successive positions and orientations of the sidescan towfish were estimated, and were used to assign latitude/longitude values to individual sidescan pixels. Navigated sidescan pixels were mapped by computer onto an absolute (latitude/longitude) reference grid, and the resulting sidescan mosaic was compared directly to existing high-resolution SeaBeam bathymetry in order to discriminate the effects of large- and small-scale roughness on the observed backscatter distribution. The Juan de Fuca spreading axis between 45 ° 25 'N and 45 ° 39 'N is located within the axial valley of the Vance segment. Relative age relationships, based on crosscutting and superposition principles, indicate that the most recent volcanism within the axial valley has occurred along the valley's central ridge, and that the most recent resolvable extension within the axial valley has been concentrated between the central ridge and west valley wall. The Vance <b>segment</b> <b>terminates</b> at 45 ° 39 'N, and is not associated with a transform fault. The south rift zone of Axial volcano is a constructional volcanic feature that is not faulted, and a discrete axis of spreading over the south flank of Axial volcano is not resolvable in the sidescan imagery; however, the spreading locus north of 45 ° 39 'N is constrained to a zone between 130 ° 06 'W and 129 ° 54 'W. The lack of a well-defined spreading axis north of 45 ° 39 'N indicates that the physical manifestation of the divergent plate boundary has been modified or masked by hotspot volcanic processes associated with Axial volcano such that a definitive locus of spreading is not expressed in the surface morphology...|$|R
