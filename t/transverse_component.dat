40|$|A {{simple method}} for characterizing {{spring-type}} magnets is proposed {{by using a}} standard magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) rig. As we previously reported, a spiral structure with parallel field (longitudinal) and normal field (<b>transverse)</b> <b>components</b> can easily develop in Laves-phase spring-type superlattice magnets once an external field is applied. Based on a phenomenological formula both longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>components</b> in the exchange-springs can be probed simultaneously by MOKE.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to construct representations of the Lorentz group using four-dimensional harmonic oscillators. This allows us to construct threedimensional wave functions with the usual rotational symmetry for space-like coordinates and one-dimensional wave function for time-like coordinate. It is then possible to construct {{a representation of the}} Poincaré group for a massive particles having the O(3) internal space-time symmetry in its rest frame. This oscillator can also be separated into two <b>transverse</b> <b>components</b> and the two-dimensional world of the longitudinal and time-like coordinates. The <b>transverse</b> <b>components</b> remain unchanged under Lorentz boosts, while it {{is possible}} to construct the squeeze representation of the O(1, 1) group in the space of the longitudinal and time-like coordinates. While the squeeze representation forms the basic language for squeezed states of light, it can be combined with the <b>transverse</b> <b>components</b> to form the representation of the Poincarè group for relativistic extended particles. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{structure}} of generalized parton distributions in impact parameter space {{with the aim of}} determining the size and role of small <b>transverse</b> separations <b>components</b> in the quarks wave function. We analyze the relation between <b>transverse</b> momentum <b>components</b> and <b>transverse</b> separations. Wave functions with large <b>transverse</b> momentum <b>components</b> can simultaneously reproduce the behavior of the Dirac form factor at large momentum transfer, and of the deep inelastic structure functions at Bjorken x -> 1. The presence of large momentum components does not ensure, however, the dominance of small transverse distances at large x. We suggest that experiments measuring the attenuation of hadrons in the nuclear medium, or the onset of color transparency, can provide an alternative source of information on generalized parton distributions, by mapping out the behavior of the <b>transverse</b> <b>components</b> of the wave function.

In particular, for a plane wave travelling through empty space, the wave impedance is equal to the impedance of free space. The symbol Z is used to represent it and it is expressed in units of ohms. The symbol η (eta) may be used instead of Z for wave impedance to avoid confusion with electrical impedance.|$|R

50|$|Thermowells are {{typically}} installed in piping systems {{and subject to}} both hydrostatic and aerodynamic forces. Vortex shedding is the dominant concern for thermowells in cross-flow applications and is capable of forcing the thermowell into resonance {{with the possibility of}} fatigue failure not only of the thermowell but also of the temperature sensor. The conditions for flow-induced resonance generally govern the design of the thermowell apart from its pressure rating and materials of construction. Flow-induced motion of the thermowell occurs both in-line with and transverse to the direction of flow with the fluid forces acting to bend the thermowell. In many applications the <b>transverse</b> <b>component</b> of the fluid forces resulting from vortex shedding tends to govern the onset of flow-induced resonance, with a forcing frequency equal to the vortex shedding rate. In liquids and in high-pressure compressible fluids, a smaller but nonetheless significant component of motion in the flow-direction is also present and occurs at nearly twice the vortex shedding rate. The in-line resonance condition may govern thermowell design at high fluid velocities although its amplitude {{is a function of the}} mass-damping parameter or Scruton number describing the thermowell-fluid interaction.|$|E
