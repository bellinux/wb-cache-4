They are tank locomotives and {{can easily be}} run tender-first, thus {{eliminating the need for}} expensive turntables or wyes.

Because the engine units are separated by the boiler unit, the weight of the locomotive is split over the two units, and they can run over bridges or line sections <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to support conventional or Mallet locomotives of similar weight.|$|E

25|$|Commodity ETFs trade {{just like}} shares, are simple and {{efficient}} and provide exposure to an ever-increasing range of commodities and commodity indices, including energy, metals, softs and agriculture. However, {{it is important}} for an investor to realize that there are often other factors that affect the price of a commodity ETF <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> immediately apparent. For example, buyers of an oil ETF such as USO might think that as long as oil goes up, they will profit roughly linearly. What isn't clear to the novice investor is the method by which these funds gain exposure to their underlying commodities. In the case of many commodity funds, they simply roll so-called front-month futures contracts from month to month. This does give exposure to the commodity, but subjects the investor to risks involved in different prices along the term structure, such as a high cost to roll.|$|E
500|$|The British War Cabinet had cautioned Allenby not {{to commit}} to any {{operations}} <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sustainable {{in the long term}} if the strength of British forces in the area could not be maintained. Their concerns were possibly linked to a peace proposal published on 8 November by the new Russian Bolshevik government between Russia and Germany. The document, scheduled to be signed on 3 March 1918, would constitute a separate peace treaty and result in the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the war. All German forces on the eastern front [...] could then turn their attention to fighting British and French forces elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|It was screenwriter Joss Whedon's idea to {{incorporate}} Barbie {{as a character}} who would rescue Woody and Buzz in the film's final act. The idea was dropped after Mattel objected and refused to license the toy. Producer Ralph Guggenheim claimed that Mattel did not allow {{the use of the}} toy as [...] "They [...] philosophically felt girls who play with Barbie dolls are projecting their personalities onto the doll. If you give the doll a voice and animate it, you're creating a persona for it <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> every little girl's dream and desire." [...] Hasbro likewise refused to license [...] (mainly because Sid was going to blow one up), but they did license Mr. Potato Head. The only toy in the movie that was not in production was Slinky Dog, which was discontinued since the 1970s. When designs for Slinky were sent to Betty James (Richard James's wife) she said that Pixar had improved the toy and that it was [...] "cuter" [...] than the original.|$|E

500|$|The biggest {{point of}} {{contention}} among the developers was including options allowing for the revival of fallen units in [...] "Casual Mode", a recurring discussion stretching back {{to the development of}} [...] (1996). The dispute between Intelligent Systems and Nintendo staff was fierce, but positive comments from playtests with the feature included helped those opposed come round to its inclusion. The four difficulty levels were made separate from the two modes of play, so players could adjust the experience to suit their needs. Another new element was the Avatar character, who was created so players would have an easier introduction, as the developers realized that they might end up creating the game assuming players would know about main protagonist Marth when <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the case. Alongside the Avatar was a new tutorial, which the developers needed to balance so it was enjoyable for series veterans while easing new players into the experience. Also new was the element of time passing when the system was turned off and the cartridge still in place. The content grew {{to the point that the}} developers contemplated dividing New Mystery of the Emblem itself into two releases.|$|E
500|$|In a 2011 Q, {{producer}} Jim Lemley {{said that}} [...] "Wanted 2 {{sounds like it}} will not happen any time soon if at all". That same year, James McAvoy said, regarding the sequel, [...] "I think the studio is keen to make it, and {{we really want to}} make it, but we want to make it if it's right and when it's right, and <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ever." [...] McAvoy also expressed interest in a sequel focusing on a character other than Wesley. Universal later brought Wanted screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas to write the sequel, which Haas described as happening [...] "right after the events that just happened; it'll pick up Wesley a few years later and go back in for another round", while also being [...] "Fox-less and loom-less." [...] Haas would later detail that the script featured a new female protagonist, who Wesley would recruit [...] "sort of in the Fox role." [...] Bekmambetov declared during the interviews for [...] that after many years of indecision as the Wanted sequel stalled in development, he proposed an idea to the screenwriters wherein the plot followed Wesley while featuring [...] "a great twist." ...|$|E
500|$|As well as {{supporting}} the Australian Army, Cannan was {{also responsible for}} providing {{a broad range of}} goods and services to the Americans. In no other theatre of war was local procurement of supplies by US forces as extensive or important as in the South West Pacific. Australian Reverse Lend Lease came to USD $1.1 billion, representing 13% of all reciprocal aid to the United States. Such figures understate the value of Australian aid, for every ton of supplies procured in Australia meant a ton that {{did not have to be}} shipped across the Pacific Ocean. This required the same shipping space as two tons of supplies shipped across in the Atlantic Ocean, the distance there being half as great. Cannan was responsible for rationing the American forces in Australia until the American Quartermaster Corps felt capable of taking over the function in 1943. When requirements to support the British Pacific Fleet were piled on top of American demands and an increasing tight Army manpower situation, Cannan protested the [...] "lavishness and extravagance which characterised US demands whilst the Australian services' demands were being subjected to rigid scrutiny and economies", citing examples, and urged that economies be made on goods and services supplied to Allied countries. However the government was reluctant to take any action <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> welcomed by American military and political leaders. Nonetheless, Prime Minister John Curtin did successfully persuade General Douglas MacArthur to rationalise his use of Australian resources in order to provide accommodation for the British Pacific Fleet.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on 11 August 2001. It begins with Minogue driving a De Tomaso Mangusta sports car on a futuristic bridge, while singing the [...] "la la la" [...] hook of the song. The next scene consists {{of a number of}} dance couples performing a dance routine dressed in black and white costumes; they are soon joined by Minogue, who is seen wearing a white tracksuit. The setting changes to a room where Minogue is seen striking various poses sporting bright crimson lipstick and a hooded white jumpsuit with a neckline plunging down to her navel. The outfit was designed by London-based fashion designer Fee Doran, under the label of Mrs Jones. Minogue then performs a synchronised dance routine with several backup dancers, who are wearing red and black suits. As the video ends, she performs a similar routine {{on the top of a}} building during the night, this time wearing a lavender halter neck dress with ribbon tile trim. Various scenes in the video show Minogue's face [...] "unusually" [...] close to the lens of the camera, thus it [...] "subtly distorts, yet remains glamorous." [...] Shadforth felt the shot gave a [...] "sort of sense of intimacy and as you say a sort of strangeness," [...] again drawing upon the suggestion of Minogue being an alien. Similarly, Morley opined that it was [...] "the side of Kylie that suddenly reveals itself as being experimental, she is prepared to push herself into positions and shapes <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> conventionally attractive [...] She becomes alien Kylie as well." ...|$|E
