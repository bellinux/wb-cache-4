40|$|Incrimination of vacuum-packaged {{smoked fish}} in {{outbreaks}} of botulism has {{raised questions about}} the safety of this process in comparison with other methods of packaging foods. It has been suggested, for example, that Clostridium botulinum may grow better in a vacuum-packaged product than in one that is packaged without vacuum. To evaluate this possibility, sliced bologna was inoculated with spores of C. botulinum <b>type</b> <b>A,</b> <b>packaged</b> in transparent plastic film with and without vacuum, and stored at temperatures within the growth range of the organism. There was no detectable difference in the rate of toxin development in the two types of packages. In contrast, vacuum packaging markedly inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus on sliced ham. The results indicate that vacuum packaging has little if any effect on the ability of C. botulinum to grow in cured meats, but it may reduce the likelihood of staphylococcal food poisoning...|$|R
40|$|After {{emphasizing}} {{the importance of}} the packaging tests in ensuring that the requisite safety features built into the design of packages comply with the Romanian Nuclear Regulatory Body-National Commission for Nuclear Activities Control (NCNAC) requirements and to IAEAâ€™s Regulations [1, 2, 8], the paper presents the type and production testing for <b>type</b> <b>A</b> <b>packages</b> (containers) which have been developed within Institute for Nuclear Research (INR) Pitesti [2].

40|$|Low-carbon steel, {{radioactive}} waste containers (55 -gallon drums) are experiencing degradation due to moisture and temperature fluctuations. With {{thousands of these}} containers currently in use; drum refurbishment becomes a significant issue for the taxpayer and stockholders. This drum refurbishment is a non-intrusive, portable process costing between 1 / 2 and 1 / 25 the cost of repackaging, depending on the severity of degradation. At the INEL alone, {{there are an estimated}} 9, 000 drums earmarked for repackaging. Refurbishing drums rather than repackaging can save up to $ 45, 000, 000 at the INEL. Based on current but ever changing WIPP Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC), this drum refurbishment process will restore drums to a WIPP acceptable condition plus; drums with up to 40 % thinning o the wall can be refurbished to meet performance test requirements for DOT 7 A <b>Type</b> <b>A</b> <b>packaging.</b> A refurbished drum provides a tough, corrosion resistant, waterproof container with longer storage life and an additional containment barrier. Drums are coated with a high-pressure spray copolymer material approximately. 045 inches thick. Increase in internal drum temperature can be held to less than 15 F. Application can be performed hands-on or the equipment is readily adaptable and controllable for remote operations. The material dries to touch in seconds, is fully cured in 48 hours and has a service temperature of {minus} 60 to 500 F. Drums can be coated with little or no surface preparation. This research was performed on drums however research results indicate the coating is very versatile and compatible with most any material and geometry. It could be used to provide abrasion resistance, corrosion protection and waterproofing to almost anything...|$|E
40|$|In {{a coordinated}} effort, the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{proposed}} {{the elimination of}} the Specification Packaging from 49 CFR 173. [1] In accordance with the Federal Register, issued on October 1, 2004, new fabrication of Specification Packages would no longer be authorized. In accordance with the NRC final rulemaking published January 26, 2004, Specification Packagings are mandated by law to be removed from service no later than October 1, 2008. This coordinated effort and resulting rulemaking initiated a planned phase out of Specification Type B and Type A fissile (F) material transportation packages within the Department of Energy (DOE) and its subcontractors. One of the Specification Packages affected by this regulatory change is the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package, per DOT 49 CFR 173. 417 (a) (6). To maintain continuing shipments of DOE materials currently transported in UN 1 A 2 Specification Package after the existing authorization expires, a replacement Type A(F) material packaging design is under development by the Savannah River National Laboratory. This paper presents a summary of the prototype design effort and testing of the new Type A(F) Package development for the DOE. This paper discusses the progress made {{in the development of a}} Type A Fissile Packaging to replace the expiring 49 CFR UN 1 A 2 Specification Fissile Package. The Specification Package was mostly a single-use waste disposal container. The design requirements and authorized radioactive material contents of the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package were defined in 49 CFR. A UN 1 A 2 Specification Package was authorized to ship up to 350 grams of U- 235 in any enrichment and in any non-pyrophoric form. The design was specified as a 55 -gallon 1 A 2 drum overpack with a body constructed from 18 gauge steel with a 16 gauge drum lid. Drum closure was specified as a standard 12 -gauge ring closure. The inner product container size was not specified but was listed as any container that met Specification 7 A requirements per 49 CFR 178. 350. Specification 7 A containers were required to withstand <b>Type</b> <b>A</b> <b>packaging</b> tests required by 49 CFR 173. 465 with compliance demonstrated through testing, analysis or similarity to other containers. The maximum weight of the 7 A product container, the radioactive content, and any internal packaging was limited to 200 lbs. The total gross weight for the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package was limited to 350 lbs. No additional restrictions were applied. Authorization for use did not require the UN 1 A 2 Specification Package to be tested to the Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT) and Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) required for performance based, Type A(F) packages certified by the NRC or DOE. The Type A(F) Packaging design discussed in this paper is required to be in compliance with the regulatory safety requirements defined in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 10 CFR 71. 41 through 71. 47 and 10 CFR 71. 71. Sub-criticality of content must be maintained under the Hypothetical Accident Conditions specified under 10 CFR 71. 73. These federal regulations, and other applicable DOE Orders and Guides, govern design requirements for a Type A(F) package. Type A(F) packages with less than an A 2 quantity of radioactive material are not required to have a leak testable boundary. With this exception a Type A(F) package design is subject to the same test requirements set forth for the design of a performance based Type B packaging...|$|E
40|$|Packages for the {{transportation}} of radioactive material must meet performance criteria to assure safety and environmental protection. The stringency {{of the performance}} criteria {{is based on the}} degree of hazard of the material being transported. Type B packages are used for transporting large quantities of radioisotopes (in terms of A{sub 2 } quantities). These packages have the most stringent performance criteria. Material with less than an A{sub 2 } quantity are transported in <b>Type</b> <b>A</b> <b>packages.</b> These packages have less stringent performance criteria. Transportation of LSA and SCO materials must be in {open_quotes}strong-tight{close_quotes} packages. The performance requirements for the latter packages are even less stringent. All of these <b>package</b> <b>types</b> provide <b>a</b> high level of safety for the material being transported. In this paper, regulatory tests that are used to demonstrate this safety will be described. The responses of various packages to these tests will be shown. In addition, the response of packages to extra-regulatory tests will be discussed. The results of these tests will be used to demonstrate the high level of safety provided to workers, the public, and the environment by packages used for {{the transportation}} of radioactive material...|$|R
