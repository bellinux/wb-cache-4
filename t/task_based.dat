Each warehouse associate is assigned a specific <b>task</b> <b>based</b> on their area of expertise (order selection - carousel/Pick To Light, transportation - conveyors, etc.). As each operator completes their individual assignment, the supervisor (WCS) assigns the next <b>task</b> <b>based</b> on the current workload.
