5000|$|Null modem is a {{communication}} method to directly connect two DTEs (computer, <b>terminal,</b> <b>printer,</b> etc.) using an RS-232 serial cable. The name {{stems from the}} historical use of RS-232 cables to connect two teleprinter devices to two modems in order to communicate with one another; null modem communication refers to using a crossed-over RS-232 cable to connect the teleprinters directly to one another without the modems.|$|E

It represents 128 characters with seven-bit binary numbers - that is, as a string of seven 1s and 0s (bits). In ASCII, a lowercase [...] "a" [...] is always 1100001, an uppercase [...] "A" [...] always 1000001, and so on.

ASCII art is also used within the source code of computer programs for representation of company or product logos, and flow control or other diagrams.

50|$|Each {{partition}} in turn {{would handle}} up to 10 I/O devices, depending on the partition type. For devices such as <b>terminals,</b> <b>printers,</b> card readers and punches, a 'Multi-Terminal IOC (input-output channel) was installed, which ran at about 20 Kbps. The partition would respond to CPU I/O instructions to retrieve and transfer data in bursts from terminal devices to main memory, there were no small or single character transfers of data to reduce the demand {{for access to the}} processor memory. The processor would cycle through each partition in turn, bypassing those that had an I/O instruction in progress, and executing instructions in the others until either a new I/O was posted or 16.7ms (20ms in Europe) had elapsed and a successful branch instruction was encountered. Theoretically it was possible to 'hog' the processor if a successful branch or I/O instruction was never encountered.|$|R
