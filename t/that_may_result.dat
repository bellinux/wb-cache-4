5|$|Armillaria gallica may {{itself be}} parasitized by other soil flora. Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about {{one week after the}} initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>result</b> are due to the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E
5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>result</b> from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen narcosis and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} quinine in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>result</b> from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E

The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the landlord was still largely free from being sued.|$|E
