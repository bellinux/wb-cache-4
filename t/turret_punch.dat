50|$|A <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> or turret {{press is}} a type of punch press used for metal forming by punching.|$|E
50|$|Punching, {{and press}} work in general, {{is a process}} well suited to mass production. However the initial tooling costs, of both the machine and the job-specific press tool, are high. This limits punch work from being used for much small-volume and {{prototype}} work. A <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> {{is one way of}} addressing this cost. The tooling of a <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> uses a large number of standard punch tools: holes of varying sizes, straight edges, commonly-used notches or mounting holes. By using a large number of strokes, with several different tools in turn, a turret press may make a wide variety of parts without having to first make a specialised press tool for that task. This saves both time and money, allowing rapid prototyping or for low volume production to start without tooling delays.|$|E
50|$|As each tool in a turret {{press is}} {{relatively}} small, the press requires little power {{compared to a}} press manufacturing similar parts with a single press stroke. This allows the tool to be lighter and sometimes cheaper, although this is offset by the increased complexity of the turret and sheet positioning. Turret punches can operate faster per stroke than a heavier tool press, although of course many strokes are required. A <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> can achieve 600 strokes per minute.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>turret</b> <b>punches</b> are CNC-controlled, with {{automatic}} {{positioning of the}} metal sheet beneath the tool and programmed selection of particular tools. A CAM process first converts the CAD design for the finished item into the number of individual punch operations needed, depending on the tools available in the turret.|$|R
50|$|Dalsin {{specializes in}} {{precision}} sheet metal contract manufacturing. They most often create products for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), companies which produce consumer products, which the OEM doesn't {{have the capacity}} or capability to produce. They help design and produce these products in both of their production facilities. The most important tools they use are robotic welding, panel bending, <b>turret</b> <b>punching,</b> laser cutting, and press brake forming..|$|R
50|$|Manual <b>turret</b> <b>punches</b> {{have also}} been used. These are C frame presses, usually with a rack-actuated ram. There is no CNC, for either sheet {{positioning}} or tool changing. Using such a manual press requires great familiarity, as the correct tool must be selected from the turret each time {{for every one of}} the many press operations performed. Such manual presses are rarely found, but they have their place in labour-intensive tasks such as hand-worked sheetmetal shops, making such products as custom car bodywork. They are often used in conjunction with other highly skilled artisan processes such as an English wheel.|$|R
50|$|A {{servo drive}} <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press uses twin AC servo drives {{directly}} coupled to the drive shaft. This drive system combines {{the simplicity of}} the original clutch and brake technology with the speed of a hydraulic ram driven system. This results in high performance, reliability, and lower operating costs. A servo drive press system has no complex hydraulics or oil-cooling chillers, thus reducing maintenance and repair costs. A turret press can be equipped with advanced technology that stores and reuses energy generated during ram deceleration, providing extended electrical power savings.|$|E
50|$|Most punch presses are {{mechanically}} operated, {{but simple}} punches are often hand-powered. Major components of this mechanical press are the frame, motor, ram, die posts, bolster, and bed. The punch is mounted into the ram, and the die is mounted to the bolster plate. The scrap material drops through as the workpiece is advanced {{for the next}} hole. A large computer-controlled punch press is called a CNC <b>turret</b> <b>punch.</b> It houses punches and their corresponding dies in a revolving indexed turret. These machines use hydraulic as well as pneumatic power to press the shape with enough force to shear the metal.|$|E
5000|$|A typical CNC <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> has {{a choice}} of up to 60 tools in a [...] "turret" [...] that can be rotated to bring any tool to the {{punching}} position. A simple shape (e.g. a square, circle, or hexagon) is cut directly from the sheet. A complex shape can be cut out by making many square or rounded cuts around the perimeter. A punch is less flexible than a laser for cutting compound shapes, but faster for repetitive shapes (for example, the grille of an air-conditioning unit). A CNC punch can achieve 600 strokes per minute.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turret</b> type <b>punch</b> press {{machines}} have a {{table or}} bed with brushes or rollers {{to allow the}} sheet metal workpiece to traverse with low friction. Brushes are used where scratches on the workpiece must be minimized, as with brushed aluminium or high polished materials.|$|R
50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} tablet presses: single-punch and rotary tablet presses. Most high speed tablet presses {{take the form}} of a {{rotating}} turret that holds any number of punches. As they rotate around the <b>turret,</b> the <b>punches</b> come into contact with cams which control the punch's vertical position. Punches and dies are usually custom made for each application, and can be made in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and can be customized with manufacturer codes and scoring lines to make tablets easier to break. Depending on tablet size, shape, material, and press configuration, a typical modern press can produce from 250,000 to over 1,000,000 tablets an hour.|$|R
5000|$|A typical CNC <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> has {{a choice}} of up to 60 tools in a [...] "turret" [...] that can be rotated to bring any tool to the {{punching}} position. A simple shape (e.g., a square, circle, or hexagon) is cut directly from the sheet. A complex shape can be cut out by making many square or rounded cuts around the perimeter. As a press tool requires a matching punch and die set, there are two corresponding turrets, {{above and below the}} bed, for punch and die. These two turrets must rotate in precise synchronisation and with their alignment carefully maintained. Several punches of identical shape may be used in the turret, each one turned to a different angle, as there is usually no feature to rotate the sheet workpiece relative to the tool.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the information required {{to describe the}} machine and device resources in the <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press environment which are needed {{for the development of}} the analysing method for automated production. The description of product and device resources and their interconnectedness is the starting point for method comparison the development of expenses, production planning and the performance of optimisation. The manufacturing method cannot be optimized unless the variables and their interdependence are known. Sheet metal parts in particular may then become remarkably complex, and their automatic manufacture may be difficult or, with some automatic equipment, even impossible if not know manufacturing properties. This thesis consists of three main elements, which constitute the triangulation. In the first phase of triangulation, the manufacture occuring on a <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press is examined in order to find the factors that affect the efficiency of production. In the second phase of triangulation, the manufacturability of products on <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> presses is examined through a set of laboratory tests. The third phase oftriangulation involves an examination of five industry parts. The main key findings of this study are: all possible efficiency in high automation level machining cannot be achieved unless the raw materials used in production and the dependencies of the machine and tools are well known. Machine-specific manufacturability factors for <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> presses were not taken into account in the industrial case samples. On the grounds of the performed tests and industrial case samples, the designer of a sheet metal product can directly influence the machining time, material loss, energy consumption and the number of tools required on a <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press by making decisions in the way presented in the hypothesis of thisstudy. The sheet metal parts to be produced can be optimised to bemanufactured on a <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press when the material to be used and the kinds of machine and tool options available are known. This provides in-depth knowledge of the machine and tool properties machine and tool-specifically. None of the optimisation starting points described here is a separate entity; instead, they are all connected to each other...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of servo direct drive <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press is presented. A {{servomotor}} to drive the eccentric-toggle mechanism is used in our design, which combines the advantages of mechanical and hydraulic <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the punch are calculated, through the kinematics analysis. So, {{the motion of the}} punch is controllable through the rotation of the servomotor. Then, the inverse kinematics analysis is studied in detail, and the corresponding motion of the servomotor can be gotten, for different punch motion curves, according to the production requirement. For example, when we design a motion of the punch for a particular stamping process, the motion of servomotor can be obtained through the inverse kinematics analysis. Finally, Output force is acquired by static force analysis, which decides the working capability of the mechanism...|$|E

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} {{fabrication}} using an NCT (numerically controlled <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> press) machine, automatic tool selection {{is a major}} problem to be solved to improve its production performance. However, this operation has been done either manually or semi-automatically by human experts. In this paper, we have introduced the shape-index-set to handle the shape of sheet metal parts and developed an algorithm through which one can find the successive matching curves between two curve lists, one from the punching tool and the other from the boundaries of the sheet metal part. The algorithm is used to select the tools automatically to punch out the boundaries of sheet metal parts. Several experiments are presented to prove the successful tool selection. ...|$|E

40|$|Lithium battery {{has been}} widely used as the main driving force of the new energy vehicle in recent years. Sheet metal parts are formed by means of {{pressure}} forming techniques with the characteristics of light weight, small size and high structural strength. The sheet metal forming has higher productivity and material utilization than the mechanical cutting, therefore sheet metal parts are widely used in many fields, such as modern automotive industry, aviation, aerospace, machine tools, instruments and household appliances. In this paper, taking a complex lithium battery box as an example, the integrated manufacturing of sheet metal parts is studied, and the digital integrated design and manufacturing process system is proposed.

40|$|With the {{development}} of aircraft model technology, quadcopters equipped with cameras are more frequently used for aerial video. Cell phones, moreover, allow people to share photos online immediately, so many people prefer to take photos or videos by cell phones instead of expensive cameras. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} project is to design and build a light weight quadcopter frame and select the system components that allow the quadcopter to fly smoothly while carrying a cell phone for aerial video. The method for creating the quadcopter is separated into three steps: design, build, and test. The design part includes frame design on the SolidWorks and Thrust/Weight ratio calculation with a safety factor of 1. 0 to 1. 5. The build consists of a center plate made of carbon fiber plate. Aluminum sheet metal arms are formed into a U-shape and attached to the plate. A drill press, treadle shear, and manual <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> are used during the building process. The remaining parts, such as cellphone carrier, battery, motors, speed controller, and control board were purchased after the analysis. The frame and electric parts were assembled with screws, nuts, and glue. During the testing section, two different propellers are tested to determine which size and type provide maximum thrust with the least battery consumption. Additional testing will evaluate stability of flight and payload capacity...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Manufacturers are {{increasingly}} looking {{at ways to}} reduce operating costs through energy savings. While {{research has been done}} to identify energy usage throughout a facility [...] such as lighting, computers, heating and cooling [...] very little research has been done on reducing the energy consumption of manufacturing equipment. Sample literature review shows the bulk of research on equipment is for tip energy, the energy when a tool makes contact with a work piece. This excludes the energy of all the machine’s background processes: motors, pumps, fans, etc. Several models have been created to predict the energy usage of a machine including both the tip energy and the energy of the background processes; however, these models are experimental laboratory studies. The purpose of this thesis is to collect and analyze real-time data of manufacturing equipment in a production setting. Real-time data is important to understand energy consumption at the machine level and the product level. This thesis reports on a method to collect and analyze real-time manufacturing equipment energy data for a simple part. It also reports on the use of that data to validate the uplci method to estimate the energy consumed for a part using three uplci’s: <b>turret</b> <b>punch</b> uplci, brake forming uplci and drilling uplci. A data logger recorder was connected to each machine to record the energy usage as it produced parts. This data was then broken down into energy modes and analyzed. The results for each machine showed how the machine utilized energy as it produced parts. The real-time data did not validate the uplci calculations; however, the method to collect the real-time data was proven and shown to be easily repeatable by manufacturers. This research provides a solid method for manufacturers to use to identify areas to reduce their energy costs through improved production scheduling and CNC programming...|$|E
