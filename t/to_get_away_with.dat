5|$|Seltzer {{defended the}} Cleveland Press {{and his own}} {{personal}} involvement in the case in his 1956 memoir The Years Were Good. Seltzer argued that he was convinced the Sheppard family {{was involved in a}} conspiracy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> murder and that he personally wrote the editorials, instead of passing them off to one of his employees, out of concern for the safety of his staff.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests {{it was the right thing}} to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the shooting.|$|E

2500|$|On March 11, final {{arguments}} from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding {{on the following}} day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims—Voorhees and Donnelly—as [...] "living dead". Referring to Gacy as the [...] "worst of all murderers", Sullivan stated: [...] "John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it all." ...|$|R
25|$|With his {{infantry}} defeated, his cavalry {{off to one}} flank and his men outnumbered, Suchet {{found himself}} in a difficult spot. Murray proved slow to take advantage of his success, however, and the French were able to retreat almost unmolested. Suchet's rearguard ably defended the pass of Biar and allowed the French <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> little additional loss.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{serving as}} Prime Minister, U Nu {{was also an}} {{accomplished}} novelist and playwright. In a work from the colonial period titled Yesset pabeikwe or It's So Cruel (Man, the Wolf of Man) U Nu describes how {{during the colonial period}} rich landlords were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> just about any crime they wished to perpetrate.|$|E
25|$|General Lovell {{tried to}} reduce command {{confusion}} by ordering that all vessels afloat should likewise take orders from Commander Mitchell. However, Captain John A. Stephenson, leading the River Defense Fleet, {{refused to accept}} Navy orders. He was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> this act of seeming mutiny because the relation of his fleet to the Army was contractual rather than military.|$|E

25|$|Eden {{believed}} that if Nasser were seen <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> seizing the Canal then Egypt and other Arab countries might move closer to the Soviet Union. At that time, the Middle East accounted for 80–90 percent of Western Europe's oil supply. If Nasser were seen <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it, then other Middle East countries might be encouraged to nationalise their oil. The invasion, he contended at the time, and again in a 1967 interview, was aimed at maintaining the sanctity of international agreements and at preventing future unilateral denunciation of treaties. Eden was energetic during the crisis in using the media, including the BBC, to incite public opinion to support his views {{of the need to}} overthrow Nasser. In September 1956 a plan was drawn up to reduce the flow of water in the Nile by using dams in an attempt to damage Nasser's position. However, the plan was abandoned because it would take months to implement, and due to fears that it could affect other countries such as Uganda and Kenya.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Massow was a {{significant}} part of Derren Brown's The Great Art Robbery for Channel 4, in which Brown taught a group of old age pensioners how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> a robbery using various techniques such as how to stay unnoticed as well as controlling fear and nerves. The OAPs then embarked on a large-scale robbery, which involved stealing an expensive painting from Massow. The show first aired on Friday 13 December.|$|E

2500|$|On September 12, 2006 Papa Roach {{released}} {{their fourth}} album The Paramour Sessions. The band named the title after the recording location, the Paramour Mansion.

60|$|About {{two miles}} from the village, the road on which Harry was riding forked, and not knowing that the party which had started off in that {{direction}} had taken the road which ran to the northeast, as being the direction in which a man would probably go, if he wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> safely <b>with</b> five stolen horses, Harry kept straight on.|$|R

25|$|The {{confined}} {{gender roles}} for females allow {{the strength of}} characters such as Grace and Blanche to remain hidden. They're manipulation, sneaking, and hiding from the law is only successful because they are women. Both are believed by the other characters in the novel to be too submissive, shallow, and dim-witted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> their goals. Blanche soon discovers that she can unravel more of Grace and Everett's treacherous plot to inherit Mumsfield's money because {{she is in the}} house, whereas Nate, as a man, is working outside. The biggest twist, that Grace is the mass murderer and plotter of cheating her family out of their fortune, exposes the sexist notions that the readers themselves have rooted into their culture. Throughout the plot, Everett seems to be the most likely suspect to the murders and manipulation of the will, all the while making it easier for Grace <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> mass murdering anyone in her path. Even though, the heroine and the villain of this novel evoke different emotions from the readers, there is a larger feminist theme in play that is made possible by taking advantage of the cloak of invisibility that society has placed over women.|$|E

25|$|As already mentioned, dwarfs {{were allowed}} to have several high ranked jobs and could move up the ranks during their career. Old Kingdom reliefs depict dwarfs {{performing}} mainly easy, rather creative jobs, because their shortened and fragile stature did not allow for hard or dangerous physical work. Unsurprisingly then dwarfs mainly worked as jewelers, tailors, cup-bearers and even as zookeepers. As at other periods, dwarfs were particularly valued as treasurers or jewellers, as their very distinctive appearance would make any dishonest dealings on their part that much more difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{evening the}} Polish Lancers of the Guard fought their way as far west as Viels-Maisons. Sacken was nearly trapped, but Yorck's effort gave the Russians enough {{time and space}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away.</b> <b>With</b> Vasilshikov's cavalry {{covering}} the withdrawal, the Russians headed for the Château-Thierry road as it rained. The Russian retreat through marshes and woods was guided by a line of bonfires.

After an all-night march, Sacken's troops reached Viffort {{on the main road}} and continued marching northward toward Château-Thierry.|$|E

25|$|At Vimeiro, Junot {{sent the}} 3rd Dragoons {{with one of}} his {{flanking}} brigades, leaving Margaron with three cavalry regiments. After his first three frontal attacks failed, Junot sent Kellermann with his grenadier reserve to strike at Vimeiro village. After a hand-to-hand struggle, the grenadiers were beaten and Margaron sent one regiment to cover their retreat. At this moment, 240 troopers of the British 20th Light Dragoons charged, broke through the French cavalry and began cutting down the grenadiers. Excited by their success, the British horsemen got out of control and pressed their charge too far. When Margaron unleashed his last two regiments, the light dragoons were lucky <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> only 21 killed, including Colonel Taylor, 24 wounded and 11 captured.|$|E
50|$|The {{shocking}} incident {{makes its}} way to the press and becomes a matter of hot debate in the city. Two judges, Mr. Jha and Mr. Savalkar (Iftekhar in a guest appearance), discuss the case.
