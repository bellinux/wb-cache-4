5|$|After the cadence, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{punctuated by}} a second {{rendition}} of the four-bar orchestral ritornello. This time the oboes play the semiquaver motif, the alto recorders play the pair of detached quavers on the beat and the upper strings those off the beat. This leads into the second fugato episode in the key of C minor.|$|E
5|$|The finale {{completes the}} {{interconnectedness}} {{of the work}} with a theme audibly {{similar to those of}} the first movement and the minuet and trio. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the most economical of all: the exposition and development commence with nearly identical passages and conclude in exactly the same way.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> also {{owner of}} reading rooms, but no worship is celebrated in these places. As of 2011, Antoinism counts 64 temples: 32 in Belgium, 31 in France and 1 in the Principality of Monaco. It has also opened reading rooms in Belgium, Metropolitan France, Réunion, Guadeloupe, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Congo and Luxembourg. A reading room in Egypt was quickly closed in November 1913.|$|E
50|$|The {{intent of}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> to obtain public support (money and votes) to elect officeholders who would repeal these liberal statutes. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. In retrospect, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> part of <b>the</b> ongoing culture war.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> an {{evolution}} of Omega's 27 CHRO range and formed {{part of the}} wider 861 family of watches, developed from the 320 and 321 series. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> manual wind with date.|$|R

5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, and proceeds to play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{the first of a}} number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, which calls for two beats per bar rather than four, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is,</b> in his view, too fast.|$|E
5|$|Miley: <b>The</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>is</b> a 2013 {{documentary}} {{television film}} about American entertainer Miley Cyrus, following {{her return to}} the music industry in the lead-up to her fourth studio album Bangerz (2013). It premiered on October 2, 2013, on MTV, shortly before the release of her record, for which the documentary served as a promotional tool. The documentary depicts Cyrus finalizing details regarding its launch, making public appearances for additional promotion, and rehearsing for her controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Åkerblom <b>Movement</b> <b>was</b> {{an evangelical}} <b>movement</b> often {{described}} as a sect active in Finland in the late 1910s and early 1920s. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> most active in Swedish speaking Ostrobothnia, but it attracted people also {{in the south of}} Finland. The leader of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> young girl Maria Åkerblom from the village of Snappertuna in Uusimaa.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>was</b> {{founded by}} former Israel Defense Forces officer and Middle Eastern studies {{lecturer}} Gershon Salomon. Members of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> {{referred to as}} the [...] "Temple Mount Faithful." [...] The group was established in 1967.|$|R
50|$|The {{first great}} {{promoters}} of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>were</b> Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan {{who were not}} only great writers but also great theorists, providing the foundation of <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b> Both <b>were</b> enthusiastic to promote <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> and <b>were</b> keen to teach young people so <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> could develop.|$|R
5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The section {{addressing}} God as Father and Son {{is again}} a duet, {{this time of}} soprano I and tenor. The voices are often in canon and in parallel, as in the Christe. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> likely another parody, possibly from the 1729 cantata Ihr Häuser des Himmels, BWV 193a. As the Christe, it is a love-duet addressing Jesus. Both duets appear {{as the center of}} the symmetry within the respective part, Kyrie and Gloria. Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that the voices pick up.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, PT Angkasa Pura I had airport {{capacities}} of 30,700,440 people, but <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> 49,237,437 passengers. Over capacities also occurred for PT Angkasa Pura II with {{capacities of}} 30,815,000 people, but <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> 62,215,834 passengers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1936 by {{former members of}} HaNoar HaTzioni, and its first settlement, kibbutz Usha, was founded on 7 November 1937. In 1948 <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> one of <b>the</b> factions that established the Progressive Party.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} {{effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of the Federation of Slavic Sokols (<b>the</b> Sokol <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> highly supportive of Neo-Slavism).|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> cast in ternary form (ABA) with {{a literal}} repeat and terse {{extension}} (coda).|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a scherzo in through-composed ternary form (ABA). A scurrying coda leads {{without a}} {{break into the}} next movement.|$|E
25|$|There {{are only}} a few symbols for finger movement. They may be doubled to show that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> repeated.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Tanka <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> {{a militant}} agrarian {{struggle}} {{on behalf of}} the Hajong tribal people in Mymensingh District, East Bengal (initially in India, later East Pakistan) 1942-1950. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> parallel, but distinct from, <b>the</b> Tebhaga <b>movement</b> in other parts of Bengal. <b>The</b> Hajong <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> inspired by <b>the</b> struggles of Moni Singh.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Berlin <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> an anti-Semitic {{intellectual}} and political <b>movement</b> in <b>the</b> German Empire in <b>the</b> 1880s. <b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> {{a collection of}} unassociated individuals and organizations.|$|R

25|$|The Charismatic {{movement}} {{is the international}} trend of historically mainstream congregations adopting beliefs and practices similar to Pentecostals. Fundamental to <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the use of spiritual gifts. Among Protestants, the movement began around 1960.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{primarily}} {{associated with}} painting, Duane Hanson and John DeAndrea are sculptors associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average {{people that were}} complete with simulated hair and real clothes. They are called Verists.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in two {{distinct}} parts. Its two sections {{consist of a}} nearly static Largo consisting of a sequence of block chords, with elegiac lines adding a touch of melancholy, and a more flowing, gloomy Andante that introduces the Promenade theme into the scene.|$|E
5000|$|In most of Beethoven's four-movement sonatas, <b>the</b> third <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in [...] and in ternary form, while <b>the</b> second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{slow and}} in a {{different}} key from <b>the</b> other <b>movements.</b> In this sonata, {{the second and third}} movements have switched roles, where <b>the</b> second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ternary scherzo and trio, while <b>the</b> third <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> slow <b>movement</b> in <b>the</b> tonic minor.|$|R
50|$|Many popular {{representations}} of <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>are</b> centered on <b>the</b> leadership and philosophy of Martin Luther King, Jr., {{who won the}} 1964 Nobel Peace Prize {{for his role in}} <b>the</b> <b>movement.</b> But, some scholars note that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> too diverse to be credited to one person, organization, or strategy.|$|R
50|$|In 1922 <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> banned.|$|R
25|$|International activists {{involved}} in the Occupy Movement have seen it stall due a lack of synergy {{to work with other}} alternative movements calling for change. The biggest criticism is that <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> without depth, without a lasting vision of an alternative future.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Movement</b> <b>is</b> independent. The National Societies, while {{auxiliaries}} in {{the humanitarian}} services of their governments {{and subject to}} the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to}} number between 40,000 and 200,000 adherents. In 2005 the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs {{reported}} {{that up to}} one million Jews attend Chabad services {{at least once a}} year. In 2013, Chabad forecast that their Chanukah activities would reach up to 8,000,000 Jews in 80 countries worldwide.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> {{most famous}} for its child preachers. These child preachers {{numbered}} around ten. At its largest, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> had around one hundred members, but its societies all over Finland gathered large crowds, even over one thousand. As well as the child preachers, <b>the</b> <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> known for Tilda Reunanen's spirited sermons.|$|R
50|$|The piece follows {{standard}} concerto form. <b>The</b> first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> brisk and in sonata form, <b>the</b> second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow, and <b>the</b> third <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> fast. <b>The</b> {{length of}} the concerto is approximately 29 minutes.|$|R
