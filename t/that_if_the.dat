5|$|Hill {{also argued}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Electoral Act {{actually}} appeared to confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as {{the determination of}} disputes about election results is a non-judicial function.

5|$|In November 2009 Altadhaug Municipality cut {{the budgets}} of youth organisations by an {{estimated}} NOK 400,000. Steinholt opposed this, saying <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> wages {{of the mayor}} and several other high-ranking politicians had been cut, the municipality could have saved NOK 487,000. In the 2009 parliamentary election Steinholt received 1,829 votes, again as Red Nordland's leading candidate.|$|E

5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They found <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically {{again in the}} air to produce forward thrust if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E

5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|A. Although the Montreal Victorias won the AHAC {{title in}} 1895, the Stanley Cup {{trustees}} had already accepted a challenge from the 1894 Cup champion Montreal HC and Queen's University.

The Montreals eventually won the game, 5–1, and their crosstown rivals were awarded the Cup.|$|E

Brian was unwilling to fight on Good Friday, as he would not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the battle to the Friday, which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E

5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition.

However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.|$|E
5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} is <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> interest is retained by the lender {{from the outset}} of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
