5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} for the right sector of the divisional defence, this meant that the 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 French agents {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> planning {{to mount an}} offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk {{in the ground and}} served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.|$|E

5|$|Hindered by total Allied {{air superiority}} and a {{large-scale}} uprising by the French Resistance, the weak German forces were swiftly defeated. The Germans decided to withdraw towards the north through the Rhône valley, {{to establish a}} stable defense line at Dijon. Allied mobile units were able to overtake the Germans and partially block their route at the town of Montélimar. The ensuing battle led to a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a decisive breakthrough, until <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> finally able to complete their withdrawal and retreat from the town. While <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> retreating, the French managed to capture the important ports of Marseille and Toulon, putting them into operation soon after.|$|E
5|$|The French 1st Army {{had also}} taken a {{battering}} and despite winning several tactical defensive victories it {{was forced to}} retreat on 15 May owing to developments elsewhere, leaving its tanks on the battlefield, while <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> free to recover theirs.|$|E

5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> reluctant to allocate {{any of their}} wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary.

50|$|The book <b>was</b> {{translated}} into <b>German</b> in 1574, then <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>was</b> revised in 1994, and finally <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>was</b> {{translated into}} English {{under the title}} The Elixirs of Nostradamus (Moyer Bell, 1996).

5|$|By February, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River {{against the advice of}} his officers.

5|$|By dawn on 20 April 1941, <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> {{well aware}} that British and Allied forces had begun {{preliminary}} withdrawal operations from ports in southern Greece.

5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|France {{was willing}} to commit to a launch aid, or subsidies, while <b>the</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> more cautious. The UK {{government}} was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by British Aerospace (BAe) and estimated at ₤250million, it was postponed for three years. On 1 March 1984 {{the government and the}} manufacturer agreed that ₤50million would be paid whether the A320 would fly or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the war, a British {{blockade}} on shipments to Germany affected the Reich economy. <b>The</b> <b>Germans</b> <b>were</b> particularly dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered an attack on Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April.
