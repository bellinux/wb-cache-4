5|$|After {{five minutes}} on the final morning, Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller, which would help {{to break up the}} wicket, thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely to spin. The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>and</b> the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers. However, Morris partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win, although they were helped by England’s fielders, who missed several catching and stumping chances. Harvey came to the crease at 3/396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>and</b> einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{tracking}} facilitation effect during categorical distinction between <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors in <b>the</b> Multiple Identity Tracking (MIT) task. We asked observers to track 4 targets {{in a total}} of 8 moving objects, and manipulated categorical distinctions of <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors across four experiments, with different combinations of inter-category and intra-category differences. Results show that tracking performance was significantly better when <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors were inter-category different, compared to when <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors were identical or intra-category distinctive. As the inter-category distinction between <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> distractors narrowed, tracking performance improved, but the inter-category facilitation effect decreased. These results may indicate a category-based grouping effect: the observers organized <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> within <b>the</b> same semantic category into one group <b>and</b> made <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> more easily <b>and</b> accurately rediscovered when lost during tracking. Furthermore, the tracking facilitation of categorical distinction diminished when all the objects were inverted. This proved that besides their visual distinctiveness, objects’ semantic category information also played an important role during tracking...|$|R

5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins {{her in the}} shower, the two have sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond {{that it is not}} too late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him to use it as his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with an antique percussion cap pistol. Bond misses <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>and</b> Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E
5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>and</b> causing more damage.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{aiming at}} the problem of UAV path {{planning}} for multiple moving <b>targets,</b> after <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> are determined, radar is used to observe <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> <b>and</b> obtain their observation positions.

5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>and</b> the detector, and producing larger {{amounts of the}} increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{went on to}} play {{a two-day}} match for the RAAF against Lancashire, where his 52 was the only fifty in a low-scoring game. He also took match figures of 2/28. After scoring 30 in an innings victory over Learie Constantine's XI, Miller {{represented}} the RAAF against the RAF at Lord's where he top-scored with 63 in 90 minutes. The Second Victory Test was played at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, where the grandstands were damaged by German air raids. Hassett sent the Englishmen into bat. Miller went wicketless. He was run {{out in the first}} innings for 17. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fast and hostile spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton in the arm before hitting Cyril Washbrook in the head, provoking an angry crowd reaction, comparing Miller to the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood. He later removed Washbrook and ended with 2/28. His efforts led to calls for him to start taking his bowling seriously, instead of simply jogging in releasing the ball, especially from former South African representative Bob Crisp. Despite this, Miller fell for eight in the second innings and Australia fell 41 runs short of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>and</b> series was squared.|$|E
5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are ineffective when the camouflaged animal or object moves, because the motion is easily {{seen by the}} observing predator, prey or enemy. However, insects such as hoverflies and dragonflies use motion camouflage: the hoverflies to approach possible mates, and the dragonflies to approach rivals when defending territories. Motion camouflage is achieved by moving so as to stay on a straight line between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>and</b> a fixed point in the landscape; the pursuer thus appears not to move, but only to loom larger in the target's field of vision. The same technique {{can be used for}} military purposes, for example by missiles to minimise their risk of detection by the enemy. However, missile engineers, and animals such as bats, use the technique primarily for its efficiency rather than camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their background or breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>and</b> some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{participated in}} the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, flying on the Enola Gay as weaponeer and Senior Military Technical Observer. Shortly after takeoff, he clambered into the bomb bay and {{carefully}} carried out the procedure that he had rehearsed the night before. It was Parsons and not Tibbetts, the pilot, {{who was in charge}} of the mission. He approved the choice of Hiroshima as <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>and</b> gave the final approval for the bomb to be released. For his part in the mission, Parsons was awarded the Silver Star, and was promoted to the wartime rank of commodore on 10 August 1945. For his work on the Manhattan Project, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>and</b> either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E
