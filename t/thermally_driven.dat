The conversion of naptha to high octane aromatics requires high energy to initiate and sustain the reaction at temperatures of 850 - 950 oF. Hydrogen - rich off - gases are fired in combinations of process furnaces. Heat is transferred to hydrocarbon fluids by radiation, principally. Feed or return stream temperatures determine the need for convection sections. It is essential that the operation and maintenance of these furnaces be optimized to minimize production costs. This paper describes the performance testing and evaluation of a set of ten refinery furnaces used to <b>thermally</b> <b>drive</b> several reforming reactors and to regenerate catalysts. Firing rates provide an input of 216. 2 x 106 Btu/hr. to the furnaces, at $ 1. 90 per 106 Btu. The units are fitted with multiple natural draft burners. There is insufficient turbulence and swirl in the burners. Operators manually set up the burners with excessive airflows for normal, full-load firing. These furnaces represent production limits. Products of combustion exhaust at high thermal levels - the range is from 985 - 1700 oF. The mixed gases flow through a "waste heat" boiler, or they bypass the boiler and enter a single stack. Steam generation at 150 psig averages 38, 200 lb/hr. Heat is wasted via the bypass at a rate of 41. 1 x 106 Btu /hr. at 1240 oF. When airflows are reduced (to 15 % excess air) the loss will be 18. 7 x 106 Btu/hr. at 1180 oF. Installation of a second, parallel waste heat boiler will result in a saving of l 3. 4 x 106 Btu/hr.

40|$|The coastal Oyashio, flowing southward {{along the}} coast of {{northern}} Japan, {{is an integral part of}} the subpolar circulation in the North Pacific. It shows a clear seasonal variation in current speed with the maximum in spring and minimum in fall. The coastal Oyashio has extended abnormally southward in years when the northwesterly monsoon was extraordinary strong, causing heavy snowfall in northern Japan. Y. SEKINE (J. Oceanogr. Soc. Jpn., 44, 60, 1988) suggested that the abnormally southward extension of the Oyashio could be caused by southward shift of the latitude of null wind stress curl. His numerical experiments showed that the entire subpolar circulation extended southward by the wind effect. Actually, however, southward extension of the Oyashio is observed only in the coastal area. Dataset of the Oyashio water area (T. YOSHIDA; Umi to Sora (Sea and Sky), 68, 79, 1992) has been analyzed together with time series of sea level, air temperature, and sea surface temperature at coastal stations. It has been found that the variation in the Oyashio area is highly correlated with the downstream sea level difference in terms of both the monthly mean and anomaly values, and that the variation in the sea level difference is also highly correlated with the sea surface temperature and air temperature at coastal stations. The sea levels along Japanese coasts are known to be primarily governed by the air pressure and the sea water temperature. Since the air pressure shows very poor correlation with the sea level differences, however, it seems likely that variation in the latter is responsible for the downstream sea level difference. It is well known that the sea water density is poorly dependent on temperature at lower temperatures (especially near the freezing point). This means that in wintertime the height of the sea water column does not drop significantly in the northern ocean while greater falls are observed in the southern ocean. Obviously, this may cause sea surface inclination in the north-south direction. Therefore, we conclude that the north-south sea level difference observed in wintertime is caused by the cold sea surface temperature or by the cold air temperature. This conclusion implies in turn that the coastal Oyashio is <b>driven</b> <b>thermally</b> or <b>driven</b> by the sea surface cooling in wintertime...|$|R
