God knows I had that abuse down pat. But I don’t know that I necessarily felt (or feel) that addiction. And so no, I don’t identify myself as an alcoholic. That identity didn’t feel true to me, so I didn’t write it. I also think the brand 'alcoholic' prevents a lot of people, especially young people, from seeking help or even reevaluating their relationship with alcohol.

5000|$|Despite Nance's quality play (he {{was leading}} the Suns in scoring with 21 points and 10 rebounds per game), Suns {{director}} of personnel, Cotton Fitzsimmons, stated {{the reason for the}} trade. [...] "It's obvious we are not happy with our current record and we are not happy with our record over the last few seasons. We <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of teams about Nance. We felt it (the trade with Cleveland) was the best deal for us in regard to the youth of the players and draft choices involved." [...] On February 25, the 29-year-old Nance, along with Mike Sanders and a 1988 draft first round pick, were sent to Cleveland in exchange for Johnson, Tyrone Corbin, Mark West, 1988 draft first and second round picks, and a 1989 second round pick.

[...] In a January 26, 2006 interview, Kerr acknowledged this had resulted in open antagonism between some in the CIA and the Bush White House, saying, [...] "There have been more leaks and discussions outside what I would consider to be the appropriate level than I've ever seen before. And I think that lack of discipline is a real problem. I don't think an intelligence organization can kind of take up arms against politics, or a policy-maker. I think that will not work, and it won't stand." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{sample item}} on a {{personality}} test, for example, might ask test-takers {{to rate the}} degree to which they agree with the statement [...] "I <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different people at parties" [...] by using a scale of 1 ("strongly disagree") to 5 ("strongly agree"). The most widely used objective test of personality is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) which was originally designed to distinguish individuals with different psychological problems. Since then, it has become popular as a means of attempting to identify personality characteristics of people in many every-day settings.

5000|$|Klay has {{described}} his own deployment in Iraq as [...] "a mild experience" [...] {{where he did}} not see the war itself but only the effects of war second hand. To depict the war, he created a dozen characters, each with a different set of experiences and perspectives. Avoiding cliches and creating [...] "prototypes", he has said, [...] "was something I took very seriously. I did a lot a research, I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Marines, and {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about the subjects. Doing the kind of imaginative work, drafting stories over and over again until I had something that felt emotionally honest, which is also not the same as something that's going to please everyone who’s been through that experience." [...] He said he needed multiples voices because: ...each person has such a small piece of the war, and that piece will be powerfully shaped not only by when they were there and where in Iraq they were, but also by what job they did. So rather than writing a unified novel about the experience of war, I wanted twelve different voices—voices that would approach similar themes but from very different perspectives. I don't think all my narrators would get along with each other. I don't think they'd agree with each other about what the war meant. And part of my intent was that that would open a space for the reader to come in and critically engage with the sorts of claims the narrators are making.... Also, it's just fascinating to me to step into very different heads. What was the war like for a mortuary affairs specialist? For a chaplain? For an artilleryman, who never sees the bodies of the enemy he has killed? He said he had some models in mind of what he did not want to do: [...] "There have been a couple books in the last couple years with almost comical misrepresentations of the military by authors who wanted to talk about Iraq, but clearly didn't want to do the hard work of learning enough about the subject to have something worth saying." [...] Klay included in Redeployment a list of works he read and found valuable in helping to shape his writing. He explained that: ...before writing about a foreign service officer I read a memoir by one who'd served in Iraq, a fairly wonky book about career diplomacy, a lot of Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction reports, and so on. I also read a Czech World War I novel that seemed appropriate to gear me up, in terms of tone, and I talked to Civil Affairs soldiers and Foreign Service Officers, and I read a lot of journalism. Not everything I read was about war. Bernanos's Diary of a Country Priest and Edward P. Jones's The Known World and Nathan Englander's short stories, for example, were all very helpful at different points for different stories.|$|E
40|$|Imagine you’re just {{starting}} in a lab. Your new PI decides to test your mettle at the bench {{with a simple}} project: Replicate some immunohistochemistry results from a recent publication. No problem, right? Not necessarily. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) relies on antibodies, and antibodies, says Anita Bandrowski of the University of California, San Diego, “are extremely messy. ” Unlike many reagents in today’s molecular biology lab, antibodies are far from the turnkey solutions commercial vendors would have you believe. Antibodypedia. com lists 1. 2 million antibodies in its database. Some work in Western blots but not in IHC, others can precipitate protein complexes but come up empty in flow cytometry, and some don’t work at all. More {{than a quarter of}} 246 histone modification antibodies tested in a 2011 study were found to be non-specific; of those that were specific, 22 % were unsuitable for chromatin immunoprecipi-tation (1).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} not {{intended}} to be an indictment of our leaders — well, not entirely, anyway. This thesis is meant to be an exercise in listening. I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people on every side of this issue, and tried hard to listen. I obviously have my biases, but I did my best to understand where everyone was coming from. I tried to evaluate groups instead of individuals as participants in this issue. My interviewees were requested to express views on behalf of the community group to which they belonged. I tried to find the opinions that best defined the majority of each group. Sometimes these came from resolutions, sometimes surveys, and other times analyses of local newspaper letters. In writing this up, I hoped to express the the voices I heard from a common ground. It seems that we 2 ̆ 7 ve let our voices become antagonistic — that we 2 ̆ 7 ve lost the will to embrace new opinions and engage in debate. I hope that people reading this might listen to the voices that are speaking — understand where they come from instead of preparing a rebuttal of their opinions. Consider our own actions and how they affect the situation. Think about whether we’re prepared to let this battle divide our community into the dreamers who get their way and those who don’t — or if we are ready to listen to one another, offer compromises, and do what really benefits this community the most. This thesis is an effort to explore different perspectives on a common issue and document the voices that have been cast aside and ignored. I originally wanted to speak for the Bernard Field Station, because I wasn’t sure how much longer it would be around to speak for itself. But I now realized it is futile. If you are willing to listen, the place speaks for itself [...] . and the story it tells is remarkable...|$|E

25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|R
