5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, {{even when they are}} not the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah {{in the past and}} never asked for anything in return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Meg {{is given}} {{a job at a}} local {{convenience}} store. Meg is extremely happy with her job and she decides to help Chris get a job there, too. Chris immediately becomes friends with the store owner, Carl, and he {{is given a}} large promotion which Carl originally promised to Meg. When Meg takes issue with this, she is fired. Lois, to whom Meg has told of her plight, explains the situation to Chris and tells him <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Meg by getting her job back. Chris is able to do this after bribing Carl by withholding his opinions of movies he and Carl normally discuss until Carl re-hires her. Meg, in turn, rejects working at the store again, as she only had Chris get her job back to see if he would stand up for her.|$|E

5|$|Oskar's classmates {{regularly}} bully him, and {{he spends}} his evenings imagining revenge, collecting clippings from {{newspapers and magazines}} about grisly murders. One night he meets Eli, {{who appears to be}} a pale girl of his age. Eli has recently moved into the next-door apartment with an older man, Håkan. Eli initially informs Oskar that they cannot be friends. Over time, however, they begin to form a close relationship, with Oskar lending his Rubik's Cube to Eli, and the two exchanging Morse code messages through their adjoining wall. Håkan requests that Eli stop seeing Oskar. After questioning Oskar about a cut on his cheek, Eli learns that the boy is being bullied by schoolmates and encourages him <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> himself. This inspires Oskar to enroll for weight-training classes after school.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
5|$|Like many English {{football}} clubs, Aston Villa {{have had}} several hooligan firms associated with them: Villa Youth, Steamers, Villa Hardcore and the C-Crew, the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s. As {{can be seen}} across the whole of English football, the hooligan groups have now been marginalised. In 2004, several Villa firms {{were involved in a}} fight with QPR fans outside Villa Park in which a steward died. The main groupings of supporters can now be found in a number of domestic and international supporters' clubs. This includes the Official Aston Villa Supporters Club which also has many smaller regional and international sections. There were several independent supporters clubs during the reign of Doug Ellis but most of these disbanded after his retirement. The supporter group My Old Man Said formed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Villa supporters' rights, {{as a direct result of}} Villa supporters' protest against the club's appointment of Alex McLeish. The club's supporters also publish fanzines such as Heroes and Villains and The Holy Trinity.|$|E

25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system.

25|$|On 9 January 2010, {{a massive}} brawl {{broke out in}} an Avangard Omsk game against Vityaz Chekhov. The {{conflict}} started during pre-game warm-ups when Darcy Verot intentionally shot a puck at Lasse Kukkonen forcing Alexander Svitov <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> his team-mate. Soon after the game started Brandon Sugden challenged Svitov to another fight, which then involved all other 8 skaters on the ice. A number of other fights ensued resulting in a bench- and penalty-box clearing. The officials had to suspend the game just after 3 minutes 39 seconds {{in the first period}} as there were only four players left to play the game. A world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game. The KHL imposed heavy fines on both teams, some players and the head coaches as well as disqualifying six Vityaz's players and Avangard's Dmitry Vlasenkov, who was first to leave the bench during a fight. The game was counted as a 5-0 defeat for both teams with no points being awarded.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} primary campaign, Romney called Arizona’s approach to illegal immigration “a {{model for the}} nation.” He vowed that {{on his first day}} in office as president, he would {{bring an end to the}} lawsuits the Obama Administration’s Justice Department had brought challenging Arizona’s immigration policy. He also praised the anti-illegal immigration efforts of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a law professor who had drafted much of Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law and similar measures around the country. Campaigning with Kobach in January 2012, Romney said, “We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> the rule of law. With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem.” When the Supreme Court struck down parts of Arizona's SB 1070 in June 2012, a Romney campaign spokesman said that Romney supports the rights of states to make their own immigration laws when the federal government has failed to address illegal immigration.|$|E
