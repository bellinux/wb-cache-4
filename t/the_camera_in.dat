5|$|Fight Club {{was filmed}} mostly {{at night and}} Fincher {{purposely}} filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes {{in the basement and}} instead placed <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} chorus, Usher {{performs}} choreography in the club, {{backed up by}} several male dancers. Female dancers then come in, performing choreography along with Usher and the male dancers. After Lil Jon sprays champagne towards <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> the laser scene, Ludacris performs his verse. He is dancing in both the club and laser scene, with the camera also alternating to female's dancing in sync in the club.|$|E
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> Super Mario 64, but <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> Ocarina of Time is largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Jumping Flash! 2 {{is virtually}} identical to its predecessor; {{the game is}} presented in a first-person perspective, and the player can move freely in three-dimensional world and rotate <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> any direction. The user interface resembles much {{of the characteristics of}} its predecessor; the top part of the screen shows the time remaining, the player's score, and one of four of Robbit's AI sidekicks who offers the player warnings, reminders and hints.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and features a tearful and distraught Stefani, lying in bed as she begins to sing to <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>In</b> a white inside-out L.A.M.B. T-shirt, she wanders around her apartment lost and questioning her lover, who is in fact absent from the video. The lyrics describe an argument, which she has with an off-screen lover throughout the video. After lying around her apartment and crying during a bath, she leaves her house at night and travels in a car, as she sits tearfully in the back. The video ends with Stefani rolling on the bed.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on April 3, 2008, at the Sunbeam Studios in London, co-directed by fashion {{photographer}} Tom Munro and Nathan Rissman. The video was shot during Madonna's photo shoot with Elle magazine, for its May cover girl issue. Madonna's retro-chic {{look in the}} video {{was inspired by the}} photoshoot. The video featured a guest appearance from rapper Pharrell Williams; he was portrayed alongside Madonna, singing to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> front of various backdrops. Madonna wore thigh-high PVC boots, visible underwear and sheer tops in the video. The dresses were designed by several fashion brands, including Chanel and Roberto Cavalli.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with Utada entering a warehouse, and lifts a tarp off a hover cycle. As the camera pans away from the bike, Utada sits down and starts the bike. The first verse opens with Utada singing to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> a warehouse, whilst intercut scenes have her driving throughout Shibuya, Japan. As the verse progresses, two more clones of Utada appear and sing behind the original Utada. As the chorus starts, the hover cycle starts grinding against the road as she rides through small streets and corners. During the second verse, Utada stops through a city centre as shots of the clones appear on city billboards. She takes of her goggles, {{and stares at the}} moon, while close-up of the clone's faces are seen singing to the track.|$|E
5|$|Jumping Flash! is {{presented}} in a first-person perspective. The player assumes the role of Robbit, a robotic rabbit, and can freely move Robbit in three-dimensional space and can rotate <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> any direction. The top part of the screen shows the remaining time, the player's score, and a character named Kumagoroâ€”Robbit's sidekick artificial intelligence who offers the player warnings and hints. The top left corner of the screen shows the collected power-ups; the top right corner contains the radar showing the locations of objects including enemies, power-ups, jet pods and enemy projectiles. The bottom shows a health meter on the sides {{and the number of}} remaining lives in the centre. The player starts the game with three lives; a new life is granted once one million points are earned.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
30|$|Assuming fixed cameras, one {{can perform}} {{calibration}} {{to calculate the}} relative positions and orientations of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> advance (e.g., Zokai et al. [6] and Bayart et al. [52]).|$|R
30|$|DR methods require {{calibration}} of <b>the</b> main <b>camera</b> and <b>the</b> background observer <b>cameras.</b> <b>In</b> addition, one can superimpose virtual objects interactively by estimating <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pose of <b>the</b> main <b>camera,</b> as <b>in</b> AR/MR.|$|R

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a third-person perspective, and the player can freely move in three-dimensional space and rotate <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> any direction. The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera will shift to first-person mode to assist in aiming.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> front of the plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays {{more information about the}} plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{directed}} by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for Citizen Kane differs from other trailers in {{that it did not}} feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary piece on the film's production. Filmed {{at the same time as}} Citizen Kane itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> a mirror.|$|E
50|$|Red light {{cameras are}} also utilitzed in {{capturing}} texting-while-driving violators. In many municipalities an officer is monitoring <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> a live command center and records all violations, including texting {{at a red}} light.|$|R
50|$|Tilting is a cinematographic {{technique}} <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> stays <b>in</b> a {{fixed position}} but rotates up/down in a vertical plane. Tilting <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> results <b>in</b> a motion similar to someone raising or lowering their {{head to look}} up or down.

5|$|Filming resumed {{two days}} later at Elstree, where Spielberg swiftly filmed the library, Portuguese freighter, and catacombs sequences. The {{steamship}} fight in the prologue's 1938 portion was filmed in three days on a sixty-by-forty-feet deck built on gimbals at Elstree. A dozen dump tanksâ€”each holding three hundred imperial gallons (360 U.S. gallons; 3000lb.) of waterâ€”were used in the scene. Henry's house was filmed at Mill Hill, London. Indiana and Kazim's fight in Venice {{in front of a}} ship's propeller was filmed in a water tank at Elstree. Spielberg used a long focus lens to make it appear the actors were closer to the propeller than they really were. Two days later, on August 4, another portion of the boat chase using Hacker Craft sport boats, was filmed at Tilbury Docks in Essex. The shot of the boats passing between two ships was achieved by first cabling the ships off so they would be safe. The ships were moved together while the boats passed between, close enough that one of the boats scraped the sides of the ships. An empty speedboat containing dummies was launched from a floating platform between the ships amid fire and smoke that helped obscure the platform. The stunt was performed twice because the boat landed too short of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> the first attempt. The following day, filming in England wrapped at the Royal Masonic School in Rickmansworth, which doubled for Indiana's college (as it had in Raiders of the Lost Ark).|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect MÃ©liÃ¨s had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>In</b> addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed MÃ©liÃ¨s to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E
25|$|Alonge's {{photographs}} were intended for his subjects, for private home use, {{and for his}} personal interest in building a visual record. His subjects chose their own attire and presented themselves to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> preferred cultural attitudes.|$|E
50|$|The eight initial {{implementations}} {{began on}} 1 April 2000. <b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> were mainly {{to be placed}} in locations where there had been a significant number of casualties as a result of road accidents. One novelty in the partnerships was that the revenue raised by <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> would be ring-fenced for investment back into the running and maintenance of <b>the</b> original <b>cameras</b> and investment <b>in</b> more <b>cameras.</b> <b>In</b> part this was a response to allegations that such cameras were being placed for revenue generation and not for safety reasons. From the start the partnerships were controversial with strong opinions both for and against <b>the</b> <b>cameras.</b> <b>In</b> December 2001 new regulations enforced a code of visibility for <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>in</b> order that they were always clearly seen by motorists. As of April 2006 there were thirty eight safety <b>camera</b> partnerships <b>in</b> England and Wales covering forty-one police force areas {{out of a total of}} forty-three (Durham and North Yorkshire are the exceptions). Similar arrangements exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camera's</b> use <b>in</b> Racquet Sports was {{met with}} {{negative}} reception, however, Joystiq panned <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> functionality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game for having motion detection with little correlation with the resulting actions on-screen, and noted {{that it was a}} poor substitute for then-upcoming products with superior functionality, such as PlayStation Move and Kinect.|$|R

25|$|Although a 3D {{engine is}} used, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> SimCity 4 is {{restricted}} to a fixed trimetric orthographic projection for performance reasons.

25|$|Grandia's environments are {{depicted}} as three-dimensional maps, with characters represented by 2-D animated bitmap sprites.

25|$|Patterson's {{expensive}} ($369) 16mm camera {{had been}} rented on May 13, {{but he had}} kept it longer than the contract had stipulated, and an arrest warrant had been issued for him on October 17; he was actually arrested within weeks of his return from Bluff Creek. After Patterson returned <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>in</b> working order, this charge was ultimately dismissed, in 1969.|$|E
