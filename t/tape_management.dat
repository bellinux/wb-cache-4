50|$|In 1986, UCCEL Corporation {{purchased}} Cambridge Systems Group, Inc., which marketed for SKK, Inc. {{and their}} market-leading ACF2 mainframe security product. In June '87, Uccel was unexpectedly bought out by its archrival, Computer Associates, which aggressively sold directly competing products CA-Dynam/TLMS (<b>tape</b> <b>management),</b> CA-Scheduler and batch job scheduling products originally from Capex Corporation and Value Software, plus CA-Top Secret (security / mainframe discretionary access control).|$|E
5000|$|CA-SORT's sorting {{algorithms}} and the product's performance (mostly on the DOS/VS computing platform), {{combined with}} modest pricing and the sales acumen of Charles Wang, led to {{rapid growth in}} the large and lucrative North American market. Helping fuel that growth was CA's entry to the DOS/VS enterprise storage management market with software products CA-Dynam/T (<b>tape</b> <b>management</b> system), CA-Dynam/D (disk or [...] "DASD" [...] (direct-access storage device) management) and CA-Dynam/FI (dynamic file independence). Another useful tool that brought OS/MVS sophistication to DOS/VS(E) environments was CA-Driver, a Job Control Language (JCL) management product. CA-Sort's primary competitors were Syncsort from Whitlow Computer Systems, plus DFSORT and SM-023 from IBM. [...] "Synergy" [...] among CA's products became the consistent theme that brought competitive advantage and {{laid the foundation for}} the Unicenter concept years later.|$|E
50|$|Rather than write its own products, Cullinane {{approached}} IT (information technology) departments (at {{that time}} called Data Processing departments) of major enterprises, particularly banks, to identify internally developed applications {{that he felt}} had potential to be productized and licensed to others. However, it proved difficult to sell these applications because most weren't generalized and supportable systems. As a result, the company decided to develop a source code management system, called PLUS, that competed with Pansophic's (PanDA) and UCC's products (UCC-1 <b>tape</b> <b>management</b> system, etc.). The first version of PLUS (which stood for Program Library Update System) required the use of magnetic tape devices, and was not competitive with the other, disk-based products. Although the company eventually responded with a disk-based version, called PLUS-DA (which stood for Direct Access, a common name for disks at the time) they did not become successful in this market.|$|E
50|$|In July 2002, KPLR {{decided to}} disaffiliate from UPN and {{exclusively}} align with The WB, a move {{which would have}} affected fans {{of two of the}} network's most popular series of the period, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Star Trek: Enterprise, forcing them to watch both shows either through cable and satellite feeds of WFTE (now MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYO) in Louisville and WPWR-TV (now a primary CW affiliate and secondary MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station) in Chicago, UPN-affiliated superstations offered by Dish Network or by way of <b>tape</b> trading.

In {{order to reduce the}} contention among drives highly dependent on traffic loads which may occur in allocating a group of data into multiple tapes, we suggest a layout scheme which objects in a cluster is constrained by the number of tapes to be allocated while increasing the utilization of tape drive power. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{relative}} impact of four waves of variables {{on the level}} of red tape in English local government services. These variables range from factors that are largely uncontrollable, such as the inherent nature of the service being provided and turbulence in the external environment, to factors that are at least partly within public managers' control, such as organisational integration and management strategy. Data for this study come from a 2004 survey of English local government (785 services). The findings show that many factors affect the level of red tape in public organisations, and while public managers cannot eliminate all burdensome rules and regulations, they can significantly reduce the level of red tape by being vigilant in their efforts and employing appropriate management techniques and strategies. The implications for research on red <b>tape</b> and public <b>management</b> theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Following CA's {{acquisition}} of Uccel in 1987, many of CA's customers felt trapped, considering the company's dominance in mainframe security software, <b>tape</b> <b>management</b> and batch job scheduling. That sense of vendor lock-in was exacerbated when mainframe databases DATACOM/DB (from ADR) and IDMS (from Cullinet) were acquired by CA {{in the very}} late '80s. Several of CA's customers went blindly [...] "running into the arms" [...] of IBM following IBM's 1996 {{acquisition of}} Tivoli Software. IBM's RACF security software gained significant market share and DB2 replaced much of CA's mainframe database clientele as did Oracle on non-mainframe platforms. CA's 1999 acquisition of Platinum Technology came as a shock, especially since Platinum unabashedly claimed in its sales campaign against smaller ISVs (like Israel's New Dimension Software and its technically superior CONTROL-M job scheduler) that those competitors could easily be swallowed by CA and that [...] "Platinum would never be acquired by CA." [...] The main reason for defections from CA wasn't that its software was bad, but that its behavior as a vendor was. Those experiences left customers with a bitter taste for ISVs and has since allowed IBM to portray all ISVs as potential extortionists.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>management</b> in {{a storage}} {{networking}} environment Today, the paradigm shift in storage architectures from directattached storage to {{storage area network}} and network-attached storage, and to emerging standards such as iSCSI, has a strong impact on the requirements for storage management software. The managed storage resources could be disks (from a few disks to a large disk subsystem) or tapes (from a single tape drive to large automated tape libraries). A key challenge in this field is the management of removable media such as tape, optical, or others. Besides having {{to keep track of}} a potentially enormous number of different volumes and maintaining records of important attributes such as media owner, age, I/O errors, media-pool affiliation, and much more, the open storage networking environment raises new questions. In a scenario in which the use of SCSI devices is no longer restricted to a small number of locally attached servers, security and robustness become increasingly important issues. Access conflicts must be carefully controlled, mount operations have to run in a robust manner, and it is mandatory to comply with a security concept that protects data as well as privacy and confidentiality. This paper concerns the new requirements for <b>tape</b> <b>management</b> systems in storage networking environments. It describes the challenges and relates these requirements to the standards that exist today...|$|E

40|$|Surgical site {{infection}} (SSI) is {{a common}} postoperative complication and can cause avoidable morbidity and excessive costs for the health service. Novel dressings, designed specifically for postoperative wounds, can help {{to reduce the risk}} of SSI and other complications like blistering. This study compared the use of a new polyurethane film surgical dressing (Opsite Post-Op Visible, Smith & Nephew, Hull, UK) with gauze and <b>tape</b> in the <b>management</b> of postoperative wounds. The results show that the polyurethane film dressing results in a significant reduction in SSI (1 · 4 % versus 6 · 6 %, P[*]=[*] 0 · 006) as well as a reduction in other postoperative wound complications (e. g. blistering and erythema). Economic analysis conducted alongside the study suggests that these improved outcomes can be achieved at a lower total treatment cost than gauze and tape dressings. The modest incremental cost of the polyurethane film surgical dressing is easily offset by the reduction in the costs associated with treating SSI and other wound complications associated with gauze and tape dressings...|$|R
