5000|$|Short-Stroking: On {{mechanical}} Autocockers, {{the trigger}} both fires the marker (by releasing the sear) and re-cocks it (by pulling the timing rod and activating the 3-way). The {{pull of the}} trigger accomplishes first one, then the other, in a precisely <b>timed</b> <b>operation,</b> making it necessary for the player to fully pull and release the trigger each time. Only partially pulling the trigger, known colloquially as [...] "short-stroking", will alter the duration of time the pneumatics are actively operating the recocking mechanism, or may eliminate the re-cocking cycle altogether. Short-stroking can thus cause many malfunctions related {{to one or more}} steps of the recocking process not being performed. For instance, if the back block does not move fully rearward, the hammer may not be caught by the sear, and will be released into the pin valve immediately upon the back block moving forward again. If the back block is not kept rearward long enough for a paintball to drop fully into the chamber, a [...] "dry fire" [...] or a [...] "ball chop" [...] may occur, the latter being extremely frustrating as it drastically affects accuracy of future shots until the barrel, breech and bolt are cleaned. The need for a full trigger pull on mechanical Autocockers also results in a slower rate of fire.|$|E

Despite {{of the evolution of}} the endoscopic diagnostics and haemostasis, improved intensive care and surgical treatment, overall mortality is still over 10 % (operative treatment over 20 %), and it almost hasn’t changed over past 40 years. For more than 100 years surgery had major role in treatment of peptic bleeding ulcers, whereas nowadays it is limited to treatment of its complications. Adequate surgical treatment demands properly <b>timed</b> <b>operation,</b> safest but appropriate operation and trained surgeon. Early surgery is much better compared to the last minute surgery. At high risk rebleeding ulcer, early delayed surgery appears to be adequate, since the complications and lethal outcome are more frequent in this group...|$|E
40|$|Airport {{coordination}} is key in airport scheduling {{activities at}} congested airports. In this strategic capacity management process {{the allocation of}} slots – precisely <b>timed</b> <b>operation</b> permits – is required for every take-off and every landing. At this scheduling stage excess demand may occur {{if the number of}} slot requests exceeds the number of available slots. Conflict resolution includes both rescheduling and rejecting slot requests. Consequently, airport access cannot be realized as planned by some airlines. This dissertation’s objective is the development of a standardized approach to evaluate the scheduling and slot allocation process. This evaluation is based on the feasibility for demanding airlines to access airport infrastructure as requested. Therefore the term “scheduled delay” – defined as difference between requested and allocated slot times – is introduced as performance indicator. Scheduled delays allow assessing airport coordination results quantitatively and transparently with regard to airport access and can account for an airport’s scheduling performance. Because this approach is unique in air transportation sciences until now, the possible usage of scheduled delays has been discussed accordingly. In Section 1 of this thesis the feasibility to access airport infrastructure due to slot allocation decisions is introduced as a relevant performance aspect in airport coordination. Airport access is required by airlines to offer transport services. Operational restrictions as well as passenger habits determine the required access times. Slots will not be allocated as requested, if conflict resolution due to excess demand requires rescheduling or rejection of some slots at least. This scheduling performance aspect impacts on both airline and passenger habits. Section 2 focuses on the airport coordination process itself. With airport coordination data being available for German coordinated airports (schedule periods Summer 2005 and Winter 2005 / 2006), a detailed process analysis is based on the developments at those airports. The results of this analysis allow abstracting the airport coordination process in Section 3. Slot demand (input parameter and system load), conflict resolution (service process) and allocated slots (output parameter and system throughput) are classified as relevant parameters and dependencies of airport coordination. Scheduled delay is defined as scheduling performance indicator. It measures the temporal deviation between requested slot time and allocated slot time as resulting from conflict resolution. A delay analysis shows significant differences at German coordinated airports with regard to scheduling performance. The empirical results confirm the assumption that when slot utilization (slot demand vs. slot capacity) increases, the average scheduled delays per allocated slot will rise. Since the available airport coordination data does not allow a precise and complete reproduction of this interdependency, a deterministic model approach is defined to predict scheduled delays depending on the level of slot utilization. The conflict resolution as focal part of the airport coordination is modeled. Section 4 finally discusses the possible implementation of scheduled delays in airport planning and management. Now a systematic airport performance measurement framework can be established including both airport scheduling and day-to-day operations. The performance indicator‘s contribution to addressing airport capacity and design issues is focal in its possible usage. An airport’s capability and sufficiency to cope with the given demand can be indicated reliably...|$|E

A multilevel prefilter is proposed, so as to discard the contingencies that are certainly harmless to the system operation {{from the standpoint of}} MW power overflows. The prefilter is also adaptive, since information from one operation cycle can be used in the next operation cycle, provided that the change in the system operating conditions is small, which is often the case. Simulation results show that the proposed prefilter is accurate and results in significant computational time savings.
