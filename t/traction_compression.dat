40|$|The “hamstring {{syndrome}} ” {{was initially}} described by Puranen and Orava 2 in 1988. They reported {{a group of}} patients with pain in the lower gluteal area radiating down the posterior thigh to the popliteal fossa. In this arti-cle, a series of 59 patients was operated on to loosen the sciatic nerve from adhesions in the proximal hamstring region and to divide tight tendinous structures at the lat-eral insertion of the hamstring tendons to the ischial tuberosity. This condition {{was thought to be}} the result of scarring or a fibrotic band between the proximal ham-string tendons and the sciatic nerve. 1 It is a chronic condi-tion where the patient experiences often ill-defined pain in the buttock region that radiates distally toward the popliteal fossa. The pain occurs with exercise, mainly run-ning, and there is often a report of some associated weak-ness in the hamstring region. The condition influences running ability, particularly sprinting and acceleration. Most patients have tenderness in the proximal hamstring region around the ischial tuberosity. 2 We have renamed this condition “proximal hamstring syndrome ” to more accurately describe the location of the problem within the hamstring muscles. It is postulated that the symptoms of proximal hamstring syndrome are caused by tethering of the sciatic nerve to the hamstring muscles and that the pain from sitting or stretching is caused by sciatic nerve <b>traction,</b> <b>compression,</b> o...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} of a two-part article {{discussing}} loadcarriage- related paresthesias, including brachial plexus lesions (rucksack palsy), digitalgia paresthetica, and meralgia paresthetica. Paresthesias are sensations of numbness, burning, and/or tingling, usually experienced as a result of nerve injury, compression, traction, or irritation. Rucksack palsy is a traction or compression injury to the brachial plexus, caused by the shoulder straps of the rucksack. The patient presents with paresthesia, paralysis, cramping with pain, and muscle weakness of the upper limb. Muscle-strength losses appear to be greater in those carrying heavier loads. Hypothetical risk factors for rucksack palsy include improper load distribution, longer carriage distances, and load weight. Nerve <b>traction,</b> <b>compression,</b> and symptoms may be reduced by use of a rucksack hip belt; wider, better-padded, and proper adjustment of the shoulder straps; reduction of weight in the rucksack; a more symmetric distribution of the load; and resistance training to improve the strength and hypertrophy of the shoulder muscles. Assessment and neck joint and nerve mobilization may relieve brachial plexus tension and reduce symptoms. Another load-carriage-related disorder is digitalgia paresthetica, likely caused by compression of the sensory digital nerves in the foot during load carriage. Patients have paresthesia in the toes. Although no studies have demonstrated effective prevention measures for digitalgia paresthetica, reducing loads and march distances may help by decreasing the forces and repetitive stress on the foot and lower leg. Specialty evaluations by a physical therapist, podiatrist, or other healthcare provider are important to rule out entrapment neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{incidence}} of cranial and cervical nerve injury during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) ranges {{from less than}} 7. 6 % to more than 50 %. Lesions are mainly due to surgical maneuvers such as <b>traction,</b> <b>compression,</b> tissue electrocoagulation, clamping, and extensive dissections. The use of dexamethasone (DEX) and its beneficial effects in spinal cord injuries have already been described. We investigated whether DEX could also be beneficial to minimize the {{incidence of}} cranial and cervical nerve injury during CEA. PurposeTo evaluate whether dexamethasone is able to {{reduce the incidence of}} cranial nerve injuries. Materials and MethodsFrom March 1999 through April 2006, 1126 patients undergoing CEA because of high-grade carotid stenosis were enrolled and randomized by predetermined randomization tables into two groups. The first group, “A”, included 586 patients that all received an intravenous administration of dexamethasone following a therapeutic scheme. The second group, “B”, included 540 control subjects that received the standard pre- and postoperative therapy. All patients were submitted to a deep cervical plexus block, eversion carotid endarterectomy, and selective shunting. Three days after the operation, an independent neurologist and otorhinolaryngologist evaluated the presence of cranial nerve deficits. All patients (group A and group B) showing nerve injuries continued the treatment (8 mg of dexamethasone once in the morning) for 7 days and were re-evaluated after 2 weeks, 30 days, and every 3 months for 1 year. Recovery time took from 2 weeks to 12 months, with a mean time of 3. 6 months. The χ 2 test was used to compare the two groups and to check for statistical significance. ResultsThe incidence of cranial nerve dysfunction was higher in group B and the statistical analysis showed a significant effect of dexamethasone in preventing the neurological damage (P =. 0081). The incidence of temporary lesions was lower in group A and the χ 2 test yielded a P value of. 006. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing the effect of dexamethasone in men and women. In addition, dexamethasone had no statistically significant effect on the incidence of permanent cranial nerve injuries. Finally, no adverse effect related to the administration of dexamethasone was observed. ConclusionPerioperative administration of dexamethasone is effective in minimizing the incidence of temporary cranial nerve injuries during CEA...|$|E

Neurites, the long {{cellular}} protrusions {{that form the}} routes of the neuronal network, are capable of actively extending during early morphogenesis or regenerating after trauma. To perform this task, they rely on their cytoskeleton for mechanical support. In this paper, we present a three-component active gel model that describes neurites in the three robust mechanical states observed experimentally: collapsed, static, and motile. These states arise from an interplay between the physical forces driven by growth of the microtubule-rich inner core of the neurite and the acto-myosin contractility of its surrounding cortical membrane. In particular, static states appear as a mechanical <b>traction</b> or <b>compression</b> balance of these two parallel structures. The model predicts how the response of a neurite to a towing force depends on the force magnitude and recovers the response of neurites to several drug treatments that modulate the cytoskeleton active and passive properties...|$|R

40|$|The cyclic {{laws for}} dynamic {{analyses}} of reinforced concrete (RC) structures usually neglect the concrete traction {{strength and the}} re-loading branch from <b>traction</b> to <b>compression.</b> These assumptions may lead to unreal results in cyclic or dynamics analyses. For example, flag-shaped moment-curvature diagrams of slender RC walls are presented. For this reason, the behaviour of concrete in cyclic tension, determined by Reinhardt et al. (1986, 1989) and modified by Ferracuti and Savoia (2005), is added to an existing cyclic stress-strain law. Making use of the finite element (FE) software OpenSees, the resulting concrete law is firstly validated by simulating experimental tests on RC cantilever beams cyclically loaded. Then, slender RC walls in multi-storey buildings are considered and dynamic analyses are done. Moment-curvature curves at base sections are obtained, together with force and displacement envelopes. The results obtained with the implemented law are compared against the ones obtained with a common law. Results show that concrete reloading behaviour from tension to compression affects significantly the walls designed for a larger response in the inelastic field...|$|R
