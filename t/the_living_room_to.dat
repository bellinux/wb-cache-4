25|$|Medieval period peasants' cottages {{have rarely}} survived, while the prestigious {{dwellings}} of merchants and traders {{are still in}} evidence. The urban poor manufactured items in the living area of their cottages. The rural poor, bound to the land owner, worked {{in one of their}} master's buildings. With the rise of a non-agrarian society, subsistence level domestic manufacture became common, and the introduction of machinery required either <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> be enlarged and modified or the addition of a separate room. Requirements were similar for any domestic manufacturing craft industry.|$|E

Jim advised Paul {{to take some}} music lessons, which he did, but soon realised that he preferred to learn 'by ear' (as his father had done) and because he never paid attention in music classes. After Paul and Michael became interested in music, Jim connected the radio in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> extension cords connected to two pairs of Bakelite headphones {{so that they could}} listen to Radio Luxembourg at night when they were in bed.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. When they got back to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E

2500|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and James {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City. By reading the daily newspaper, James had just learned of gang member Liddil's confession for participating in Hite's murder and grew increasingly suspicious of the Fords for never reporting this matter to him. According to Robert Ford, it became clear to him that James had realized they were there to betray him. However, instead of scolding the Fords, James walked across <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> lay his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair in order to clean it. [...] Robert Ford drew his weapon and shot the unarmed James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prospective}} partners either date {{each other}} or in stricter communities {{they go to a}} [...] "bashow" [...] or sit in. A typical bashow scene is that the young man with his parents goes to see the young woman in her house to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> speak among themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the shadchen or from other people. The number of bashows prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many bashows while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.|$|E
2500|$|In the bedroom, Mueller noted {{there was}} indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, {{contained}} scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies {{in various stages of}} dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> show them to his partner, uttering the words, [...] "These are for real." [...] When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf. As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: [...] "For what I did I should be dead." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} plan, which was finally {{approved}} by Mrs. Sutton, {{the dining room}} is {{once again in the}} west, the reception room in the east, and the living room in the center. However, the three rooms are now all equally wide front to back and the fireplace moved forward from the rear (north) wall, causing <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> project forward. McCarter calls this an [...] "impacted cruciform" [...] where Wright's usual cruciform is [...] "folded in on itself, producing an experiential density and tension between the space-defining elements." [...] As a result, the main floor boasts a gracious sweep of the three public rooms, becoming in effect one very large space. In this it bears stylistic similarities to the K. C. DeRhodes House in South Bend and the George Barton House in Buffalo, New York, of this same time period. The kitchen is behind the fireplace in the north arm of the cross, and the sixth bedroom occupies the northeast corner that would be empty in a pure cruciform plan.|$|E
2500|$|James Pinchot died in 1908, and his wife, Mary, {{died three}} days after Gifford married Cornelia Bryce in August 1914. He and his brother Amos split the estate, with Amos taking the half on which a small forester's cabin was the main {{dwelling}} and Gifford taking the house. The couple began spending their summers at Grey Towers. She realized that his developing political career, and hers (she ran for Congress three times), required a residence more suited to entertaining guests than it had originally been intended to be, and set about modernizing the house. At her behest, many alterations {{were made to the}} original first-floor plan. The most significant involved merging the dining and breakfast rooms to create a large sitting room, and similarly enlarging the library by adding <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> it. [...] "The first thing my wife did", Pinchot told the Saturday Evening Post in 1922, [...] "was to break down the partition walls and let in light and air ... f course, it's a vast improvement." ...|$|E

He climbed the steep stairway (the house stood on piles twelve feet above the sand), and entered <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> report. The trader demanded the chicken. Mauki opened his mouth to explain the missionary's absence. But Bunster did not care for explanations. He struck out with his fist. The blow caught Mauki on the mouth and lifted him into the air.
