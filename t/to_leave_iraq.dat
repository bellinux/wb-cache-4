This decision was reached at with the agreement of all the Assyrian leaders and when responses to this petition were delayed, the Assyrians decided to take action and planned for a general 'cessation of service' by all the Levies.|$|E
25|$|The {{paranoia}} {{that rose}} up around Hashimi's announcement and {{the reports that}} the buses were leaving Iraq slowed the influx of activists into Iraq, and caused some of those already there <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq,</b> believing they had lost credibility through Hashimi's actions. The Iraqi authorities, on the other hand, saw Kenneth O'Keefe, Sloan, and other organisers as constantly challenging Hashimi's authority and being deliberately disruptive, and that some would-be shields were taking too long to deploy to sites. Five of the 'trouble makers' {{were then asked to}} leave the country.|$|E

Smith was willing to cross party lines in support of bills for withdrawing troops from Iraq.|$|E

Nevertheless, Ayyoub al-Jalili and the Jalili family returned again and tried to claim ownership of Bakhdida. On 21 Nov. 1949 judge Moslih al-Den al-Salhani awarded Bakhdida to the Jalili family. The people of Bakhdida presented a petition to the Iraqi government in which they explained the whole history of their village, ending the petition with a request for permission <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq</b> if the government did not return ownership of the village to them. The courts looked into the matter one last time and on 15 March 1954 awarded the village to the people of Bakhdida.|$|E

Biden responded by stating the war is not a [...] "game show" [...] or a [...] "football game", which can be lost. He went on to argue that the real question that should be asked is, [...] "Are we going to be able <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq...</b> and leave behind something other than chaos?"

In 1967, Iraq signed an agreement with the USSR to supply the nation with oil in exchange for large-scale access to Eastern Bloc arms. [...] In 1972, Egypt ordered the Soviet military personnel in the country <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> and <b>Iraq</b> soon became one of the Soviet Union's closest allies in the Middle East. [...] During this time, the USSR and Iraq had signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in which both countries promised to help each other under threat and to avoid entering hostile alliances against one another.|$|R

It was the trigger of much anxiety among the volunteers and negative reporting in the media, including mis-reports that activists were being forced to deploy to military sites. It was also at this point that some of the British volunteers were to return to London along with the two double-decker red buses and their owner, which were originally meant to have left soon after arrival.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To examine {{levels of}} {{psychological}} distress and help seeking behaviour in resettled refugees attending English tuition classes in Australia, and their associations with participants' demographic characteristics. METHODS: Data was collected by bilingual interviewers between March and November 2013. A volunteer sample of attendees of Adult Migrant English Programs (AMEP) in Western Sydney were recruited. Participants were two hundred and twenty five Iraqi refugees resettled in Western Sydney, who had left Iraq no earlier than 1991, were fluent in Arabic and/or English, and were {{between the ages of}} 18 and 70. The chief outcome measures used were the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K- 10) as well as The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). RESULTS: On the K- 10, 39. 8 % of participants had severe psychological distress, 19. 4 % moderate distress, and 40. 7 % had low to mild distress. Ninety-five percent of participants reported having experienced one or more potentially traumatic event (PTE) as defined by the HTQ prior <b>to</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>Iraq,</b> with a mean of 14. 28 events (SD[*]=[*] 8. 69). Thirty-one percent of participants met the threshold (≥ 2. 5) for clinically significant PTSD symptomatology, with a significantly higher occurrence among participants with lower education attainment (χ (2) (3) [*]=[*] 8. 26, p[*]=[*]. 04). Of those participants with clinically significant PTSD symptomatology according to the HTQ, only 32. 9 % reported ever having ever sought help for a mental health problem. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of distress found in this sample, combined with low uptake of mental health care, highlights the need for programs targeted to promote help-seeking among Iraqi refugees who have resettled in Australia. Further, the higher level of PTSD symptomatology found amongst those with lower education attainment has mental health promotion and treatment implications. Specifically, in designing service and treatment programs, consideration should be given to the possible impact excessive levels {{of psychological distress}} may have on learning in refugees, to ensure that those who have been unable to develop proficiency in the English language receive effective care.

5000|$|On May 26, 1987, President Reagan {{announced}} {{his intention to}} nominate Howell to be Ambassador of the U.S. to Kuwait. Howell was at his post awaiting reassignment when, on August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City, was declared closed by Saddam Hussein on August 24, by which time many Americans and other nationals had taken refuge on the embassy compound. Iraq's declaration of the annexation of Kuwait, by means of trumped-up historical, economic and political pretexts, was not recognized by the U.S. It was decided to keep the mission open, under siege, as Iraq would not allow non-diplomats <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country (<b>Iraq</b> retained foreign [...] "guests" [...] as human shields, to deter military strikes).|$|R
2500|$|On 24 December 2006, the New York Times {{reported}} {{that at least}} four Iranians were captured by American troops in Iraq in the previous few days. According to the article, the U.S.government suspected that {{two of them were}} members of Quds Force, which would be some of the first physical proof of Quds Force activity in Iraq. According to The Pentagon, the alleged the Quds Force members were [...] "involved in the transfer of IED technologies from Iran to Iraq". The two men had entered Iraq legally, although they were not accredited diplomats. Iraqi officials believed that the evidence against the men was only circumstantial, but on 29 December, and under U.S. pressure, the Iraqi government ordered the men <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq.</b> They were driven back to Iran that day. In mid-January 2007 it was said that the two alleged Quds force officers seized by American forces were Brig. Gen. Mohsen Chirazi and Col. Abu Amad Davari. According to the Washington Post. Chirazi is the third highest officer of Quds Force, making him the highest-ranked Iranian to ever allegedly be held by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The central U.S. {{justification}} for launching the Iraq War was that Saddam Hussein's alleged development of nuclear {{and biological weapons}} and purported ties to al-Qaeda made his regime a [...] "grave and growing" [...] threat to the United States and the world community. During the lead-up to {{the war and the}} aftermath of the invasion, critics cast doubt on the evidence supporting this rationale. Concerning Iraq's weapons programs, prominent critics included Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector who argued in 2002 that inspections had eliminated the nuclear and chemical weapons programs, and that evidence of their reconstitution would [...] "have been eminently detectable by intelligence services ..." [...] Although it is popularly believed that Saddam Hussein had forced the IAEA weapons inspectors <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq,</b> they were in fact withdrawn {{at the request of the}} US, in advance of Operation Desert Fox, the 1998 American bombing campaign. After the build-up of U.S. troops in neighboring states, Saddam welcomed them back and promised complete cooperation with their demands. Experienced IAEA inspection teams were already back in Iraq and had made some interim reports on its search for various forms of WMD. American diplomat Joseph C. Wilson investigated the contention that Iraq had sought uranium for nuclear weapons in Niger and reported that the contention had no substance.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1950 the {{government}} of Iraq passed the Denaturalisation Act that allowed Jews to emigrate if they renounced their Iraqi citizenship. Iraqi prime minister Tawfiq al-Suwaidi expected that 7,000–10,000 Jews out of the Iraqi Jewish population of 125,000 would leave. A few thousand Jews registered for the offer before the first bombing occurred. The first bombing occurred {{on the last day}} of Passover, 8 April 1950. Panic in the Jewish community ensued and many more Jews registered <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>Iraq.</b> The law expired in March 1951 but was extended after the Iraqi government froze the assets of departing Jews, including those who had already left. Between the first and last bombing almost the entire Jewish community bar a few thousand had registered to leave the country. The emigration of Jews was also due to the deteriorating status of Jews in Iraq since the 1948 Arab-Israeli war as they were suspected of being disloyal to Iraq. They were treated with threats, suspicion and physical assaults and were portrayed by the media as a fifth column. By 1953, nearly all Jews had left the country. In his memoir of Jewish life in Baghdad, Sasson Somekh writes: [...] "The pace of registration for the citizenship waiver was slow in the beginning, but it increased as tensions rose between Jews and their neighbors and after acts of terror were perpetrated against Jewish businesses and institutions – especially the Mas'uda Shem-Tov Synagogue...This was the place to which emigrating citizens were required to report with their luggage before leaving for Israel." ...|$|E
50|$|Karabekir had {{differences}} of opinion with Mustafa Kemal about the realization of Atatürk's Reforms, {{one of the most}} important being the abolition of caliphate. Even though he agreed with Mustafa Kemal on the subject, he did not agree with him on immediate action. For Karabekir, the timing was inappropriate, because British forces stood at the border of southeastern Turkey, claiming Kirkuk in modern-day Iraq. Karabekir did not believe that the caliphate should be abolished before solving this problem. Kurds, more radical in their shafi-sunni Islamic beliefs, began to rise up against the government, because they thought the government would abolish religion after ending the caliphate. Struggling with this rebellion, Turkey agreed <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Kirkuk <b>to</b> <b>Iraq,</b> which was under the British mandate. Such conflicts prompted tensions between Karabekir and Mustafa Kemal.|$|R
50|$|Iraqi President Saddam Hussein never {{replaced}} al-Shawi {{as ambassador}} {{and for a}} number of years the embassy was run by more junior staffers. In the late 1990s the embassy was perennially short of cash and got in trouble for paying employees in alcohol and cigarettes. The Canadian government did not bow to U.S. pressure to close the embassy during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but Canada did expel a number of diplomats on suspicion of espionage. The lone Iraqi diplomat who remained, chargé d'affaires Mamdouh Mustafa, shuttered himself inside the embassy, attending few functions and refusing to talk to the media. In December 2003 Mustafa returned <b>to</b> <b>Iraq,</b> <b>leaving</b> the embassy vacant.|$|R

With the Iraqi bombers fast approaching Ras Tanura, the American AWACs went step-by-step with Al-Shamrani to line himself up behind the two remaining Iraqi jets. Al-Shamrani eventually managed to shoot both Iraqi jets down with AIM-9s, though only mere minutes before they reached their target. Both Iraqi pilots Fadel and Saleem were killed.|$|R
