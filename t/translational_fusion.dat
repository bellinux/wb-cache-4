40|$|We {{have used}} the Escherichia coli {{beta-glucuronidase}} (uidA) gene as a reporter gene to localize the promoter and analyze {{the function of the}} 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) of the Chlamydomonas chloroplast petD gene. Using particle bombardment, petD-uidA transcriptional and <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> genes were introduced into the chloroplast genome in the large inverted repeat flanking the atpB gene. In transformants carrying a petD-uidA transcriptional fusion, uidA mRNA accumulated but was not translated. However, in a <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> that included the entire petD 5 ' UTR, uidA mRNA accumulated and a high level of beta-glucuronidase activity was detected. When approximately 70 % of the petD 5 ' UTR was deleted from the <b>translational</b> <b>fusion,</b> uidA mRNA accumulation and beta-glucuronidase activity decreased 4 - to 6 -fold and 8 -fold, respectively. Run-on transcription assays demonstrated that all strains transcribe the uidA gene at equivalent rates. Our results show that sequences essential for translation reside in the petD 5 ' UTR and also that sequences within the 5 ' UTR directly or indirectly affect mRNA stability. The expression of beta-glucuronidase under the control of chloroplast transcriptional and translational signals will facilitate further studies of chloroplast gene regulatory mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe gene con- 10 of Neurospora crassa is {{expressed}} preferentially during conidiation and following illumination of vegetative mycelia with blue light. In {{this study we}} have examined the segmental locations of the genetic elements associated with con- 10 {{that are responsible for}} light and developmental expression. A <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> was prepared between the initial segment of con- 10 and Escherichia coli lacZ. Deletions were then introduced into the con- 10 upstream region associated with this <b>translational</b> <b>fusion.</b> Each construct was integrated at the his- 3 locus of N. crassa by transformation and homologous recombination. Photoinduction of mycelia containing the <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> with the intact upstream region revealed a two phase stimulus-response curve. Exposure to light for as little as 5 sec induced a transcriptional response. Following this initial induction, a period of 15 min in the dark or light was required for appearance of a second phase response. Only a brief light treatment was necessary for induction of the second phase response. Deletions within the upstream region altered normal light and developmental expression of constructs containing the con- 10 -lacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusion.</b> The deleted segments appear to contain a mycelial repression site, two conidiation activation sites, and two dark repression sites. A repeated 17 -bp sequence acted as a transcriptional enhancer. One copy of this enhancer is in the upstream region. The second copy, with the opposite orientation, is located in the first con- 10 intron. The enhancer was required for proper mycelial and conidial expression of the con- 10 -lacZ fusion. The initial 10 bp of this enhancer sequence were sufficient to restore conidial expression to a deletion construct lacking both copies of the 17 -bp repeat. Proteins were detected in extracts of mycelia and conidia that specifically bound to the enhancer sequence in vitro. Our findings suggest that conidiation-specific and mycelial-specific expression of con- 10 requires the action of several factors acting independently and/or in concert at distinct sites located in the regulatory regions for con- 10...|$|E

In this study, we report that under nutrient poor conditions, RpoS protein accumulation in E. coli was strongly enhanced by a secreted factor. Expression of a single copy RpoS 0 - 0 LacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> was activated 12 -fold by the signal, but a single copy rpoS-lacZ transcriptional fusion was only activated 1. 6 -fold. The extracellular signal activated the RpoS 0 - 0 LacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> in dsrA, rprA or dsrA/rprA mutant backgrounds, but did not activate in an hfq mutant background. A RpoS 379 0 - 0 LacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusion,</b> missing the region of RpoS required for the RssB (SprE) /ClpXP-dependent proteolysis, was not activated by the extracellular signal. Furthermore, in a rssB(sprE) <Tn 10 back-ground, the presence of extracellular signal did not significantly activate expression above the already elevated levels. Western and Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the extracellular signal significantly increased the levels of RpoS protein, but not mRNA. The extracellular signal did not bind to reversed-phase C- 18 columns, was dialyzable, and stable to pH 2, pH 12 and heat. However, protease treatment drastically reduced signal activity. Extracellular signal activity was absent in an hldD (rfaD) mutant, but was present in cell lysates, suggesting that signal was unable to be exported in an hldD mutant...|$|E

To simplify the analysis of vir gene induction, we sought to create Agrobacterium strains in which virG could be expressed in a controllable fashion. To study {{the possibility of using}} the lac promoter and repressor, we constructed a plasmid containing the lac promoter fused to the lacZ structural gene. A derivative of this plasmid containing the lacIq gene was also constructed. The plasmid not containing lacIq expressed high levels of beta-galactosidase. The plasmid containing lacIq expressed beta-galactosidase at very low levels in the absence of o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside (IPTG) and at moderate levels in the presence of IPTG. We also fused the lac promoter to a virG::lacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> and found that IPTG elevated expression of this <b>translational</b> <b>fusion</b> to moderate levels, though not to levels as high as from the stronger of the two native virG promoters. Finally, the lac promoter was used to express the native virG gene in strains containing a virB::lacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusion.</b> virB expression in this strain depended on addition of IPTG as well as the vir gene inducer acetosyringone. In a similar strain lacking lacIq, virB expression was greater than in a strain in which virG was expressed from its native promoters. Expression of virG from the lac promoter did not alter the acidic pH optimum for vir gene induction, indicating that the previously observed requirement for acidic media was not due solely to the need to induce P 2...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} {{the utility of}} Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, encoded by phoA, as a reporter molecule for genetic fusions in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. A portion of the R. sphaeroides cycA gene was fused to phoA, yielding a fusion protein comprising the putative signal sequence and first 10 amino acids of the cytochrome c 2 apoprotein joined to the sixth amino acid of alkaline phosphatase. The fusion protein was efficiently transported to the periplasm of R. sphaeroides as determined by enzyme activity, Western immunoblot analysis, and immunogold electron microscopy. We also documented the ability of an R. sphaeroides mutant, RS 104, with gross defects in photosynthetic membrane morphology to efficiently recognize and translocate the fusion protein to the periplasmic compartment. The inclusion of 500 base pairs of R. sphaeroides DNA in cis to the cycA structural gene resulted in a 2. 5 -fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity in photosynthetically grown cells compared with the activity in aerobically grown cells, demonstrating that the fusion protein is regulated {{in a manner similar}} to that of cytochrome c 2 regulation. We also constructed two pUC 19 -based plasmids suitable for the construction of <b>translational</b> <b>fusions</b> to phoA.

40|$|The Neurospora crassa arg- 2 {{transcript}} {{contains an}} upstream {{open reading frame}} (uORF) specifying a 24 -residue leader peptide and is subject to a novel form of negative translational regulation in response to arginine. The role of the arg- 2 uORF in arginine-specific negative regulation was investigated by using <b>translational</b> <b>fusions</b> of wild-type and mutant arg- 2 sequences to the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene specifying beta-galactosidase. The wild-type uORF conferred Arg-specific regulation on the reporter gene in N. crassa, but mutated or truncated uORFs did not, as determined by measurements of beta-galactosidase activity produced in N. crassa strains expressing arg- 2 -lacZ fusion genes. All effects on reporter gene expression were posttranscriptional, as determined by measurement of RNA levels. Both sequence-dependent and sequence-independent effects of uORFs were observed. Genes containing the wild-type uORF or a 21 -codon mutated uORF showed reduced translation in comparison {{with that of a}} gene lacking a uORF. Both uORF-containing transcripts showed reduced association with polysomes relative to transcripts lacking a uORF, but only the transcript with the wild-type uORF showed a reduced average number of ribosomes associated with it in response to arginine addition. Direct <b>translational</b> <b>fusions</b> between uORF sequences and lacZ sequences indicated that the uORF is translated. Overlapping the uORF with the lacZ initiation codon indicated that ribosome reinitiation at a downstream start codon is not integral to uORF-mediated, Arg-specific translational regulation.

40|$|The trp RNA-binding {{attenuation}} protein (TRAP) regulates {{expression of}} the Bacillus subtilis trpEDCFBA operon by transcription attenuation and translational control mechanisms. Both mechanisms require binding of tryptophan-activated TRAP to 11 (G/U) AG repeats in the trp leader transcript. trpE translational control involves formation of a TRAP-dependent RNA structure that sequesters the trpE Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (the SD blocking hairpin). By comparing expression levels from trpE′-′lacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusions</b> controlled by the wild-type leader or by a leader that cannot form the SD blocking hairpin, we found that translational control requires a tryptophan concentration higher than that required for transcription attenuation. We also found that inhibition of trpE translation by the SD blocking hairpin does not alter {{the stability of the}} downstream message. Since the coding sequences for trpE and trpD overlap by 29 nucleotides, we examined expression levels from trpED′-′lacZ <b>translational</b> <b>fusions</b> to determine if these two genes are translationally coupled. We found that introduction of a UAA stop codon in trpE resulted in a substantial reduction in expression. Since expression was partially restored {{in the presence of a}} tRNA suppressor, our results indicate that trpE and trpD are translationally coupled. We determined that the coupling mechanism is TRAP independent and that formation of the SD blocking hairpin regulates trpD translation via translational coupling. We also constructed a rho mutation to investigate the role of Rho-dependent termination in trp operon expression. We found that TRAP-dependent formation of the SD blocking hairpin allows Rho access to the nascent transcript, causing transcriptional polarity...|$|R

40|$|Posttranscriptional {{control is}} known to {{contribute}} to the regulation of secondary metabolism and virulence determinants in certain gram-negative bacteria. Here we report the isolation of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene which encodes a global translational regulatory protein, RsmA (regulator of secondary metabolites). Overexpression of rsmA resulted in a substantial reduction in the levels of extracellular products, including protease, elastase, and staphylolytic (LasA protease) activity as well as the PA-IL lectin, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and the phenazine pigment pyocyanin. While inactivation of rsmA in P. aeruginosa had only minor effects on the extracellular enzymes and the PA-IL lectin, the production of HCN and pyocyanin was enhanced during the exponential phase. The influence of RsmA on N-acylhomoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing was determined by assaying the levels of N-(3 -oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3 -oxo-C 12 -HSL) and N-butanoylhomoserine lactone (C 4 -HSL) produced by the rsmA mutant and the rsmA-overexpressing strain. RsmA exerted a negative effect on the synthesis of both 3 -oxo-C 12 -HSL and C 4 -HSL, which was confirmed by using lasI and rhlI <b>translational</b> <b>fusions.</b> These data also highlighted the temporal expression control of the lasI gene, which was induced much earlier and to a higher level during the exponential growth phase in an rsmA mutant. To investigate whether RsmA modulates HCN production solely via quorum-sensing control, hcn <b>translational</b> <b>fusions</b> were employed to monitor the regulation of the cyanide biosynthesis genes (hcnABC). RsmA was shown to exert an additional negative effect on cyanogenesis posttranscriptionally by acting on a region surrounding the hcnA ribosome-binding site. This suggests that, in P. aeruginosa, RsmA functions as a pleiotropic posttranscriptional regulator of secondary metabolites directly and also indirectly by modulating the quorum-sensing circuitry...|$|R
