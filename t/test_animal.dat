25|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} {{experiments on}} animals {{can be set}} up differently than those on humans. The “flower pot” method involves placing a laboratory animal above water on a platform so small that it falls off upon losing muscle tone. The naturally rude awakening which results may elicit changes in the organism which necessarily exceed the simple absence of a sleep phase. This method also stops working after about 3 days as the subjects (typically rats) lose their will to avoid the water. Another method involves computer monitoring of brain waves, complete with automatic mechanized shaking of the cage when the <b>test</b> <b>animal</b> drifts into REM sleep.|$|E

25|$|Sankar Chatterjee {{suggested}} in 2005 that, {{in order for}} Microraptor to glide or fly, the forewings and hindwings must have been on different levels (as on a biplane) and not overlaid (as on a dragonfly), and that the latter posture would have been anatomically impossible. Using this biplane model, Chatterjee was able to calculate possible methods of gliding, and determined that Microraptor most likely employed a phugoid style of gliding: launching itself from a perch, the animal would have swooped downward in a deep U-shaped curve and then lifted again to land on another tree. The feathers not directly employed in the biplane wing structure, like those on the tibia and the tail, {{could have been used}} to control drag and alter the flight path, trajectory, etc. The orientation of the hindwings would also have helped the animal control its gliding flight. Chatterjee also used computer algorithms that <b>test</b> <b>animal</b> flight capacity to test whether or not Microraptor was capable of true, powered flight, as opposed to or in addition to passive gliding. The resulting data showed that Microraptor did have the requirements to sustain level powered flight, so it is theoretically possible that the animal flew as opposed to gliding.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of acute toxicity tests. The [...] ("Lethal Dose 50%") test is {{used to evaluate the}} toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill 50% of the <b>test</b> <b>animal</b> population. This test was removed from OECD international guidelines in 2002, replaced by methods such as the fixed dose procedure, which use fewer animals and cause less suffering. Abbott writes that, as of 2005, [...] "the LD50 acute toxicity test ... still accounts for one-third of all animal [...] tests worldwide".|$|E
500|$|With the {{development}} of serological typing, medical researchers were able to sort bacteria into different strains, or types. [...] When a person or <b>test</b> <b>animal</b> (e.g., a mouse) is inoculated with a particular type, an immune response ensues, generating antibodies that react specifically with antigens on the bacteria. [...] Blood serum containing the antibodies can then be extracted and applied to cultured bacteria. [...] The antibodies will react with other bacteria of the same type as the original inoculation. Fred Neufeld, a German bacteriologist, had discovered the pneumococcal types and serological typing; until Frederick Griffith's studies bacteriologists believed that the types were fixed and unchangeable {{from one generation to}} the next.|$|E

50|$|In animal experimentation, {{self-administration}} {{is a form}} of {{operant conditioning}} where the reward is a drug. This drug can be administered remotely through an implanted intravenous line or an intracerebroventricular injection. Self-administration of putatively addictive drugs {{is considered one of the}} most valid experimental models to investigate drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. The higher the frequency with which a <b>test</b> <b>animal</b> emits the operant behavior, the more rewarding (and addictive), the test substance is considered. Self-administration of addictive drugs has been studied using humans, non-human primates, mice, invertebrates such as ants, and, most commonly, rats.|$|E

40|$|By {{carrying}} out the tissue culture of the bone marrow from the guinea pigs with experimental auemia induced by the intraperitoneal injection of anti-serum of the bone marrow, the author observed the growth of bone marrow cells in the leucocyte series and the function of pseudo-eosinophils, and obtained the following results: 1. The relative growth rate in the test guinea pigs falls to 1 / 2 or 1 / 3 of the control, and the cell growth has declined in all the cases. The cell density in the <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> is less dense than in the control, showing the poor cell growth. 2 The wandering velocity of pseudo-eosinophils in the bone marrow of <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> is more diminished when compared with that in the control. 3. The average rate of neutral red vital staining of pseudoeosinophils in the <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> to stain and fade more quickly than in the control, i. e. the function is diminished. 4. The carbon-particle phagocytoticpower of pseudo-eosinophils in <b>test</b> <b>animals</b> is slightly lowered when compared with that in the control. From these findings of bone-marrow tissue culture irrespective of an increase or decrease of peripheral leucocytes in the animals with the experimental anemia induced by the antiserum of the bone marrow, {{it has been found}} that the growth rate and function of the cells in the leucocyte series of the bone marrow are diminished though there is some variation in the degree of changes...|$|R
