5|$|Catalytic triads perform {{covalent}} catalysis via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate {{is resolved}} by water, {{the result is}} hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a <b>transferase.</b> For example, attack by an acyl group results in an acyltransferase reaction. Several families of <b>transferase</b> enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.|$|E
5|$|VP3 {{is part of}} {{the inner}} core of the virion and is an enzyme called guanylyl <b>transferase.</b> This is a capping enzyme that catalyses the {{formation}} of the 5' cap in the post-transcriptional modification of mRNA. The cap stabilises viral mRNA by protecting it from nucleic acid degrading enzymes called nucleases.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, an {{alternative}} <b>transferase</b> mechanism has been evolved by amidophosphoribosyltransferases, which has two active sites. In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a glutamine substrate to release free ammonia. The ammonia then diffuses though an internal tunnel in the enzyme {{to the second}} active site, where it is transferred to a second substrate.|$|E

40|$|<b>Transferases</b> are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} reactions {{in which a}} group is transferred from one compound to another.

5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl <b>transferase</b> activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|These {{sections}} are subdivided {{by other}} {{features such as}} the substrate, products, and chemical mechanism. An enzyme is fully specified by four numerical designations. For example, hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) is a <b>transferase</b> (EC 2) that adds a phosphate group (EC 2.7) to a hexose sugar, a molecule containing an alcohol group (EC 2.7.1).|$|E
5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl <b>transferase,</b> and is therefore {{no longer able to}} act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|E

5|$|There {{are more}} than 100 other {{naturally}} occurring modified nucleosides. The greatest structural diversity of modifications {{can be found in}} tRNA, while pseudouridine and nucleosides with 2'-O-methylribose often present in rRNA are the most common. The specific roles of many of these modifications in RNA are not fully understood. However, it is notable that, in ribosomal RNA, many of the post-transcriptional modifications occur in highly functional regions, such as the peptidyl <b>transferase</b> center and the subunit interface, implying that they are important for normal function.|$|E
5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and <b>transferase</b> enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl <b>transferase</b> (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
