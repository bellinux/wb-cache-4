5|$|To {{initiate}} firing <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> {{the trigger}} mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull the body of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>weapon,</b> and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> in action.|$|E

5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy {{for a man to}} carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of the}} gun port he could fire <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E

5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). <b>The</b> <b>weapon</b> is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition.

50|$|The CVN 21 {{class was}} {{designed}} to have better weapons movement paths, largely eliminating horizontal movements within the ship.

Linear motors are being considered for <b>the</b> advanced <b>weapons</b> elevators. <b>The</b> elevators will also be relocated such that they will not impede aircraft operations on the flight deck. The redesign of <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> movement paths and the location of <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> elevators on <b>the</b> flight deck will reduce manpower and contribute to a much higher sortie generation rate.|$|R

5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} by British staff {{officers of the}} initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, {{they also found that}} once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow-charge ammunition before it could penetrate the tank's armour, <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> became much less effective.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{proved that}} the fault lay {{in the construction of}} the bomb's tail; breaking up on impact, a 'safed' bomb would have its arming wire removed, rendering it 'unsafe' and detonating <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> Modifications were made to solve the problem, but the damage had been done; the safety issues, increased maintenance costs compared to conventional bombs, the fact that the bomb's guidance system required clear-day use only, rendering the bombers vulnerable to enemy fighters, and required that <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> be released at a prime altitude for the aircraft to be in danger from enemy flak. These combined with the weapon's poor reliability – only six of twenty-eight bombs dropped successfully destroyed their targets – to result in the production order being canceled by the USAF; following this, the Tarzon program as a whole was terminated in August 1951.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that several psychology researchers have also criticized <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> effect, questioning <b>the</b> original research study’s findings. This is because subsequent studies have been less successful at replicating <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> effect, and alternative explanations have been proposed. For example, more recent research has proposed that there are more factors that influence aggression in a situation containing a weapon, such as an individual's familiarity with <b>the</b> <b>weapons</b> present.|$|R

5|$|Chemical {{restoration}} {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} milling. Typically, chemical milling is used to slowly remove material to create a desired shape. In serial number restoration, small amounts of metal are removed until the serial number is brought back to the surface. This can be performed due to the depth that serial numbers are engraved into <b>the</b> <b>weapon.</b> However, chemical restoration is limited by that depth and is only successful when the obliteration of the serial number is superficial. Examiners performing a restoration first sand the area where the serial number used to be. This removes any debris from the area left when the serial number was obliterated. The examiner then chooses a chemical, usually an acid, that will be used to slowly bring the number back to the surface. The type of chemical that is used depends on the material <b>the</b> <b>weapon</b> is made of. These acids can range from Fry's Reagent for a magnetic metal, which is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, cupric chloride, and distilled water, to an acidic ferric chloride solution for a non-magnetic, non-aluminum material.|$|E
