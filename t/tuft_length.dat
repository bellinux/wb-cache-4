40|$|The aim of {{the work}} of the "Evaluation of varietal {{characteristics}} od Coral Bells" is to approach the issue of growing these plants, and the comparison of varietal characteristics of Coral Bells examined in the Botanical Garden in Troja. The total was 36 taxa (Heuchera) in the Botanic Garden in Troja. In plants, these characters were recorded: height of tuft, width of <b>tuft,</b> <b>length</b> of leaf, the leaf width, the leaf color, shape of the leaf, the length of the inflorescence, the color of flowers and flowering time. The plants were shot and monitored (including measurements) from March to November every month (in May and June data was collected twice a month). Varietal characteristics of Coral Bells were evaluated according to all the parameters and then the information were compared with the literature. It was found that the most common plant height is 201 - 350 mm. The most of Coral Bells blooms in May and the most common color is white. The most of Coral Bells has green coloring leafs. It was also found, and confirmed from the literature that the red flowering Coral Bells require a rather sunny habitat than shady. On the contrary, Coral Bells with white flower require shading. The result of the Bachelor thesis is gathering information from different sources and from his own observations and subsequent comparison of these data. Charts and tables embedded in the work can be used when designing the beds {{on the basis of the}} parameters...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of light, water flow and water temperature on larvae and early juveniles of 4 shallow-water Caribbean demosponges, Tedania ignis, Haliclona tubifera, Sigmadocja caerulea and Halichondria magniconulosa. Larval release was not a synchronous event, either at the individual or population level {{in any of these}} species. Parenchymella larvae were photonegative during their whole life, but their swimming speed to escape from a light source varied with species and was related to the ratio of larval body length:flagellar <b>tuft</b> <b>length.</b> The presence of a water flow faster than the larval swimming speed had no effect on the settlement success of these 4 species in experimental flumes. Larvae of all 4 species preferred shaded sites at settlement in flumes. However, microhabitat irradiance in the field was correlated with abundances of adults only in 1 species, S. caerulea. The presence of water flow was positively associated with juvenile survivorship in the field only in the caseof T ignjs. Water flow was also positively associated with the adult abundance of T ignis, but negatively associated with the abundance of H. tubifera. Recruitment varied substantially among species, being extremely low in H. tubifera and H. magniconulosa. Larval activity and settlement of 2 species were strongly affected by abnormally low temperatures: swimming speed decreased, the free-swimming phase was dramatically shortened and recruitment was virtually inhibited. Low temperatures, therefore, potentially prevent larval dispersal and recruitment into cold waters and might restrict the geographic distribution of these species to tropical areas and warm shallow waters. This study was supported by a postdoctoral Fulbright-MEC grant (FU 93 - 02207057) to M. M. This is Harbor Branch contribution number 1126 Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|There are {{collected}} materials on morphology, reproduction rate, and mortality of Dschiggetajs Equus h. hemionus between 2001 and 2006 in the South Gobi of Mongolia. It were found 794 skeletons of wild asses, 95 % {{of these were}} pouched, ⅔ of them in winter coat. Pouching was also located in the protected areas of this region. The main living resources of Equus hemionus are registered in the South eastern Gobi. For the first time statistical data on morphology measurements of body <b>length,</b> tail and <b>tuft,</b> ear <b>length,</b> and hoofs are given. There are {{no significant differences between}} the sexes. The reproduction rate differed in the years 2003 to 2006 between 23 % and 7. 5 % in dependence of weather and feeding conditions as well as the fitness of the mares. In two reference areas of Manlaj Sum and Bordzongijn Gobi we found in 4 years per 1 km 2 2. 1 to 4. 1 shot wild asses. All sources of population decrease are known. Now the politicians have to develop new strategies for better protection of this endangered species. The International Nature Conservation and the International community are waiting for progress in this unacceptable situation...|$|R
40|$|Several {{independent}} {{studies of}} acoustics, DNA, and morphology {{support the hypothesis}} of numerous cryptic sibling taxa within Tarsius tarsier (=spectrum), but direct comparison among studies is often hindered by the relative incomparability of specimens (e. g. those that measure acoustic form versus those that measure crania). Tail tufts {{have been used for}} taxonomic identification both among and within tarsier species groups, but traditional univariate measures of tail tuft have yielded disappointing results. We used an ordinary ruler to assess 105 museum specimens and captive animals for overall tail length and five measurements of tail <b>tuft</b> fur <b>length.</b> We used a discriminant function analysis for 2 sets of analyses, one on all 105 tarsiers specimens grouped by tarsier species groups, and another on 37 Eastern tarsiers grouped by taxon. To accommodate for possible changes in tail length due to preservation method, separate analyses were conducted for both using: a) all variables, and b) all variable except tail length. In the analysis of all tarsiers grouped by species group with all variables, 96. 2 % of the original grouped cases were correctly classified, and 93. 3 % of cross-validated cases were correctly classified, while the respective values were 91. 4 % and 89. 5 % when the variable, tail length, was excluded. In the analysis of Eastern tarsiers grouped by taxon with all variables, 86. 5 % of the original cases were correctly classified, and 67. 6 % of the cross-validated cases correctly classified, while the respective values were 78. 4 % and 45. 9 % when the variable tail length was excluded. This method clearly has utility for diagnosing tarsier species groups, and it shows strong potential for assisting in the diagnosis of fine scale taxonomic variatio...|$|R
40|$|Scarlet-tufted {{malachite}} sunbirds, Nectarinia johnstoni, are {{endemic to}} the alpine zones of East African mountains. On Mount Kenya they feed {{almost exclusively on}} the nectar of Lobelia telekii flowers. Males are bright iridescent green, with red pectoral tufts and elongated central tail feathers. The pectoral tufts are used to mediate male-male competition for territories and the long tail may be important in mate choice. The pectoral tufts and the tails of males measured in both 1989 and 1990 increased between years. This increase {{could be due to}} age or to differences in condition of the males in the two years. There was an increase in the population tail <b>length</b> and pectoral <b>tuft</b> size of the same magnitude as the change seen in known males which suggests that an age effect is unlikely. The density of L. telekii inflorescences increased between the two years, so more food was available in 1990 than in 1989. Weather records and data from breeding success also suggest that conditions in 1989 were harsher than in 1990. The available information suggests that the size of pectoral <b>tufts</b> and tail <b>length</b> are influenced by environmental conditions rather than male age. © 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

40|$|For {{the organic}} farmers there is {{important}} question which varieties of wheat are right for organic farming in Less Favoured Areas. Modern varieties of wheat are bred in {{the conditions of}} conventional (high imput) farming. That is why the organic farmers asked about the suitability of land races of soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or different species like emmer wheat grown in the past (Triticum dicoccum SCHUEBL). The paper results {{from the study of}} fourty land races, two intermediate and ten modern varieties of soft wheat in comparison to ten land races of emmer wheat at two locations in the Czech Republic. We evaluated <b>tuft</b> shape, <b>length</b> of plant, length and width of flag leaf, length and density of spike and awnedness. The modern varieties of soft wheat are characterised by a high level of uniformity. Their tuft shape is erect or semi-erect and length of plant is 60 - 70 cm, it does not rise the weed competitiveness. On the other hand, they have a medium or long flag leaf whose width is narrow or medium. Length of spike is medium or long. On the other hand, emmer wheat land races have the same tuft shape as forgoing modern varieties. Length of plant (89 - 119 cm) is the positive aspect of the weed competitiveness. Their flag leaf is narrow, but it is compesated by its length. The spike is shorter than the spike of modern varieties of soft wheat, but it is effectivelly compensated by an increased density. Intermediate wheat land races are characterised by looselly spreading tuft shape which puts the weeds down, but on the other hand, it favours the mildew because of the microclimate of soil. Its flag leaf is very short and narrow. Length of spike is medium and it is lax dense. The group of land races of soft wheat is characterised by a high diversity. The tuft shape is most frequently semi-erect. The length of plant varies from 60 to 120 cm, it usually ranges from 90 to 110 cm. Flag leaf is usually long or very long, but its width is very narrow or narrow. The spike is often long, but lax dense. Some of the evaluated varieties of landraces are proved to be suitable for organic farming {{from the point of view}} of the morphological characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{studies show}} that {{repeated}} restraint stress leads to selective atrophy in the apical dendritic field of pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the functional consequence of this selectivity remains unclear. The apical dendrite of layer V pyramidal neurons in the mPFC is a selective locus for the generation of increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by serotonin (5 -HT) and hypocretin (orexin). On that basis, we hypothesized that apical dendritic atrophy might result in a blunting of 5 -HT- and hypocretin-induced excitatory responses. Using a combination of whole-cell recording and two-photon imaging in rat mPFC slices, {{we were able to}} correlate electrophysiological and morphological changes in the same layer V pyramidal neurons. Repeated mild restraint stress produced a decrement in both 5 -HT- and hypocretin-induced EPSCs, an effect that was correlated with a decrease in apical <b>tuft</b> dendritic branch <b>length</b> and spine density in the distal tuft branches. Chronic treatment with the stress hormone corticosterone, while reducing 5 -HT responses and generally mimicking the morphological effects of stress, failed to produce a significant decrease in hypocretin-induced EPSCs. Accentuating this difference, pretreatment of stressed animals with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 486 blocked reductions in 5 -HT-induced EPSCs but not hypocretin-induced EPSCs. We conclude: (i) stress-induced apical dendritic atrophy results in diminished responses to apically targeted excitatory inputs and (ii) corticosterone plays a greater role in stress-induced reductions in EPSCs evoked by 5 -HT as compared with hypocretin, possibly reflecting the different pathways activated by the two transmitters...|$|R
