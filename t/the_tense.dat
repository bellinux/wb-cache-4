5|$|Verb {{morphology}} in Wagiman {{is highly}} irregular. Of the small inventory of inflecting verbs, many {{have their own}} unique tense suffixes, while other tense suffixes are common to several verbs, and while some rudimentary verb classes can be identified - stance verbs always take the past tense suffix -nginy , for instance - <b>the</b> <b>tense</b> suffixes must be learned for each individual verb.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> English <b>tense</b> {{system has}} always been one of the main {{subjects}} for linguists and grammarians. This paper adopts the metaphorical approach to study <b>the</b> English <b>tense.</b> By analyzing <b>the</b> prototypical uses of <b>the</b> present <b>tense</b> and <b>the</b> past <b>tense,</b> <b>the</b> author gives a convincing and reasonable explanation of these various uses of <b>the</b> English <b>tense.</b> <b>The</b> metaphorical approach used in this paper provides a new perspective for the study of <b>the</b> English <b>tense.</b> <b>The</b> metaphorical mapping processes of <b>the</b> past <b>tense</b> and <b>the</b> present <b>tense</b> reflect <b>the</b> universal cognitive mechanism of human beings, that is, learners acquire knowledge from known to unknown. The last but not least, the new interpretations of the different uses of <b>the</b> English <b>tense</b> offers a practical help for the teaching and learning of tense. </p...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} <b>tenses</b> in Arabic: <b>the</b> past <b>tense</b> ( [...] ), <b>the</b> present <b>tense</b> ( [...] ) and <b>the</b> future <b>tense.</b> <b>The</b> future <b>tense</b> in Classical Arabic is formed by adding either the prefix [...] or the {{separate}} word [...] onto {{the beginning of}} <b>the</b> present <b>tense</b> verb, e.g. [...] or [...] 'he will write'.|$|R

5|$|The Alexandrian texts were {{incorporated}} {{into the body of}} classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the Hellenistic period.

In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuriesAD.|$|E
5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} highlighted systemic racial {{inequality in}} the Navy. A {{year before the}} disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service but not one black officer. In the months following the disaster, the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring <b>the</b> <b>tense</b> race relations {{in the armed forces}} at the time.|$|E
5|$|The verbal prefix {{contains}} {{information about}} the person and number of the subject, sometimes also the person and number of the object, as well as obligatory information about <b>the</b> <b>tense</b> of the clause. Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While {{only a small number}} of tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E

5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible. They are often monosyllabic verb roots and all are vowel-final. Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for <b>the</b> <b>tense</b> and aspect of the clause. A small set of verbs may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or tense. That non-finite verb must then co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A {{year after the}} war ended, Hindman's brother, Robert, engaged {{in a fight with}} William Falkner because he thought that Falkner had tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the Sons of Temperance. Robert Hindman tried to defend himself, but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury which ruled that he was acting in self-defense. Afterward, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial. Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. <b>The</b> <b>tense</b> relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the Memphis, Tennessee Appeal.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). <b>The</b> <b>tense</b> or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E

40|$|Tenses bold an {{important}} part in teaching and learning English. When someone is using <b>the</b> wrong <b>tenses,</b> <b>the</b> other will have misinterpretation. Since <b>tenses,</b> in <b>the</b> reality, are boring and difficult, the teachers must be able to vary the teaching technique in order to help the students master <b>the</b> <b>tenses</b> very well among other by using games and songs. To help the students improve their mastery in English, especially <b>the</b> <b>tenses,</b> some of them join an English course. By joining the course, They hope that they can master the English better then we they get the English subject at school, because they only have limited time for this subject at school. In this thesis, the writer did some observation in "JOY" English course. (She did the observation for one month (5 meetings), but she found <b>tenses</b> as <b>the</b> subject only in the first three meetings). From the observations, the writer found that games and songs are very helpful for the teacher to teach <b>the</b> <b>tenses</b> without <b>the</b> students feeling pressured to learn <b>the</b> <b>tenses.</b> From <b>the</b> three meetings that had tenses, there were only two meetings that used one game and song. When the teacher did not give the students song or games they could hardly understand <b>the</b> <b>tenses.</b> They asked <b>the</b> teacher to repeat the explanations and often made mistakes in using <b>the</b> <b>tenses.</b> Since <b>the</b> writer did not observe the student’ tests results in teaching <b>tenses,</b> <b>the</b> writer hopes that someone will make a study on the students' tests results, particularly <b>the</b> tests for <b>tenses</b> to discover <b>the</b> effectiveness of games and songs...|$|R

5|$|Europe {{had been}} by then embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After {{five years of}} war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798 but this too was {{defeated}} by 1801. Britain remained the only opponent for the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For {{the first time in}} ten years, all of Europe was at peace. There were many problems between the two sides and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge. Britain resented having to turn over all colonial conquests since 1793 and France was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta. <b>The</b> <b>tense</b> situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush the Haitian Revolution.

5|$|George VI's {{coronation}} at Westminster Abbey {{took place}} on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation.

There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in <b>the</b> <b>tense</b> period before the Second World War.

5|$|Historically this {{is nothing}} new, as <b>the</b> <b>tense</b> {{relations}} between Armenia and Azerbaijan because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting {{in the absence of}} players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012 was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to Kazan, with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan. More recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor, and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship 2014 in Yerevan. Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 Chess World Cup in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.|$|E

Richard immediately began to re-establish order in London and rescinded his previous grants to the rebels. The revolt had also spread into East Anglia, where the University of Cambridge was attacked and many royal officials were killed. Unrest continued until the intervention of Henry le Despenser, who defeated a rebel army at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June. Troubles extended north to York, Beverley and Scarborough, and as far west as Bridgwater in Somerset. Richard mobilised 4,000 soldiers to restore order. Most of the rebel leaders were tracked down and executed; by November, at least 1,500 rebels had been killed.|$|E
5|$|General Nguyễn Khánh {{had come}} to power in January 1964 after {{surprising}} the ruling junta of General Dương Văn Minh in a bloodless coup. However, due to American pressure, he kept the popular Minh as a token head of state, while concentrating real power in his hands by controlling the Military Revolutionary Council. In August, the Vietnam War continued to escalate following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, a disputed encounter between communist and American naval vessels off the North Vietnamese coast; Washington accused North Vietnam of attacking their ships in international waters. Khánh saw <b>the</b> <b>tense</b> situation {{as an opportunity to}} increase his authority. On August 7, he declared a state of emergency, increased police powers, banned protests, tightened censorship and allowed the police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. He drafted a new constitution, which would have augmented his personal power {{at the expense of the}} already-limited Minh. However, these moves only served to weaken Khánh as large demonstrations and riots broke out in the cities, with majority Buddhists prominent, calling for an end to the state of emergency and the abandonment of the new constitution, as well as a progression back to civilian rule.|$|E
