5|$|The {{decision}} to use English-speaking actors was made early. Since the film would be very visual, the director wanted audiences {{to be able to}} focus on <b>the</b> <b>images,</b> <b>and</b> not have to rely on subtitles. He later expressed his approval of the use of dubbed voice tracks in non-English speaking countries.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E

5|$|At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True {{was hired}} to handle the design and {{decoration}} of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region. Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist. With {{the assistance of the}} National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics. <b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals— lizards, serpents, birds— and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas. In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.|$|E
5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> improve the images' quality. The result suggested not only that the faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E

The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> {{media reports}} of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{is divided}} into two-halves with the first {{describing}} Joan's quest to meet Charles, the Dauphin of France. Eventually, she is capable of gaining the Dauphin's support and begins to lead the French military. The secondary half describes the French defeat of the British army at Orléans. After many victories, the poem ends with Charles crowned King of France. Joan of Arc serves {{as a way for}} Southey to express his views on history and on politics; these include his republican ideals, his claims that political tyranny was a common element in Europe, and his opposition to Christian practices that he thought were superstitious. Later editions of the poem shifted from a promotion of a deistic view of religion to a more traditional view. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the quality of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> themes of the poem. However, others believed that the poem lacked merit and some believed that the subject matter was inappropriate to the time. Many critics felt that Southey rushed in composing the work and did not devote enough time to it.|$|E

5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} cornerstone of contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with hip hop beats, while <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the cornerstone of the neo soul genre.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E
5|$|Tokyopop's {{localized}} volumes {{appeared on}} ICv2's monthly top one-hundred selling graphic novels. The Rozen Maiden manga has received generally positive reviews. Anime News Network praised Peach-Pit's works as always {{being able to}} evoke excitement or laughter from its readers but was critical about Rozen Maidens lack of plot and criticized how the dialogue or layout can be vague. Comic Book Bin wrote that while Rozen Maiden was not a splendid manga, its emphasis on psychology and emotion was something American comics should follow to expand their readership. Active Anime praised several aspects of the series: the combination of mystery, comedy, and cuteness with a balance of fantasy and drama; the visual esthetics of <b>the</b> <b>images</b> <b>and</b> characters; and a broadness that extends towards teens and adults. Initially, Anime Land praised the balance between comedic daily life and the underlying {{dark side of the}} plot. In later volumes though, Anime Land criticized the story's pacing and the abrupt ending. In their review of the sequel, Anime Land wrote they were surprised by the dark tone and how the plot was confusing even with knowledge from the first series. Manga-News also praised the story's alteration between moments of peace and conflict but panned the latter volumes for being rushed and losing the story's complexity. In their review of the sequel, Manga-News praised the introduction for being interesting and accessible to new readers.|$|E

40|$|In image {{deconvolution}} or restoration using Kalman filter, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>and</b> blur {{models are}} required to be known for the restoration process. Generally, {{the accuracy of the}} restoration depends on the accuracy of the given models. Unfortunately, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>and</b> blur models are normally unknown in practice. To solve the problem, an identification stage is employed to estimate <b>the</b> <b>image</b> <b>and</b> blur models. However, the estimated models are seldom accurate especially with the presence of noise in <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> This paper presents a robust Kalman filter design for image deconvolution that can accommodate the inaccuracy in <b>the</b> estimated <b>image</b> <b>and</b> blur models. If the inaccuracy can be modelled as addictive white Gaussian noise with a known variance, it can be stochastically account for in the robust filter design. In the simulation tests performed, the robust design achieved improved accuracy in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> restoration even though inaccurate <b>image</b> <b>and</b> blur models were used...|$|R
