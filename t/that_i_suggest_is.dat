They seemed to be country-lasses, of sturdy and {{wholesome}} aspect, with coarse-grained, cabbage-rosy cheeks, and, I am willing to suppose, a stout texture of moral principle, such as would bear {{a good deal of}} rough usage without suffering much detriment. But how unlike the trim little damsels of my native land! I desire above all things to be courteous; but, since the plain truth must be told, the soil and climate of England produce feminine beauty as rarely as they do delicate fruit, and though admirable specimens of both are to be met with, they are the hot-house ameliorations of refined society, and apt, moreover, to relapse into the coarseness of the original stock. The men are manlike, but the women are not beautiful, though the female Bull be well enough adapted to the male. To return to the lasses of Greenwich Fair, their charms were few, and their behavior, perhaps, not altogether commendable; and yet it was impossible not to feel a degree of faith in their innocent intentions, with such a half-bashful zest and entire simplicity did they keep up their part of the game. It put the spectator in good-humor to look at them, because there was still something of the old Arcadian life, the secure freedom of the antique age, in their way of surrendering their lips to strangers, as if there were no evil or impurity in the world. As for the young men, they were chiefly specimens of the vulgar sediment of London life, often shabbily genteel, rowdyish, pale, wearing the unbrushed coat, unshifted linen, and unwashed faces of yesterday, as well as the haggardness of last night's jollity in a gin-shop. Gathering their character from these tokens, I wondered whether there were any reasonable prospect of their fair partners returning to their rustic homes with as much innocence (whatever were its amount or quality) as they brought, to Greenwich Fair, in spite of the perilous familiarity established by Kissing in the Ring.|$|E

40|$|Borrowing {{from recent}} work on {{political}} ontology, this thesis explores three {{different versions of}} "storytelling coloniality": an autobiography by fourteen Mapuche scholars that enacts a politics of knowledge through the production of their own book; an experimental ethnography that approaches knowledge through the notions of colonialism and decolonization that emerge from the ritual practices of Aymara Shamans and Apprentices in the Bolivian highlands; and a science fiction novel, set roughly in the year 2070, which enacts an "oral history of the future" organized around the logic of Andean thought. Produced and circulated within local and international academic audiences, these stories make visible contemporary legacies of colonialism, explore spaces in which alternative social worlds emerge and thrive, and problematize how alterity is envisaged, enacted, articulated, and aggregated {{within the context of}} contemporary global processes and power relations. As a state-led project of change, decolonization in Bolivia {{can be seen as the}} most recent process of liberal governance that seeks to manage forms of radical alterity.

I rely on Confucianism, modern virtue ethics, and psychological research to outline four features <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>are</b> necessary for an adequate conception of ethics.

The inclusion of Baradian ontology into our everyday ethical understanding is a continuous process that consists in completely reorienting our perception of the world.

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} Euskadi ta Auskatasuna (ETA), a {{terrorist}} group in País Vasco, Spain and attempts to determine the causes behind ETA’s violence. I focus on three areas of study: the political situation of País Vasco, the public opinion, and the economic situation of País Vasco. Data is collected from the Basque government, the EuskoBarómetro, and World Bank, and showed in correlation with ETA attacks to discern patterns. Due to limited data, my area of study focuses mainly on ETA’s later years, when they were less active. This allows me {{to focus on the}} periods of the ceasefires in contrast to active years, to determine if one factor played more of a role in violence than the others. While the Basque case is unique in Spain, it has similarities to other cases of ethnic violence. As such, if the cause of Basque violence and their motivations towards reaching a ceasefire can be discovered, they may be implemented in other cases of ethnic violence, such as that of the Kurds in Iraq and Turkey. Through my research, I concluded that neither nationalist representation in the Basque Parliament or public opinion correlates with ETA attacks; however, increased economic prosperity led to decreased violence. While I found that political representation and public opinion were not consequential, it is possible that they played a small role which I was not able to discern through my research. As such, my research is inconclusive and I suggestive further study into looking into the causes of Basque violence and its demise. One such area for further study <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>is</b> the internal structure of the group and how increased action from the state, including imprisoning leaders, may have led to the downfall of the group...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s {{representation of}} the north of England in his second tetralogy of history plays. In this study, I argue that the plays are not only a {{representation of the}} past, but an expression of the political, cultural and geographical divisions within England in the era of their production. Drawing on contemporary reports from the region, official papers, ballads and various modern histories of the age, I will suggest that there exists a direct correlation between Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s representation of the region and the concept of the north as the alien element within Elizabethan England. Reading the plays as explorations of the development of England from feudalism to a centralised nation state, I discuss the manner in which Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s second tetralogy exposes the contradictions behind the concept of a united and stable England. Central to my argument is the notion that to be marginalised (in the latter decades of the sixteenth century) was not only a matter of social status or political expediency but was, to a degree, dependent on being identified as belonging to, and existing within, the geographical margins of the state. The four central chapters, comprising Richard II, both parts of Henry IV and Henry v, examine {{the manner in which the}} north, and those associated with it, are increasingly presented as a disruptive element that threatens the stability of the realm, a role <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>is</b> reliant on both historical experience and contemporary expectation.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{semantic}} account of belief ascriptions of the form 'A believes that S'. It begins with a detailed discussion of Saul Kripke's famous 'Puzzle about Belief, and tries to unearth a fundamental but rarely explicitly articulated assumption that gives {{the steps of the}} derivation of Kripke's Puzzle their intuitive plausibility. The assumption can be roughly stated as follows: belief ascriptions report on some single ontologically prior mental state which grounds the truth of a true ascription. A response to one form of Kripke's Puzzle is suggested {{at the end of this}} discussion. Several apparently diverse kinds of response to Kripke's Puzzle are critically evaluated and are found to be unsatisfactory. Many of the problems with these responses are traced to the fact that they are built upon the assumption <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>is</b> at the heart of Kripke's Puzzle. The beginnings of a positive account of the semantics of belief ascriptions are given. The account gives a central role to the fact that the truth-value of a belief ascription depends on elements of the conversational setting in which it occurs. It is suggested that belief ascriptions are essentially answers to questions asked by an audience who has specific interests and makes specific assumptions about the agent and the setting of the ascription. The interests of the audience and the background assumptions that she makes are two- distinct sources of the context-sensitivity of belief ascriptions. The account makes no appeal to any kind of inner mental representations, but instead says that the truth of an ascription depends in a complex way on the agent's dispositions and capacities to do, say, think, and feel certain things. The thesis ends with a discussion of the de dicto/ de re distinction, and suggests that the distinction does not provide the most useful way of understanding belief ascription. It is argued that truly de re ascriptions are probably very rare, and that this does not therefore mean that most ascriptions are de dicto...|$|E

40|$|Intellectual {{development}}, {{the development}} of the intellect, is the emergence of increasingly sophisticated forms or levels of cognition, the progress of understanding, reasoning, and rationality. We can describe the outcomes of intellectual development by specifying steps, stages, or levels of development for cognition as a whole and/or for various cognitive domains. Fundamentally, however, intellectual development is an ongoing process of reflection, coordination, and social interaction that begins in early childhood and continues, at least in some cases, long into adulthood. Liberal education, however defined, includes the promotion of intellectual development as a primary goal. There may be specific facts, skills, and values we want students to learn in specific courses and contexts, but above all we want to foster intellectual progress. To encourage intellectual progress, we must promote reflection, coordination, and social interaction, the basic processes of development.

40|$|Society is {{continually}} changing, {{as are the}} cities that we live in. The urban structure is not a fixed entity, but a dynamic and evolving one, needing new and different ways of thinking and planning. A city’s public space does not escape these needs and {{it is necessary to}} recognise that the provision of public space could be approached in innovative ways, through experimentation, more flexible planning controls and questioning traditional values as well as learning from them. This thesis is about exploring alternative approaches to public space in urban environments. Public space is a concept that carries preconceived connotations made up of certain typologies. This thesis aims to introduce new typologies into the discourse, through a proposal for public space in Gamla Staden, Malmö. While there is a current trend for this to be done through ‘loose space’ or ‘terrain vague,’ this thesis approaches this issue from the controversial standpoint of using the inner courtyards in the most significant part of the city as the subject for a new type of public space. The traditional dichotomy of public and private space is broken down through {{the creation of a new}} kind of public space, which collapses the boundaries between them and provides an alternative public space in the city. This new public space can be conceived of as exposing a new ‘parochial realm’ in the city, where a familiar public life is focused on, rather than the anonymous public life in the conventional spaces of the public realm. This proposal demonstrates how these courtyards and passageways could be transformed to become incorporated into the structure of public space in the city. The design aims to provide a meeting place for residents, workers and visitors. The proposal seeks to improve the parochial realm of Gamla Staden through making intimate places for people to mingle and interact. The proposal is informed by an investigation of what it is that encourages people to integrate in a community. The amalgamation of all the components of this thesis results in a concept for Gamla Staden’s Urban Rooms, hidden in the secret gardens of the courtyard spaces. The proposal <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>is</b> not intended to be ‘an answer’ to the plan for public space in Gamla Staden, but rather, aims to initiate a discussion on the consequences, both positive and negative of the potentials of making the courtyards accessible to the public.

40|$|The {{question}} I address is: {{how might}} {{a theology of}} authority be conceived {{in the light of}} questions raised by what is termed 'post-modernity'? Is it possible to articulate a theology of authority coming to the church community 'from God' that avoids an oppressive and alienating heteronomy? The thesis explores the question of authority as of vital importance in the sociological dimension of religion, calling for legitimisation (in light of claims made for itself) and as obligatory in the theological sphere. For this reason the project involves two methodologies (theological and sociological/ethnographic). While this investigation is relevant to all sections of the Christian church, particular attention is paid to Baptist churches in the UK, since they hold a concept in their tradition <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>is</b> valuable in answering the question of the thesis, namely that of covenant. Within the Christian tradition there is an inner 'problematic' relating the personal authority of Christ to the forms of institution (church) and text (scripture). I explore this with a brief survey of theological authority as found in the fourfold foundation of scripture, tradition, reason and experience. From this is developed a brief theological and Christological reflection on divine authority and covenant theology as found in Karl Barth and his response to the 'inner problematic'. Within contemporary culture I view authority through the lens of so-called 'postmodernism', identifying four challenges to the notion of 'external authority' (all of which exemplify a move from the external to internal, and objective to subjective approaches to authority). This is further explored by means of qualitative research with one-to-one interviews conducted in a Baptist church in York. This data is reflected upon by means of ethnography and 'judicious narratives', especially in dialogue with material from Guest ('congregational study'), Heelas and Woodhead ('subjectivised-self') and Healy ('theodramatic horizon' and 'practical-prophetic ecclesiology'), providing an intersection between the language of theology and sociology. The concept of church as covenant community is explored in Baptist and (more briefly) Anglican traditions, leading to a constructive proposal that both the inner-church 'problematic' and the 'postmodern' challenge to authority might begin to be resolved with the notion of covenant. It is within this context of relationship, human and divine, that the authoritative and revelatory Word of God, the story that is Christ, is found in community and praxis. Here is a 'triangulating' relationship between authority, story and covenant revealing divine authority in a non-coercive way and relevant to contemporary culture.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} value in judicial ethics is impartiality. This {{means that a}} judge is duty-bound to decide cases on their merits, be open to persuasion, and not influenced by improper considerations. The paradigm case of unethical behavior by a judge is taking a bribe to decide a case in favor {{of one of the}} parties. This kind of corruption, which is fortunately rare in many developed countries, is also relatively uninteresting from an intellectual point of view. A more difficult case of failure of impartiality, conceptually speaking, involves a judge who relies on extra-legal factors as the basis for a judicial decision. Making sense of judicial ethics therefore requires a distinction between factors a judge may take into account when rendering a decision, and those which are excluded from consideration. In American legal discourse, this distinction is often stated in terms of law vs. politics, where politics is used to mean any normative view that is not incorporated into the law. In contrast with legal decisions made by actors within the executive branch of government, in which policy and ideological factors may play a role, judicial decisions are supposed to be justified {{solely on the basis of}} legal reasons. The general theme of this paper is that the role of the judge, and the subject of judicial ethics, cannot be discussed in the abstract; the analysis must have a foundation in some view about the nature of law. Talking about legal reasons and criticizing judges for relying on non-legal reasons presupposes a tenable distinction between the legal and non-legal domains. This, of course, is one of the principal points of contention between legal positivists and their critics. On the other hand, if some kind of moral or political argument is required to differentiate between law and non-law, it is not simply an empirical matter to draw a boundary separating inside from outside. The distinction between law and non-law would be evaluative and contestable, and would make reference to the very sorts of political, ideological, and policy reasons that may or may not be part of the law. The claim that the possibility of a value-free distinction between law and non-law is untenable is at the heart of Ronald Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s theory of law. More specifically, the paper will discuss two aspects of the law-politics distinction. First, principles of judicial impartiality must take a position on the existence of judicial discretion and the problem of legal interpretation. The second area of discussion is the justification for certain restrictions imposed on judges by positive law (rules of judicial conduct, statutes, and court rules) often misleadingly referred to as rules of judicial ethics. At least in the United States, many of these restrictions purport to regulate bias and the risk that judges will not be impartial. Courts applying the rules governing judicial conduct often regulate prophylactically, by disqualifying judges from presiding over certain types of cases, based on conduct that is taken to be evidence of bias. However, the discussion of the Hart/Dworkin debate shows that the political viewpoints of judges may necessarily influence the outcomes of cases. In Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s view, judging is inherently a political practice, because ascertaining the content of law is impossible without resort to normative political argument. In Hart 2 ̆ 7 s view, by contrast, it is possible to ascertain the content of law empirically, but there may be a further normative question about the best way to prioritize or balance competing legal considerations. I believe the right approach to judicial ethics is to focus on the application side of the distinction between the content of law (which may or may not be susceptible of determination on the basis of social facts) and standards for its application. Where there are multiple plausible interpretations of existing cases, statutes, and other applicable legal norms, all we can reasonably expect is that a judge deliberate in good faith and reach the conclusion she believes represents the best reading of the governing law. The subject of judicial ethics is essentially an attempt to flesh out the idea of judging in good faith. <b>That,</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally about being prepared to give reasons in justification of a judicial decision...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{gap between}} rich and poor and the {{degradation}} of the planet are among the systemically generated outcomes increasingly associated with contemporary capitalism. This association is made by scholarly, professional and technical experts and spiritual leaders from across the political spectrum. Among them are Joseph Stiglitz, Vandana Shiva, Bill McKibben and Pope Francis. The negative social impact associated with the privileging of capitalist interests manifest in a globalising corporate logic during the 1990 s, was critically documented by Jane Kelsey (1999). In the ongoing pursuit of the neo-liberal agenda globally, Kelsey (2013) argues that significant decisions are often made behind closed doors with little chance of democratic influence, particularly by those who may come to suffer from their ramifications. Popular uprisings, such as the Occupy Wall Street Movement, attest to the widespread concern of many. Activist scholar, Slavoj Žižek (2012) urges the embedding of the occupiers’ concerns beyond the visible spectacle of the movement. He urges wider commitment to the transformation of the issues of their concern in the very fabric of daily life. My work presented in this thesis is one attempt to contribute to this call. Through my investigation into the apparent impact of corporate capitalism, I have come to notice ever more acutely, as encouraged by Seo and Creed (2002), the value contradictions within the institutional logics that support capitalism and the logics of other significant institutions that I allow influence on my life. My research drew me towards concurrence with the views of critical organisational theorists such as Deetz (1992) and Dyer, Humphries, Fitzgibbons and Hurd (2014). These theorists provide the proposition that the contemporary form of globalisation is orchestrated through the normalised workings and values of global corporations that spread a competitive ordering, selectively atomise individuals and pit one against the other. I call this the ‘dominant order(ing) of daily lives’ that draws the privileged and the oppressed into a way of being that sustains privilege and oppression while espousing values of justice. My research contributes to the body of knowledge concerned with how a sense of responsibility and transformative agency may be developed amongst privileged peoples. It is in the projects of community gardening and my life that I have chosen to ‘notice’ the prevalence of a mechanistic, functionalist world view that infuses the moral limitations of dominant order. I have been attentive to noticing how this order influences the [un]ethical decisions of daily life. I suggest that increasing the awareness of the privileged to the working of dominant order and to the interconnectedness of life is important to our ability to ‘notice’ institutional contradictions and thus the possibilities of our transformation. My attention to ‘noticing’ has heightened my discomfort with the current institutional arrangements and prompted me to reflect, talk with others, try new things and seek a more attentive way of being. My research endorses the suggestion made by Dyer et al. (2014) that conscientising the privileged to the workings of dominant order, and the ways we are implicated in the maintenance of this ordering, is important work for educators to pursue. Through my research I have identified ideas that may mitigate against concerning assumptions amongst the privileged that ‘community gardening’ and the projects of local food are ‘naturally virtuous’ including: listening to the stories of the oppressed, knowing who we are in the context of these stories, holding our own discomfort and questioning how we may be responsible. As an outcome of my research, I posit that the reprioritisation and valuing of interconnection and ‘concern for others’ in the day to day lives of the privileged may be achieved through the development of relational identities, storytelling that highlights interconnection and spiritual ritual. Community gardening can draw the privileged into being with the oppressed; enabling an understanding of shared and common humanity <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>is</b> motivating of reflection and the construction of new social interactions. My investigations drew me more deeply into the insights and commitments of people of an indigenous, Earth-centred, life-affirming spiritual tradition who are among those who articulate an interconnected worldview and ways of being human. My research highlights that when commitment is given to a relationship with people of these traditions, those who are largely (but never wholly) colonised to the dominant order may ‘notice’ and rediscover the possibilities of interconnected ways of seeing and being human. Listening to the holders of life-affirming traditions can enable ‘noticing’ of, and resistance to, the dominating ideas of capitalist projections that are mechanistic and competitive in form. In the context of Aotearoa New Zealand, my research suggests that bicultural relationship may be developed by Pākehā through listening to Te Ao Māori authority and engaging in practical actions that support related Māori aspirations. This relationship may interrupt the potential dominance of Pākehā ways of being. My first person action research has involved reflection, ‘noticing’, conversation and action in dynamic interplay. I have recorded this dynamic interplay and discerned together with others, through ongoing co-inquiry relationship and dialogue, the transformative possibilities of ‘noticing’ the ways that we, as people who would like to be considered ‘just’, are human. I have woven a narrative, presented in this report that is compelling to me, to my co-inquirers and to others. I have assessed the value of my inquiry by the way it stirs thinking, reflection and transformative action in those who engage with it. ‘Noticing’ dominant order and the unconscious stream of oppressive action in the day to day life of the privileged is difficult and challenging work. This work may generate conflict and discomfort for the researcher and the people connected with and through the research. I posit that such discomfort is important to reflection and to developing a form of sensitivity that draws ethical attention to the systemic causes of such degradation that sustains the privilege of many. The potential challenging of privilege that ‘noticing’ promotes requires a relational dynamic that is open, non-competitive, non-oppositional and potentially inconclusive. Including this Socratic dynamic in research methods, and in ‘noticing’, is important for researchers whose ability to shed light on the challenging terrain of social change requires relationships of openness and dialogue. When grounded in a critique of dominant order, ‘noticing’ disturbs otherwise inoculated, rationalised and normalised privileges. Just as the disturbance of soil is necessary for the settling of a new seed, so too is the disturbance of our minds necessary for our awakening and the growth of our ‘noticing’ and an interconnected worldview. ‘Noticing’ enables the privileged to identify ways of being human that reprioritise the diminished valuing of interdependency...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic study of endemic hunger {{in the city}} of Trairi, in the Northeastern state of Ceara. Brazil. It explores the lunch time meal (almoço) as a {{socio-cultural}} construct and proposes it as a useful tool for the investigation and comprehension of the daily experiences that take place when one is hungry. The extensive descriptions and the narratives of women and men of Trairi complement one another as we come to discover two slightly different discourses of hunger that emphasize the occurrence of a paradox that plays either on the presence or on the absence of a socio-cultural problem of hunger. Several conclusions emerge from the arguments at the basis of this thesis: endemic hunger is understood as meaning malnutrition and undernutrition; the Trairiense know poverty which governs their socio-cultural eating patterns; the almoço is the principal meal of the day and is an excellent milieu from which to scrutinize the ideologies rooted within everyday eating practices; and lastly, people have developed different ways of acting and of speaking about food in such a manner that they are able to endure their condition. These findings come together and work simultaneously to silence the state of endemic hunger in Trairi: it is not a silence that relies on intimidation or on enforcement; it is a silence that is culturally shared and ingrained in social codes <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>are</b> being reproduced in the daily performance of the almoç...|$|R

40|$|Drum 'n' bass {{music has}} {{received}} some attention from academics but {{the contributions of}} MCs who perform onstage alongside DJs in live events and broadcasts needs further consideration. In response, and using MC lyrics, secondary interviews and Tweets, this article is a "critical celebration" of what MCs bring to British drum 'n' bass. The critique concerns the content of what MCs say, some of which I argue undermines the cultural and economic potential of the music. The celebration explores what MCs bring to drum 'n' bass, particularly practices <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> should <b>be</b> viewed as community services. <b>I</b> therefore argue <b>that</b> MCs are community workers, providing, leading, building and networking in ways that help generate solidarity, reciprocity, and alliances within and across an overlapping and diverse world of drum 'n' bass. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I trace {{our modern}} conceptions of {{anorexia}} and sexuality to the Victorian Era, and discuss {{how they have}} grown into the modern phenomenon we know today. Next I provide a conceptual background for the medicalization of mental disorders and locate the origin of our modern conception of health.

I then consider data concerning eating disorders primarily among gay and bisexual men as they compare with each other and their female counterparts. With this data in mind, I am able to rule out many competing claims as to the cause of anorexia by looking at the different outcomes between men and women as well as between gay, bisexual and heterosexual men.

It begins by drawing a cross-historical comparison between Managua 19 s metropolitan makeover and a paradigmatic case of planned urban change, that of 19 th-century Parisian Haussmannization, in order to highlight the systemic and purposeful nature of the former 19 s transformation from a top-down perspective. It then focuses ethnographically on the grassroots consequences of specific instances of infrastructural development that have affected two poor neighbourhoods in the city, providing a bottom-up view on the way that these have constituted the poor communities as 18 pacified spaces 19, to the extent that their inhabitants can be said to have internalized a form of 18 abject urbanism 19 that actively contributes to sustaining the unequal spatial order of the city. When seen from this perspective, the planned urban transformation of Managua emerges as a systemic form of violence mediated by the workings of infrastructure, a process <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> can <b>be</b> termed 18 infrastructural violence 19...|$|R

The "Declaration of a Global Ethic" that was approved by 250 religious leaders at the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago on 4 September 1993 (Kung and Kuschel 1993) represents a goal that all peoples and all religions must resolutely move toward if they are to exercise "global responsibility" in resolving the crises that face our planet as it enters the twenty-first century. (For a careful but sobering description and analysis of these multiple crises, see Kennedy [1993].) The critical remarks that follow are meant, in the fullest sense, to be a positive criticism [...] a support that will enable Kung, Swidler, and all of us to achieve this necessary goal of a global ethic that will ground a global responsibility. <b>I</b> fear <b>that,</b> unless the warnings and directions <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>are</b> taken to heart, the path that Kung and Swidler are walking can either turn into a dead-end or, contrary to their intentions, lead to an end they are trying to avoid. In order to achieve a global ethic, Kung and Swidler propose an open-ended, pluralistic dialogue among all the religions and ideologies of the world. They endorse a genuinely pluralistic approach to elaborating this ethic. While <b>I</b> certainly agree <b>that</b> such pluralistic dialogue is indispensable for the formulation and acceptance of a global ethic, I want to add that indispensable to the success of such a dialogue is a clear recognition that this kind of pluralistic dialogue is as dangerous as it is necessary. To succeed in their proposal, Kung and Swidler must be aware of these dangers. <b>I</b> fear <b>that</b> they are not...|$|R

A system of copyright protection makes little sense unless it is designed to encourage the use and enjoyment of the works it induces authors to create and publishers to disseminate. <b>I</b> argue <b>that</b> a clear-eyed examination of copyright's history reveals that solicitude for readers and members of the audience is, in fact, deeply encoded in copyright's DNA. Recently, readers' interests have faded in apparent importance in the copyright scheme in ways that have unbalanced the copyright system, and undermined public support for copyright law. In response to growing criticism of copyright, some of copyright law's most ardent supporters have insisted that users have no rights, should have no rights, and have never had rights in the copyright scheme. <b>That</b> approach, <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>is</b> making the problem worse, not better. Copyright seems out of whack because it has forgotten its most important constituents.
